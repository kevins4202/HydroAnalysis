2120,geothermal resources regarded as sustainable green energy are attracting increasing attention the southern tibetan plateau possesses the most abundant intermediate high geothermal resources in china and has enormous potential for geothermal exploration geothermal waters from the yadong gulu rift ygr which is considered as the most active geothermal belt of the plateau are studied based on hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics to understand the spatial variations of fluid origin evolution and circulation mechanism as well as heat sources the hydrochemical characteristics of cold springs and surface waters are consistently characterized by ca hco3 dominated ca hco3 and ca hco3 so4 waters while those of geothermal springs present extensive variability with na cl dominated na cl hco3 na hco3 cl na ca cl hco3 and na hco3 waters the main geochemical processes controlling the geothermal springs are combinations of silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and cation exchange the characteristics of trace alkali metals and b indicate they undergone common similar deep process and the potential input of magmatic degassing the δd and δ18o values suggest that cold springs and surface waters are recharged by meteoric water and geothermal springs are replenished by meteoric water snow melt and magmatic fluid the mass balance model reveal that dominant carbon sources for geothermal waters can be deeply derived co2 i e magmatic source and metamorphic source contributing from 77 to 99 based on empirical chemical geothermometers si enthalpy mixing model and

geothermal sources has enormous potential for geothermal exploration and exploitation kong et al 2014 zhang et al 2019b the direct utilization of low temperature 125 c geothermal systems in china has been highly developed whereas electricity generation by intermediate high temperature 125 c geothermal systems is still in the initial stage bertani 2016 lund and toth 2021 jolie et al 2021 the tibetan plateau an important part of the mediterranean himalayan geothermal belt possesses the most abundant intermediate high temperature geothermal resources in china guo 2012 guo et al 2019 under persistent india asia continental collision the tibetan plateau has been strongly uplifted and resulted in a series of approximately n s trending extensional rifts cogan et al 1998 yin and harrison 2000 chung et al 2005 the intermediate high temperature geothermal systems of the tibetan plateau principally distribute along the indus yarlung tsangpo suture and extend in n s direction strictly controlled by a system of near n s trending normal faults and grabens hou et al 2001 wang et al 2021 at present 129 geothermal systems with reservoir temperatures higher than 150 c and 12 geothermal systems higher than 200 c have been found in tibet liao and zhao 1999 however the power generation potential of most geothermal resources has not been evaluated completely economical intermediate high temperature geothermal systems are commonly due to high geothermal gradients and or magma chambers at various depths among which shallow magmatic heat source has the most effective power generation potential guo et al 2009 jolie et al 2021 during the 1990s the project indepth conducted multiple geophysical surveys in the yadong gulu rift ygr the longest rift system of the tibetan plateau and one of the most representative n s trending rifts geophysical data revealed the existence of partial melting granitic magmas at 15 20 km depth to the north of the ygr north of the indus yarlung tsangpo

2005 xie et al 2021 it is notable that geothermal surface manifestations are accordance with the underlying partial melt zone along the ygr wei et al 2001 fluid geochemistry can provide significant

high temperature geothermal system in china the installed capacity has reached 26 18 mw and remains active due to the severe energy shortage in tibet zhang et al 2019b however it is not clear whether various geothermal manifestations along the ygr have consistent heat sources and genetic mechanisms the major objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the controlling processes of the major solutes and typical trace elements based on the hydrochemical characteristics and geological conditions 2 determine the recharge sources and carbon sources based on the isotopic characteristics 3

geothermal wells cold springs and surface waters are presented in table 1 and table 2 respectively additional data from previous studies tong et al 2000 guo et al 2007 2009 2010 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018a are included for comparison 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics hydrochemical characteristics of the geothermal springs show extensive variability along the ygr while that for cold springs and surface waters are relatively uniform the geothermal springs had outled temperatures between 29 and 88 c tds values from 737 fresh water to 4180 mg l brackish saline water and the ph from 6 1 to 9 1 slightly acidic to alkaline for cold springs and surface waters the temperatures were in the range of 4 3 18 c the tds values were 48 694 mg l fresh water with similar chemical compositions and the ph was from 6 4 to 8 4 neutral to slightly alkaline the concentrations of the main anions and cations in the geothermal springs were higher than that of the cold springs and surface waters the anion

elements diagnostic trace elements represented by li rb cs b and f are regarded as a typical geothermal suite li et al 2021 yi et al 2021 the concentrations of li rb cs and b in the cold springs and surface waters ranged from 5 6 to 641 μg l 0 01 to 25 μg l 1 92 to 300 μg l and 65 to 800 μg l respectively table 2 and those from geothermal springs discharged at a broad range 0 6 28 mg l 0 11 5 2

dic values of the geothermal springs range from 4 68 to 0 24 with an average of 2 40 4 4 spatial variations of geochemistry the hydrochemical facies of geothermal springs geothermal well cold springs and surface waters are visualized in the piper diagram fig 2 piper 1944 the hydrochemical facies of cold springs and surface waters in the ygr are ca hco3 and ca hco3 so4 whereas those of geothermal waters are more vailable na cl na cl hco3 na hco3 cl na hco3 na ca hco3 cl and na ca cl hco3 based on the geographical location hydrochemical types and trace elements the geothermal springs can be distinguished as three groups fig 3 group 1 na cl dominated waters this group includes na cl hco3 na hco3 cl types found in the gl nz ybj and yy geothermal fields of the northern segment group 2 na hco3 dominated waters this group includes na hco3 type related to the yl and grq geothermal fields of the northern segment group 3 na cl dominated waters this group includes na ca cl hco3 na cl hco3 and na hco3 cl types in the jz and km geothermal fields of the southern segment 5 discussion 5 1 processes controlling major solute the common solutes of the deep reservoir fluids can be conveniently classified into two groups a conservative components e g cl which display conservative behavior of water rock interaction and b reactive components e g na k ca2 mg2 which are controlled by the temperature dependent water rock interactions nicholson 1993 arnorsson 2000 therefore molar or equivalent ratios of major solutes have been widely applied to provide insight into the governing geochemical processes e g yang et al 2019 wu et al 2021 lee et al 2021 the hydro geological setting of the study region is complex being characterized by volcanic metamorphic and sedimentary environments the dominant anion of geothermal waters shows a geographical variation in cl and hco3 while the dominant cation is distinctly na fig 2 the concentration of na in geothermal springs are well correlated with cl r 0 90 with the enrichment of cl up to 40 meq l suggesting the potential influence of geothermal fluids or halite dissolution the deviation of na cl molar ratio from the 1 1 line fig 4 a the undersaturated of halite table 5 and the rarely distribution of evaporite unit manifesting that halite dissolution eq 1 are not the dominated source of na and cl fontes and matray 1993 yang et al 2019 given that the widely distributed of the granite gangdese granite and leucogranite and volcanic rocks the enrichment of na in the geothermal springs are possible deriving by the leaching of silicate minerals e g incongruent dissolution of albite eq 2 which can additionally increase the alkalinity the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 diagram fig 4b shows that all the geothermal springs locate above the 1 1 line which support the hypothesis of the occurrence of silicate weathering e g negri et al 2018 fan et al 2019 yang et al 2019 to define the dissolution of silicate minerals the thermodynamic activity plots are applied in the na2o al2o3 sio2 h2o and the k2o al2o3 sio2 h2o systems freeze and cherry 1979 guler and thyne 2004 raychowdhury et al 2014 most geothermal springs fall around the triple point junction of albite k feldspar paragonite muscovite and kaolinite suggesting that the na and k are controlled by the above minerals figs 5 a and b the si of gypsum of all the samples are undersaturated table 5 and the trend of gypsum dissolution eq 3 is not obvious which suggest the limit contribution of gypsum dissolution fig 4d the cold springs and surface waters are dominated by the dissolution of carbonate calcite aragonite and dolomite eqs 4 and 5 as shown in figs 4b and d 1 nacl halite na cl 2 2naalsi3o8 albite 2co2 3h2o 2na kaolinite 2hco3 4sio2 3 caso4 2h2o gypsum ca2 so4 2 2h2o 4 caco3 calcite aragonite h2o co2 ca2 2hco3 5 camg co3 2 dolomite 2h2o 2co2 ca2 mg2 4hco3 the reaction of cation exchange can be generalized as eq 6 and the influence of cation exchange can be calculated by the relationship of corrected bivalent cation and corrected na negri et al 2018 hosono and yamanaka 2021 the na k cl ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 equivalent ratio of geothermal springs are close to 1 1 trend line fig 4c suggesting that the exchange of major cations is one of the dominating processes jankowski et al 1998 yang et al 2019 the cold springs and surface waters cluster close to the origin indicating that the cation exchange has little influence on the chemistry verma et al 2016 compared to the cold springs the geothermal waters are enriched in na and cl showing a deep and long term circulation path e g zhang et al 2019a 6 ca2 2na clay ca clay 2na the na hco3 waters in the geothermal systems are commonly associated with the co2 dissolution at the depth and can be generally formed by two processes sracek and hirata 2002 dupalova et al 2012 sracek et al 2019 a carbonate dissolution combined with cation exchange expressed as eqs 7 and b reaction between silicates and co2 expressed as eq 8 7 caco3 co2 h2o na2x 2na 2hco3 cax 8 2naalsi3o8 2co2 11h2o 2na al2si2o5 oh 4 4h4sio4 2hco3 all the geothermal waters are oversaturated with co2 relative to the atmosphere where pco2 in the range of 10 2 90 to 10 0 03 up to serval orders of magnitude higher than the saturation of atmospheric co2 pco2 10 3 40 meanwhile co2 is the dominating compound of bubbling gases in the ygr e g zhang et al 2017 klemperer et al 2022 and thus co2 can be a significant factor controlling water rock interactions the sis show that geothermal springs are generally close to saturation with respect to carbonate phases calcite aragonite and dolomite table 5 which confirms that the precipitation of these mineral phases should have occurred fig 4b shows the significantly enrichment of hco3 which can be also attributed to co2 induced silicate hydrolysis this suggests that both processes possibly operate simultaneously and the co2 dissolution increases mineral dissolution and enhances weathering processes dupalova et al 2012 kis et al 2020 the depleted ca2 in the geothermal springs can also be attributed to the cation exchange and co2 dissolution guo et al 2009 lambrakis et al 2013 the cation exchange processes eq 6 lead to the continuous removal of ca2 as shown in fig 4c for geothermal fluid ascend from depth the decrease of external pressure causes co2 degassing and in turn induces hco3 transformed to co3 2 as expressed by the eq 9 with the increasing of co3 2 concentration the ca carbonate precipitation which reduce the ca2 concentration occurred eq 10 concentrations of ca2 were negative correlation with f most of the geothermal waters are undersaturated for fluorite and oversaturated for calcite table 5 this suggests that the decrease of ca2 would promote the release of f bearing minerals which are commonly prevail in granitic terrains 9 2hco3 co3 2 co2 g h2o 10 ca2 co3 2 caco3 s 5 2 processes controlling typical trace elements typical trace elements li rb cs and b regarded as conservative constituents are insensitive to the dilution or boiling processes and therefore useful for providing information on the source of deep geothermal fluid giggenbach et al 1994 pasvanoglu 2020 shoedarto et al 2020 these typical trace elements are also enriched in the fluid associate with the end step of crystallization of the granitic magma grimaud et al 1985 despite concentration of the trace alkalies for geothermal springs varies greatly the good correlations between the trace alkalies and cl r 0 83 indicate that they originate from the deep reservoir figs 6 a c shows the relations between the trace alkali metals li rb and cs and b relative to the median rock ratios and all three alkali metals are less mobile than b the depletion in the trace alkali metals can attributed to 1 the uptake of the trace alkali metals li rb and cs into major alkali metals na and k 2 the addition of b by magmatic degassing kaasalainen and stefansson 2012 wrage et al 2017 in the geothermal systems the three trace alkali metals were acquired by the fluids in the early formation stages once added to the fluids they were remain basically unchanged and not formed their own secondary minerals goguel 1983 giggenbach and soto 1992 kaasalainen and stefansson 2012 however these trace alkali metals can also be taken up into some geothermal alteration minerals such as quartz chlorite illite clays and zeolites giggenbach et al 1994 kaasalainen and stefansson 2012 relative concentrations of li rb and cs for the geothermal springs are plotted on the li rb cs ternary diagram to identify the existence of the common origin and deep processes fig 7 a all the geothermal springs are far away from the isochemical dissolution of average crustal rock remarked rock pointing toward the removal of rb with secondary layer silicates i e illite which removes the initial rb in the process of crystallization under elevated temperatures 300 c giggenbach et al 1994 shoedarto et al 2020 for li which survived in the early stages of water rock interaction under high temperature commonly had the possible to be incorporated into the secondary quartz during the cooling process of all the geothermal springs giggenbach and soto 1992 however the good relationship between li and cl suggests the limited li depletion arnorsson 2000 the li cs ratios generally dependent on the lithology around 1 for granite range from 1 1 5 0 for the geothermal springs giggenbach and soto 1992 pasvanoglu 2020 the deep melting fluid li depletion can provide potential contribution to geothermal fluids ni et al 2017 the geothermal springs plot close to each other and this suggests that they origin from similar reservoir or under similar processes relative concentrations of cl li and b which have varying degrees of conservative behavior are plotted on the cl li b ternary diagram fig 7b to trace the deep source of the fluids giggenbach and soto 1992 due to the incompatible behavior of b and cl at high temperature especially higher than 150 c the cl b ratios can record the rock type during the deep circulation process and have been regard as suitable geochemical indicator to identify the input of magamatic vapor giggenbach 1995 arnorsson and andrsdttir 1995 bernard et al 2011 reyes and trompetter 2012 as the water rock interaction processes proceed the initial aqueous cl b ratio changes as b concentration is added by rock dissolution while the supplement of cl concentration is limited and thus gradually approach to the wall rock arnorsson 1995 dotsika 2015 geothermal waters with low cl b molar ratio contain abnormally high b up to 137 5 mg l which is higher than the average crustal abundances 10 40 mg l and possibly attributed to the supply of b from the magmatic vapor of degassing magma goguel 1983 arnorsson 1995 dotsika 2012 the cl b molar ratios of geothermal waters in the range of 1 49 9 74 are significantly lower than the seawater 1313 indicating that there is no contribution by formation waters yuan et al 2014 the good correlation between b and cl r 0 83 also indicates the occurrence of mixing processes with cold waters during the ascending process arnorsson 2000 5 3 recharge sources and carbon sources of geothermal water 5 3 1 recharge sources various sources can affect the composition of geothermal waters such as deep circulating meteoric waters magmatic waters formation and metamorphic waters nicholson 1993 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are powerful tool to determine the recharge sources and water rock interactions of the geothermal system e g yang et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 sracek et al 2019 as shown in fig 8 all the surface waters and cold springs are generally parallel to the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 indicating they are originated from local meteoric with no or poor evapo concentration most geothermal springs distribute close to the gmwl which also indicate their meteoric origin compared with the surface waters and cold springs nearby geothermal springs present significant enrichment in δ18o geothermal shift craig 1963 which can attribute to high temperature water rock interactions craig 1963 clark and fritz 1997 arnorsson 2000 however water rock interactions normally limit δd shift since little hydrogen occurs in most rocks relative to that in the fluids giggenbach 1992 nicholson 1993 the incongruent dissolution of na feldspars eq 2 and the mixing processes discussed above would also theoretically counteract the observed δd shift giggenbach 1992 hensen et al 2007 thus the non horizontal isotopic trends of geothermal springs possibly suggest the input of magmatic fluids as shown in fig 8 the feeding source of the geothermal waters falls into the mixing area of three end members including meteoric water snow melt and magmatic fluid the mixing ratio of magmatic water can be estimated as follows giggenbach 1992 11 α δg w δs w δm w δs w where α is the mixed percentage of magmatic water δg w δm w and δs w is the δd v smow compositions of geothermal magmatic and snow waters respectively the contribution of the magmatic waters for geothermal springs in the group 1 group 2 and group 3 are in the range of 15 31 14 16 and 21 28 respectively this suggests that group 2 is less affected by magmatic fluids with respect to group 1 and group 3 likely due to a shallow circulation depth given the negative correlation between heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition and elevation altitude effect the recharge elevation can be estimated by the equation established by yu et al 1984 12 hr e δdr e 30 2 0 026 where hr e represents the recharge elevation m δdr e is the δd value of the intersection point a δd 163 2 and b δd 182 6 the average recharge elevations of the geothermal waters for the northern and the southern segments are 5116 m and 5862 m respectively based on the regional geological condition the nyehchen tanglha mountains about 5500 6000 m in the northeast and the himalayan mountains in the south about 6000 m can be the main recharge area of the geothermal springs the snow melt water is prone to infiltrate the ygr and circulate deeply 5 3 2 carbon sources four potential sources can be responsible for the dissolved carbon in the geothermal waters atmospheric carbon dissolved by rainwater catm organic carbon in the sedimentary strata or soil zone corg carbon derived from carbonate mineral dissolution ccarb deeply derived co2 cdeep including magmatic source and metamorphic co2 chiodini et al 2000 karlstrom et al 2013 chiodini et al 2020 the atmospheric co2 have an average δ13catm value of 8 with low partial pressure pco2 0 0003bar and has thus negligible contribution to geothermal waters graven et al 2017 karakus et al 2019 the multiple carbon sources contributing to tdic total dissolved inorganic carbon can be identified by the carbon mass balance model as follows chiodini et al 2000 13 cexter tdic ccarb 14 δ13cexter cexter δ13ct dic tdic δ13ccarb ccarb where ccarb and δ13ccarb represent the carbon from the carbonate dissolution mol l and related isotopic composition respectively cexter and δ13cexter represent the carbon from external sources mol l and related isotopic composition respectively the ccarb can be calculated by the equilibrium of ca mg carbonate dissolution and gypsum anhydrite dissolution ccarb ca mg so4 in mol l for the geothermal waters dominated by volcanic rocks the ccarb is close to zero which indicate the limited contribution of carbonate dissolution frondini et al 2009 the δ13ccarb value is set as 1 7 based on the average of 350 marine carbonate samples from the southern tibetan plateau hu et al 2001 li et al 2005a the external carbon can be established by the binary mixing model as follows chiodini et al 2000 15 cexter corg cdeep 16 δ13cexter cexter δ13corg corg δ13cdeep cdeep where δ13corg and δ13cdeep are the δ13c compositions of organic carbon and deeply derived co2 respectively the theoretical mixing curves are established based on the organic carbon end

and tdic table 3 are under the threshold values pco2 1bar and tdic 69 5mmol l suggesting that the uncertainty of the model caused by calcite precipitation and or co2 degassing can be ignored chiodini et al 2000 the cexter vs δ13cexter plot fig 9 indicates that all the geothermal waters fall within the evolution curves between the organic and deep carbon end members the dominant carbon sources for geothermal waters can ascribable to deeply derived co2 with the contribution range from 77 to 99 the geothermal waters in the southern segment are closer to the deep carbon end member which is consistent with the large scale distribution of the metamorphic core complexes i e kangma gneiss dome and or the relatively shallow partial melting zhang et al 2021 xie et al 2021 5 4 reservoir temperature cooling process and circulation depth 5 4 1 empirical chemical geothermometers empirical chemical geothermometers including cation and silica geothermometers have been widely used to calculate subsurface geothermal reservoir temperatures and they are of pivotal importance to the exploration and development of geothermal resources kharaka and mariner 1989 yang et al 2019 wu et al 2021 based on empirical or semi empirical laws chemical geothermometers rely on several assumptions including the existence of water rock equilibrium the adequate supplement of chemical species involved and no significant modification of chemical composition i e dilution boiling and re equilibration in upflow zones fournier and truesdell 1973 fournier 1977 nicholson 1993 arnorsson 2000 for a comprehensive understanding of the reservoir temperature several chemical geothermometers are applied to verify or disprove the validity of the assumptions before calculating the reservoir temperature the water rock equilibrium state should be determined first the na k mg triangle plot fig 10 a proposed by giggenbach 1988 have been widely used to determine the equilibrium state the mixing degree and the suitability of various cation geothermometers e g chao et al 2021 mao et al 2021 wu et al 2021 three groups are included fully equilibrated partially equilibrated and immature waters fig 10a shows that most geothermal springs from group 1 gl ybj and yy geothermal fields group 2 grq geothermal fields and group 3 jz geothermal field fall into partially equilibrated areas suggesting that water rock equilibrium is generally occurred and the above samples are suitable for the application of cation geothermometers geothermal springs in the nz group 1 yl group 2 and km group 3 geothermal fields pertain to immature water which can be attributed to mixing with mg rich cold waters shallow circulation depth and rapid flow rate giggenbach 1988 yang et al 2017 li et al 2021 these immature waters may cause significantly over or under estimated temperatures through cation geothermometers distinct differences are observed among the estimated temperatures for geothermal springs based on different cation geothermometers table 4 and fig 10b compared to the measure temperatures of geothermal wells fig 10b the na k ca geothermometer gives anomalously high temperature 310 525 c mg involving geothermometer gives relatively lower temperatures 81 259 c and the na li geothermometer gives wide range of temperatures 119 475 c the na k geothermometer which generally maintain deep equilibration temperature for slow kinetics of na k equilibration and insensitive to secondary processes giggenbach 1988 delalande et al 2011 rezaei et al 2019 provides more reliable results 202 321 c for geothermal waters generally attain water rock equilibrium the sis table 5 suggest that the quartz chalcedony equilibriums are generally established for all the geothermal springs and silica geothermometers are suitable for the study region temperatures estimates with quartz without steam loss quartz with complete steam loss and improve sio2 geothermometers are similar to each other with average values of 149 c 142 c 149 c respectively while those with chalcedony geothermometer are relatively low with the average values of 124 c table 4 silica geothermometers provide relatively lower temperatures than na k geothermometer 5 4 2 mixing model and ratio the characteristics of conservative elements ratios i e cl b ratio oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and chemical geothermometers discussed above indicate the possible mixing process of the ygr fournier 1979 arnorsson 2000 the si enthalpy mixing method truesdell and fournier 1977 which can recognize the mixing processes and mixing ratios is used as a supplement method to estimate reservoir temperature in the si enthalpy mixing model fig 11 two methods are applied for mixed groundwaters under the conditions that steam loss occurs or not before mixing assuming no steam loss before mixing the mixing line joining cold springs to geothermal springs intersect the quartz solubility curve indicate the reservoir temperature for geothermal springs in group 1 group 2 and group 3 reservoir temperatures are in the range of 196 302 c n1 n2 164 207 c c1 c2 and 137 261 c s1 s2 respectively if steam loss from adiabatically cooled fluid before mixing the intersection points n3 n4 c3 c4 and s3 s4 demonstrate reservoir temperatures for group 1 group 2 and group 3 are in the range of 134 151 c 122 133 c and 112 144 c respectively the si enthalpy mixing model suggests that there are at least two reservoirs with different temperatures according to the drilling data two types of geothermal reservoirs including intermediate temperature and high temperature exist in the northern part of the ygr with the measure temperatures of 172 c and 190 207 c for yy geothermal filed and 130 173 c and 330 c for ybj geothermal field zhao et al 1998 dor 2003 wang et al 2018a thus the temperatures estimated by the assumptions that no loss before mixing give more reasonable results there s no intersection point from the cold spring to the geothermal wells in the ybj and yy geothermal fields with the quartz solubility curve suggesting the mixing process is not the major cooling process the intersection points of a and b indicate the reservoir temperature without steam loss for yy and ybj geothermal fields i e 205 c and 250 c respectively the reservoir temperature of ybj geothermal well by si enthalpy mixing model is lower than multiple chemical geothermometers and maximal measured temperature of drilling well 330 c owing to the sio2 re equilibrium during the ascending process zhao et al 1998 the estimated temperature of yy geothermal well by si enthalpy is generally consistent with the measured temperature 207 c suggesting the limited contribution by secondary processes this is also confirmed by some geothermal springs in the yy whose mixing line fail to intersect to the quartz solubility curve fig 11 suggests that most geothermal springs are formed by the mixing of deep geothermal water and shallow groundwater or surface water assuming that the dissolved sio2 was saturated in the deep geothermal fluid the proportion of the mixed water can be expressed as follows truesdell and fournier 1977 17 ecwx eh 1 x es 18 sicwx sih 1 x sis where ecw is the enthalpy of the cold water eh is the enthalpy of the deep geothermal fluid es is the final enthalpy of the geothermal spring sicw is the sio2 concentration of the cold spring sih is the sio2 concentration of the deep geothermal fluid sis is the sio2 concentration of the geothermal spring and x is the mixture ratio of cold water with the deep geothermal fluid based on a graphical method the cold waters mixing ratios of the different geothermal fields in the ygr are plotted on the fig 12 calculated proportions of cold waters for the geothermal springs in group 1 group 2 group 3 are in the range of 64 66 69 76 and 78 81 respectively 5 4 3 geothermometrical modelling geothermometrical modelling depends on solid thermodynamic basis and complete fluid compositions it can provide the convergence of multi mineral equilibrium and has been proven to give effective prediction of reservoir temperatures reed and spycher 1984 pang and reed 1998 palandri and reed 2001 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2021 the fixal method which considered the influence of degassing mixing processes and errors of aluminum analysis for multi mineral equilibrium was applied to reconstruct the conditions of deep reservoirs based on solveq xpt code pang and reed 1998 reed et al 2012 degassed co2 was re established by adding equal moles of h and hco3 with the range of 0 1 0 9 mol l and mixing process was corrected by removing corresponding moles h2o related to the calculated mixture ratio fig 13 to eliminate the erroneous or lacking analyses of al albite was selected as al bearing mineral to force equilibrium in the systems pang and reed 1998 the mineral sets were selected based on hydrochemical characteristics hydrothermal alteration minerals and aquifer lithology zhu and xu 1989 hou et al 2015 geothermal water with the highest sampling temperature was chosen to represent each geothermal field predicted reservoir temperatures with reconstructed mineral equilibrium are plotted as fig 13 reservoir temperatures for geothermal waters of group 1 group 2 and group 3 are in the range of 249 312 c 216 218 c and 235 238 c respectively meanwhile the molded ph of geothermal waters in the deep reservoir are slightly acidic ph 5 8 6 4 with the degassed co2 ranging from 0 1 0 9 mol l this suggests after varying degrees of co2 escaped during the ascending process the deep geothermal waters elevated to slightly acidic and alkaline ph 6 1 9 1 at the surface the estimated temperatures by geothermometrical modelling are generally consistent with that from na k geothermometer and si enthalpy mixing model for partially equilibrated geothermal waters for immature waters geothermometrical modelling gives consistent results with si enthalpy mixing model but not with empirical chemical geothermometers 5 4 4 circulation depth according to the temperature estimated by various geothermometers mixing model and geothermometrical modelling the circulation depths of geothermal springs can be calculated as follows yang et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 19 d hcz te ta gg where d is the maximum circulation depth of geothermal waters m hcz is the thickness of the constant temperature zone m te is the calculated reservoir temperature c ta is the temperature of the normal temperature zone c gg is the local geothermal gradient c km the thickness of the constant temperature zone is 20 m liu et al 2022 the local average temperature is 2 c the geothermal gradients are based on the measured drilling data jiang et al 2016 as shown in the table 4 the circulation depths for the northern segment and southern segment are in the range of 2 45 6 85 km and 3 40 6 50 km respectively 6 conceptual model and evolution of geothermal water based on the geomorphologic setting geochemical characteristics and isotopic signature the conceptual model of the mediate high temperature geothermal systems in the ygr across southern tibetan plateau was proposed fig 14 in the ygr a non volcanic area with the magmatic heat source the dominated recharge sources of geothermal waters are the combination of meteoric water snow melt water and magmatic fluids the meteoric water and or snow melt water from the surrounding mountains nyenchen tanglha mountains himalayan mountains infiltrated deeply under the driving force of 1000 m water head through a series of n s trending normal fault systems and e w stretching thrust systems the crustal partial melting which validated by multiple geophysical methods i e magnetotelluric data seismic wave data and earthquake data can be regarded as principally heat source to actuate the geothermal activities in the ygr e g makovsky et al 1996 kind et al 1996 unsworth et al 2005 xie et al 2021 the deep circulating fluid mixing the magmatic fluid about 14 31 to form highly reactive acid solutions and further interacted with wall rocks result in neutral nacl water primary neutralization process involving the precipitations of various alteration minerals e g albite calcite kaolinite and microcline giggenbach 1988 the neutral nacl waters ascended to the surface with the formation of several deep and or shallow reservoirs formed with various reservoir temperatures 137 312 c at different depth 2 45 6 85 km during the ascending processes heated geothermal waters are cooled by adiabatic degassing conductive cooling and mixing with shallow cold water as well as a combination of the above processes meanwhile progressive water rock interactions i e silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and cation exchange combing the increasingly co2 rich vapor about 0 1 mol l 0 9 mol l generated cl hco3 na hco3 cl na water group 1 group 3 and hco3 na water group 2 with varying maturity degrees and complex chemical characteristics 7 conclusions geochemistry of major solutes typical trace elements li rb cs and b and stable isotopes δd δ18o and δ13ctdic of geothermal waters in the ygr were determined to investigate the major geochemical processes controlling the origin evolution and circulation mechanism the cold springs and surface waters are consistently characterized by ca hco3 dominated waters with extremely low concentrations of trace elements the geothermal springs present extensive variability and can be classified into three groups na cl dominated group 1 with high trace elements in the northern segment na hco3 waters group 2 with relatively low trace elements in the northern segment and na cl dominated group 3 with abnormally high trace elements in the southern segment the source of major solutes for cold springs and surface waters are dominated by carbonate dissolution while that for geothermal springs are dominated by silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and cation exchange typical trace elements are significantly depleted relative to the median rock ratios and the ion ratios suggest the potential addition of b by magmatic degassing and similar deep processes of geothermal waters the recharge sources of geothermal springs are the combination of meteoric water snow melt and magmatic fluid while that for cold springs and surface waters are meteoric water the nyehchen tanglha mountains and himalayan mountains can be the main recharge sources of geothermal waters snow melt waters and meteoric waters infiltrated deeply through a series of fault systems in the ygr and mixed with magmatic fluids with varying degree i e group 1 group 2 and group 3 with the range of 15 31 14 16 and 21 28 respectively the dominant carbon sources for geothermal waters can ascribable to deeply derived co2 including magmatic source and metamorphic source with the contribution range from 77 to 99 the calculated subsurface temperatures are in the range of 137 312 c and belong to median high temperature geothermal systems the circulation depths for the northern and southern segments are in the range of 2 45 6 85 km and 3 40 6 50 km respectively the geothermal springs of different geothermal fields along the ygr have uniform heat source and undergo the combing cooling processes as well as multifarious water rock interactions this study can improve the understanding of the origin evolution and circulation of deep circulating groundwater and helpful for exploration and exploitation of the high temperature

2120,geothermal resources regarded as sustainable green energy are attracting increasing attention the southern tibetan plateau possesses the most abundant intermediate high geothermal resources in china and has enormous potential for geothermal exploration geothermal waters from the yadong gulu rift ygr which is considered as the most active geothermal belt of the plateau are studied based on hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics to understand the spatial variations of fluid origin evolution and circulation mechanism as well as heat sources the hydrochemical characteristics of cold springs and surface waters are consistently characterized by ca hco3 dominated ca hco3 and ca hco3 so4 waters while those of geothermal springs present extensive variability with na cl dominated na cl hco3 na hco3 cl na ca cl hco3 and na hco3 waters the main geochemical processes controlling the geothermal springs are combinations of silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and cation exchange the characteristics of trace alkali metals and b indicate they undergone common similar deep process and the potential input of magmatic degassing the δd and δ18o values suggest that cold springs and surface waters are recharged by meteoric water and geothermal springs are replenished by meteoric water snow melt and magmatic fluid the mass balance model reveal that dominant carbon sources for geothermal waters can be deeply derived co2 i e magmatic source and metamorphic source contributing from 77 to 99 based on empirical chemical geothermometers si enthalpy mixing model and

persistent india asia continental collision the tibetan plateau has been strongly uplifted and resulted in a series of approximately n s trending extensional rifts cogan et al 1998 yin and harrison 2000 chung et al 2005 the intermediate high temperature geothermal systems of the tibetan plateau principally distribute along the indus yarlung tsangpo suture and extend in n s direction strictly controlled by a system of near n s trending normal faults and grabens hou et al 2001 wang et al 2021 at present 129 geothermal systems with reservoir temperatures higher than 150 c and 12 geothermal systems higher than 200 c have been found in tibet liao and zhao 1999 however the power generation potential of most geothermal resources has not been evaluated completely economical intermediate high

well correlated with cl r 0 90 with the enrichment of cl up to 40 meq l suggesting the potential influence of geothermal fluids or halite dissolution the deviation of na cl molar ratio from the 1 1 line fig 4 a the undersaturated of halite table 5 and the rarely distribution of evaporite unit manifesting that halite dissolution eq 1 are not the dominated source of na and cl fontes and matray 1993 yang et al 2019 given that the widely distributed of the granite gangdese granite and leucogranite and volcanic rocks the enrichment of na in the geothermal springs are possible deriving by the leaching of silicate minerals e g incongruent dissolution of albite eq 2 which can additionally increase the alkalinity the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 diagram fig 4b shows that all the geothermal springs locate above the 1 1 line which support the hypothesis of the occurrence of silicate weathering e g negri et al 2018 fan et al 2019 yang et al 2019 to define the dissolution of silicate minerals the thermodynamic activity plots are applied in the na2o al2o3 sio2 h2o and the k2o al2o3 sio2 h2o systems freeze and cherry 1979 guler and thyne 2004 raychowdhury et al 2014 most geothermal springs fall around the triple point junction of albite k feldspar paragonite muscovite and kaolinite suggesting that the na and k are controlled by the above minerals figs 5 a and b the si of gypsum of all the samples are undersaturated table 5 and the trend of gypsum dissolution eq 3 is not obvious which suggest the limit contribution of gypsum dissolution fig 4d the cold springs and surface waters are dominated by the dissolution of carbonate calcite aragonite and dolomite eqs 4 and 5 as shown in figs 4b and d 1 nacl halite na cl 2 2naalsi3o8 albite 2co2 3h2o 2na kaolinite 2hco3 4sio2 3 caso4 2h2o gypsum ca2 so4 2 2h2o 4 caco3 calcite aragonite h2o co2 ca2 2hco3 5 camg co3 2 dolomite 2h2o 2co2 ca2 mg2 4hco3 the reaction of cation exchange can be generalized as eq 6 and the influence of cation exchange can be calculated by the relationship of corrected bivalent cation and corrected na negri et al 2018 hosono and yamanaka 2021 the na k cl ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 equivalent ratio of geothermal springs are close to 1 1 trend line fig 4c suggesting that the exchange of major cations is one of the dominating processes jankowski et al 1998 yang et al 2019 the cold springs and surface waters cluster close to the origin indicating that the cation exchange has little influence on the chemistry verma et al 2016 compared to the cold springs the geothermal waters are enriched in na and cl showing a deep and long term circulation path e g zhang et al 2019a 6 ca2 2na clay ca clay 2na the na hco3 waters in the geothermal systems are commonly associated with the co2 dissolution at the depth and can be generally formed by two processes sracek and hirata 2002 dupalova et al 2012 sracek et al 2019 a carbonate dissolution combined with cation exchange expressed as eqs 7 and b reaction between silicates and co2 expressed as eq 8 7 caco3 co2 h2o na2x 2na 2hco3 cax 8 2naalsi3o8 2co2 11h2o 2na al2si2o5 oh 4 4h4sio4 2hco3 all the geothermal waters are oversaturated with co2 relative to the atmosphere where pco2 in the range of 10 2 90 to 10 0 03 up to serval orders of magnitude higher than the saturation of atmospheric co2 pco2 10 3 40 meanwhile co2 is the dominating compound of bubbling gases in the ygr e g zhang et al 2017 klemperer et al 2022 and thus co2 can be a significant factor controlling water rock interactions the sis show that geothermal springs are generally close to saturation with respect to carbonate phases calcite aragonite and dolomite table 5 which confirms that the precipitation of these mineral phases should have occurred fig 4b shows the significantly enrichment of hco3 which can be also attributed to co2 induced silicate hydrolysis this suggests that both processes possibly operate simultaneously and the co2 dissolution increases mineral dissolution and enhances weathering processes dupalova et al 2012 kis et al 2020 the depleted ca2 in the geothermal springs can also be attributed to the cation exchange and co2 dissolution guo et al 2009 lambrakis et al 2013 the cation exchange processes eq 6 lead to the continuous removal of ca2 as shown in fig 4c for geothermal fluid ascend from depth the decrease of external pressure causes co2 degassing and in turn induces hco3 transformed to co3 2 as expressed by the eq 9 with the increasing of co3 2 concentration the ca carbonate precipitation which reduce the ca2 concentration occurred eq 10 concentrations of ca2 were negative correlation with f most of the geothermal waters are undersaturated for fluorite and oversaturated for calcite table 5 this suggests that the decrease of ca2 would promote the release of f bearing minerals which are commonly prevail in granitic terrains 9 2hco3 co3 2 co2 g h2o 10 ca2 co3 2 caco3 s 5 2 processes controlling typical trace elements typical trace elements li rb cs and b regarded as conservative constituents are insensitive to the dilution or boiling processes and therefore useful for providing information on the source of deep geothermal fluid giggenbach et al 1994 pasvanoglu 2020 shoedarto et al 2020 these typical trace elements are also enriched in the fluid associate with the end step of crystallization of the granitic magma grimaud et al 1985 despite concentration of the trace alkalies for geothermal springs varies greatly the good correlations between the trace alkalies and cl r 0 83 indicate that they originate from the deep reservoir figs 6 a c shows the relations between the trace alkali metals li rb and cs and b relative to the median rock ratios and all three alkali metals are less mobile than b the depletion in the trace alkali metals can attributed to 1 the uptake of the trace alkali metals li rb and cs into major alkali metals na and k 2 the addition of b by magmatic degassing kaasalainen and stefansson 2012 wrage et al 2017 in the geothermal systems the three trace alkali metals were acquired by the fluids in the early formation stages once added to the fluids they were remain basically unchanged and not formed their own secondary minerals goguel 1983 giggenbach and soto 1992 kaasalainen and stefansson 2012 however these trace alkali metals can also be taken up into some geothermal alteration minerals such as quartz chlorite illite clays and zeolites giggenbach et al 1994 kaasalainen and stefansson 2012 relative concentrations of li rb and cs for the geothermal springs are plotted on the li rb cs ternary diagram to identify the existence of the common origin and deep processes fig 7 a all the geothermal springs are far away from the isochemical dissolution of average crustal rock remarked rock pointing toward the removal of rb with secondary layer silicates i e illite which removes the initial rb in the process of crystallization under elevated temperatures 300 c giggenbach et al 1994 shoedarto et al 2020 for li which survived in the early stages of water rock interaction under high temperature commonly had the possible to be incorporated into the secondary quartz during the cooling process of all the geothermal springs giggenbach and soto 1992 however the good relationship between li and cl suggests the limited li depletion arnorsson 2000 the li cs ratios generally dependent on the lithology around 1 for granite range from 1 1 5 0 for the geothermal springs giggenbach and soto 1992 pasvanoglu 2020 the deep melting fluid li depletion can provide potential contribution to geothermal fluids ni et al 2017 the geothermal springs plot close to each other and this suggests that they origin from similar reservoir or under similar processes relative concentrations of cl li and b which have varying degrees of conservative behavior are plotted on the cl li b ternary diagram fig 7b to trace the deep source of the fluids giggenbach and soto 1992 due to the incompatible behavior of b and cl at high temperature especially higher than 150 c the cl b ratios can record the rock type during the deep circulation process and have been regard as suitable geochemical indicator to identify the input of magamatic vapor giggenbach 1995 arnorsson and andrsdttir 1995 bernard et al 2011 reyes and trompetter 2012 as the water rock interaction processes proceed the initial aqueous cl b ratio changes as b concentration is added by rock dissolution while the supplement of cl concentration is limited and thus gradually approach to the wall rock arnorsson 1995 dotsika 2015 geothermal waters with low cl b molar ratio contain abnormally high b up to 137 5 mg l which is higher than the average crustal abundances 10 40 mg l and possibly attributed to the supply of b from the magmatic vapor of degassing magma goguel 1983 arnorsson 1995 dotsika 2012 the cl b molar ratios of geothermal waters in the range of 1 49 9 74 are significantly lower than the seawater 1313 indicating that there is no contribution by formation waters yuan et al 2014 the good correlation between b and cl r 0 83 also indicates the occurrence of mixing processes with cold waters during the ascending process arnorsson 2000 5 3 recharge sources and carbon sources of geothermal water 5 3 1 recharge sources various sources can affect the composition of geothermal waters such as deep circulating meteoric waters magmatic waters formation and metamorphic waters nicholson 1993 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are powerful tool to determine the recharge sources and water rock interactions of the geothermal system e g yang et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 sracek et al 2019 as shown in fig 8 all the surface waters and cold springs are generally parallel to the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 indicating they are originated from local meteoric with no or poor evapo concentration most geothermal springs distribute close to the gmwl which also indicate their meteoric origin compared with the surface waters and cold springs nearby geothermal springs present significant enrichment in δ18o geothermal shift craig 1963 which can attribute to high temperature water rock interactions craig 1963 clark and fritz 1997 arnorsson 2000 however water rock interactions normally limit δd shift since little hydrogen occurs in most rocks relative to that in the fluids giggenbach 1992 nicholson 1993 the incongruent dissolution of na feldspars eq 2 and the mixing processes discussed above would also theoretically counteract the observed δd shift giggenbach 1992 hensen et al 2007 thus the non horizontal isotopic trends of geothermal springs possibly suggest the input of magmatic fluids as shown in fig 8 the feeding source of the geothermal waters falls into the mixing area of three end members including meteoric water snow melt and magmatic fluid the mixing ratio of magmatic water can be estimated as follows giggenbach 1992 11 α δg w δs w δm w δs w where α is the mixed percentage of magmatic water δg w δm w and δs w is the δd v smow compositions of geothermal magmatic and snow waters respectively the contribution of the magmatic waters for geothermal springs in the group 1 group 2 and group 3 are in the range of 15 31 14 16 and 21 28 respectively this suggests that group 2 is less affected by magmatic fluids with respect to group 1 and group 3 likely due to a shallow circulation depth given the negative correlation between heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition and elevation altitude effect the recharge elevation can be estimated by the equation established by yu et al 1984 12 hr e δdr e 30 2 0 026 where hr e represents the recharge elevation m δdr e is the δd value of the intersection point a δd 163 2 and b δd 182 6 the average recharge elevations of the geothermal waters for the northern and the southern segments are 5116 m and 5862 m respectively based on the regional geological condition the nyehchen tanglha mountains about 5500 6000 m in the northeast and the himalayan mountains in the south about 6000 m can be the main recharge area of the geothermal springs the snow melt water is prone to infiltrate the ygr and circulate deeply 5 3 2 carbon sources four potential sources can be responsible for the dissolved carbon in the geothermal waters atmospheric carbon dissolved by rainwater catm organic carbon in the sedimentary strata or soil zone corg carbon derived from carbonate mineral dissolution ccarb deeply derived co2 cdeep including magmatic source and metamorphic co2 chiodini et al 2000 karlstrom et al 2013 chiodini et al 2020 the atmospheric co2 have an average δ13catm value of 8 with low partial pressure pco2 0 0003bar and has thus negligible contribution to geothermal waters graven et al 2017 karakus et al 2019 the multiple carbon sources contributing to tdic total dissolved inorganic carbon can be identified by the carbon mass balance model as follows chiodini et al 2000 13 cexter tdic ccarb 14 δ13cexter cexter δ13ct dic tdic δ13ccarb ccarb where ccarb and δ13ccarb represent the carbon from the carbonate dissolution mol l and related isotopic composition respectively cexter and δ13cexter represent the carbon from external sources mol l and related isotopic composition respectively the ccarb can be calculated by the equilibrium of ca mg carbonate dissolution and gypsum anhydrite dissolution ccarb ca mg so4 in mol l for the geothermal waters dominated by volcanic rocks the ccarb is close to zero which indicate the limited contribution of carbonate dissolution frondini et al 2009 the δ13ccarb value is set as 1 7 based on the average of 350 marine carbonate samples from the southern tibetan plateau hu et al 2001 li et al 2005a the external carbon can be established by the binary mixing model as follows chiodini et al 2000 15 cexter corg cdeep 16 δ13cexter cexter δ13corg corg δ13cdeep cdeep where δ13corg and δ13cdeep are the δ13c compositions of organic carbon and deeply derived co2 respectively the theoretical mixing curves are established based on the organic carbon end member δ13corg 26 with variable corg values of 0 1 3 0 mmol l and the deep carbon end member δ13cdeep 0 with cdeep 60 mmol l chiodini et al 2004 williams et al 2013 in the model the calculated pco2 and tdic table 3 are under the threshold values pco2 1bar and tdic 69 5mmol l suggesting that the uncertainty of the model caused by calcite precipitation and or co2 degassing can be ignored chiodini et al 2000 the cexter vs δ13cexter plot fig 9 indicates that all the geothermal waters fall within the evolution curves between the organic and deep carbon end members the dominant carbon sources for geothermal waters can ascribable to deeply derived co2 with the contribution range from 77 to 99 the geothermal waters in the southern segment are closer to the deep carbon end member which is consistent with the large scale distribution of the metamorphic core complexes i e kangma gneiss dome and or the relatively shallow partial melting zhang et al 2021 xie et al 2021 5 4 reservoir temperature cooling process and circulation depth 5 4 1 empirical chemical geothermometers empirical chemical geothermometers including cation and silica geothermometers have been widely used to calculate subsurface geothermal reservoir temperatures and they are of pivotal importance to the exploration and development of geothermal resources kharaka and mariner 1989 yang et al 2019 wu et al 2021 based on empirical or semi empirical laws chemical geothermometers rely on several assumptions including the existence of water rock equilibrium the adequate supplement of chemical species involved and no significant modification of chemical composition i e dilution boiling and re equilibration in upflow zones fournier and truesdell 1973 fournier 1977 nicholson 1993 arnorsson 2000 for a comprehensive understanding of the reservoir temperature several chemical geothermometers are applied to verify or disprove the validity of the assumptions before calculating the reservoir temperature the water rock equilibrium state should be determined first the na k mg triangle plot fig 10 a proposed by giggenbach 1988 have been widely used to determine the equilibrium state the mixing degree and the suitability of various cation geothermometers e g chao et al 2021 mao et al 2021 wu et al 2021 three groups are included fully equilibrated partially equilibrated and immature waters fig 10a shows that most geothermal springs from group 1 gl ybj and yy geothermal fields group 2 grq geothermal fields and group 3 jz geothermal field fall into partially equilibrated areas suggesting that water rock equilibrium is generally occurred and the above samples are suitable for the application of cation geothermometers geothermal springs in the nz group 1 yl group 2 and km group 3 geothermal fields pertain to immature water which can be attributed to mixing with mg rich cold waters shallow circulation depth and rapid flow rate giggenbach 1988 yang et al 2017 li et al 2021 these immature waters may cause significantly over or under estimated temperatures through cation geothermometers distinct differences are observed among the estimated temperatures for geothermal springs based on different cation geothermometers table 4 and fig 10b compared to the measure temperatures of geothermal wells fig 10b the na k ca geothermometer gives anomalously high temperature 310 525 c mg involving geothermometer gives relatively lower temperatures 81 259 c and the na li geothermometer gives wide range of temperatures 119 475 c the na k geothermometer which generally maintain deep equilibration temperature for slow kinetics of na k equilibration and insensitive to secondary processes giggenbach 1988 delalande et al 2011 rezaei et al 2019 provides more reliable results 202 321 c for geothermal waters generally attain water rock equilibrium the sis table 5 suggest that the quartz chalcedony equilibriums are generally established for all the geothermal springs and silica geothermometers are suitable for the study region temperatures estimates with quartz without steam loss quartz with complete steam loss and improve sio2 geothermometers are similar to each other with average values of 149 c 142 c 149 c respectively while those with chalcedony geothermometer are relatively low with the average values of 124 c table 4 silica geothermometers provide relatively lower temperatures than na k geothermometer 5 4 2 mixing model and ratio the characteristics of conservative elements ratios i e cl b ratio oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and chemical geothermometers discussed above indicate the possible mixing process of the ygr fournier 1979 arnorsson 2000 the si enthalpy mixing method truesdell and fournier 1977 which can recognize the mixing processes and mixing ratios is used as a supplement method to estimate reservoir temperature in the si enthalpy mixing model fig 11 two methods are applied for mixed groundwaters under the conditions that steam loss occurs or not before mixing assuming no steam loss before mixing the mixing line joining cold springs to geothermal springs intersect the quartz solubility curve indicate the reservoir temperature for geothermal springs in group 1 group 2 and group 3 reservoir temperatures are in the range of 196 302 c n1 n2 164 207 c c1 c2 and 137 261 c s1 s2 respectively if steam loss from adiabatically cooled fluid before mixing the intersection points n3 n4 c3 c4 and s3 s4 demonstrate reservoir temperatures for group 1 group 2 and group 3 are in the range of 134 151 c 122 133 c and 112 144 c respectively the si enthalpy mixing model suggests that there are at least two reservoirs with different temperatures according to the drilling data two types of geothermal reservoirs including intermediate temperature and high temperature exist in the northern part of the ygr with the measure temperatures of 172 c and 190 207 c for yy geothermal filed and 130 173 c and 330 c for ybj geothermal field zhao et al 1998 dor 2003 wang et al 2018a thus the temperatures estimated by the assumptions that no loss before mixing give more reasonable results there s no intersection point from the cold spring to the geothermal wells in the ybj and yy geothermal fields with the quartz solubility curve suggesting the mixing process is not the major cooling process the intersection points of a and b indicate the reservoir temperature without steam loss for yy and ybj geothermal fields i e 205 c and 250 c respectively the reservoir temperature of ybj geothermal well by si enthalpy mixing model is lower than multiple chemical geothermometers and maximal measured temperature of drilling well 330 c owing to the sio2 re equilibrium during the ascending process zhao et al 1998 the estimated temperature of yy geothermal well by si enthalpy is generally consistent with the measured temperature 207 c suggesting the limited contribution by secondary processes this is also confirmed by some geothermal springs in the yy whose mixing line fail to intersect to the quartz solubility curve fig 11 suggests that most geothermal springs are formed by the mixing of deep geothermal water and shallow groundwater or surface water assuming that the dissolved sio2 was saturated in the deep geothermal fluid the proportion of the mixed water can be expressed as follows truesdell and fournier 1977 17 ecwx eh 1 x es 18 sicwx sih 1 x sis where ecw is the enthalpy of the cold water eh is the enthalpy of the deep geothermal fluid es is the final enthalpy of the geothermal spring sicw is the sio2 concentration of the cold spring sih is the sio2 concentration of the deep geothermal fluid sis is the sio2 concentration of the geothermal spring and x is the mixture ratio of cold water with the deep geothermal fluid based on a graphical method the cold waters mixing ratios of the different geothermal fields in the ygr are plotted on the fig 12 calculated proportions of cold waters for the geothermal springs in group 1 group 2 group 3 are in the range of 64 66 69 76 and 78 81 respectively 5 4 3 geothermometrical modelling geothermometrical modelling depends on solid thermodynamic basis and complete fluid compositions it can provide the convergence of multi mineral equilibrium and has been proven to give effective prediction of reservoir temperatures reed and spycher 1984 pang and reed 1998 palandri and reed 2001 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2021 the fixal method which considered the influence of degassing mixing processes and errors of aluminum analysis for multi mineral equilibrium was applied to reconstruct the conditions of deep reservoirs based on solveq xpt code pang and reed 1998 reed et al 2012 degassed co2 was re established by adding equal moles of h and hco3 with the range of 0 1 0 9 mol l and mixing process was corrected by removing corresponding moles h2o related to the calculated mixture ratio fig 13 to eliminate the erroneous or lacking analyses of al albite was selected as al bearing mineral to force equilibrium in the systems pang and reed 1998 the mineral sets were selected based on hydrochemical characteristics hydrothermal alteration minerals and aquifer lithology zhu and xu 1989 hou et al 2015 geothermal water with the highest sampling temperature was chosen to represent each geothermal field predicted reservoir temperatures with reconstructed mineral equilibrium are plotted as fig 13 reservoir temperatures for geothermal waters of group 1 group 2 and group 3 are in the range of 249 312 c 216 218 c and 235 238 c respectively meanwhile the molded ph of geothermal waters in the deep reservoir are slightly acidic ph 5 8 6 4 with the degassed co2 ranging from 0 1 0 9 mol l this suggests after varying degrees of co2 escaped during the ascending process the deep geothermal waters elevated to slightly acidic and alkaline ph 6 1 9 1 at the surface the estimated temperatures by geothermometrical modelling are generally consistent with that from na k geothermometer and si enthalpy mixing model for partially equilibrated geothermal waters for immature waters geothermometrical modelling gives consistent results with si enthalpy mixing model but not with empirical chemical geothermometers 5 4 4 circulation depth according to the temperature estimated by various geothermometers mixing model and geothermometrical modelling the circulation depths of geothermal springs can be calculated as follows yang et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 19 d hcz te ta gg where d is the maximum circulation depth of geothermal waters m hcz is the thickness of the constant temperature zone m te is the calculated reservoir temperature c ta is the temperature of the normal temperature zone c gg is the local geothermal gradient c km the thickness of the constant temperature zone is 20 m liu et al 2022 the local average temperature is 2 c the geothermal gradients are based on the measured drilling data jiang et al 2016 as shown in the table 4 the circulation depths for the northern segment and southern segment are in the range of 2 45 6 85 km and 3 40 6 50 km respectively 6 conceptual model and evolution of geothermal water based on the geomorphologic setting geochemical characteristics and isotopic signature the conceptual model of the mediate high temperature geothermal systems in the ygr across southern tibetan plateau was proposed fig 14 in the ygr a non volcanic area with the magmatic heat source the dominated recharge sources of geothermal waters are the combination of meteoric water snow melt water and magmatic fluids the meteoric water and or snow melt water from the surrounding mountains nyenchen tanglha mountains himalayan mountains infiltrated deeply under the driving force of 1000 m water head through a series of n s trending normal fault systems and e w stretching thrust systems the crustal partial melting which validated by multiple geophysical methods i e magnetotelluric data seismic wave data and earthquake data can be regarded as principally heat source to actuate the geothermal activities in the ygr e g makovsky et al 1996 kind et al 1996 unsworth et al 2005 xie et al 2021 the deep circulating fluid mixing the magmatic fluid about 14 31 to form highly reactive acid solutions and further interacted with wall rocks result in neutral nacl water primary neutralization process involving the precipitations of various alteration minerals e g albite calcite kaolinite and microcline giggenbach 1988 the neutral nacl waters ascended to the surface with the formation of several deep and or shallow reservoirs formed with various reservoir temperatures 137 312 c at different depth 2 45 6 85 km during the ascending processes heated geothermal waters are cooled by adiabatic degassing conductive cooling and mixing with shallow cold water as well as a combination of the above processes meanwhile progressive water rock interactions i e silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and cation exchange combing the increasingly co2 rich vapor about 0 1 mol l 0 9 mol l generated cl hco3 na hco3 cl na water group 1 group 3 and hco3 na water group 2 with varying maturity degrees and complex chemical characteristics 7 conclusions geochemistry of major solutes typical trace elements li rb cs and b and stable isotopes δd δ18o and δ13ctdic of geothermal waters in the ygr were determined to investigate the major geochemical processes controlling the origin evolution and circulation mechanism the cold springs and surface waters are consistently characterized by ca hco3 dominated waters with extremely low concentrations of trace elements the geothermal springs present extensive variability and can be classified into three groups na cl dominated group 1 with high trace elements in the northern segment na hco3 waters group 2 with relatively low trace elements in the northern segment and na cl dominated group 3 with abnormally high trace elements in the southern segment the source of major solutes for cold springs and surface waters are dominated by carbonate dissolution while that for geothermal springs are dominated by silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and cation exchange typical trace elements are significantly depleted relative to the median rock ratios and the ion ratios suggest the potential addition of b by magmatic degassing and similar deep processes of geothermal waters the recharge sources of geothermal springs are the combination of meteoric water snow melt and magmatic fluid while that for cold springs and surface waters are meteoric water the nyehchen tanglha mountains and himalayan mountains can be the main recharge sources of geothermal waters snow melt waters and meteoric waters infiltrated deeply through a series of fault systems in the ygr and mixed with magmatic fluids with varying degree i e group 1 group 2 and group 3 with the range of 15 31 14 16 and 21 28 respectively the dominant carbon sources for geothermal waters can ascribable to deeply derived co2 including magmatic source and metamorphic source with the contribution range from 77 to 99 the calculated subsurface temperatures are in the range of 137 312 c and belong to median high temperature geothermal systems the circulation depths for the northern and southern segments are in the range of 2 45 6 85 km and 3 40 6 50 km respectively the geothermal springs of different geothermal fields along the ygr have uniform heat source and undergo the combing cooling processes as well as multifarious water rock interactions this study can improve the understanding of the origin evolution and circulation of deep circulating groundwater and helpful for exploration and exploitation of the high temperature

2121,the meltwater generated from the himalayan mountain system is an important source of freshwater sustaining hydrological ecological and biological activities in upstream and downstream regions under a warming climate the cryospheric cover is shrinking altering the availability of freshwater to 53 million people living in the upper and lower parts of the himalayas therefore it becomes essential to understand the hydrological processes and regimes influencing the regional hydrological cycle for proper water resource management and ecosystem restoration policies in this study we measured the patterns of isotopic values δ18o and δ2h of river streamwater to assess the factors controlling its spatio temporal variability and mean residence time in glacierized mountainous upper indus river basin india to better understand the significant hydrological processes and controls the isotopic values of stream river water exhibited significant spatio temporal variance ascribed to changing physiographic hydrometeorological and climatic factors persisting at the local and regional scales the slope and intercept of the river water line δ2h 8 3 0 2 δ18o 15 3 9 p 0 001 is higher than global meteoric water line and local meteoric water line of the uirb india the seasonality in source water ratios suggested that stream water is more biased to winter precipitation the estimated mean residence time in six sub basins ranged from 188 17 to 387 38 days with the longest and shortest mean residence time observed in indus 387 38 days and tangtse 188 17 days sub basins the polynomial second order relationship suggests that the variability in the paleo precipitation δ18o values reflect a change in the moisture source and or upliftment along airmass transport pathways our study highlighted the significance of physiographical and hydrometeorological processes in controlling the spatio temporal variance of stable isotopic composition of river stream water bodies the

and water balance regimes woo et al 2008 wild 2009 therefore the magnitude of perennial streamflow in these high altitude regions is more sensitive to negative impact of climatic variations nijssen et al 2001 berthier et al 2007 eriksson et al 2009 bolch et al 2012 tetzlaff et al 2014 berghuijs et al 2014 ipcc 2014 reynolds et al 2015 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 peleg et al 2020 patel et al 2021 lone et al 2022 in irb approximately 237 million people depend on the meltwaters derived from the cryospheric cover these meltwater contributes 70 to regional surface and sub surface hydrology immerzeel et

2013 2017a wilson et al 2017 shah and lone 2019 lone et al 2017 2021a 2021b 2022 patel et al 2021 therefore understanding the hydrological processes and controlling environmental conditions have become prerequisite for ecosystem restoration and water resource management policies in the last 20 30 years the environmental tracers δ18o and δ2h have been widely used to observe the hydrological processes and regimes across the globe gat 1996 clark and fritz 1997 criss 1999 jeelani et al 2013 2018 zhao and li 2017 lone et al 2019 2020 2022a bowen et al 2019 jeelani and lone 2019 jiang et al

differential source waters in high altitude mountainous basins the estimated mean residence time not only reflects the flowpaths and storage but also acts as a critical indicator of water quality as hydrological geochemical and biogeochemical reactions are influenced by time therefore assessing the hydrological hydrometeorological processes and estimating the mrt valuable information about hydro chemical systems and recent climatic changes could be ascertained in high altitude glacierized basins soulsby et al 2006 tetzlaff et al 2014 bershaw et al 2020 penna et al 2014 wu et al 2019 gao et al 2021 xia et al 2021 he et al 2019 the various studies carried out in the indus river basin irb have mostly focused on the model based approaches to estimate the differential source water contribution to surface and groundwater pande et al 2000 karim and veizer 2002 immerzeel et al 2010 mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 lone et al 2021a lone et al 2022 lone and jeelani 2022 but considering the rugged topography climate in the himalayas and also the critical importance of runoff to maintain the social and agro economic stability of the region the study of complex hydrological and hydrometeorological processes controlling spatio temporal pattern of river stream water is still not available in detail despite the rugged topography and complexities in sample collection at higher altitudes a high resolution data collection and analysis was carried out to address this research gap the main focus of this study is 1 to assess the spatio temporal variances of stable isotopic composition of stream river water ii to estimate the mean residence time mrt and establish empirical isotope altitude relationship for river water the study is aimed to improve the knowledge of how spatial and temporal hydrological processes are controlling the stable water isotopic composition and mrt of river water the study will also provide better insights into the hydraulic linkage of differential water reservoirs in high altitude glacierized basins that would possibly help us to manage the water resources in the region 2 study area the transboundary indus river basin irb is one of the most important system of rivers and tributaries in asia it shares its boundary with parts of india 39 pakistan 47 china 8 and afghanistan 6 with a total areal extent of 833 788 km2 in india the indus river basin irb extends over the northern states and union territories including punjab haryana himachal pradesh rajasthan jammu and kashmir ladakh and chandigarh in ladakh india the upper indus river basin uirb is located between the coordinates of 33 n to 35 n latitude and 76 e to 79 e longitude fig 1 occupying an area of 59 146 km2 the uirb india consists of seven sub basins including dras suru zanskar indus nubra shyok and tangtse with differential areal and glacier cover the climate of the study area is controlled by two major weather systems western disturbances wds and indian summer monsoons ism gadgil 2003 dimri et al 2015 lone et al 2019 the study area is categorized as bw as per the köppen classification system and experiences cold arid to semi arid climatic conditions with maximum precipitation received during winter and early spring lone et al 2019 the region is categorized into four season including spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february the warmest 6 months march october are conquered by clear weather and high incoming solar radiations the less relative humidity rh throughout the year results in variability in ambient temperatures based on the last 11 year climate data acquired from leh weather station latitude 34 08 09 n longitude 77 32 47 e and altitude 3416 m asl the maximum precipitation and temperature is recorded in march 146 mm and august 4 5 c and minimum precipitation and temperature is recorded in august 31 mm and january 23 c fig 2 the high altitudes of uirb are conquered by seasonal snow and permanent glacier fields in uirb the water derived from the snow accumulated in the winter and early spring seasons is a major contributor sustaining the perennial flow and groundwater recharge with least inputs from rain lone et al 2022 the topographic altitude is highly variable throughout the basin which results in variable microclimatic conditions at sub basinal scale this variability in the complex topographic and climatic conditions at the sub basinal scale favors small sized and high elevation glaciers at present 1800 glaciers have been mapped in uirb occupying an area of 997 km2 therefore the discharge of the most important streams of the indus river originating in the ladakh himalayas is significantly controlled by the nectar released from snow and glacier cover with a notable influence from snowfall taking place at higher altitudes in summer it has been reported that 70 of groundwater recharge and stream water flow in uirb is supplied by snow and glacier melt lone et al 2021b 2022 any change in precipitation amount form and glacier extent will negatively impact the regional hydrology 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling and analysis the samples were collected from the dras suru indus shyok nubra and tangtse main channels and their tributaries across the study area for stable isotopic δ18o and δ2h analysis fig 3 the water samples were collected at different altitudes along the profile of these rivers the samples were collected monthly from 2017 to 2019 water sample collection was done in 10 ml high density polyethylene bottles hdpe which were rinsed twice before sample collection and were sealed and numbered at the spot to avoid secondary evaporation fig 3 the water samples were collected at 10 15 cm depth below the water surface and were kept at a temperature of 4⁰c before analysis for oxygen and hydrogen isotope 18o and 2h analysis the samples were sent to geosciences division physical research laboratory prl ahmedabad india the isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms delta v plus thermo scientific is used to measure oxygen and hydrogen ratios in continuous flow mode in a continuous flow mode the gas obtained from the equilibration of water 300 μl with carbon dioxide co2 or h2 for 16 h or 1 h is used to measure the composition of stable water isotopic values of 18o 16o or 2h 1h the results obtained are defined with respect to the international protocol of vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water and specified in standard δ notation as 1 δ 18 o δ 2 h r s a m p l e r s m o w 1000 where rsample and rsmow are the stable isotopic ratios of heavy and lighter isotopes i e δ18o δ16o for oxygen 18 and δ2h δ1h for hydrogen the precision measurement is with 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h the deuterium excess d excess is calculated as 2 d e x c e s s δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o the stable water isotopic composition of differential source waters rain snow glaciermelt groundwater and river water at sampling locations is used to infer the basic changes to river flow sources governed by factors e g precipitation temperature and the admixture of re evaporated moisture and the influence of contribution derived from meltwaters the stable isotopic relationship of differential reservoirs and river flow is used to trace the potential water sources controlling the isotopic composition of a particular river stream it is important to note here that we have used precipitation data and some stream river water data from our published work lone et al 2019 lone et al 2022 global positioning system gps trimble juno 3b was used to obtain the latitude and longitude of sampling sites the space shuttle topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution https earthexplorer usgs gov was used to obtain the elevation gradient and major drainage network of the study region in the arcgis 10 7 1 environment 3 2 statistical analysis the isotopic values 18o and 2h of river stream water in response to the isotopic values of precipitation snow and rain that falls in the basin sub basin requires time to reach a particular river stream the temporal variance in isotopic values of precipitation is exhibited by river stream water the isotopic composition of stream flows at any particular period δout t comprises of past inputs lagged δin t τ based on their residence time distribution g τ 3 δ o u t 0 g τ δ i n t τ d τ where τ is the time lag gap among the input and output of the natural tracer concentration in this study only a stable isotopic tracer of precipitation and river stream water is considered thus the transfer function is represented by g τ the residence time distribution i e g τ illustrates the fractional weighting of how stable water isotopic tracer exits from the basin the sine wave considers that the mean residence time mrt of the tracer is equal to the mrt of the water in the present study we have used an exponential model that has been proved highly significant in different mountainous basins dewalle et al 1997 buttle et al 2001 mcglynn and seibert 2003 shah et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 the model parameters are defined as 4 g τ t 1 e x p τ t where t represents the residence time 5 δ 18 o x a c o s c t θ where δ18o and x are the projected and the yearly mean measured δ18o respectively a is the yearly amplitude of precipitation and stream water δ18o in c is the annual fluctuations radial frequency or 0 017214 rad d 1 t is the time and h is the phase lag the statistical model sine wave fitted to δ18o variation of water samples was employed and the mrt t of water exiting was evaluated as 6 t c 1 a z 2 a z 1 2 1 1 2 where az2 and az1 are the amplitude of δ18op and δ18or and c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuation defined in the equation the uncertainty of the model results was estimated using following equation 7 w fx a 1 w e 1 2 fx a 2 w e 2 2 fx an w en 2 where w is uncertainty a1 a2 and an refer to end members 1 2 and n respectively fx is the residence time of particular stream 3 3 seasonality in source water ratios to assess the temporal bias of source waters to regional hydrology the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and stream water were used to assess the variability in stream water ratio of precipitation falling during winter 0 c versus summer 0 c months as 8 sd p winter sd p summer δ sw δ psummer δ pannual δ psummer δ sw δ pwinter δ pannual δ pwinter where sd p is the stream discharge and precipitation in the summer and winter months indicating the temporal variance in stream flow ratio 4 results 4 1 stable water isotopic variations of river water during the observation period the stable water isotopic values of river stream water showed substantial spatial and temporal variation table 1 fig 4 and fig 5 generally the stable water isotopic values of river stream water varied from 16 9 to 9 1 and 134 to 74 with an average value of 14 5 and 102 for δ18o and δ2h respectively in each sub basin the higher δ18o and δ2h values were perceived in dras indus and tangtse sub basin table 1 fig 4 while lower δ18o and δ2h values were perceived in nubra suru and shyok sub basin respectively table 1 fig 4 the estimated isotopic elevation gradient of river stream water is 0 68 and 3 18 per 100 m change in altitude for δ18o and δ2h however at the sub basins scale the isotopic gradient was high in indus river 0 68 and 3 09 and low in dras river 0 34 and 1 89 per 100 m change in elevation for δ18o and δ2h table 2 temporally the higher δ18o and δ2h values were observed in spring may and lower values in autumn september fig 5 the overall d excess values of stream river water varied from 17 to 43 with a mean value of 26 table 1 spatially the higher d excess values were perceived in nubra suru dras shyok and tangtse than in the indus river the slope of general river water line rwl fig 6 and river water lines at sub basinal scale fig 7 have higher slope and intercept than global meteoric waterline gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric waterline lmwl of uirb lone et al 2019 4 2 residence time estimates the first isotopic value obtained at the outlet of all the sub basins in spring reflects the residence time rt of the water following the shortest flowpath however to know the rt of water moving via other flowpaths the calculation of mrt is essential the temporal variance in isotopic values of stream river water is perceived more accurately using periodic regression analyses and eq 5 the model defined by eq 5 was used to interpret the results to evaluate the residence time of water in rivers according to eq 6 the results obtained are statistically significant p 0 01 the relationship between the measured and modeled δ18o values in river water is significant with r2 0 88 0 68 0 62 0 91 0 89 and 0 81 for dras suru indus nubra shyok and tangtse rivers respectively fig 8 the results attained are similar to himalayan and outside himalayan studies mcglynn and seibert 2003 soulsby et al 2006 rodgers et al 2005 farrick and branfireun 2015 shah et al 2017 ogrinc et al 2018 cao et al 2020 4 3 empirical isotope altitude relationship in the current study we examined the δ18o elevation relationship in the uirb by using our and other published data hren et al 2009 breitenbach et al 2010 xu et al 2014 ren et al 2017 from other parts of himalayas and outside regions based on our data we derived the pronounced linear and polynomial fit second order between stable water isotopes and elevation as fig 9 9 a l t i t u d e a 27 9 δ 18 o 2 1029 2 δ 18 o 4322 r 2 0 77 p 0 005 10 δ 18 o 230 2 100 1292 r 2 0 71 p 0 0001 where a is the altitude in meters o represents the δ18o of river stream water in the present study the intercept x of the polynomial fit is about 4 9 at zero altitude 5 discussions 5 1 spatial and temporal δ18o and δ2h variability in river water generally the lower δ18o and δ2h values were exhibited at the headwater of the river stream profile and relatively higher δ18o and δ2h values were perceived at lower altitudes in each sub basin although snow and glaciermelt is a major source of river discharge across the uirb but the contrasting climatic conditions predominant in sub basins due to differential snow cover glacier cover aspect slope catchment length and mixing of differential reservoir waters leads to a significant variance in isotopic values of river stream water the lower δ18o and δ2h values observed in the dras and tangtse rivers define the well known altitude effect the sampling altitude of dras sub basin samples is lower 2500 3400 m asl than other catchments 3000 m asl a substantial relationship existed between the δ18o of river stream water and the altitude of sampled water in different sub basins table 2 besides the variability in isotopic values may also arise due to the aspect of the basin the aspect is determined with respect to part of the region exposed and sheltered from the wind it has been reported that lower δ18o and δ2h values towards leeward aspect is attributed to orographic upliftment and cooling of an airmass on windward side on a regional scale uirb is a rained shadow area but at a local scale dras and tangtse are rain shadow than other sub basins thus receiving the precipitation with heavier enriched stable isotopic composition lone et al 2022 therefore the discrete variance in an isotopic gradient of river water in sub basins implies the main role of local climatic factors and diverse topographic and hydrological settings the isotopic values of river water in each sub basin designates stable water isotopic values of water from different sources in a particular basin above the sampling location the variability in meteorological parameters precipitation source region contribution from different source waters precipitation glacier snowmelt groundwater permafrost etc catchment length physiography and other hydrological processes modifying the stable water isotopic values of river water and hence the isotopic lapse rate in each sub basin at lower altitude due to high ambient temperature the δ18o enrichment in residual water results in increasing the stable water isotopic lapse rate of river water another important reason for δ18o enrichment in river water could be due mixing of river water with baseflow it was observed that the groundwater samples collected at lower altitudes have similar stable water isotopic values to river water in each sub basin lone et al 2021b the isotope altitude gradient of river water is well within the published gradients of precipitation and stream water across the globle in table 3 we presented the altitude isotope gradient of precipitation and stream river water from different parts of the globe in the present study it was found that the isotopic gradient of river stream water is higher than precipitation from himalayas and outside himalayas yao et al 2009 peng et al 2010 windhorst et al 2013 jeelani et al 2017a liu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 florea et al 2017 pant et al 2021 hemmerle et al 2021 lone et al 2019 2021b which may arise due to the mixing of isotopic values of water from differential reservoirs pools e g rain snow glacier melt groundwater permafrost in a particular basin the significant variance in the stable isotopic values was perceived along the profile of the indus river than its tributaries fig 4 the isotopic values δ18o and or δ2h of the indus river collected between chumathang and choglomsar the upstream regions show less variance in each sampling period indicating a single water source fig 4 this less variance in the stable isotopic values also showed that the contribution from the small tributaries hardly affect the isotopic composition of the main river however the isotopic values δ18o and or δ2h abruptly decreased in the middle part of the profile near nimmu location 14 fig 4 at the confluence of the zanskar river with the indus river fig 3 specifying the water contributed by the zanskar river modifies the isotopic composition of indus river farther downstream the δ18o values showed an enrichment signifying multiple sources of water with differential stable water isotopic values the higher δ18o and δ2h values may also be ascribed to the existence of hydropower project e g nimoo bazgo 34 08 09 n latitude 77 32 47 e longitude located below the confluence point the anthropogenic storage of water to generate hydroelectricity may be altering the stable isotopic composition of water downstream with the beginning of the hydrological year the isotopic composition obtained in the river water are not as depleted in heavier isotopes as fresh snow samples in the winter indicating that the water during this period may is derived from other sources groundwater rather than meltwaters snow and glaciers due to less temperatures required for melting however with the rise in temperature the isotopic values of winter precipitation collected at an elevation of 3000 m asl is revealed in river stream water in june representing that the rivers streams not only drain the lower δ18o and δ2h values of fresh winter snow but also diminishes the effect of higher δ18o and δ2h values of rain during this period in other months e g july august and september the isotopic values observed in river stream water fig 5 are characteristics isotopic signature of snow and glacier samples collected at an altitudinal range of above 3800 m asl to 4200 m asl the lower δ18o and δ2h values were observed in october collected at an altitude of 5000 m asl represents the dominance of glaciermelt in rivers streams in this study the d excess values governed by different physiographic and hydrometeorological parameters were also determined to explore the moisture sources and evaporation effects on river stream water across uirb the average values fall within the typical d excess values of ism 10 and western disturbance 20 suggesting the mixing of water from two major wind systems the mixing of these moisture sources westerlies and ism in the western himalayas is also reported by other studies jeelani et al 2019 lone et al 2019 prathipati et al 2019 singh et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 jeelani et al 2021b mal et al 2021 ranjan et al 2021 oza et al 2022 further the low d excess values observed in the indus river than in other rivers table 1 suggest that the d excess values observed in the indus river are the weighted mean of all the source waters some of which may originate far off in the east while the other rivers receive water from local snow and glaciers 5 2 river water line rwl the δ18o and δ2h relationship of stream water can vary locally and regionally depending upon local climatic and physiographic settings the evaporated waters may deviate from global meteoric waterline gmwl and or local meteoric waterline lmwl due to low δ18o and δ2h however the condensation during sub zero temperatures particularly in winter season leads to a higher slope due to depletion in heavier isotopes 18o and or 2h the slope 8 of river stream water samples obtained in the present study reveals dominance of winter accumulated precipitation because sub zero temperature during condensation lead to depletion of heavier isotopes in source waters and thus leading to higher slope fig 6 hence the meltwater generated from winter accumulated snow and glaciermelt sustaining the annual stream river flow is least affected by evaporation along the profile resulting in a higher slope and intercept of river stream water in tibet and other high altitude himalayan basins higher slope and intercept of river water have been attributed to less transit time induced by the steep gradient of river profile navada and rao 1991 sharma et al 2017 ma et al 2017 wu et al 2022 besides the similarity in the slope and intercept of all the sub basins with lmwl of snow and glacier melt lone et al 2021b indicates that the meltwaters could be the main source of river water flow however the variability in the slopes and intercepts of rwl within the sub basin represents basin specific variability of stable isotopic values fig 7 due to complex climatological and physiographic conditions at local and regional scales it is difficult to make a simple interpretation for example in the central part of the indus river the isotopic values deviate from the gmwl compared to upper and lower parts but this cannot be attributed to the evaporation effect because of depleted isotopic values in the central part of the river fig 4 the higher δ18o and δ2h values were observed in the lower part of the indus river than in the middle and upper part but the isotopic values deviate less from the gmwl indicating the least evaporation the spatial heterogeneity in physiographical and hydrometeorological conditions e g snow cover glacier cover aspect basin area and mixing of differential waters causes spatio temporal variance in the hydrological regimes in each sub basin the large areal extent and lesser gradient of the indus river decrease the rate of water flow resulting in a long residence time thus decreasing the slope of the rwl of the indus river on the other hand the lesser area and leeward aspect of dras 1683 km2 and tangtse 1234 km2 sub basins cause enrichment in heavier isotopic values leading to lower slope and intercept of rwl than other sub basins however the huge glaciers cover higher altitude of suru 681 km2 and nubra 681 km2 sub basins releasing a surplus volume of meltwater with depleted 18o values leading to higher slope and intercept of rwl s in these sub basins 5 3 stream discharge biased to winter precipitation based upon the comparison between the weighted stable isotopic values of precipitation and stream water it was observed that stream flow in uirb is influenced by the precipitation received during winter months when the mean ambient temperature is below the sub zero 0 c than the precipitation received during summer months when the mean temperature is above the sub zero 0 c the higher and lower sd p cold sd p warm values acquired are 1 9 and 5 3 with a mean value of 3 5 besides we also observed that the isotopic values of maximum stream river water samples fig 5 is depleted in 18o values but similar to snow received during winter lone et al 2019 emphasizing the importance of winter snow in sustaining the annual stream water flow our results corroborate well with other studies mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 lone et al 2022 showing that perennial flow of streams in upper indus is dominated by meltwater generated from snow and glaciers keeping in view the above results the variability in source waters due to climate warming could disturb the temporal stream river discharge and ultimately the regional stream water flow 5 4 inferences of mean residence time in river water the depleted lighter δ18o values were observed in autumn e g october and enriched heavier values in spring e g may but the precipitation is enriched heavier in δ18o in summer and depleted lighter in winter except in august lone et al 2019 2021b the δ18o values similar to winter precipitation were observed in river water in june and july this typical relationship among the isotopic composition of precipitation and river stream water is well known in the mountainous basins where snow and glaciermelt is the main source of river stream flow the increase in temperature from late may amplifies the melting of winter snow which sustains flow of rivers during late spring and summer across uirb water from the rainfall snowmelt and glaciermelt follows distinct flow paths routes before reaching the exit point of the sub basin the major flowpaths encompass 1 the shortest flowpaths followed by water over the ground surface without entering into surface water bodies and 2 the longest flowpath via saturated and or unsaturated medium added as baseflow to the river channel in the present study the lower amplitude and comparatively weak correlation r2 0 68 and 0 62 fig 8 observed in the suru and indus rivers may be ascribed to the existence of hydropower projects the incoming water of the suru and indus rivers is stored to generate hydroelectricity which could modify the stable water isotopic composition of these rivers by storing the flowing water the modeled δ18o values for the dras shyok and nubra rivers corroborated with measured values 0 81 to 0 89 fig 8 combined with a large amplitude the substantial temporal variance in δ18o of dras shyok and nubra river reflects the better sensitivity to winter accumulated precipitation inputs the overall estimated mrt of river water varied from 188 17 to 387 38 days the longest mrt is observed for the indus 387 38 days followed by suru 325 32 days shyok 305 28 days nubra 259 22 days dras 205 20 days and tangtse 188 17 days rivers respectively in uirb we found less residence time of stream water than in other parts of the himalayas and outside regions rodgers et al 2005 shah et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 this might be explained in terms of the steep gradient of stream profile and flowpath length which not only leads to quick flushing but also least evaporation due to limit exposure to atmospheric conditions however the variance of mrt at sub basinal scale may be attributed to diverse landscape physiography which is controlled by the distinct and complex geological geomorphological and tectonic setup of each sub basin it is important to mention here that estimated mean residence time values presented in this study are average and specific to the current research period in reality high altitude mountainous basins are composed of highly complex range of internal micro watershed scale residence time distribution that is still unknown kirchner et al 2001 rodgers et al 2005 more research work is needed to assess the different groundwater and soil water reservoirs that are significantly variable at local and regional scale gonfiantini et al 1998 frederickson and criss 1999 rodgers et al 2005 these reservoirs could be assessed via high resolution spatio temporal sampling of streamwater baseflow and precipitation or using other effective tracers including chlorofluorocarbon and or tritium 5 5 paleo elevation reconstruction the paleo altitude reconstruction relies on assumptions that the stable water isotopic modification in rainfall during rayleigh distillation follows equilibrium fractionation of an orographically arising airmass rowley and garzione 2007 however the isotopic fractionation that occurs due to secondary hydrological and hydrometeorological processes e g recycling sub cloud secondary evaporation vapor mixing etc leads to uncertainties in paleo altitude reconstruction taking into consideration that the observed systemic depletion in δ18o values with increasing altitude in uirb india is mainly due to rayleigh distillation we assume that isotope based paleo altitude reconstruction is valid in this region the modern empirical theoretical δ18o elevation relationships strongly affect the paleoelevation reconstructions the linear relationship generates a δ18o altitude gradient of 1 8 km 1 similar to the gradient obtained from the tibetan plateau e g yarlung river and yellow river suggesting topographical and environmental conditions have a significant role in controlling the stable water isotopic composition of precipitation and stream water kuang et al 2019 the study also suggested that the variability in the paleo precipitation δ18o values reflects a change in the moisture source or upliftment along airmass transport pathways a comparison with different δ18o δ2h elevation relationships from surrounding areas is shown in fig 9 similar relationships have been acquired in yarlung zangbo river lancang river eastern tibet and yellow river hoke et al 2014 xu et al 2014 ren et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 kuang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 li et al 2022 our δ18o elevation relationships are close to the south eastern tibetan plateau and yellow river with a 95 confidence level the present study constructs δ18o δ2h elevation relationships over the 5200 m altitude range above the mean sea level for uirb india and surrounding regions both the relationship linear and second order polynomial can be used to calculate the altitudinal gradients if the δ18o value is known it has been observed that the polynomial relationship corroborates with the measured δ18o values than the ist order linear relation the variances between predicteda and predictedb elevation with basin mean elevation using the ist and 2nd order polynomial relationship varies from 635 to 712 m and 529 to 540 m respectively the differences in the elevation values obtained from the 2nd order polynomial relationship are smaller than the linear relationship suggesting polynomial is better than the linear relationship to imply the altitude elevation effect in the western himalayas and surrounding regions with similar climatic and environmental conditions however keeping in view the impact of secondary evaporation processes the position of the indian plate topography and the inland seaways during the cenozoic era may have significantly affected the location of arid climatic zones and hence the spatial and temporal precipitation variances roe et al 2016 these topographical and climatic variances may have caused substantial fluctuations in moisture sources recycled waters and sub cloud evaporation leading to significant deviation in the stable water isotope signatures across the himalayas and neighboring regions although these past physiographic and climatic conditions can be constrained however the variability in isotopic patterns due to rayleigh distillation processes observed in the himalayas and outside himalayas ascertains significant uncertainty in paleo altitude reconstruction therefore the development of new proxies to reconstruct paleo altitude based on other topographic and environmental parameters e g temperature and pressure is highly significant in addition the proper characterization of stable water isotope observations in differential source water within the general circulation models gcm is essential to assimilate the mathematical simulation efforts with stable isotope based paleo altitude reconstructions 6 conclusion in this study we measured the isotopic values δ18o and δ2h of stream river water to evaluate the spatio temporal variances and mrt of river stream water in a cold arid environment of uirb india a substantial spatio temporal variation in isotopic values of stream river water is exhibited at the catchment sub basin scale the slope and intercept of the river water line rwl are higher than lmwl and gmwl of precipitation reflecting the dominance of other source waters snow and glaciermelt in controlling the regional hydrology the wide variance in isotopic values appears due to heterogeneity in physiographical and hydrometeorological conditions persisting within the sub basins leading to variable slope and intercept of rwl the seasonality in discharge ratios revealed that streamflow is dominated by winter precipitation than summer precipitation based on the sine wave approach the residence time of stream river water ranged from 188 17 to 387 38 days with the longest and shortest mean residence observed in indus 387 38 days and tangtse 188 17 days river sub basins the stream water samples exhibited a substantial polynomial fit of 4 9 at zero altitude suggesting the variability in the paleo precipitation δ18o may be due to change in the moisture source and or moisture pathway the results are highly significant to improve the knowledge and understanding of present hydrological regimes governing the hydrological cycle of the western himalayas and demonstrates the applicability of stable water isotope tracers to understand the

2121,the meltwater generated from the himalayan mountain system is an important source of freshwater sustaining hydrological ecological and biological activities in upstream and downstream regions under a warming climate the cryospheric cover is shrinking altering the availability of freshwater to 53 million people living in the upper and lower parts of the himalayas therefore it becomes essential to understand the hydrological processes and regimes influencing the regional hydrological cycle for proper water resource management and ecosystem restoration policies in this study we measured the patterns of isotopic values δ18o and δ2h of river streamwater to assess the factors controlling its spatio temporal variability and mean residence time in glacierized mountainous upper indus river basin india to better understand the significant hydrological processes and controls the isotopic values of stream river water exhibited significant spatio temporal variance ascribed to changing physiographic hydrometeorological and climatic factors persisting at the local and regional scales the slope and intercept of the river water line δ2h 8 3 0 2 δ18o 15 3 9 p 0 001 is higher than global meteoric water line and local meteoric water line of the uirb india the seasonality in source water ratios suggested that stream water is more biased to winter precipitation the estimated mean residence time in six sub basins ranged from 188 17 to 387 38 days with the longest and shortest mean residence time observed in indus 387 38 days and tangtse 188 17 days sub basins the polynomial second order relationship suggests that the variability in the paleo precipitation δ18o values reflect a change in the moisture source and or upliftment along airmass transport pathways our study highlighted the significance of physiographical and hydrometeorological processes in controlling the spatio temporal variance of stable isotopic composition of river stream water bodies the

et al 2012 bintanja and selten 2014 atmospheric temperature in high altitude snow and glacier dominant regions is one of the vital control for cryogenic processes playing a significant role in energy and water balance regimes woo et al 2008 wild 2009 therefore the magnitude of perennial streamflow in these high altitude regions is more sensitive to negative impact of climatic variations nijssen et

become prerequisite for ecosystem restoration and water resource management policies in the last 20 30 years the environmental tracers δ18o and δ2h have been widely used to observe the hydrological

differential source waters in high altitude mountainous basins the estimated mean residence time not only reflects the flowpaths and storage but also acts as a critical indicator of water quality as hydrological geochemical and biogeochemical reactions are influenced by time therefore assessing the hydrological hydrometeorological processes and estimating the mrt valuable information about hydro chemical systems and recent climatic changes could be ascertained in high altitude glacierized basins soulsby et al 2006 tetzlaff et al 2014 bershaw et al 2020 penna et al 2014 wu et al 2019 gao et al

topography climate in the himalayas and also the critical importance of runoff to maintain the social and agro economic stability of the region the study of complex hydrological and hydrometeorological processes controlling spatio temporal pattern of river stream water is still not available in detail despite the rugged topography and complexities in sample collection at higher altitudes a high resolution data collection and analysis was carried out to address this research gap the main focus of this study is 1 to assess the spatio temporal variances of stable isotopic composition of stream river water ii to estimate the mean residence time mrt and establish empirical isotope altitude relationship for river water the study is aimed to improve the knowledge of how spatial and temporal hydrological processes are controlling the stable water isotopic composition and mrt of river water the study will also provide better insights into the hydraulic linkage of differential water reservoirs in high altitude glacierized basins that would possibly help us to manage the water resources in the region 2 study area the transboundary indus river basin irb is one of the most important system of rivers and tributaries in asia it shares its boundary with parts of india 39 pakistan 47 china 8 and afghanistan 6 with a total areal extent of 833 788 km2 in india the indus river basin irb extends over the northern states and union territories including punjab haryana himachal pradesh rajasthan jammu and kashmir ladakh and chandigarh in ladakh india the upper indus river basin uirb is located between the coordinates of 33 n to 35 n latitude and 76 e to 79 e longitude fig 1 occupying an area of 59 146 km2 the uirb india consists of seven sub basins including dras suru zanskar indus nubra shyok and tangtse with differential areal and glacier cover the climate of the study area is controlled by two major weather systems western disturbances wds and indian summer monsoons ism gadgil 2003 dimri et al 2015 lone et al 2019 the study area is categorized as bw as per the köppen classification system and experiences cold arid to semi arid climatic conditions with maximum precipitation received during winter and early spring lone et al 2019 the region is categorized into four season including spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february the warmest 6 months march october are conquered by clear weather and high incoming solar radiations the less relative humidity rh throughout the year results in variability in ambient temperatures based on the last 11 year climate data acquired from leh weather station latitude 34 08 09 n longitude 77 32 47 e and altitude 3416 m asl the maximum precipitation and temperature is recorded in march 146 mm and august 4 5 c and minimum precipitation and temperature is recorded in august 31 mm and january 23 c fig 2 the high altitudes of uirb are conquered by seasonal snow and permanent glacier fields in uirb the water derived from the snow accumulated in the winter and early spring seasons is a major contributor sustaining the perennial flow and groundwater recharge with least inputs from rain lone et al 2022 the topographic altitude is highly variable throughout the basin which results in variable microclimatic conditions at sub basinal scale this variability in the complex topographic and climatic conditions at the sub basinal scale favors small sized and high elevation glaciers at present 1800 glaciers have been mapped in uirb occupying an area of 997 km2 therefore the discharge of the most important streams of the indus river originating in the ladakh himalayas is significantly controlled by the nectar released from snow and glacier cover with a notable influence from snowfall taking place at higher altitudes in summer it has been reported that 70 of groundwater recharge and stream water flow in uirb is supplied by snow and glacier melt lone et al 2021b 2022 any change in precipitation amount form and glacier extent will negatively impact the regional hydrology 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling and analysis the samples were collected from the dras suru indus shyok nubra and tangtse main channels and their tributaries across the study area for stable isotopic δ18o and δ2h analysis fig 3 the water samples were collected at different altitudes along the profile of these rivers the samples were collected monthly from 2017 to 2019 water sample collection was done in 10 ml high density polyethylene bottles hdpe which were rinsed twice before sample collection and were sealed and numbered at the spot to avoid secondary evaporation fig 3 the water samples were collected at 10 15 cm depth below the water surface and were kept at a temperature of 4⁰c before analysis for oxygen and hydrogen isotope 18o and 2h analysis the samples were sent to geosciences division physical research laboratory prl ahmedabad india the isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms delta v plus thermo scientific is used to measure oxygen and hydrogen ratios in continuous flow mode in a continuous flow mode the gas obtained from the equilibration of water 300 μl with carbon dioxide co2 or h2 for 16 h or 1 h is used to measure the composition of stable water isotopic values of 18o 16o or 2h 1h the results obtained are defined with respect to the international protocol of vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water and specified in standard δ notation as 1 δ 18 o δ 2 h r s a m p l e r s m o w 1000 where rsample and rsmow are the stable isotopic ratios of heavy and lighter isotopes i e δ18o δ16o for oxygen 18 and δ2h δ1h for hydrogen the precision measurement is with 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h the deuterium excess d excess is calculated as 2 d e x c e s s δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o the stable water isotopic composition of differential source waters rain snow glaciermelt groundwater and river water at sampling locations is used to infer the basic changes to river flow sources governed by factors e g precipitation temperature and the admixture of re evaporated moisture and the influence of contribution derived from meltwaters the stable isotopic relationship of differential reservoirs and river flow is used to trace the potential water sources controlling the isotopic composition of a particular river stream it is important to note here that we have used precipitation data and some stream river water data from our published work lone et al 2019 lone et al 2022 global positioning system gps trimble juno 3b was used to obtain the latitude and longitude of sampling sites the space shuttle topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution https earthexplorer usgs gov was used to obtain the elevation gradient and major drainage network of the study region in the arcgis 10 7 1 environment 3 2 statistical analysis the isotopic values 18o and 2h of river stream water in response to the isotopic values of precipitation snow and rain that falls in the basin sub basin requires time to reach a particular river stream the temporal variance in isotopic values of precipitation is exhibited by river stream water the isotopic composition of stream flows at any particular period δout t comprises of past inputs lagged δin t τ based on their residence time distribution g τ 3 δ o u t 0 g τ δ i n t τ d τ where τ is the time lag gap among the input and output of the natural tracer concentration in this study only a stable isotopic tracer of precipitation and river stream water is considered thus the transfer function is represented by g τ the residence time distribution i e g τ illustrates the fractional weighting of how stable water isotopic tracer exits from the basin the sine wave considers that the mean residence time mrt of the tracer is equal to the mrt of the water in the present study we have used an exponential model that has been proved highly significant in different mountainous basins dewalle et al 1997 buttle et al 2001 mcglynn and seibert 2003 shah et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 the model parameters are defined as 4 g τ t 1 e x p τ t where t represents the residence time 5 δ 18 o x a c o s c t θ where δ18o and x are the projected and the yearly mean measured δ18o respectively a is the yearly amplitude of precipitation and stream water δ18o in c is the annual fluctuations radial frequency or 0 017214 rad d 1 t is the time and h is the phase lag the statistical model sine wave fitted to δ18o variation of water samples was employed and the mrt t of water exiting was evaluated as 6 t c 1 a z 2 a z 1 2 1 1 2 where az2 and az1 are the amplitude of δ18op and δ18or and c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuation defined in the equation the uncertainty of the model results was estimated using following equation 7 w fx a 1 w e 1 2 fx a 2 w e 2 2 fx an w en 2 where w is uncertainty a1 a2 and an refer to end members 1 2 and n respectively fx is the residence time of particular stream 3 3 seasonality in source water ratios to assess the temporal bias of source waters to regional hydrology the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and stream water were used to assess the variability in stream water ratio of precipitation falling during winter 0 c versus summer 0 c months as 8 sd p winter sd p summer δ sw δ psummer δ pannual δ psummer δ sw δ pwinter δ pannual δ pwinter where sd p is the stream discharge and precipitation in the summer and winter months indicating the temporal variance in stream flow ratio 4 results 4 1 stable water isotopic variations of river water during the observation period the stable water isotopic values of river stream water showed substantial spatial and temporal variation table 1 fig 4 and fig 5 generally the stable water isotopic values of river stream water varied from 16 9 to 9 1 and 134 to 74 with an average value of 14 5 and 102 for δ18o and δ2h respectively in each sub basin the higher δ18o and δ2h values were perceived in dras indus and tangtse sub basin table 1 fig 4 while lower δ18o and δ2h values were perceived in nubra suru and shyok sub basin respectively table 1 fig 4 the estimated isotopic elevation gradient of river stream water is 0 68 and 3 18 per 100 m change in altitude for δ18o and δ2h however at the sub basins scale the isotopic gradient was high in indus river 0 68 and 3 09 and low in dras river 0 34 and 1 89 per 100 m change in elevation for δ18o and δ2h table 2 temporally the higher δ18o and δ2h values were observed in spring may and lower values in autumn september fig 5 the overall d excess values of stream river water varied from 17 to 43 with a mean value of 26 table 1 spatially the higher d excess values were perceived in nubra suru dras shyok and tangtse than in the indus river the slope of general river water line rwl fig 6 and river water lines at sub basinal scale fig 7 have higher slope and intercept than global meteoric waterline gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric waterline lmwl of uirb lone et al 2019 4 2 residence time estimates the first isotopic value obtained at the outlet of all the sub basins in spring reflects the residence time rt of the water following the shortest flowpath however to know the rt of water moving via other flowpaths the calculation of mrt is essential the temporal variance in isotopic values of stream river water is perceived more accurately using periodic regression analyses and eq 5 the model defined by eq 5 was used to interpret the results to evaluate the residence time of water in rivers according to eq 6 the results obtained are statistically significant p 0 01 the relationship between the measured and modeled δ18o values in river water is significant with r2 0 88 0 68 0 62 0 91 0 89 and 0 81 for dras suru indus nubra shyok and tangtse rivers respectively fig 8 the results attained are similar to himalayan and outside himalayan studies mcglynn and seibert 2003 soulsby et al 2006 rodgers et al 2005 farrick and branfireun 2015 shah et al 2017 ogrinc et al 2018 cao et al 2020 4 3 empirical isotope altitude relationship in the current study we examined the δ18o elevation relationship in the uirb by using our and other published data hren et al 2009 breitenbach et al 2010 xu et al 2014 ren et al 2017 from other parts of himalayas and outside regions based on our data we derived the pronounced linear and polynomial fit second order between stable water isotopes and elevation as fig 9 9 a l t i t u d e a 27 9 δ 18 o 2 1029 2 δ 18 o 4322 r 2 0 77 p 0 005 10 δ 18 o 230 2 100 1292 r 2 0 71 p 0 0001 where a is the altitude in meters o represents the δ18o of river stream water in the present study the intercept x of the polynomial fit is about 4 9 at zero altitude 5 discussions 5 1 spatial and temporal δ18o and δ2h variability in river water generally the lower δ18o and δ2h values were exhibited at the headwater of the river stream profile and relatively higher δ18o and δ2h values were perceived at lower altitudes in each sub basin although snow and glaciermelt is a major source of river discharge across the uirb but the contrasting climatic conditions predominant in sub basins due to differential snow cover glacier cover aspect slope catchment length and mixing of differential reservoir waters leads to a significant variance in isotopic values of river stream water the lower δ18o and δ2h values observed in the dras and tangtse rivers define the well known altitude effect the sampling altitude of dras sub basin samples is lower 2500 3400 m asl than other catchments 3000 m asl a substantial relationship existed between the δ18o of river stream water and the altitude of sampled water in different sub basins table 2 besides the variability in isotopic values may also arise due to the aspect of the basin the aspect is determined with respect to part of the region exposed and sheltered from the wind it has been reported that lower δ18o and δ2h values towards leeward aspect is attributed to orographic upliftment and cooling of an airmass on windward side on a regional scale uirb is a rained shadow area but at a local scale dras and tangtse are rain shadow than other sub basins thus receiving the precipitation with heavier enriched stable isotopic composition lone et al 2022 therefore the discrete variance in an isotopic gradient of river water in sub basins implies the main role of local climatic factors and diverse topographic and hydrological settings the isotopic values of river water in each sub basin designates stable water isotopic values of water from different sources in a particular basin above the sampling location the variability in meteorological parameters precipitation source region contribution from different source waters precipitation glacier snowmelt groundwater permafrost etc catchment length physiography and other hydrological processes modifying the stable water isotopic values of river water and hence the isotopic lapse rate in each sub basin at lower altitude due to high ambient temperature the δ18o enrichment in residual water results in increasing the stable water isotopic lapse rate of river water another important reason for δ18o enrichment in river water could be due mixing of river water with baseflow it was observed that the groundwater samples collected at lower altitudes have similar stable water isotopic values to river water in each sub basin lone et al 2021b the isotope altitude gradient of river water is well within the published gradients of precipitation and stream water across the globle in table 3 we presented the altitude isotope gradient of precipitation and stream river water from different parts of the globe in the present study it was found that the isotopic gradient of river stream water is higher than precipitation from himalayas and outside himalayas yao et al 2009 peng et al 2010 windhorst et al 2013 jeelani et al 2017a liu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 florea et al 2017 pant et al 2021 hemmerle et al 2021 lone et al 2019 2021b which may arise due to the mixing of isotopic values of water from differential reservoirs pools e g rain snow glacier melt groundwater permafrost in a particular basin the significant variance in the stable isotopic values was perceived along the profile of the indus river than its tributaries fig 4 the isotopic values δ18o and or δ2h of the indus river collected between chumathang and choglomsar the upstream regions show less variance in each sampling period indicating a single water source fig 4 this less variance in the stable isotopic values also showed that the contribution from the small tributaries hardly affect the isotopic composition of the main river however the isotopic values δ18o and or δ2h abruptly decreased in the middle part of the profile near nimmu location 14 fig 4 at the confluence of the zanskar river with the indus river fig 3 specifying the water contributed by the zanskar river modifies the isotopic composition of indus river farther downstream the δ18o values showed an enrichment signifying multiple sources of water with differential stable water isotopic values the higher δ18o and δ2h values may also be ascribed to the existence of hydropower project e g nimoo bazgo 34 08 09 n latitude 77 32 47 e longitude located below the confluence point the anthropogenic storage of water to generate hydroelectricity may be altering the stable isotopic composition of water downstream with the beginning of the hydrological year the isotopic composition obtained in the river water are not as depleted in heavier isotopes as fresh snow samples in the winter indicating that the water during this period may is derived from other sources groundwater rather than meltwaters snow and glaciers due to less temperatures required for melting however with the rise in temperature the isotopic values of winter precipitation collected at an elevation of 3000 m asl is revealed in river stream water in june representing that the rivers streams not only drain the lower δ18o and δ2h values of fresh winter snow but also diminishes the effect of higher δ18o and δ2h values of rain during this period in other months e g july august and september the isotopic values observed in river stream water fig 5 are characteristics isotopic signature of snow and glacier samples collected at an altitudinal range of above 3800 m asl to 4200 m asl the lower δ18o and δ2h values were observed in october collected at an altitude of 5000 m asl represents the dominance of glaciermelt in rivers streams in this study the d excess values governed by different physiographic and hydrometeorological parameters were also determined to explore the moisture sources and evaporation effects on river stream water across uirb the average values fall within the typical d excess values of ism 10 and western disturbance 20 suggesting the mixing of water from two major wind systems the mixing of these moisture sources westerlies and ism in the western himalayas is also reported by other studies jeelani et al 2019 lone et al 2019 prathipati et al 2019 singh et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 jeelani et al 2021b mal et al 2021 ranjan et al 2021 oza et al 2022 further the low d excess values observed in the indus river than in other rivers table 1 suggest that the d excess values observed in the indus river are the weighted mean of all the source waters some of which may originate far off in the east while the other rivers receive water from local snow and glaciers 5 2 river water line rwl the δ18o and δ2h relationship of stream water can vary locally and regionally depending upon local climatic and physiographic settings the evaporated waters may deviate from global meteoric waterline gmwl and or local meteoric waterline lmwl due to low δ18o and δ2h however the condensation during sub zero temperatures particularly in winter season leads to a higher slope due to depletion in heavier isotopes 18o and or 2h the slope 8 of river stream water samples obtained in the present study reveals dominance of winter accumulated precipitation because sub zero temperature during condensation lead to depletion of heavier isotopes in source waters and thus leading to higher slope fig 6 hence the meltwater generated from winter accumulated snow and glaciermelt sustaining the annual stream river flow is least affected by evaporation along the profile resulting in a higher slope and intercept of river stream water in tibet and other high altitude himalayan basins higher slope and intercept of river water have been attributed to less transit time induced by the steep gradient of river profile navada and rao 1991 sharma et al 2017 ma et al 2017 wu et al 2022 besides the similarity in the slope and intercept of all the sub basins with lmwl of snow and glacier melt lone et al 2021b indicates that the meltwaters could be the main source of river water flow however the variability in the slopes and intercepts of rwl within the sub basin represents basin specific variability of stable isotopic values fig 7 due to complex climatological and physiographic conditions at local and regional scales it is difficult to make a simple interpretation for example in the central part of the indus river the isotopic values deviate from the gmwl compared to upper and lower parts but this cannot be attributed to the evaporation effect because of depleted isotopic values in the central part of the river fig 4 the higher δ18o and δ2h values were observed in the lower part of the indus river than in the middle and upper part but the isotopic values deviate less from the gmwl indicating the least evaporation the spatial heterogeneity in physiographical and hydrometeorological conditions e g snow cover glacier cover aspect basin area and mixing of differential waters causes spatio temporal variance in the hydrological regimes in each sub basin the large areal extent and lesser gradient of the indus river decrease the rate of water flow resulting in a long residence time thus decreasing the slope of the rwl of the indus river on the other hand the lesser area and leeward aspect of dras 1683 km2 and tangtse 1234 km2 sub basins cause enrichment in heavier isotopic values leading to lower slope and intercept of rwl than other sub basins however the huge glaciers cover higher altitude of suru 681 km2 and nubra 681 km2 sub basins releasing a surplus volume of meltwater with depleted 18o values leading to higher slope and intercept of rwl s in these sub basins 5 3 stream discharge biased to winter precipitation based upon the comparison between the weighted stable isotopic values of precipitation and stream water it was observed that stream flow in uirb is influenced by the precipitation received during winter months when the mean ambient temperature is below the sub zero 0 c than the precipitation received during summer months when the mean temperature is above the sub zero 0 c the higher and lower sd p cold sd p warm values acquired are 1 9 and 5 3 with a mean value of 3 5 besides we also observed that the isotopic values of maximum stream river water samples fig 5 is depleted in 18o values but similar to snow received during winter lone et al 2019 emphasizing the importance of winter snow in sustaining the annual stream water flow our results corroborate well with other studies mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 lone et al 2022 showing that perennial flow of streams in upper indus is dominated by meltwater generated from snow and glaciers keeping in view the above results the variability in source waters due to climate warming could disturb the temporal stream river discharge and ultimately the regional stream water flow 5 4 inferences of mean residence time in river water the depleted lighter δ18o values were observed in autumn e g october and enriched heavier values in spring e g may but the precipitation is enriched heavier in δ18o in summer and depleted lighter in winter except in august lone et al 2019 2021b the δ18o values similar to winter precipitation were observed in river water in june and july this typical relationship among the isotopic composition of precipitation and river stream water is well known in the mountainous basins where snow and glaciermelt is the main source of river stream flow the increase in temperature from late may amplifies the melting of winter snow which sustains flow of rivers during late spring and summer across uirb water from the rainfall snowmelt and glaciermelt follows distinct flow paths routes before reaching the exit point of the sub basin the major flowpaths encompass 1 the shortest flowpaths followed by water over the ground surface without entering into surface water bodies and 2 the longest flowpath via saturated and or unsaturated medium added as baseflow to the river channel in the present study the lower amplitude and comparatively weak correlation r2 0 68 and 0 62 fig 8 observed in the suru and indus rivers may be ascribed to the existence of hydropower projects the incoming water of the suru and indus rivers is stored to generate hydroelectricity which could modify the stable water isotopic composition of these rivers by storing the flowing water the modeled δ18o values for the dras shyok and nubra rivers corroborated with measured values 0 81 to 0 89 fig 8 combined with a large amplitude the substantial temporal variance in δ18o of dras shyok and nubra river reflects the better sensitivity to winter accumulated precipitation inputs the overall estimated mrt of river water varied from 188 17 to 387 38 days the longest mrt is observed for the indus 387 38 days followed by suru 325 32 days shyok 305 28 days nubra 259 22 days dras 205 20 days and tangtse 188 17 days rivers respectively in uirb we found less residence time of stream water than in other parts of the himalayas and outside regions rodgers et al 2005 shah et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 this might be explained in terms of the steep gradient of stream profile and flowpath length which not only leads to quick flushing but also least evaporation due to limit exposure to atmospheric conditions however the variance of mrt at sub basinal scale may be attributed to diverse landscape physiography which is controlled by the distinct and complex geological geomorphological and tectonic setup of each sub basin it is important to mention here that estimated mean residence time values presented in this study are average and specific to the current research period in reality high altitude mountainous basins are composed of highly complex range of internal micro watershed scale residence time distribution that is still unknown kirchner et al 2001 rodgers et al 2005 more research work is needed to assess the different groundwater and soil water reservoirs that are significantly variable at local and regional scale gonfiantini et al 1998 frederickson and criss 1999 rodgers et al 2005 these reservoirs could be assessed via high resolution spatio temporal sampling of streamwater baseflow and precipitation or using other effective tracers including chlorofluorocarbon and or tritium 5 5 paleo elevation reconstruction the paleo altitude reconstruction relies on assumptions that the stable water isotopic modification in rainfall during rayleigh distillation follows equilibrium fractionation of an orographically arising airmass rowley and garzione 2007 however the isotopic fractionation that occurs due to secondary hydrological and hydrometeorological processes e g recycling sub cloud secondary evaporation vapor mixing etc leads to uncertainties in paleo altitude reconstruction taking into consideration that the observed systemic depletion in δ18o values with increasing altitude in uirb india is mainly due to rayleigh distillation we assume that isotope based paleo altitude reconstruction is valid in this region the modern empirical theoretical δ18o elevation relationships strongly affect the paleoelevation reconstructions the linear relationship generates a δ18o altitude gradient of 1 8 km 1 similar to the gradient obtained from the tibetan plateau e g yarlung river and yellow river suggesting topographical and environmental conditions have a significant role in controlling the stable water isotopic composition of precipitation and stream water kuang et al 2019 the study also suggested that the variability in the paleo precipitation δ18o values reflects a change in the moisture source or upliftment along airmass transport pathways a comparison with different δ18o δ2h elevation relationships from surrounding areas is shown in fig 9 similar relationships have been acquired in yarlung zangbo river lancang river eastern tibet and yellow river hoke et al 2014 xu et al 2014 ren et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 kuang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 li et al 2022 our δ18o elevation relationships are close to the south eastern tibetan plateau and yellow river with a 95 confidence level the present study constructs δ18o δ2h elevation relationships over the 5200 m altitude range above the mean sea level for uirb india and surrounding regions both the relationship linear and second order polynomial can be used to calculate the altitudinal gradients if the δ18o value is known it has been observed that the polynomial relationship corroborates with the measured δ18o values than the ist order linear relation the variances between predicteda and predictedb elevation with basin mean elevation using the ist and 2nd order polynomial relationship varies from 635 to 712 m and 529 to 540 m respectively the differences in the elevation values obtained from the 2nd order polynomial relationship are smaller than the linear relationship suggesting polynomial is better than the linear relationship to imply the altitude elevation effect in the western himalayas and surrounding regions with similar climatic and environmental conditions however keeping in view the impact of secondary evaporation processes the position of the indian plate topography and the inland seaways during the cenozoic era may have significantly affected the location of arid climatic zones and hence the spatial and temporal precipitation variances roe et al 2016 these topographical and climatic variances may have caused substantial fluctuations in moisture sources recycled waters and sub cloud evaporation leading to significant deviation in the stable water isotope signatures across the himalayas and neighboring regions although these past physiographic and climatic conditions can be constrained however the variability in isotopic patterns due to rayleigh distillation processes observed in the himalayas and outside himalayas ascertains significant uncertainty in paleo altitude reconstruction therefore the development of new proxies to reconstruct paleo altitude based on other topographic and environmental parameters e g temperature and pressure is highly significant in addition the proper characterization of stable water isotope observations in differential source water within the general circulation models gcm is essential to assimilate the mathematical simulation efforts with stable isotope based paleo altitude reconstructions 6 conclusion in this study we measured the isotopic values δ18o and δ2h of stream river water to evaluate the spatio temporal variances and mrt of river stream water in a cold arid environment of uirb india a substantial spatio temporal variation in isotopic values of stream river water is exhibited at the catchment sub basin scale the slope and intercept of the river water line rwl are higher than lmwl and gmwl of precipitation reflecting the dominance of other source waters snow and glaciermelt in controlling the regional hydrology the wide variance in isotopic values appears due to heterogeneity in physiographical and hydrometeorological conditions persisting within the sub basins leading to variable slope and intercept of rwl the seasonality in discharge ratios revealed that streamflow is dominated by winter precipitation than summer precipitation based on the sine wave approach the residence time of stream river water ranged from 188 17 to 387 38 days with the longest and shortest mean residence observed in indus 387 38 days and tangtse 188 17 days river sub basins the stream water samples exhibited a substantial polynomial fit of 4 9 at zero altitude suggesting the variability in the paleo precipitation δ18o may be due to change in the moisture source and or moisture pathway the results are highly significant to improve the knowledge and understanding of present hydrological regimes governing the hydrological cycle of the western himalayas and demonstrates the applicability of stable water isotope tracers to understand the

2122,within the western united states increasingly severe and frequent wildfires may alter the magnitude timing and quality of water exported from burned areas by streams post fire hydrologic studies often focus on peak stream flow responses to shifts in runoff generation or on annual streamflow yield response to changes in evapotranspiration following fire however the magnitude and duration of wildfire effects on groundwater recharge changes in subsurface routing and consequences for stream low flows sourced predominately by baseflow are poorly understood here we demonstrate an approach using the amplitude and phase of paired annual air and stream water temperature signals to broadly identify changes in watershed subsurface flow contributions after fire watersheds were classified using pre fire temperature data as having air coupled i e reduced apparent groundwater signature deep groundwater or shallow groundwater stream temperature signals changes in pre and post fire paired air and stream water temperature metrics were compared for locations n 17 spanning a large range of physiographic and climatic conditions across the western united states pre and post fire comparisons were computed by quantile using bootstrapped confidence intervals ci 95 as well as in aggregate using kruskal wallis and post hoc dunn tests statistical comparisons of pre and post fire temperature metrics suggest that overall watersheds classified as having minimal groundwater influence are the most likely to experience fire induced subsurface hydrologic change more specifically watersheds classified as having air coupled or shallow groundwater signals experienced increases in the magnitude of groundwater discharge with more stable annual thermal regimes post fire that are less coupled to ambient air temperature these findings form the basis of a conceptual framework for watershed resistance to subsurface hydrologic change following fire that can be broadly applied as a first approximation for water management impacts on aquatic habitat and post wildfire response planning data availability all data used in this work is publicly available and links can be found in the data availability statement 1 introduction forested watersheds are primary suppliers of water for human consumption in many parts of the world including the western united states where climate related impacts threaten regional water availability e g overpeck and udall 2010 lund et al 2018 ault 2020 wildfire can cause abrupt and prolonged shifts in the magnitude timing and quality of water exported from burned areas kinoshita and hogue 2015 hallema et al 2018a b goeking and tarboton 2020 williams et al 2022 with high downstream demands for water spread across multiple sectors evaluation of hydrologic change following fire is critical for strategic water management e g coop et al 2020 regional warming and projected increases in fire severity extent and frequency in the western united states westerling et al 2006 williams et al 2022 further elevate the need for post fire hydrologic research to inform sound decision making post fire hydrologic studies have generally focused on assessing peak flow extremes in response to short term enhanced hydrophobicity and reduced hydraulic conductivity of surface soils shakesby and doerr 2006 ebel et al 2012 moody et al 2013 wine and cadol 2016 and annual streamflow yield response to changes in evapotranspiration following fire hallema et al 2018a b goeking and tarboton 2020 saxe et al 2018 collar et al 2022 yet there is growing recognition that post fire changes in subsurface routing of flow and groundwater recharge may be substantial in some settings bart and tague 2017 beyene et al 2021 impacting stream baseflow fractions and potentially altering the timing temperature and chemical composition of water delivered from fire affected watersheds e g murphy et al 2018 post fire changes in stream temperature have been repeatedly demonstrated to threaten aquatic organism habitat dunham et al 2007 isaak et al 2010 rhoades et al 2011 beyene et al 2022 while elevated sediment loads nutrients dissolved organic compounds and metals can threaten drinking water supplies e g murphy et al 2015 rhoades et al 2019 paul et al 2022 disparate responses to fire have been reported in post fire low flows when streamflow is sourced predominantly from groundwater discharge e g goeking and tarboton 2020 beyene et al 2021 decreases in baseflow recession rates bart and tague 2017 and increases in soil moisture ebel 2013a cardenas and kanarek 2014 suggests that groundwater recharge and shallow subsurface flow may increase following fire a recent western conus wide study found increases in post fire low flows for some watersheds as well as watersheds that experienced no change or decreases in low flows following disturbance beyene et al 2021 increases in post fire low flows have often been attributed to reduced transpiration resulting from vegetation mortality kinoshita and hogue 2011 kinoshita and hogue 2015 collar et al 2022 with modeling studies having demonstrated linkages between reduced evapotranspiration increased soil moisture and enhanced groundwater recharge ebel 2013b atchley et al 2018 maina and siirila woodburn 2020 yet predicting the impact of wildfire on groundwater discharge to streams remains difficult as post fire hydrologic responses show substantial spatiotemporal variation due to heterogeneities in underlying physical watershed conditions fire extent and severity vegetation recovery and precipitation event sequencing bart 2016 bart and tague 2017 burned watersheds often lack multi year pre fire stream observations presenting challenges for linking pre fire watershed attributes with the spatiotemporal consequences of wildfire on streamflow e g beyene et al 2021 consequently studies conducted at larger scales are often limited to areas of existing data collection networks that happen to burn e g streamgauges and to remotely sensed or modeled observations of key variables such as burn severity estimated evapotranspiration vegetation mortality and recovery temperature and precipitation e g collar et al 2022 williams et al 2022 however stream water temperature is a simple affordable and common water quality metric collected for a wide range of historical and ongoing watershed research and management goals increasing the chances of capturing pre to post fire stream change if used as an in situ data type heat has been widely adopted as a tracer in hydrologic systems anderson 2005 kurylyk et al 2019 with numerous studies leveraging temperature differences between groundwater and surface water to locate areas of groundwater discharge to streams using varied methodology e g dugdale et al 2015 constantz 2008 johnson et al 2017 hare et al 2015 over much of the year stream temperature signals may be well coupled to air temperature signals mohseni and stefan 1999 but discharge of groundwater followed by in stream mixing disrupts that coupling e g johnson et al 2020 hare et al 2021 when combined with local air temperature observations as a surrogate for total stream thermal forcing stream temperature records have proven useful for estimating the magnitude and source depth of groundwater contributions to streams at scales ranging from hillslope springs vesper et al 2022 to a single watershed to the entire conus kelleher et al 2012 snyder et al 2015 briggs et al 2018 johnson et al 2020 hare et al 2021 stream temperature data also represent an aggregated upstream response integrating hydrologic processes over larger areas than small plots or hillslopes and thus generally provide information at scales that are less confounded by small scale variability however paired air and stream water temperature observations have yet to be adopted for studying post fire hydrologic response and may provide alternate or complementary datasets for studying the impact of wildfire on groundwater resources here we demonstrate a unique application of paired air water temperature analysis for investigating potential changes in watershed subsurface flow contributions following fire for locations spanning a large range of physiographic and climatic conditions across the western united states existing literature notes a general paucity of streams with both pre and post fire streamflow data e g hallema et al 2018a b collar et al 2022 williams et al 2022 but by harnessing existing stream temperature records collected for a variety of purposes we identified 17 sites where potential shifts in stream baseflow sources could be evaluated specifically paired air and stream water temperature methods based on annual temperature signals as described in detail by briggs et al 2018 are used to broadly classify relative groundwater contributions and source depths to streamflow results are then used to identify watersheds and watershed characteristics including air water temperature metrics that may be most or least tolerant to subsurface hydrologic change based on dominant pre fire streamwater sources 2 methods 2 1 watershed selection criteria and data sources water temperature records from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system nwis usgs 2022 and norwest isaak et al 2017 for sites located within the western continental united states conus were selected for analysis if they had no data gaps greater than 30 days based on the criteria of johnson et al 2021 and had 10 or more contiguous years of water temperature observations contributing watersheds were delineated for sites that met these criteria using the usgs streamstats application programming interface ries et al 2008 delineated watersheds were subsequently compared to burned area polygons from the monitoring trends in burn severity dataset https www mtbs gov from 1989 to 2019 to determine sites whose watersheds had been affected by fire only fires classified by mtbs as wildfires were considered if greater than 10 of a delineated watershed had burned and 5 years of pre and post fire water temperature data existed 10 year time series sites were selected as candidates for analysis a number of studies have shown or used as a selection criterion a burned watershed threshold of approximately 20 for annual watershed yield wine and cadol 2016 wine et al 2018 hallema et al 2018a b saxe et al 2018 however those thresholds are for total watershed yield not groundwater or subsurface streamflow generation specifically therefore we selected a more conservative burned area threshold of 10 in case groundwater or subsurface streamflow generation is more sensitive to burned than total annual watershed yield watershed candidates were used in the final analysis if no additional fires burned more than 3 of the watershed during the pre or post fire analysis period and if the stream temperature monitoring sites had no upstream regulation from dams or diversions multi burn criteria were selected in accordance with previous study criteria e g beyene et al 2021 and was considered conservative when compared to burned thresholds previously shown to impact total watershed yield e g wine and cadol 2016 hallema et al 2018a b in total 17 sites were selected table 1 fig 1 a 5 of which also contained pre and post fire discharge data hydroclimatic data i e daily time series of mean minimum and maximum air temperature and precipitation for each site were taken from the daymet v4 1 km database https daymet ornl gov thornton et al 2021 thornton et al 1997 and yearly median and mean values were calculated for each individual watershed while annual fluctuations in air temperature are accounted for in paired and stream water temperature ratios precipitation data from daymet v4 were compared between pre and post fire values to ensure no significant changes occurred after the fire additionally amplitude ratios phase lags and precipitation data were tested for correlations to ensure precipitation fluctuations were not driving observed pre vs post fire differences 2 2 paired air and stream water temperature metrics at yearly timescales the amplitude and phase of annual stream temperature signals deviate from local annual air temperature signals in characteristic ways these air water temperature deviations can be used to infer general source groundwater characteristics and parse stream sites with less apparent groundwater influence briggs et al 2018 fig 1b within hillslope aquifers short term fluctuations in air temperature signals are conducted into the subsurface and attenuated with depth this attenuation creates consistent water temperatures in deeper aquifers on annual timescales often in these deeper aquifer settings water temperatures approximate the average local annual air temperature constantz 2008 consequently deeper groundwater flowpaths have lower annual temperature signal amplitudes and phases when compared to annual air temperature signals as a result deep groundwater discharge buffers seasonal changes in stream temperature amplitude and has little impact on annual stream temperature signal phase timing in contrast shallower groundwater flowpaths within several meters of land surface experience less signal attenuation and often have pronounced annual signals that are phase shifted forward in time from local air these phase shifts are uniquely conveyed to streams sourced by shallow groundwater in addition to seasonal buffering briggs et al 2018 fig 1b c consequently the use of air water annual temperature signal amplitude ratios and phase shifts provides efficient metrics used to identify streams with an air coupled minimal groundwater signal deep groundwater buffered from air or shallow groundwater buffered and phase shifted signature air temperature data were used for overlapping time periods at each of the 17 selected sites where raster cells overlapped stream temperature locations and that met screening criteria annual signals for water and air temperature data are sinusoidal in nature and can therefore be represented as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions with separate coefficients and a constant c equation 1 1 t annual α sin t β cos t c regression coefficients that minimized the root mean squared error between the annual temperature signal and observed daily temperature values were selected and considered to represent the average annual signal for each water year the phase ϕ and amplitude a of best fit sinusoids for both air and water temperature signals were calculated using the regressed coefficients α and β equation 2 equation 3 ratios between fit water and air temperature sinusoid amplitudes ar as well as shifts in sinusoid phase δ ϕ or phase lags were subsequently calculated 2 a α 2 β 2 3 ϕ arctan β α each of the 17 sites was subsequently classified as having air coupled shallow groundwater or deep groundwater temperature signals based on mean amplitude ratios and phase lags pre fire fig 1 thresholds were selected in accordance with those previously used and discussed in several conus wide studies of unburned watersheds johnson et al 2020 hare et al 2021 and more targeted watershed scale studies that leveraged observations from multiple ecoregions briggs et al 2018 specifically sites with pre fire amplitude ratios greater than 0 65 and phase lags 10 days were considered to have an air coupled signal sites with amplitude ratios 0 65 and phase lags 10 days were considered to have a deep groundwater signal and any sites with phase lags greater than 10 days were considered to have a shallow groundwater signal fig 1c 2 3 baseflow separation and supporting discharge data where available annual streamflow data can be used to estimate the fraction of baseflow which is interpreted as being sourced mainly from groundwater discharge in headwater systems e g duncan 2019 for sites with both water temperature and discharge data mean daily streamflow was retrieved for overlapping periods of discharge and water temperature data availability the baseflow index algorithm bfi wahl and wahl 1988 was used to graphically separate the baseflow component of streamflow the bfi algorithm can be categorized as a smoothed minima approach and has been widely adopted employed and compared to numerous other chemical and graphical baseflow separation algorithms e g miller et al 2015 lott and stewart 2016 in this study the window length n that defines non overlapping periods used by the bfi method was optimized programmatically and individually for each site by identifying the break point in the relationship between n and long term average bfi values through piecewise linear regression miller et al 2015 following baseflow separation cumulative baseflow values were calculated for each watershed as a sum of daily baseflow values and the baseflow index bfi was calculated by dividing the cumulative volume of baseflow by the cumulative volume of discharge for each water year while the sensitivity of paired air and stream water temperature metrics to classical stream baseflow metrics e g baseflow index has already been demonstrated hare et al 2021 ordinary least squares regressions between paired air water stream temperature metrics i e ar δ ϕ and bfi values from sites with streamflow data n 5 were calculated to further demonstrate the physical basis of paired air water stream temperature metrics for assessing changes in the magnitude of groundwater discharge to streams after fire 2 4 statistical analysis of paired air and stream water temperature metrics to quantify changes in population statistics between pre and post fire paired air and stream water temperature metrics we used the bootstrap method efron 1982 as well as the wilcoxon signed rank kruskal wallis and post hoc dunn tests the bootstrap resampling technique has been widely used in wildfire event studies to develop more robust confidence intervals for pre and post fire observations particularly in studies with smaller sample sizes e g beyene et al 2021 williams et al 2022 for each paired air water temperature metric data were aggregated for all sites and separated based on pre and post fire occurrence the pre fire and post fire sample populations were each randomly sampled with replacement n 1000 and quantiles 0 05 0 10 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 90 and 0 95 were calculated for pre fire and post fire populations for each bootstrapped sample for each quantile post fire paired air water temperature signal metrics were considered significantly altered if the median 500th ranked observation post fire value from the bootstrapped sample population fell outside the 5th 50th observation and 95th 950th observation percentile values for pre fire bootstrapped sample population wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to assess changes in aggregate pre and post fire sample medians while kruskal wallis and post hoc dunn tests were used to compare pre and post fire differences in populations with contrasting pre fire paired air and stream water temperature signal characteristics i e air coupled shallow groundwater deep groundwater specifically median pre fire paired air water temperature metrics were differenced from annual post fire metrics for each unique site to assess annual departures from pre fire medians after fire excluding fire year calculated differences for each respective paired air water temperature metric were then grouped based on signal type i e air coupled shallow groundwater deep groundwater kruskal wallis tests were performed to assess the null hypothesis of equality of medians across signal types for each paired air water temperature metric where thresholds for significance of p 0 01 were used post hoc dunn tests were subsequently used to quantify differences between individual signal types for each paired air water temperature metrics where kruskal wallis tests showed significant differences in median values a threshold for significance of p 0 01 was used for all tests conducted wilcoxon signed rank tests kruskal wallis and post hoc dunn tests were performed in the python scipy stats package v1 8 0 and the scikit posthocs package v0 6 7 post fire changes in paired air and stream water temperature metrics were also calculated as a function of time since fire specifically for each watershed pre fire amplitude ratio and phase lag median values were differenced from yearly post fire values differences between pre and post fire temperature signal metrics were binned by year and grouped based on pre fire watershed classification i e air coupled shallow groundwater deep groundwater pre fire observations for each stream and air water temperature classification were bootstrapped to provide 95 confidence intervals against which to compare pre vs post fire differences differenced amplitude ratio and phase lag values were considered significant if they fell outside pre fire confidence intervals 3 results 3 1 population response pre and post fire paired air water temperature metrics significant changes between bootstrapped pre and post fire populations were observed in 70 of computed quantiles for each of the calculated paired air water temperature metrics fig 2 a post fire amplitude ratio values decreased significantly in 85 of the computed quantiles with the largest magnitude changes occurring in upper quantiles i e 0 5 0 75 0 90 and lower magnitude but still significant changes in lower quantiles 0 05 and 0 10 fig 2a median phase lag values increased post fire in 71 of the computed quantiles with the largest magnitude changes occurring in the central quantiles 0 25 0 50 0 75 and insignificant changes occurring in the two lowest quantiles 0 10 and 0 05 fig 2a decreases were observed in all post fire amplitude ratio quantiles while increases were observed in all post fire phase lag quantiles fig 2a relationships between amplitude ratios and cumulative yearly baseflow red and baseflow index black quantified via regression further supported the notion that paired air stream water temperature metrics are sensitive to groundwater discharge post fire fig 2b uniform decreases in post fire amplitude ratio values and increases in post fire phase lag values are further supported by statistically significant differences between pre and post fire population medians when compared in aggregate using wilcoxon signed rank tests fig 2c amplitude ratio and phase lag values were used to characterize the magnitude of groundwater contributions and their relative source depths pre fire fig 1a c consequently variable magnitude differences between pre and post fire amplitude ratio and phase lag values for bootstrapped population quantiles suggest that post fire response may differ between watersheds classified as having air coupled shallow groundwater or deep groundwater signals pre fire differences between median pre and post fire paired air and stream water temperature metrics were calculated annually for each site and kruskal wallis tests were used to test for equality of sample median between pre fire classification groups fig 2d differenced pre fire and post fire temperature metrics had significant kruskal wallis tests statistics p 0 01 suggesting non equal sample medians between air coupled shallow groundwater and deep groundwater groups fig 2d posthoc dunn tests further elucidated differences between groups specifically air coupled dominated temperature signals had significant test statistics when compared to deep groundwater groups for differenced amplitude ratios and when compared to shallow groundwater groups for differenced phase lags additionally deep groundwater groups had significant test statistics when compared with shallow groundwater groups for differenced amplitude ratios and phase lags 3 2 temporal response pre and post fire paired air water temperature metrics differenced temperature metrics represent post minus pre fire values fig 2d fig 3 a f these differences displayed temporal trends that fell outside pre fire confidence intervals for all watersheds except those with pronounced deep groundwater discharge prior to disturbance fig 3 watersheds classified as having a deep groundwater stream temperature signal generally saw insignificant changes in amplitude ratios i e differenced amplitude ratios that fell within pre fire confidence intervals post fire fig 3c in contrast watersheds lacking pronounced groundwater inputs had differenced amplitude ratios that were negative and predominantly fell outside pre fire confidence intervals for the six years following fire fig 3a b which further supports significant wilcoxon rank sum test statistics calculated for pre vs post fire population medians fig 2c differenced amplitude ratios were only considered significant for air coupled and shallow groundwater groups the variability in response between groups supports kruskal wallis and posthoc dunn test results that show significant differences in population medians between air coupled shallow groundwater and deep groundwater dominated watersheds specifically watersheds classified as having deep groundwater temperature signals pre fire had insignificant changes in population medians when post and pre fire temperature metrics were differenced fig 2d post fire changes in phase lags showed differences in short vs long term responses were not apparent when compared in aggregate fig 2d these changes fell within pre fire confidence intervals for watersheds classified as having deeper groundwater stream temperature signals fig 3f in contrast air coupled watersheds showed initial decreases in differenced phase lags immediately following fire these decreases gradually transitioned to increases in differenced phase lags 4 years after fire with mixed results in the 2 3 year range fig 3d similarly watersheds classified as having a shallow groundwater stream temperature signal pre fire also saw decreases in differenced phase lags immediately following fire however differenced phase lags for shallow groundwater dominated watersheds gradually increased 2 years after fire fig 3e longer term increases in differenced phase lags coincide with wilcoxon rank sum tests showing increases in significantly different sample medians when post and pre fire populations were compared fig 2c as observed in post fire changes in amplitude ratios significant decreases in differenced phase lags were only present in air coupled and shallow groundwater populations these results coincide with statistical tests showing significant differences between medians when deep groundwater air coupled and shallow groundwater populations were compared fig 2d 4 discussion paired air and stream water temperature methods provide the unique ability to describe the relative source depths of groundwater contributions when pre vs post fire temperature metrics were compared across burned watersheds results suggested overall greater groundwater influence following fire for sites previously classified as being air coupled less groundwater influence or shallow groundwater influenced this is evidenced by decreases in annual amplitude ratios and increases in phase lags after disturbance indicating reduced coupling of annual stream and air temperature signals fig 2 fig 3 more fundamentally temperature data from our study showed that streams with minimal groundwater influence pre fire tend to be more thermally stable after fire on annual timescales a key characteristic for aquatic organism habitat e g sullivan et al 2021 this finding contradicts post fire expectations based on changes in riparian and hillslope shading helvey 1980 issac et al 2010 leonard et al 2017 warren et al 2022 along with increased surface runoff and turbidity which may all enhance seasonal thermal variability in streams dunham et al 2007 rhoades et al 2011 mahlum et al 2011 beyene et al 2022 chen and chang 2022 following previous work briggs et al 2018 hare et al 2021 reduced annual amplitude ratios signify enhanced groundwater influence while increases in phase lags are indicative of inputs from shallow subsurface flowpaths in this study enhanced phase shifts and their apparent negative relation to amplitude ratios suggest increased shallow groundwater inputs e g johnson et al 2020 after fire though these shifts were not large enough to recategorize the stream sites as being shallow groundwater dominated using a static threshold of 10 days apparent increases in post fire groundwater discharge from air coupled and shallow groundwater dominated watersheds suggests that some of the increase in total streamflow yield after disturbance observed in previous studies may originate from shallow groundwater flowpaths during inter storm time periods e g wine et al 2018 williams et al 2022 sites dominated by deeper groundwater inputs before fire showed resistance after van meerbeek et al 2021 to post fire shifts in groundwater inputs suggesting tolerance to fire effects on shallow and deep groundwater flow this conclusion is conceptually similar to observations from hare et al 2021 who found that deep groundwater dominated watersheds across the united states had the highest baseflow fractions and were the least sensitive to climactic warming while no previous studies have used paired air and stream water temperature methods to quantify changes in post fire baseflow existing work has utilized streamflow observations to demonstrate similar results namely the potential for wildfire to enhance groundwater discharge kinoshita and hogue 2015 bart and tague 2017 beyene et al 2021 similarly previous field observations have shown wetter soil conditions post fire that can persist over several months sometimes in excess of field capacity values further suggesting the potential for increased groundwater recharge post fire ebel 2013a cardenas and kanarek 2014 while paired air and stream temperature metrics employed in this study demonstrated sensitivity to changes in post fire groundwater discharge magnitude fig 2b our results suggest they may also be helpful for disentangling changes in groundwater source path depths not possible with traditional change detection methods that primarily rely on streamflow observations previous conus scale analysis has shown significant spatial heterogeneity in paired and stream water temperature metrics across physiographic regions yet some general trends were apparent notably deeper groundwater signatures were often associated with physiographic locations that had productive aquifers while shallow groundwater inputs were often associated with thinner soil profiles and steep watersheds hare et al 2021 watersheds with air coupled i e reduced groundwater signal temperature signals are generally dominated by runoff sources resulting from low permeability surface soils or saturation excess overland flow low conductivity streambed sediments and or small lateral hillslope hydraulic gradients fig 4 a in contrast watersheds generally dominated by groundwater temperature signals are considered to have established pathways for deeper soil water flux and larger hydrologic gradients driving lateral groundwater discharge to streams potentially from deeper regional flowpaths fig 4b c conceptually this fits with previous work demonstrating the sensitivity of common baseflow metrics to paired air and stream water classification schemes e g hare et al 2021 and provides a framework for interpreting changes in post fire temperature signal metrics fig 4a c recent studies have routinely demonstrated the impact of wildfire on evapotranspiration poon and kinoshita 2018 ma et al 2020 collar et al 2021 despite fire induced changes in soil hydrologic properties e g debano 2000 moody and ebel 2014 ebel 2022 that have been repeatedly linked to increases in post fire peak flows increased post fire groundwater discharge has often been attributed to the impacts of vegetation mortality where deep soil water flux was promoted by decreased transpiration during inter storm periods cardenas and kanarek 2014 bart and tague 2017 maina and siirila woodburn 2020 ma et al 2020 collar et al 2022 increased recharge due to decreased plant water uptake likely has the largest relative impact in watersheds previously dominated by surface runoff sources i e air coupled temperature signals as steeper hydrologic gradients could drive higher rates of lateral groundwater discharge to streams at interstorm timescales fig 4a similar mechanisms may drive observed changes in watersheds dominated by shallow groundwater temperature signals as these watersheds would either store i e shallow groundwater table or transmit e g topographically focused interflow at a lithologic or pedologic interface more groundwater at depths vulnerable to transpiration when compared to watersheds with deeper groundwater inputs post fire changes in watersheds dominated by shallow groundwater inputs may also be related to wetter initial soil or regolith conditions a propensity for higher shallow volumetric water content combined with decreased plant water uptake may promote more efficient streamflow generation by subsurface flow from either 1 a shallow water table rising into a more transmissive layer e g detty and mcguire 2010 or 2 lateral flow through preferential pathways e g uchida et al 2005 or at permeability contrasts e g whipkey 1965 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 consequently post fire vegetation mortality may explain why observed shifts in post fire amplitude ratios and phase lags were primarily observed in shallow groundwater and air coupled watersheds fig 2 fig 3 fig 4a b in this study watersheds with significant deep groundwater inputs prior to disturbance appeared resistant to subsurface hydrologic change post fire this may be attributed to the large initial fraction of stream discharge already comprised by groundwater where post fire changes likely induced by decreased plant water uptake are significantly buffered by inputs from deeper regional flowpaths watersheds with significant deep groundwater inputs prior to disturbance also may have had higher antecedent groundwater storage pre fire which has been shown to reduce the impact of wildfire on baseflow recession rates bart and tague 2017 additionally watersheds that were dominated by deep groundwater inputs prior to disturbance may see muted changes post fire due to longer groundwater residence times which could create enough temporal lag to extend changes in groundwater discharge out past the 5 yr post fire periods evaluated in this study fig 4c consequently more ubiquitous long term stream temperature data may elucidate post fire changes in watersheds dominated by deep groundwater not apparent in this study resistance to near term fire affects in deep groundwater dominated streams suggests that paired air and stream water temperature methods may be useful for identifying watersheds most vulnerable to fire induced changes in groundwater discharge moving forward paired air and stream water temperature observations at higher temporal scales e g sub daily could provide additional opportunities to parse out groundwater change dynamics on sub annual scales higher resolution paired air and stream water temperature metrics would be more conducive for quantitative comparisons with controlling atmospheric variables or changes in riparian vegetation and evapotranspiration paired air and stream water temperature metrics calculated on sub annual timescales would also facilitate comparisons to water quality observations helping parse the impact of increased groundwater discharge versus large precipitation events on post fire water quality e g murphy et al 2018 moving forward nested air and stream water temperature observations within watersheds may better elucidate the impact of burn severity on post fire groundwater discharge and could be deployed in a control impact design higher temporal resolution in paired air and stream water temperature metrics may also help to elucidate the impact of fire on thermal refuge for aquatic organisms as we observed an increase in stream thermal stability on annual timescales yet previous work has seen increases in summer stream temperature when cold water habitat is most essential e g isaak et al 2010 like studies that utilize streamflow e g williams et al 2022 paired air and stream water temperature metrics represent an aggregated watershed response to a multitude of post fire changes this aggregated response makes it difficult to isolate specific physical processes responsible for changes in groundwater discharge behavior e g beyene et al 2021 efforts to capture and quantify post fire response are also complicated by spatiotemporal issues of scale and heterogeneity in physical watershed attributes furthermore recent studies have repeatedly demonstrated the inherent difficulties in parsing wildfire effects from climatic variability even when pre fire discharge or water quality data are available bart and hope 2010 bart 2016 wine et al 2018 collar et al 2021 collar et al 2022 previous work has shown that both burn extent and severity impact post fire hydrologic response e g goeking and tarboton 2020 in this study a limited number of available sites met basin selection criteria this inhibited analysis of post fire change as a function of watershed burn extent and severity as well as basin physiographic properties and represents an opportunity for future work despite these limitations this work suggests that paired air and stream water temperature metrics provide viable proxies for groundwater contributions to streams based on the results of this study paired air and stream water temperature metrics may provide additional avenues to study subsurface hydrologic change after fire in a field of study that often struggles with spatio temporal limitations in available datasets 5 conclusion there is growing evidence that groundwater discharge to streams increases following wildfire yet the subsurface hydrologic impacts of wildfire continue to receive relatively less focus than changes in peak flows water quality evapotranspiration and total streamflow yield following fire this is the first study to make use of emerging paired air and stream water temperature analyses to investigate the impact of wildfire on changes in groundwater contribution to streams here we show that paired air and stream temperature observations may provide an alternative and potentially complementary dataset for studying the subsurface hydrologic impacts of wildfire a field of study where work is often limited by the lack of available pre fire observations additionally paired air and stream water temperature metrics provide insight into changes in the source depth of groundwater discharge not easily attained with post disturbance studies that often rely on streamflow observations shedding light on the dominant subsurface routing of hillslope groundwater as impacted by critical zone processes we found that streams with a pre fire classification of reduced groundwater connectivity air coupled or dominant shallow groundwater connectivity showed systematic changes post fire evidenced primarily by more stable annual thermal regimes compared to local air these observations contrast with expected stream temperature response to wildfire based on enhanced flashy runoff and reductions in riparian shading and we attribute the observed shifts to enhanced shallow hillslope groundwater discharge as evapotranspiration is reduced based on the findings of this study the magnitude and relative source depths of groundwater discharge to streams prior to disturbance directly impact hydrologic change post fire specifically watersheds dominated by air coupled or shallow groundwater temperature signals showed significant change post fire in paired air and stream water temperature metrics sensitive to the relative magnitude and source depth of groundwater discharge in contrast watersheds identified as having significant deep groundwater contributions to streamflow pre fire displayed more resistance to disturbance and did not show systematic shifts in annual thermal regimes these observations provide valuable insight into a watershed s tolerance for to disturbance and provide scientists or water managers an alternative

2122,within the western united states increasingly severe and frequent wildfires may alter the magnitude timing and quality of water exported from burned areas by streams post fire hydrologic studies often focus on peak stream flow responses to shifts in runoff generation or on annual streamflow yield response to changes in evapotranspiration following fire however the magnitude and duration of wildfire effects on groundwater recharge changes in subsurface routing and consequences for stream low flows sourced predominately by baseflow are poorly understood here we demonstrate an approach using the amplitude and phase of paired annual air and stream water temperature signals to broadly identify changes in watershed subsurface flow contributions after fire watersheds were classified using pre fire temperature data as having air coupled i e reduced apparent groundwater signature deep groundwater or shallow groundwater stream temperature signals changes in pre and post fire paired air and stream water temperature metrics were compared for locations n 17 spanning a large range of physiographic and climatic conditions across the western united states pre and post fire comparisons were computed by quantile using bootstrapped confidence intervals ci 95 as well as in aggregate using kruskal wallis and post hoc dunn tests statistical comparisons of pre and post fire temperature metrics suggest that overall watersheds classified as having minimal groundwater influence are the most likely to experience fire induced subsurface hydrologic change more specifically watersheds classified as having air coupled or shallow groundwater signals experienced increases in the magnitude of groundwater discharge with more stable annual thermal regimes post fire that are less coupled to ambient air temperature these findings form the basis of a conceptual framework for watershed resistance to subsurface hydrologic change following fire that can be broadly applied as a first approximation for water management impacts on aquatic habitat and post wildfire response planning data availability all data used in this work is publicly available and links can be found in the data availability statement 1 introduction forested watersheds are primary suppliers of water for human consumption in many parts of the world including the western united states where climate related impacts threaten regional water availability e g overpeck and udall 2010 lund et al 2018 ault 2020 wildfire can cause abrupt and prolonged shifts in the magnitude timing and quality of water exported from burned areas kinoshita and hogue 2015 hallema et al 2018a b goeking and tarboton 2020 williams et al 2022 with high downstream demands for water spread across multiple sectors evaluation of hydrologic change following fire is critical for strategic water management e g coop et al 2020 regional warming and projected increases in fire severity extent and frequency in the western united states westerling et al 2006 williams et al 2022 further elevate the need for post fire hydrologic research to inform sound decision making post fire hydrologic studies have generally focused on assessing peak flow extremes in response to short term enhanced hydrophobicity and reduced hydraulic conductivity of surface soils shakesby and doerr 2006 ebel et al 2012 moody et al 2013 wine and cadol 2016 and annual streamflow yield response to changes in evapotranspiration following fire hallema et al 2018a b goeking and tarboton 2020 saxe et al 2018 collar et al 2022 yet there is growing recognition that post fire changes in subsurface routing of flow and groundwater recharge may be substantial in some settings bart and tague 2017 beyene et al 2021 impacting stream baseflow fractions and potentially altering the timing temperature and chemical composition of water delivered from fire affected watersheds e g murphy et al 2018 post fire changes in stream temperature have been repeatedly demonstrated to threaten aquatic organism habitat dunham et al 2007 isaak et al 2010 rhoades et al 2011 beyene et al 2022 while elevated sediment loads nutrients dissolved organic compounds and metals can threaten drinking water supplies e g murphy et al 2015 rhoades et al 2019 paul et al 2022 disparate responses to fire have been reported in post fire low flows when streamflow is sourced predominantly from groundwater discharge e g goeking and tarboton 2020 beyene et al 2021 decreases in baseflow recession rates bart and tague 2017 and increases in soil moisture ebel 2013a cardenas and kanarek 2014 suggests that groundwater recharge and shallow subsurface flow may increase following fire a recent western conus wide study found increases in post fire low flows for some watersheds as well as watersheds that experienced no change or decreases in low flows following disturbance beyene et al 2021 increases in post fire low flows have often been attributed to reduced transpiration resulting from vegetation mortality kinoshita and hogue 2011 kinoshita and hogue 2015 collar et al 2022 with modeling studies having demonstrated linkages between reduced evapotranspiration increased soil moisture and enhanced groundwater recharge ebel 2013b atchley et al 2018 maina and siirila woodburn 2020 yet predicting the impact of wildfire on groundwater discharge to streams remains difficult as post fire hydrologic responses show substantial spatiotemporal variation due to heterogeneities in underlying physical watershed conditions fire extent and severity vegetation recovery and precipitation event sequencing bart 2016 bart and tague 2017 burned watersheds often lack multi year pre fire stream observations presenting challenges for linking pre fire watershed attributes with the spatiotemporal consequences of wildfire on streamflow e g beyene et al 2021 consequently studies conducted at larger scales are often limited to areas of existing data collection networks that happen to burn e g streamgauges and to remotely sensed or modeled observations of key variables such as burn severity estimated evapotranspiration vegetation mortality and recovery temperature and precipitation e g collar et al 2022 williams et al 2022 however stream water temperature is a simple affordable and common water quality metric collected for a wide range of historical and ongoing watershed research and management goals increasing the chances of capturing pre to post fire stream change if used as an in situ data type heat has been widely adopted as a tracer in hydrologic systems anderson 2005 kurylyk et al 2019 with numerous studies leveraging temperature differences between groundwater and surface water to locate areas of groundwater discharge to streams using varied methodology e g dugdale et al 2015 constantz 2008 johnson et al 2017 hare et al 2015 over much of the year stream temperature signals may be well coupled to air temperature signals mohseni and stefan 1999 but discharge of groundwater followed by in stream mixing disrupts that coupling e g johnson et al 2020 hare et al 2021 when combined with local air temperature observations as a surrogate for total stream thermal forcing stream temperature records have proven useful for estimating the magnitude and source depth of groundwater contributions to streams at scales ranging from hillslope springs vesper et al 2022 to a single watershed to the entire conus kelleher et al 2012 snyder et al 2015 briggs et al 2018 johnson et al 2020 hare et al 2021 stream temperature data also represent an aggregated upstream response integrating hydrologic processes over larger areas than small plots or hillslopes and thus generally provide information at scales that are less confounded by small scale variability however paired air and stream water temperature observations have yet to be adopted for studying post fire hydrologic response and may provide alternate or complementary datasets for studying the impact of wildfire on groundwater resources here we demonstrate a unique application of paired air water temperature analysis for investigating potential changes in watershed subsurface flow contributions following fire for locations spanning a large range of physiographic and climatic conditions across the western united states existing literature notes a general paucity of streams with both pre and post fire streamflow data e g hallema et al 2018a b collar et al 2022 williams et al 2022 but by harnessing existing stream temperature records collected for a variety of purposes we identified 17 sites where potential shifts in stream baseflow sources could be evaluated specifically paired air and stream water temperature methods based on annual temperature signals as described in detail by briggs et al 2018 are used to broadly classify relative groundwater contributions and source depths to streamflow results are then used to identify watersheds and watershed characteristics including air water temperature metrics that may be most or least tolerant to subsurface hydrologic change based on dominant pre fire streamwater sources 2 methods 2 1 watershed selection criteria and data sources water temperature records from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system nwis usgs 2022 and norwest isaak et al 2017 for sites located within the western continental united states conus were selected for analysis if they had no data gaps greater than 30 days based on the criteria of johnson et al 2021 and had 10 or more contiguous years of water temperature observations contributing watersheds were delineated for sites that met these criteria using the usgs streamstats application programming interface ries et al 2008 delineated watersheds were subsequently compared to burned area polygons from the monitoring trends in burn severity dataset https www mtbs gov from 1989 to 2019 to determine sites whose watersheds had been affected by fire only fires classified by mtbs as wildfires were considered if greater than 10 of a delineated watershed had burned and 5 years of pre and post fire water temperature data existed 10 year time series sites were selected as candidates for analysis a number of studies have shown or used as a selection criterion a burned watershed threshold of approximately 20 for annual watershed yield wine and cadol 2016 wine et al 2018 hallema et al 2018a b saxe et al 2018 however those thresholds are for total watershed yield not groundwater or subsurface streamflow generation specifically therefore we selected a more conservative burned area threshold of 10 in case groundwater or subsurface streamflow generation is more sensitive to burned than total annual watershed yield watershed candidates were used in the final analysis if no additional fires burned more than 3 of the watershed during the pre or post fire analysis period and if the stream temperature monitoring sites had no upstream regulation from dams or diversions multi burn criteria were selected in accordance with previous study criteria e g beyene et al 2021 and was considered conservative when compared to burned thresholds previously shown to impact total watershed yield e g wine and cadol 2016 hallema et al 2018a b in total 17 sites were selected table 1 fig 1 a 5 of which also contained pre and post fire discharge data hydroclimatic data i e daily time series of mean minimum and maximum air temperature and precipitation for each site were taken from the daymet v4 1 km database https daymet ornl gov thornton et al 2021 thornton et al 1997 and yearly median and mean values were calculated for each individual watershed while annual fluctuations in air temperature are accounted for in paired and stream water temperature ratios precipitation data from daymet v4 were compared between pre and post fire values to ensure no significant changes occurred after the fire additionally amplitude ratios phase lags and precipitation data were tested for correlations to ensure precipitation fluctuations were not driving observed pre vs post fire differences 2 2 paired air and stream water temperature metrics at yearly timescales the amplitude and phase of annual stream temperature signals deviate from local annual air temperature signals in characteristic ways these air water temperature deviations can be used to infer general source groundwater characteristics and parse stream sites with less apparent groundwater influence briggs et al 2018 fig 1b within hillslope aquifers short term fluctuations in air temperature signals are conducted into the subsurface and attenuated with depth this attenuation creates consistent water temperatures in deeper aquifers on annual timescales often in these deeper aquifer settings water temperatures approximate the average local annual air temperature constantz 2008 consequently deeper groundwater flowpaths have lower annual temperature signal amplitudes and phases when compared to annual air temperature signals as a result deep groundwater discharge buffers seasonal changes in stream temperature amplitude and has little impact on annual stream temperature signal phase timing in contrast shallower groundwater flowpaths within several meters of land surface experience less signal attenuation and often have pronounced annual signals that are phase shifted forward in time from local air these phase shifts are uniquely conveyed to streams sourced by shallow groundwater in addition to seasonal buffering briggs et al 2018 fig 1b c consequently the use of air water annual temperature signal amplitude ratios and phase shifts provides efficient metrics used to identify streams with an air coupled minimal groundwater signal deep groundwater buffered from air or shallow groundwater buffered and phase shifted signature air temperature data were used for overlapping time periods at each of the 17 selected sites where raster cells overlapped stream temperature locations and that met screening criteria annual signals for water and air temperature data are sinusoidal in nature and can therefore be represented as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions with separate coefficients and a constant c equation 1 1 t annual α sin t β cos t c regression coefficients that minimized the root mean squared error between the annual temperature signal and observed daily temperature values were selected and considered to represent the average annual signal for each water year the phase ϕ and amplitude a of best fit sinusoids for both air and water temperature signals were calculated using the regressed coefficients α and β equation 2 equation 3 ratios between fit water and air temperature sinusoid amplitudes ar as well as shifts in sinusoid phase δ ϕ or phase lags were subsequently calculated 2 a α 2 β 2 3 ϕ arctan β α each of the 17 sites was subsequently classified as having air coupled shallow groundwater or deep groundwater temperature signals based on mean amplitude ratios and phase lags pre fire fig 1 thresholds were selected in accordance with those previously used and discussed in several conus wide studies of unburned watersheds johnson et al 2020 hare et al 2021 and more targeted watershed scale studies that leveraged observations from multiple ecoregions briggs et al 2018 specifically sites with pre fire amplitude ratios greater than 0 65 and phase lags 10 days were considered to have an air coupled signal sites with amplitude ratios 0 65 and phase lags 10 days were considered to have a deep groundwater signal and any sites with phase lags greater than 10 days were considered to have a shallow groundwater signal fig 1c 2 3 baseflow separation and supporting discharge data where available annual streamflow data can be used to estimate the fraction of baseflow which is interpreted as being sourced mainly from groundwater discharge in headwater systems e g duncan 2019 for sites with both water temperature and discharge data mean daily streamflow was retrieved for overlapping periods of discharge and water temperature data availability the baseflow index algorithm bfi wahl and wahl 1988 was used to graphically separate the baseflow component of streamflow the bfi algorithm can be categorized as a smoothed minima approach and has been widely adopted employed and compared to numerous other chemical and graphical baseflow separation algorithms e g miller et al 2015 lott and stewart 2016 in this study the window length n that defines non overlapping periods used by the bfi method was optimized programmatically and individually for each site by identifying the break point in the relationship between n and long term average bfi values through piecewise linear regression miller et al 2015 following baseflow separation cumulative baseflow values were calculated for each watershed as a sum of daily baseflow values and the baseflow index bfi was calculated by dividing the cumulative volume of baseflow by the cumulative volume of discharge for each water year while the sensitivity of paired air and stream water temperature metrics to classical stream baseflow metrics e g baseflow index has already been demonstrated hare et al 2021 ordinary least squares regressions between paired air water stream temperature metrics i e ar δ ϕ and bfi values from sites with streamflow data n 5 were calculated to further demonstrate the physical basis of paired air water stream temperature metrics for assessing changes in the magnitude of groundwater discharge to streams after fire 2 4 statistical analysis of paired air and stream water temperature metrics to quantify changes in population statistics between pre and post fire paired air and stream water temperature metrics we used the bootstrap method efron 1982 as well as the wilcoxon signed rank kruskal wallis and post hoc dunn tests the bootstrap resampling technique has been widely used in wildfire event studies to develop more robust confidence intervals for pre and post fire observations particularly in studies with smaller sample sizes e g beyene et al 2021 williams et al 2022 for each paired air water temperature metric data were aggregated for all sites and separated based on pre and post fire occurrence the pre fire and post fire sample populations were each randomly sampled with replacement n 1000 and quantiles 0 05 0 10 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 90 and 0 95 were calculated for pre fire and post fire populations for each bootstrapped sample for each quantile post fire paired air water temperature signal metrics were considered significantly altered if the median 500th ranked observation post fire value from the bootstrapped sample population fell outside the 5th 50th observation and 95th 950th observation percentile values for pre fire bootstrapped sample population wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to assess changes in aggregate pre and post fire sample medians while kruskal wallis and post hoc dunn tests were used to compare pre and post fire differences in populations with contrasting pre fire paired air and stream water temperature signal characteristics i e air coupled shallow groundwater deep groundwater specifically median pre fire paired air water temperature metrics were differenced from annual post fire metrics for each unique site to assess annual departures from pre fire medians after fire excluding fire year calculated differences for each respective paired air water temperature metric were then grouped based on signal type i e air coupled shallow groundwater deep groundwater kruskal wallis tests were performed to assess the null hypothesis of equality of medians across signal types for each paired air water temperature metric where thresholds for significance of p 0 01 were used post hoc dunn tests were subsequently used to quantify differences between individual signal types for each paired air water temperature metrics where kruskal wallis tests showed significant differences in median values a threshold for significance of p 0 01 was used for all tests conducted wilcoxon signed rank tests kruskal wallis and post hoc dunn tests were performed in the python scipy stats package v1 8 0 and the scikit posthocs package v0 6 7 post fire changes in paired air and stream water temperature metrics were also calculated as a function of time since fire specifically for each watershed pre fire amplitude ratio and phase lag median values were differenced from yearly post fire values differences between pre and post fire temperature signal metrics were binned by year and grouped based on pre fire watershed classification i e air coupled shallow groundwater deep groundwater pre fire observations for each stream and air water temperature classification were bootstrapped to provide 95 confidence intervals against which to compare pre vs post fire differences differenced amplitude ratio and phase lag values were considered significant if they fell outside pre fire confidence intervals 3 results 3 1 population response pre and post fire paired air water temperature metrics significant changes between bootstrapped pre and post fire populations were observed in 70 of computed quantiles for each of the calculated paired air water temperature metrics fig 2 a post fire amplitude ratio values decreased significantly in 85 of the computed quantiles with the largest magnitude changes occurring in upper quantiles i e 0 5 0 75 0 90 and lower magnitude but still significant changes in lower quantiles 0 05 and 0 10 fig 2a median phase lag values increased post fire in 71 of the computed quantiles with the largest magnitude changes occurring in the central quantiles 0 25 0 50 0 75 and insignificant changes occurring in the two lowest quantiles 0 10 and 0 05 fig 2a decreases were observed in all post fire amplitude ratio quantiles while increases were observed in all post fire phase lag quantiles fig 2a relationships between amplitude ratios and cumulative yearly baseflow red and baseflow index black quantified via regression further supported the notion that paired air stream water temperature metrics are sensitive to groundwater discharge post fire fig 2b uniform decreases in post fire amplitude ratio values and increases in post fire phase lag values are further supported by statistically significant differences between pre and post fire population medians when compared in aggregate using wilcoxon signed rank tests fig 2c amplitude ratio and phase lag values were used to characterize the magnitude of groundwater contributions and their relative source depths pre fire fig 1a c consequently variable magnitude differences between pre and post fire amplitude ratio and phase lag values for bootstrapped population quantiles suggest that post fire response may differ between watersheds classified as having air coupled shallow groundwater or deep groundwater signals pre fire differences between median pre and post fire paired air and stream water temperature metrics were calculated annually for each site and kruskal wallis tests were used to test for equality of sample median between pre fire classification groups fig 2d differenced pre fire and post fire temperature metrics had significant kruskal wallis tests statistics p 0 01 suggesting non equal sample medians between air coupled shallow groundwater and deep groundwater groups fig 2d posthoc dunn tests further elucidated differences between groups specifically air coupled dominated temperature signals had significant test statistics when compared to deep groundwater groups for differenced amplitude ratios and when compared to shallow groundwater groups for differenced phase lags additionally deep groundwater groups had significant test statistics when compared with shallow groundwater groups for differenced amplitude ratios and phase lags 3 2 temporal response pre and post fire paired air water temperature metrics differenced temperature metrics represent post minus pre fire values fig 2d fig 3 a f these differences displayed temporal trends that fell outside pre fire confidence intervals for all watersheds except those with pronounced deep groundwater discharge prior to disturbance fig 3 watersheds classified as having a deep groundwater stream temperature signal generally saw insignificant changes in amplitude ratios i e differenced amplitude ratios that fell within pre fire confidence intervals post fire fig 3c in contrast watersheds lacking pronounced groundwater inputs had differenced amplitude ratios that were negative and predominantly fell outside pre fire confidence intervals for the six years following fire fig 3a b which further supports significant wilcoxon rank sum test statistics calculated for pre vs post fire population medians fig 2c differenced amplitude ratios were only considered significant for air coupled and shallow groundwater groups the variability in response between groups supports kruskal wallis and posthoc dunn test results that show significant differences in population medians between air coupled shallow groundwater and deep groundwater dominated watersheds specifically watersheds classified as having deep groundwater temperature signals pre fire had insignificant changes in population medians when post and pre fire temperature metrics were differenced fig 2d post fire changes in phase lags showed differences in short vs long term responses were not apparent when compared in aggregate fig 2d these changes fell within pre fire confidence intervals for watersheds classified as having deeper groundwater stream temperature signals fig 3f in contrast air coupled watersheds showed initial decreases in differenced phase lags immediately following fire these decreases gradually transitioned to increases in differenced phase lags 4 years after fire with mixed results in the 2 3 year range fig 3d similarly watersheds classified as having a shallow groundwater stream temperature signal pre fire also saw decreases in differenced phase lags immediately following fire however differenced phase lags for shallow groundwater dominated watersheds gradually increased 2 years after fire fig 3e longer term increases in differenced phase lags coincide with wilcoxon rank sum tests showing increases in significantly different sample medians when post and pre fire populations were compared fig 2c as observed in post fire changes in amplitude ratios significant decreases in differenced phase lags were only present in air coupled and shallow groundwater populations these results coincide with statistical tests showing significant differences between medians when deep groundwater air coupled and shallow groundwater populations were compared fig 2d 4 discussion paired air and stream water temperature methods provide the unique ability to describe the relative source depths of groundwater contributions when pre vs post fire temperature metrics were compared across burned watersheds results suggested overall greater groundwater influence following fire for sites previously classified as being air coupled less groundwater influence or shallow groundwater influenced this is evidenced by decreases in annual amplitude ratios and increases in phase lags after disturbance indicating reduced coupling of annual stream and air temperature signals fig 2 fig 3 more fundamentally temperature data from our study showed that streams with minimal groundwater influence pre fire tend to be more thermally stable after fire on annual timescales a key characteristic for aquatic organism habitat e g sullivan et al 2021 this finding contradicts post fire expectations based on changes in riparian and hillslope shading helvey 1980 issac et al 2010 leonard et al 2017 warren et al 2022 along with increased surface runoff and turbidity which may all enhance seasonal thermal variability in streams dunham et al 2007 rhoades et al 2011 mahlum et al 2011 beyene et al 2022 chen and chang 2022 following previous work briggs et al 2018 hare et al 2021 reduced annual amplitude ratios signify enhanced groundwater influence while increases in phase lags are indicative of inputs from shallow subsurface flowpaths in this study enhanced phase shifts and their apparent negative relation to amplitude ratios suggest increased shallow groundwater inputs e g johnson et al 2020 after fire though these shifts were not large enough to recategorize the stream sites as being shallow groundwater dominated using a static threshold of 10 days apparent increases in post fire groundwater discharge from air coupled and shallow groundwater dominated watersheds suggests that some of the increase in total streamflow yield after disturbance observed in previous studies may originate from shallow groundwater flowpaths during inter storm time periods e g wine et al 2018 williams et al 2022 sites dominated by deeper groundwater inputs before fire showed resistance after van meerbeek et al 2021 to post fire shifts in groundwater inputs suggesting tolerance to fire effects on shallow and deep groundwater flow this conclusion is conceptually similar to observations from hare et al 2021 who found that deep groundwater dominated watersheds across the united states had the highest baseflow fractions and were the least sensitive to climactic warming while no previous studies have used paired air and stream water temperature methods to quantify changes in post fire baseflow existing work has utilized streamflow observations to demonstrate similar results namely the potential for wildfire to enhance groundwater discharge kinoshita and hogue 2015 bart and tague 2017 beyene et al 2021 similarly previous field observations have shown wetter soil conditions post fire that can persist over several months sometimes in excess of field capacity values further suggesting the potential for increased groundwater recharge post fire ebel 2013a cardenas and kanarek 2014 while paired air and stream temperature metrics employed in this study demonstrated sensitivity to changes in post fire groundwater discharge magnitude fig 2b our results suggest they may also be helpful for disentangling changes in groundwater source path depths not possible with traditional change detection methods that primarily rely on streamflow observations previous conus scale analysis has shown significant spatial heterogeneity in paired and stream water temperature metrics across physiographic regions yet some general trends were apparent notably deeper groundwater signatures were often associated with physiographic locations that had productive aquifers while shallow groundwater inputs were often associated with thinner soil profiles and steep watersheds hare et al 2021 watersheds with air coupled i e reduced groundwater signal temperature signals are generally dominated by runoff sources resulting from low permeability surface soils or saturation excess overland flow low conductivity streambed sediments and or small lateral hillslope hydraulic gradients fig 4 a in contrast watersheds generally dominated by groundwater temperature signals are considered to have established pathways for deeper soil water flux and larger hydrologic gradients driving lateral groundwater discharge to streams potentially from deeper regional flowpaths fig 4b c conceptually this fits with previous work demonstrating the sensitivity of common baseflow metrics to paired air and stream water classification schemes e g hare et al 2021 and provides a framework for interpreting changes in post fire temperature signal metrics fig 4a c recent studies have routinely demonstrated the impact of wildfire on evapotranspiration poon and kinoshita 2018 ma et al 2020 collar et al 2021 despite fire induced changes in soil hydrologic properties e g debano 2000 moody and ebel 2014 ebel 2022 that have been repeatedly linked to increases in post fire peak flows increased post fire groundwater discharge has often been attributed to the impacts of vegetation mortality where deep soil water flux was promoted by decreased transpiration during inter storm periods cardenas and kanarek 2014 bart and tague 2017 maina and siirila woodburn 2020 ma et al 2020 collar et al 2022 increased recharge due to decreased plant water uptake likely has the largest relative impact in watersheds previously dominated by surface runoff sources i e air coupled temperature signals as steeper hydrologic gradients could drive higher rates of lateral groundwater discharge to streams at interstorm timescales fig 4a similar mechanisms may drive observed changes in watersheds dominated by shallow groundwater temperature signals as these watersheds would either store i e shallow groundwater table or transmit e g topographically focused interflow at a lithologic or pedologic interface more groundwater at depths vulnerable to transpiration when compared to watersheds with deeper groundwater inputs post fire changes in watersheds dominated by shallow groundwater inputs may also be related to wetter initial soil or regolith conditions a propensity for higher shallow volumetric water content combined with decreased plant water uptake may promote more efficient streamflow generation by subsurface flow from either 1 a shallow water table rising into a more transmissive layer e g detty and mcguire 2010 or 2 lateral flow through preferential pathways e g uchida et al 2005 or at permeability contrasts e g whipkey 1965 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 consequently post fire vegetation mortality may explain why observed shifts in post fire amplitude ratios and phase lags were primarily observed in shallow groundwater and air coupled watersheds fig 2 fig 3 fig 4a b in this study watersheds with significant deep groundwater inputs prior to disturbance appeared resistant to subsurface hydrologic change post fire this may be attributed to the large initial fraction of stream discharge already comprised by groundwater where post fire changes likely induced by decreased plant water uptake are significantly buffered by inputs from deeper regional flowpaths watersheds with significant deep groundwater inputs prior to disturbance also may have had higher antecedent groundwater storage pre fire which has been shown to reduce the impact of wildfire on baseflow recession rates bart and tague 2017 additionally watersheds that were dominated by deep groundwater inputs prior to disturbance may see muted changes post fire due to longer groundwater residence times which could create enough temporal lag to extend changes in groundwater discharge out past the 5 yr post fire periods evaluated in this study fig 4c consequently more ubiquitous long term stream temperature data may elucidate post fire changes in watersheds dominated by deep groundwater not apparent in this study resistance to near term fire affects in deep groundwater dominated streams suggests that paired air and stream water temperature methods may be useful for identifying watersheds most vulnerable to fire induced changes in groundwater discharge moving forward paired air and stream water temperature observations at higher temporal scales e g sub daily could provide additional opportunities to parse out groundwater change dynamics on sub annual scales higher resolution paired air and stream water temperature metrics would be more conducive for quantitative comparisons with controlling atmospheric variables or changes in riparian vegetation and evapotranspiration paired air and stream water temperature metrics calculated on sub annual timescales would also facilitate comparisons to water quality observations helping parse the impact of increased groundwater discharge versus large precipitation events on post fire water quality e g murphy et al 2018 moving forward nested air and stream water temperature observations within watersheds may better elucidate the impact of burn severity on post fire groundwater discharge and could be deployed in a control impact design higher temporal resolution in paired air and stream water temperature metrics may also help to elucidate the impact of fire on thermal refuge for aquatic organisms as we observed an increase in stream thermal stability on annual timescales yet previous work has seen increases in summer stream temperature when cold water habitat is most essential e g isaak et al 2010 like studies that utilize streamflow e g williams et al 2022 paired air and stream water temperature metrics represent an aggregated watershed response to a multitude of post fire changes this aggregated response makes it difficult to isolate specific physical processes responsible for changes in groundwater discharge behavior e g beyene et al 2021 efforts to capture and quantify post fire response are also complicated by spatiotemporal issues of scale and heterogeneity in physical watershed attributes furthermore recent studies have repeatedly demonstrated the inherent difficulties in parsing wildfire effects from climatic variability even when pre fire discharge or water quality data are available bart and hope 2010 bart 2016 wine et al 2018 collar et al 2021 collar et al 2022 previous work has shown that both burn extent and severity impact post fire hydrologic response e g goeking and tarboton 2020 in this study a limited number of available sites met basin selection criteria this inhibited analysis of post fire change as a function of watershed burn extent and severity as well as basin physiographic properties and represents an opportunity for future work despite these limitations this work suggests that paired air and stream water temperature metrics provide viable proxies for groundwater contributions to streams based on the results of this study paired air and stream water temperature metrics may provide additional avenues to study subsurface hydrologic change after fire in a field of study that often struggles with spatio temporal limitations in available datasets 5 conclusion there is growing evidence that groundwater discharge to streams increases following wildfire yet the subsurface hydrologic impacts of wildfire continue to receive relatively less focus than changes in peak flows water quality evapotranspiration and total streamflow yield following fire this is the first study to make use of emerging paired air and stream water temperature analyses to investigate the impact of wildfire on changes in groundwater contribution to streams here we show that paired air and stream temperature observations may provide an alternative and potentially complementary dataset for studying the subsurface hydrologic impacts of wildfire a field of study where work is often limited by the lack of available pre fire observations additionally paired air and stream water temperature metrics provide insight into changes in the source depth of groundwater discharge not easily attained with post disturbance studies that often rely on streamflow observations shedding light on the dominant subsurface routing of hillslope groundwater as impacted by critical zone processes we found that streams with a pre fire classification of reduced groundwater connectivity air coupled or dominant shallow groundwater connectivity showed systematic changes post fire evidenced primarily by more stable annual thermal regimes compared to local air these observations contrast with expected stream temperature response to wildfire based on enhanced flashy runoff and reductions in riparian shading and we attribute the observed shifts to enhanced shallow hillslope groundwater discharge as evapotranspiration is reduced based on the findings of this study the magnitude and relative source depths of groundwater discharge to streams prior to disturbance directly impact hydrologic change post fire specifically watersheds dominated by air coupled or shallow groundwater temperature signals showed significant change post fire in paired air and stream water temperature metrics sensitive to the relative magnitude and source depth of groundwater discharge in contrast watersheds identified as having significant deep groundwater contributions to streamflow pre fire displayed more resistance to disturbance and did not show systematic shifts in annual thermal regimes these observations provide valuable insight into a watershed s tolerance for to disturbance and provide scientists or water managers an alternative

2123,this study describes a comprehensive investigation of the contiguous united states precipitation patterns in relation to the warm and cold phases of el niño southern oscillation enso using a set of empirical and statistical analyses such as harmonic analysis annual cycle composites and cross correlation analysis monthly precipitation composites for the first harmonic covering 24 month enso events are formed for all climate divisions over the united states spanning up to 29 enso episodes from the harmonic vectorial maps plotted on the study area each vector reveals both intensity and temporal phase of the enso related precipitation teleconnection and the corresponding candidate and core regions are determined using a machine learning technique of gaussian mixture model gmm based on magnitude and temporal phase of climate signal and köppen climate classification as a result of vectorial mapping five core regions were designated as north west region nw south west region sw middle inland region mi south east region se and north east region ne during fall 0 to spring seasons the results of this analysis show below above normal precipitation response to the el niño events at the nw region sw mi se and ne regions while the opposite patterns are detected for the cold phase of enso the temporal consistency values were 0 72 to 0 86 0 77 to 0 82 and spatial coherence values ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 0 94 to 0 99 for the warm cold events comparative analyses of precipitation responses to both el niño and la niña events reveal the high significance level of the enso related precipitation signals with an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation anomalies positive precipitation anomalies during the el niño thermal forcing are more significant than negative precipitation

precipitation index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the el niño southern oscillation enso is a combined phenomenon of fluctuating sea surface temperature and atmospheric circulation over the central and eastern pacific ocean it has a critical influence on climate patterns all over the world wmo 2014 these large scale naturally occurring phenomena have been investigated at regional and global scale since the extreme phases of the enso episodes can cause major hydrologic extremes e g floods and droughts in various parts throughout the world many scientific approaches for understanding these phenomena have been providing us a chance to prepare for the disastrous hazards such as torrential rainstorm floods and droughts walker 1923 walker and bliss 1932 were the first to study the impacts of the southern oscillation so on the indian precipitation variability since then a number of global scale studies related to the enso extreme phases showed various notable climatic links between precipitation patterns and either phase of these opposite extreme events in many areas throughout the globe since berlage 1966 found the enso extreme events correlated well with precipitation anomalies on a global basis rasmusson and carpenter 1983 related the precipitation and temperature patterns to the extreme phase of the southern oscillation and identified a significant link between the two variations also ropelewski and halpert 1987 1989 investigated temporal and spatial ranges showing consistent responses of the precipitation patterns over a variety of areas throughout the world to the extreme phases of the enso episodes and showed significant correlations of the enso forcing and precipitation patterns which were also identified by kiladis and diaz 1989 more recently westra et al 2013 used a mann kendall nonparametric test and a nonstationary generalized extreme value analysis to identify monotonic trends in annual maximum daily precipitation on a global basis and to test for a significant association with near surface air temperature averaged globally on a regional basis many studies found plausible evidence of the enso far reaching effect on the low and mid latitude climate variabilities as documented by douglas and englehart 1981 rasmusson and wallace 1983 ropelewski and halpert 1986 redmond and koch 1991 and kahya and dracup 1994 for midlatitude regions several studies noted the enso related precipitation correlation for the southeastern united states douglas and englehart 1981 revealed that the extreme enso forcing modulated the increases of the winter precipitation ropelewski and halpert 1986 studied the climatic links between the extreme southern oscillation and precipitation anomalies over north america and showed the enso related precipitation signals this finding was also confirmed by kiladis and diaz 1989 grimm et al 1998 documented the influence of the extreme phases of so on precipitation variability over southern brazil using monthly precipitation data over 250 stations in turkey some coherent regions where precipitation anomaly is statistically correlated with the extreme phases of enso events were found by karabörk and kahya 2003 korea japan precipitation patterns were investigated by jin et al 2005 in relation to the enso far reaching effects they used lead lag correlation analysis for five categorized southern oscillation index soi and non exceedance precipitation probability time series and showed evidence of the enso precipitation correlation in sri lanka the kelani river basin was examined by chandimala and zubair 2007 focusing on the precipitation probability related to the enso events and sea surface temperature using principal component and correlation analyses a coupled general circulation model was employed by power et al 2006 for investigating the climatic responses of australian precipitation patterns to the enso forcing also cai et al 2011 examined the enso effects on the precipitation pattern over australia in terms of extratropical and tropical teleconnections triggered by the equatorial pacific sea surface temperature lee and julien 2016 showed teleconnection of the extreme phases of enso forcing and midlatitude precipitation variability in the korean peninsula and wang et al 2020 investigated the role of enso events in climatic links between chinese precipitation patterns and tropical cyclones previous studies of the enso related teleconnection have focused more on the warm phase of extreme events and the impacts of the cold phase of extreme events have less scientific attention since the latter is considered less distinct and causes less disastrous natural hazards than the former there has been few discussion in the literature about the teleconnections with a focus on comparative analysis and interpretation between the warm and cold phases of enso forcing this study fills this gap by examining two potentially enso driven precipitation anomalies in terms of their degree of magnitude and the temporal phase shift of the far reaching impacts as described in the relevant literature many previous studies concentrated on global or rather broad regional scale analyses despite the various studies of the enso related climate teleconnection little is known about the perspective of enso forcing on sub regional precipitation variability recently precipitation occurred in more localized and intensified events and the corresponding hydrologic extremes had a devastating effect on people s lives property and the natural environment therefore delving into the underlying influences of the extreme phases of climatic variation on various scopes of precipitation patterns provides a constructive way to predict and prepare unexpected natural hazards thus it is important to investigate systematically how the warm and cold phases of extreme enso events influence the sub regional precipitation patterns over the united states recently more comprehensive information about spatial and temporal variability of hydrometeorological parameters is being sought by potential users of the climate information as they are modulated by the extreme phases of enso forcing prior literature investigated the teleconnection between the extreme phases of southern oscillation and precipitation anomalies over the united states using the observational precipitation data from 1931 to 1980 50 years covering only 11 enso episodes ropelewski and halpert 1986 however we recently experienced noticeably severe extreme enso episodes including strong el niño events in 1982 1997 2015 and strong la niña events in 1988 1999 2010 and so on this study aims to provide updated climate information regarding the temporal phase spatial extent and intensity of enso related precipitation signals at each of several locations over the proposed study area using updated long term precipitation data 1895 2020 spanning up to 29 enso episodes in addition from the perspective of methodological approaches the present study provided an improved clustering technique the previous studies including ropelewski and halpert 1986 1987 used a subjective zoning method for determining core regions based on visual inspection over the harmonic dial maps this subjective graphical approach implies that the enso related hydrometeorological variability may include some uncertainties caused by other factors in the present study to categorize more objectively the candidate and core regions associated with the extreme phases of the enso forcing an ai artificial intelligence machine learning technique was employed for determining the enso related precipitation signal areas the main purpose of this study is to investigate precipitation variabilities over the united states associated with two opposite phases of enso events warm and cold phases using composite and harmonic analyses this study uses an improved description of temporal cycle and spatial outlook for the intensity time shift and areal boundary of the enso precipitation correlation also the present study compares the two types of teleconnections induced by el niño and la niña considering magnitude and trend of the significant responses using annual cycle and cross correlation analyses 2 data the monthly precipitation time series used in this study are based on 344 climate divisions covering all climate regions over the contiguous united states the source of the applied dataset is the national center for environmental information ncei which is a governmental organization under the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa monitors and operates the overall united states meteorology as shown in fig 1 the monthly precipitation sums data range from 1895 to 2020 and cover all the enso episodes 29 el niño and 22 la niña for classifying the candidate regions objectively köppen climate classification is used in harmonic analysis the contiguous united states was categorized into five main climate groups by the köppen climate classification e g a tropical b arid c temperate d continental and e polar with each group being divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns to identify a consistent far reaching effect of enso events on precipitation anomalies over the united states two sets of extreme enso episodes are selected considering a comprehensive scope of criteria defined by ropelewski and halpert 1987 1989 rasmusson and carpenter 1983 and kiladis and diaz 1989 the enso years for the two phases of extreme events selected in the present analysis are listed in table 1 the southern oscillation index soi is applied as an indicator of representing large scale climate variation over the central eastern pacific ocean enso this present analysis applied the soi data calculated and recorded by the noaa climate prediction center these soi time series are computed based on the difference of the standardized sea level pressure slp anomaly between tahiti and darwin australia 3 method 3 1 general concept to examine the spatiotemporal extent to which el niño la niña affect precipitation patterns over the united states an empirical method ropelewski and halpert 1986 annual cycle analysis and cross correlation analysis are employed with some changes and additions as shown in fig 2 the specific procedure of this analysis consists of mainly three steps namely data processing spatial and temporal analyses and comparative statistical assessment in the first step the original raw data are transformed into appropriate data formats e g ranked percentile modular coefficients and categorized sois in the second step candidate and core regions are determined using composite and harmonic analyses then in the last step el niño la niña related precipitation signals are compared using lag cross correlation and annual cycle analyses 3 2 data processing monthly precipitation data of 344 climate divisions over the united states are fitted to a gamma distribution for calculating the standard precipitation index spi using a method developed by mckee et al 1993 the spi is a probability index that considers only precipitation for assessing drought and wet condition as the dry and wet conditions become more severe the index becomes more negative or positive the fitted distribution can be transformed into a cumulative density function cdf of the standard normal distribution by the equal probability conversion technique as shown in fig 3 the spi time series which has a mean of zero and standard deviation of unity is used in the composite and harmonic analyses monthly precipitation time series are transformed into modular coefficients for carrying out annual cycle analysis these modular coefficients remove the effects of dispersed variance and mean values the precipitation data are expressed as percentages for the annual mean values the modular coefficient data are calculated by the rate of each monthly precipitation value to the monthly average value for the entire dataset it places all divisions on the same cycle as the stationary condition of the cyclic feature of the values at the same time in this present study lag cross correlation coefficients are computed from precipitation data and categorized soi time series on a seasonal basis to do this four seasonal precipitation and soi time series are formed by averaging three month values the four seasons consist of december february djf march may mam june august jja and september november son then all the soi values are categorized into five levels based on the magnitudes of individual data jin et al 2005 the five categories of the soi values are strong warm phase weak warm phase normal phase weak cold phase and strong cold phase on the other hand the seasonal precipitation data are converted into percentile ranked probability time series to remove periodicities in precipitation time series and to deal with the disparities among climate divisions the percentile ranked probability values are based on the weibull plotting position formula all precipitation values are ranked in ascending order and then divided by n 1 n size of data 3 3 spatial coherence monthly precipitation composites on a 24 month basis are computed for each climate division starting with the july preceding the event continuing through the june following the event year for both high and low phases of the so the july preceding the event is designated as jul while the june following the event year is expressed as jun composites are computed separately for each phase of the so the composite for each climate division is then fitted with the first harmonic of an idealized 24 month so cycle either warm or cold episodes this method assumes one precipitation peak or trough during the duration of an so event and that the so is phase locked to the annual cycle a 24 month compositing period was chosen since this defines the period during which one phase of the so goes through its entire cycle rasmusson and carpenter 1983 in the first harmonic cycle the amplitude and phase of a harmonic dial refer to the strength and time of the response respectively that is the amplitude refers to a representative magnitude of precipitation anomalies assumed to fluctuate in relation to the enso forcing and the phase indicates the timing of this fluctuation or the time at which the first harmonic has a maximum departure from the composite mean fig 4 the formula of the harmonic fits are as follows wilks 1995 1 y t y i 1 n 2 c i cos 2 π i t n β i y i 1 n 2 a i cos 2 π i t n b i sin 2 π i t n where 2 a i 2 n t 1 n y t cos 2 π i t n b i 2 n t 1 n y t sin 2 π i t n c i a i 2 b i 2 0 5 3 β i tan 1 b i a i a i 0 π 2 a i 0 tan 1 b i a i π a i 0 where y t is monthly precipitation value y is the mean precipitation value t is time of observation i is number of harmonic fits n is sample size c i is amplitude of the harmonic curve magnitude of curve β i is time of harmonic peak temporal phase of curve and a i and b i are fourier coefficients after the climate division composites are fitted with a 24 month harmonic the amplitude and phase of the curve is plotted as a vector for each station in the analysis convention chosen here the vector points toward the positive part of the cycle that is wetter than normal precipitation it is only after examining the composites described below that the actual sign of the so precipitation relationship can be determined this study is concerned with regional areas of the united states that exhibit strong so precipitation relationships over periods of many months therefore individual or isolated climate division that shows strong apparent relationships or areas that have short time scale relationships are not considered for further study the first harmonic for each point was replaced by a vector whose length and direction are equal to the amplitude and the phase of the harmonic respectively plotting the harmonics as vectors i e harmonic dial vectors on a map provides a method to spatially identify candidate geographic areas that appear to have a coherent enso response we attempted to choose the largest areas of coherent enso response where the coherence c is estimated through the computation of the ratio of the magnitude of the average vector to the arithmetic average value of the vector magnitudes to determine regions of coherent harmonic vectors the concept of coherence is defined as 4 c v cos θ 2 v sin θ 2 1 2 v where c is coherence value θ is angle of the vector and v is magnitude of the vector that is the numerator is the average vector magnitude of all harmonic vectors within the candidate regions and the denominator is the arithmetic average value of the vector magnitudes the analysis that follows is limited to areas for which values of the coherence were equal to or greater than 0 80 ropelewski and halpert 1986 this eliminates from the analysis regions that contain harmonic vectors with large amplitudes at a few stations which have little consistency in phase i e low coherence 3 4 temporal consistency aggregate composites are formed to detect the enso related precipitation signal seasons these signal seasons represent apparently consistent precipitation responses to extreme enso forcing all enso composite values in a candidate region are averaged and plotted on a 24 month period to cover the entire enso cycle and identify accurately the signal season one season within the aggregate composite is found by detecting a group of values showing more than five consecutive months with the same sign the event year and the following year are regarded as the responding period of enso phenomena considering the distance between the study area in midlatitude and the enso area in the pacific ocean index time series its are computed by temporally averaging precipitation values of the signal seasons for the entire years of record and by spatially averaging the precipitation data over the candidate regions the its values are used to quantify the temporal consistency of the enso impact on precipitation patterns temporal consistency rates for the candidate regions are computed using the rate of the number of years exhibiting enso signals in its to the number of all enso event years these temporal consistency rates are the determinant of the core regions showing consistent precipitation responses to enso phenomena in addition extreme precipitation events are examined in association with enso forcing as demonstrated by ropelewski and halpert 1986 they investigated climate linkage between enso events and extreme precipitation occurrences in the present study the number of years showing the enso related extreme precipitation signal is counted during the signal season to assign the highest and lowest levels of the extreme events the its time series are ranked from the highest value to the lowest value normalized by the entire dataset and transformed to the probability time series kahya and dracup 1994 the highest value is assigned to the probability of 80 its while the lowest value is assigned to the probability of 20 its a machine learning technique gaussian mixture model gmm was employed for diminishing the degree of subjectivity when candidate regions were determined based on the magnitude and temporal phase of the enso related precipitation signals the gmm algorithm is based on a statistical learning technique used in identifying a subset of discrete data which represents a feature space as a measurable characteristic the feature can describe phenomena being observed and the corresponding feature data can form a feature space by defining collectively the single or multidimensional range for the purpose of classifying the candidate regions objectively three features are selected in this study i e the intensity of the enso related precipitation teleconnection temporal cycle of each precipitation response and the köppen climate classification all harmonic dial vectors fall somewhere in the feature space the gmm method takes advantage of a probability model instead of objective functions of distance measurements as opposed to the commonly used clustering techniques e g fuzzy c means or k means which are based on distance measures in the gmm algorithm each cluster is classified by a parametric probability density based on a mixture model of probability distribution followed by dataset and the cluster structure is modeled by a finite mixture although the gmm technique has been considered a powerful tool for cluster analysis in many research fields there has been little attention given to its practical application in hydro climatological studies the dimension of the input data affects the results of cluster analysis largely because the gmm is based on a probability model therefore it is of great importance to select an appropriate feature subset for conducting cluster analysis multivariate distributions of a given dataset can be fitted with a normal mixture model for clustering structure the multivariate data y n which are composed of m independent samples with variables comprises c clusters in the dataset and a probability distribution is assigned to each sample with a density function a mixture probability density function pdf is weighed for the densities of c clusters as follows 5 p d f y n β i 1 c p i h i y n μ i v i where p i is mixing proportions h i is normal probability density function μ i is mean of h i and v i is variance matrix if an indicator vector of y is d d 1 d m with d m d n 1 d n i the mixture model log likelihood is as follows 6 l β y 1 y m d n i n 1 n ln i 1 c d n i p i h i y n μ i v i also the parameter β p 1 p i μ 1 μ i v 1 v i can be selected for maximizing the log likelihood here many normal mixture models can be chosen according to the geometric features of each cluster that includes the expression of the cluster variance matrix 3 5 comparative analyses the hypergeometric distribution test is employed to assign the significance level of the enso precipitation correlation a cumulative probability computed from the hypergeometric distribution gives an occurrence significance level of the relationship previously defined for both extreme phases of the enso haan 1977 conducted the hypergeometric distribution test calculating the cumulative probability that at least m successes are obtained in n trials from a finite population of size n containing k successes kahya and dracup 1994 used the hypergeometric test in terms of average value and high low extreme events in the present test two cases i and ii are considered according to the definition of a success in case i a success is defined as the occurrence of years that an its value associated with enso events is higher lower than the median while in case ii a success is defined as the occurrence of the year in which the values of an its are associated with enso events falls in the upper lower 20 of the distribution annual cycle analysis is used as a comparative interpretation of two enso effects on the precipitation anomaly from the perspective of magnitude and annual trend of the signal monthly precipitation time series are transformed into modular coefficients for carrying out annual cycle analysis these modular coefficients remove the effects of dispersed variance and mean values the precipitation data are expressed as percentages for the annual mean values the modular coefficient data are calculated by the rate of each monthly precipitation value compared to the monthly average value for the entire data these annual cycle plots make it possible to determine whether the extreme phases of warm and cold enso events modulate precipitation increasingly or decreasingly cross correlation coefficients are calculated on a seasonal basis to compare the positive and negative enso related precipitation signals five categorized soi data sets like the enso index are correlated with the monthly precipitation time series expressed by percentile ranked probability the resulting correlation coefficient values indicate the magnitude and sign of the relationship between the precipitation patterns and the enso forcing on a seasonal basis more detailed explanation of the data conversion and correlation procedure was described in the data processing of the method section 4 results 4 1 el niño precipitation relationship fig 5 shows the harmonic dial map with the detected candidate regions from the results of composite and harmonic analyses the vectorial map for precipitation indicates five regions of the united states that appear to have a coherent enso response that is the five candidate regions were detected namely the north west region nw the south west region sw the middle inland region mi the south east region se and the north east region ne as shown in table 2 composite precipitation indices for each region indicate that the nw sw mi sw and ne regions may have an enso related response the precipitation composites for the five candidate regions show clearly defined dry and wet seasons within the enso cycle and so they are explained in detail for further consideration in this analysis the north west region nw includes 30 climate divisions extending from washington and northern oregon to western montana and northern wyoming and including almost all of idaho the south west region sw occupies all of arizona the southern parts of california and nevada and part of utah the middle inland region mi consists of eastern colorado western kansas and oklahoma part of nebraska and all of new mexico and texas and covers 37 climate divisions the south east region se covers 32 climate divisions and includes all of florida and south carolina parts of louisiana mississippi alabama and almost all of georgia the north east region ne has the smallest area but contains the largest number of climate divisions among all candidate regions the ne region contains 42 climate divisions and covers almost all of north carolina and virginia eastern pennsylvania and new york and maryland delaware new jersey connecticut rhode island 4 2 la niña precipitation relationship for 22 la niña episodes which are the cold phase of enso the composite and harmonic analyses were performed on the monthly precipitation data the resulting map of harmonic dial vectors fig 6 indicates coherent responses within the five outlined regions the north west region nw the south west region sw the middle inland region mi south east region se and north east region ne enso composites of precipitation indices for each of the regions indicate that the five regions have well defined seasons of potentially significant enso related response the overall results of the composite and harmonic analyses are outlined in table 3 the north west region nw occupies all of washington almost all of oregon idaho montana and the northwestern part of wyoming and covers 34 climate divisions the south west region sw includes 23 climate divisions extending from southern california and to western texas and including all of arizona southern nevada and utah almost all of new mexico the middle inland region mi covers 42 climate divisions and includes all of nebraska kansas oklahoma eastern colorado northeastern new mexico and almost all of texas the south east region se consists of eastern north carolina and all of south carolina georgia alabama florida and covers 36 climate divisions the north east region ne has the smallest area contains 29 climate divisions and covers almost all of virginia and pennsylvania part of north carolina and west virginia and all of maryland delaware new jersey 4 3 comparative analysis of el niño and la niña the probability that the wet dry season occurs at random during the enso event years was tested by the hypergeometric distribution in case i the application of the hypergeometric distribution model results in a very low level of probability of occurrence by chance less than 0 008 for both events in case ii the probability is also very low for both phases of extreme events except for the se region for the la niña events the extreme wet precipitation conditions appear to be almost exclusively related to enso events in the 125 yr period overall results in tables 4 and 5 are also consistent with the high confirmation rates 72 86 for el niño events and 77 82 for la niña events for temporal consistency of the signals all of this implies that the relationship depicted in the aggregate composites is probably due to a nonrandom forcing mechanism i e the tropical thermal anomalies monthly precipitation time series are transformed into modular coefficients for carrying out annual cycle analysis from this resulting series el niño and la niña composites are formed and plotted along with the regional annual cycle figs 7 and 8 examination of this figures reveals two fundamental features first for a typical precipitation behavior during el niño events a suppressed precipitation of the annual cycle during the event year is followed by an enhanced precipitation of the annual cycle from the end of event year to the beginning of the following year second for typical precipitation behavior during la niña events a somewhat increased amplitude during the event year precedes a decreased amplitude from the end of the event year to the beginning of the following year this enhancement and suppression of magnitudes are roughly concurrent with the previously detected wet and dry signal seasons in five core regions also an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation fluctuations between the el niño and the la niña composites during a 24 month period are noticeable in summary the resulting findings suggest that the tropical heating cooling anomalies modulate the annual precipitation cycle within the united states by increasing decreasing table 6 displays the results of calculating cross correlation coefficients these values represent the intensity and sign of the correlation between the enso phenomena and precipitation anomalies this correlation analysis is conducted for the large scale climate indicator enso index and the seasonal precipitation anomalies which use five categorized soi data sets and percentile ranked probabilities respectively as a result the seasonal precipitation anomalies were significantly correlated with both extreme phases of so at a 0 05 significance level the highest positive correlation coefficient values are shown in the lag 0 to lag 2 cases over the nw region and negative correlations are found in the lag 0 to lag 2 lag 1 to lag 3 cases over the sw and mi se and ne regions for the strong warm phase soi condition for the strong cold phase soi condition the highest negative correlation coefficient values are found at the nw region with lag 0 to lag 2 cases and positive correlations are shown at the sw and mi se and ne regions with lag 0 and lag 2 lag 1 to lag 3 cases as a result the stronger warm and cold phases of enso forcing the more and less precipitation with lag time 0 to 3 seasons over the united states 5 discussion as shown in fig 5 the results of this study show negative positive precipitation response to the el niño events at the nw region sw mi se and ne regions during fall 0 to spring seasons especially the amplitude of the positive precipitation departure of an el niño year in the mi and se regions are even higher than that of non el niño years on the contrary during the cold phase of enso phenomena the opposite patterns are detected the monthly precipitation indices are wetter drier than normal for the nw sw mi se and ne core region from fall 0 through spring seasons the amplitude of the negative precipitation departure of the la niña year at the sw and mi regions are much higher than that of a non event year the opposite pattern of precipitation anomalies over the western parts of the united states between the nw region and the sw region was documented in earlier studies cayan and webb 1992 emery and hamilton 1985 cayan and peterson 1989 and it was consistently shown in the relevant composites of the extreme phase of enso forcing cayan and webb 1992 stated that during the mature warm phase of the enso phenomena in association with deepening of the aleutian island low pressure the northward shift of the north pacific storm paths causes wet conditions over alaska and western canada and dry conditions over the northwestern us on the other hand the study by emery and hamilton 1985 showed that during the la niña events the depression of the central pacific low which is located over the aleutian and gulf of alaska modulates a more active low in the eastern gulf of alaska these la niña related atmospheric activities affect the north pacific winter storms shifting toward the northwestern united states as a result wetter than average precipitation patterns are observed over the nw region cayan and peterson 1989 douglas and englehart 1984 investigated the us precipitation patterns in relation to the 1982 1983 enso event and linked the observed wet condition with intensification of a mid latitude trough in the southwestern region of the united states for the climatological causes for the teleconnection cayan and webb 1992 revealed that the sw wet conditions during the enso years are attributed to the mid latitude storm displacement by active southerlies bringing up moisture laden air currents from the subtropical pacific additionally they showed drier than normal conditions during the la niña events over the sw region webb and betancourt 1990 noted that the development of the aleutian low gives rise to the intensification of the sw frontal storms at the time of the extreme phase of enso a study by ely et al 1992 using sea level geopotential height anomalies associated with hydrologic variation over the sw region indicated that the dominant storm producing atmospheric circulation pattern is an anticyclone over the gulf of alaska and a cyclone off the california coast andrade and sellers 1987 examined significant changes in tropical cyclogenesis during enso episodes considering a possible influence of the presence of warm sea surface temperature off the coast of california and pointed out that these atmospheric changes cause frequent tropical cyclone dissipating over arizona also they emphasized that during the warm enso phase anomalous warm water of the west coast of the sw region is a driver of the enhanced precipitation pattern in fall and spring seasons which is the source of energy for the strengthened troughs this warm water weakens the trade wind inversion caused by sinking air resulting from subtropical high as a result the warm water allows more moisture bearing air to enter over the sw region from the perspective of storage effects the findings of andrade and sellers 1988 are consistent with the results of the present study in that the positive enso related precipitation signal has been detected in fall to spring seasons the sw region is one of regions over the united states in which cloudiness correlates significantly with the sea surface temperature over the tropical pacific ocean angell and korshover 1987 employed a combined parameter of sunshine duration and cloud amount as a cloudiness index and identified a significant increase of cloudiness over the sw during 1950 to 1985 they showed that during the warm phase of enso forcing cloudiness is 5 above average while below normal cloudiness exhibits at the time of cold events in addition douglas and englehart 1981 showed a significant correlation between tropical rainfall index and precipitation pattern of the sw region and emphasized that the teleconnection could be explained by the eastward moving low latitude troughs and the corresponding cloudiness webb and betancourt 1990 analyzed simultaneous and lag relationships between precipitation in the line islands and tucson arizona and pointed out tropical cloud masses moving northeastward from the central tropical pacific as a driving factor of the significant correlation this implies that the subtropical jet stream enhanced by the equatorial convection produces more intense storm systems over the sw region an explanation for the apparent enso related signal in the mi region is difficult to construct to find the physical mechanisms for the increased decreased precipitation in the signal seasons and the persistence of this apparent signal douglas and englehart 1984 investigated the heavy precipitation over the united states associated with 1982 1983 enso event and indicated that enhanced precipitation could be linked with the development of a midlatitude trough over the southern part of the country although positive sea surface temperature anomalies are not a normal enso related feature in the northeastern pacific in the enso cycle norton et al 1985 the occurrence of warm water might help to increase precipitation amounts in the mi region the precipitation response in the southeastern united states to the enso phenomena is consistent with ropelewski and halpert 1986 douglas and englehart 1981 ropelewski and halpert 1986 stated that the precipitation response to enso may be more easily explained in terms of direct or shorter range effects related to the enhanced subtropical jet stream and warmer than normal surface water over the pacific douglas and englehart 1981 suggested that the enso related precipitation signal may be an indication of a more direct link to enso forcing than a pacific north american teleconnection pattern pna active enso related convection is typical in the equatorial pacific south of the southeastern united states this convection has been linked to stronger than normal westerlies in the southern parts of the united states including gulf of mexico e g 200 mb enso composites in arkin 1982 and hence a tendency for more frequent storms and precipitation in the southeastern united states this possible direct link to the enso related forcing may account for the consistent precipitation response over the southeastern us rasmusson and wallace 1983 found a strengthened subtropical jet stream displaced southward from its normal position during the mature phases of enso event 1982 1983 this pronounced intensification of the jet stream drove numerous winter storms causing flooding events in the southern parts of the united states additionally they indicated that this region has shown abnormal wet conditions associated with past enso events tropical cyclones infiltrating into the region increase and decrease precipitation but are not the only mechanism responsible for the positive and negative precipitation responses during the warm and cold phases of enso forcing simonson et al 2022 stated that the occurrence of these precipitation patterns could be connected with southward shifted storm tracks over the ne region the circulation shifts are associated with intensified precipitation because of southerly wind anomalies and modulate enhanced moisture laden air transport into the region during the enso event years the persistent occurrence of warm cold sea surface temperatures over the central and eastern equatorial pacific triggers large scale atmospheric fluctuations in the middle latitude based on complex air sea coupled interactions as a result these enso related middle latitude circulations excite abnormal precipitation patterns over the united states 6 summary and conclusions teleconnection between two phases of enso thermal forcing and monthly precipitation anomalies in the united states was investigated using a set of empirical and statistical analyses such as harmonic analysis annual cycle composites and cross correlation analysis the details of the general results for enso related precipitation signals are outlined in tables 2 to 5 from the results of vectorial mapping through composite and harmonic analyses the proposed study area is classified into five core regions designated as the north west region nw the south west region sw the middle inland region mi the south east region se and the north east region ne they showed high levels of spatial coherence and temporal consistency with notable spatial range and amplitude of the precipitation response to enso phenomena the main conclusions are outlined as follows during the el niño events the monthly precipitation anomalies are below normal in the nw region and above normal in the sw mi se and ne regions for the nw region the nov 0 to mar is the signal seasons showing the noticeable consistency in precipitation in association with the warm enso forcing and the sep 0 to apr oct 0 to apr nov 0 to mar and nov 0 to mar are the signal seasons having a high level of temporal consistency in enso related precipitation responses for the sw mi se and ne regions respectively the spatial coherence of the five core regions for the warm thermal forcing ranges from 0 96 to 0 99 and the temporal consistency are between 0 72 and 0 86 especially the mi core region showed the highest magnitude of the positive precipitation departure for the el niño years for the la niña events the monthly precipitation anomalies are above normal in nw region and below normal in the sw mi se and ne regions the results of the composite and harmonic analyses show that the signal season for wet period is october 0 to february and the signal seasons for dry periods are aug 0 to jun oct 0 to jun nov 0 to may and nov 0 to may for the sw mi se and ne regions respectively the spatial coherence rates for the five core regions for la niña events range from 0 94 to 99 and the temporal consistency for each core region are 0 77 to 0 82 comparative analyses of precipitation responses to both warm and cold enso events reveal the high significance level of the enso precipitation correlation with an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation anomalies the nw region shows negative positive tendency for warm cold phases while the sw mi se and ne regions show positive negative responses to the warm cold phases of enso episodes above normal precipitation anomalies during the el niño thermal forcing are more significant than below normal precipitation departures during the la niña events from the results of annual cycle analysis the tropical heating and cooling anomalies of sea surface temperature modulate the annual precipitation cycle over the united states by increasing or decreasing the highest positive negative correlation coefficient values are shown in the lag 0 to lag 2 cases for the nw core regions for the strong warm cold phase soi condition for the sw and mi regions negative positive correlations are found in lag 0 to lag 2 cases for strong warm cold phase soi condition and the same correlations are shown in lag 1 to lag 3 cases for the se and ne regions that is the stronger warm and cold phases of enso forcing the more and less precipitation with lag time 0 to 3 seasons over the united states from the findings above it is concluded that middle latitude precipitation responses to the el niño and la niña phenomena are detectable over the contiguous united states credit authorship contribution statement jai hong lee

2123,this study describes a comprehensive investigation of the contiguous united states precipitation patterns in relation to the warm and cold phases of el niño southern oscillation enso using a set of empirical and statistical analyses such as harmonic analysis annual cycle composites and cross correlation analysis monthly precipitation composites for the first harmonic covering 24 month enso events are formed for all climate divisions over the united states spanning up to 29 enso episodes from the harmonic vectorial maps plotted on the study area each vector reveals both intensity and temporal phase of the enso related precipitation teleconnection and the corresponding candidate and core regions are determined using a machine learning technique of gaussian mixture model gmm based on magnitude and temporal phase of climate signal and köppen climate classification as a result of vectorial mapping five core regions were designated as north west region nw south west region sw middle inland region mi south east region se and north east region ne during fall 0 to spring seasons the results of this analysis show below above normal precipitation response to the el niño events at the nw region sw mi se and ne regions while the opposite patterns are detected for the cold phase of enso the temporal consistency values were 0 72 to 0 86 0 77 to 0 82 and spatial coherence values ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 0 94 to 0 99 for the warm cold events comparative analyses of precipitation responses to both el niño and la niña events reveal the high significance level of the enso related precipitation signals with an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation anomalies positive precipitation anomalies during the el niño thermal forcing are more significant than negative precipitation

precipitation index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the el niño southern oscillation enso is a combined phenomenon of fluctuating sea surface temperature and atmospheric circulation over the central and eastern pacific ocean it has a critical influence on climate patterns all over the world wmo 2014 these large scale naturally occurring phenomena have been investigated at regional and global scale since the extreme phases of the enso episodes can cause major hydrologic extremes e g floods and droughts in various parts throughout the world many scientific approaches for understanding these phenomena have been providing us a chance to prepare for the disastrous hazards such as torrential rainstorm floods and droughts walker 1923 walker and bliss 1932 were the first to study the impacts of the southern oscillation so on the indian precipitation variability since then a number of global scale studies related to the enso extreme phases showed various notable climatic links between precipitation patterns and either phase of these opposite extreme events in many areas throughout the globe since berlage 1966 found the enso extreme events correlated well with precipitation anomalies on a global basis rasmusson and carpenter 1983 related the precipitation and temperature patterns to the extreme phase of the southern oscillation and identified a significant link between the two variations also ropelewski and halpert 1987 1989 investigated temporal and spatial ranges showing consistent responses of the precipitation patterns over a variety of areas throughout the world to the extreme phases of the enso episodes and showed significant correlations of the enso forcing and precipitation patterns which were also identified by kiladis and diaz 1989 more recently westra et al 2013 used a mann kendall nonparametric test and a nonstationary generalized extreme value analysis to identify monotonic trends in annual maximum daily precipitation on a global basis and to test for a significant association with near surface air temperature averaged globally on a regional basis many studies found plausible evidence of the enso far reaching effect on the low and mid latitude climate variabilities as documented by douglas and englehart 1981 rasmusson and wallace 1983 ropelewski and halpert 1986 redmond and koch 1991 and kahya and dracup 1994 for midlatitude regions several studies noted the enso related precipitation correlation for the southeastern united states douglas and englehart 1981 revealed that the extreme enso forcing modulated the increases of the winter precipitation ropelewski and halpert 1986 studied the climatic links between the extreme southern oscillation and precipitation anomalies over north america and showed the enso related precipitation signals this finding was also confirmed by kiladis and diaz 1989 grimm et al 1998 documented the influence of the extreme phases of so on precipitation variability over southern brazil using monthly precipitation data over 250 stations in turkey some coherent regions where precipitation anomaly is statistically correlated with the extreme phases of enso events were found by karabörk and kahya 2003 korea japan precipitation patterns were investigated by jin et al 2005 in relation to the enso far reaching effects they used lead lag correlation analysis for five categorized southern oscillation index soi and non exceedance precipitation probability time series and showed evidence of the enso precipitation correlation in sri lanka the kelani river basin was examined by chandimala and zubair 2007 focusing on the precipitation probability related to the enso events and sea surface temperature using principal component and correlation analyses a coupled general circulation model was employed by power et al 2006 for investigating the climatic responses of australian precipitation patterns to the enso forcing also cai et al 2011 examined the enso effects on the precipitation pattern over australia in terms of extratropical and tropical teleconnections triggered by the equatorial pacific sea surface temperature lee and julien 2016 showed teleconnection of the extreme phases of enso forcing and midlatitude precipitation variability in the korean peninsula and wang et al 2020 investigated the role of enso events in climatic links between chinese precipitation patterns and tropical cyclones previous studies of the enso related teleconnection have focused more on the warm phase of extreme events and the impacts of the cold phase of extreme events have less scientific attention since the latter is considered less distinct and causes less disastrous natural hazards than the former there has been few discussion in the literature about the teleconnections with a focus on comparative analysis and interpretation between the warm and cold phases of enso forcing this study fills this gap by examining two potentially enso driven precipitation anomalies in terms of their degree of magnitude and the temporal phase shift of the far reaching impacts as described in the relevant literature many previous studies concentrated on global or rather broad regional scale analyses despite the various studies of the enso related climate teleconnection little is known about the perspective of enso forcing on sub regional precipitation variability recently precipitation occurred in more localized and intensified events and the corresponding hydrologic extremes had a devastating effect on people s lives property and the natural environment therefore delving into the underlying influences of the extreme phases of climatic variation on various scopes of precipitation patterns provides a constructive way to predict and prepare unexpected natural hazards thus it is important to investigate systematically how the warm and cold phases of extreme enso events influence the sub regional precipitation patterns over the united states recently more comprehensive information about spatial and temporal variability of hydrometeorological parameters is being sought by potential users of the climate information as they are modulated by the extreme phases of enso forcing prior literature investigated the teleconnection between the extreme phases of southern oscillation and precipitation anomalies over the united states using the observational precipitation data from 1931 to 1980 50 years covering only 11 enso episodes ropelewski and halpert 1986 however we recently experienced noticeably severe extreme enso episodes including strong el niño events in 1982 1997 2015 and strong la niña events in 1988 1999 2010 and so on this study aims to provide updated climate information regarding the temporal phase spatial extent and intensity of enso related precipitation signals at each of several locations over the proposed study area using updated long term precipitation data 1895 2020 spanning up to 29 enso episodes in addition from the perspective of methodological approaches the present study provided an improved clustering technique the previous studies including ropelewski and halpert 1986 1987 used a subjective zoning method for determining core regions based on visual inspection over the harmonic dial maps this subjective graphical approach implies that the enso related hydrometeorological variability may include some uncertainties caused by other factors in the present study to categorize more objectively the candidate and core regions associated with the extreme phases of the enso forcing an ai artificial intelligence machine learning technique was employed for determining the enso related precipitation signal areas the main purpose of this study is to investigate precipitation variabilities over the united states associated with two opposite phases of enso events warm and cold phases using composite and harmonic analyses this study uses an improved description of temporal cycle and spatial outlook for the intensity time shift and areal boundary of the enso precipitation correlation also the present study compares the two types of teleconnections induced by el niño and la niña considering magnitude and trend of the significant responses using annual cycle and cross correlation analyses 2 data the monthly precipitation time series used in this study are based on 344 climate divisions covering all climate regions over the contiguous united states the source of the applied dataset is the national center for environmental information ncei which is a governmental organization under the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa monitors and operates the overall united states meteorology as shown in fig 1 the monthly precipitation sums data range from 1895 to 2020 and cover all the enso episodes 29 el niño and 22 la niña for classifying the candidate regions objectively köppen climate classification is used in harmonic analysis the contiguous united states was categorized into five main climate groups by the köppen climate classification e g a tropical b arid c temperate d continental and e polar with each group being divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns to identify a consistent far reaching effect of enso events on precipitation anomalies over the united states two sets of extreme enso episodes are selected considering a comprehensive scope of criteria defined by ropelewski and halpert 1987 1989 rasmusson and carpenter 1983 and kiladis and diaz 1989 the enso years for the two phases of extreme events selected in the present analysis are listed in table 1 the southern oscillation index soi is applied as an indicator of representing large scale climate variation over the central eastern pacific ocean enso this present analysis applied the soi data calculated and recorded by the noaa climate prediction center these soi time series are computed based on the difference of the standardized sea level pressure slp anomaly between tahiti and darwin australia 3 method 3 1 general concept to examine the spatiotemporal extent to which el niño la niña affect precipitation patterns over the united states an empirical method ropelewski and halpert 1986 annual cycle analysis and cross correlation analysis are employed with some changes and additions as shown in fig 2 the specific procedure of this analysis consists of mainly three steps namely data processing spatial and temporal analyses and comparative statistical assessment in the first step the original raw data are transformed into appropriate data formats e g ranked percentile modular coefficients and categorized sois in the second step candidate and core regions are determined using composite and harmonic analyses then in the last step el niño la niña related precipitation signals are compared using lag cross correlation and annual cycle analyses 3 2 data processing monthly precipitation data of 344 climate divisions over the united states are fitted to a gamma distribution for calculating the standard precipitation index spi using a method developed by mckee et al 1993 the spi is a probability index that considers only precipitation for assessing drought and wet condition as the dry and wet conditions become more severe the index becomes more negative or positive the fitted distribution can be transformed into a cumulative density function cdf of the standard normal distribution by the equal probability conversion technique as shown in fig 3 the spi time series which has a mean of zero and standard deviation of unity is used in the composite and harmonic analyses monthly precipitation time series are transformed into modular coefficients for carrying out annual cycle analysis these modular coefficients remove the effects of dispersed variance and mean values the precipitation data are expressed as percentages for the annual mean values the modular coefficient data are calculated by the rate of each monthly precipitation value to the monthly average value for the entire dataset it places all divisions on the same cycle as the stationary condition of the cyclic feature of the values at the same time in this present study lag cross correlation coefficients are computed from precipitation data and categorized soi time series on a seasonal basis to do this four seasonal precipitation and soi time series are formed by averaging three month values the four seasons consist of december february djf march may mam june august jja and september november son then all the soi values are categorized into five levels based on the magnitudes of individual data jin et al 2005 the five categories of the soi values are strong warm phase weak warm phase normal phase weak cold phase and strong cold phase on the other hand the seasonal precipitation data are converted into percentile ranked probability time series to remove periodicities in precipitation time series and to deal with the disparities among climate divisions the percentile ranked probability values are based on the weibull plotting position formula all precipitation values are ranked in ascending order and then divided by n 1 n size of data 3 3 spatial coherence monthly precipitation composites on a 24 month basis are computed for each climate division starting with the july preceding the event continuing through the june following the event year for both high and low phases of the so the july preceding the event is designated as jul while the june following the event year is expressed as jun composites are computed separately for each phase of the so the composite for each climate division is then fitted with the first harmonic of an idealized 24 month so cycle either warm or cold episodes this method assumes one precipitation peak or trough during the duration of an so event and that the so is phase locked to the annual cycle a 24 month compositing period was chosen since this defines the period during which one phase of the so goes through its entire cycle rasmusson and carpenter 1983 in the first harmonic cycle the amplitude and phase of a harmonic dial refer to the strength and time of the response respectively that is the amplitude refers to a representative magnitude of precipitation anomalies assumed to fluctuate in relation to the enso forcing and the phase indicates the timing of this fluctuation or the time at which the first harmonic has a maximum departure from the composite mean fig 4 the formula of the harmonic fits are as follows wilks 1995 1 y t y i 1 n 2 c i cos 2 π i t n β i y i 1 n 2 a i cos 2 π i t n b i sin 2 π i t n where 2 a i 2 n t 1 n y t cos 2 π i t n b i 2 n t 1 n y t sin 2 π i t n c i a i 2 b i 2 0 5 3 β i tan 1 b i a i a i 0 π 2 a i 0 tan 1 b i a i π a i 0 where y t is monthly precipitation value y is the mean precipitation value t is time of observation i is number of harmonic fits n is sample size c i is amplitude of the harmonic curve magnitude of curve β i is time of harmonic peak temporal phase of curve and a i and b i are fourier coefficients after the climate division composites are fitted with a 24 month harmonic the amplitude and phase of the curve is plotted as a vector for each station in the analysis convention chosen here the vector points toward the positive part of the cycle that is wetter than normal precipitation it is only after examining the composites described below that the actual sign of the so precipitation relationship can be determined this study is concerned with regional areas of the united states that exhibit strong so precipitation relationships over periods of many months therefore individual or isolated climate division that shows strong apparent relationships or areas that have short time scale relationships are not considered for further study the first harmonic for each point was replaced by a vector whose length and direction are equal to the amplitude and the phase of the harmonic respectively plotting the harmonics as vectors i e harmonic dial vectors on a map provides a method to spatially identify candidate geographic areas that appear to have a coherent enso response we attempted to choose the largest areas of coherent enso response where the coherence c is estimated through the computation of the ratio of the magnitude of the average vector to the arithmetic average value of the vector magnitudes to determine regions of coherent harmonic vectors the concept of coherence is defined as 4 c v cos θ 2 v sin θ 2 1 2 v where c is coherence value θ is angle of the vector and v is magnitude of the vector that is the numerator is the average vector magnitude of all harmonic vectors within the candidate regions and the denominator is the arithmetic average value of the vector magnitudes the analysis that follows is limited to areas for which values of the coherence were equal to or greater than 0 80 ropelewski and halpert 1986 this eliminates from the analysis regions that contain harmonic vectors with large amplitudes at a few stations which have little consistency in phase i e low coherence 3 4 temporal consistency aggregate composites are formed to detect the enso related precipitation signal seasons these signal seasons represent apparently consistent precipitation responses to extreme enso forcing all enso composite values in a candidate region are averaged and plotted on a 24 month period to cover the entire enso cycle and identify accurately the signal season one season within the aggregate composite is found by detecting a group of values showing more than five consecutive months with the same sign the event year and the following year are regarded as the responding period of enso phenomena considering the distance between the study area in midlatitude and the enso area in the pacific ocean index time series its are computed by temporally averaging precipitation values of the signal seasons for the entire years of record and by spatially averaging the precipitation data over the candidate regions the its values are used to quantify the temporal consistency of the enso impact on precipitation patterns temporal consistency rates for the candidate regions are computed using the rate of the number of years exhibiting enso signals in its to the number of all enso event years these temporal consistency rates are the determinant of the core regions showing consistent precipitation responses to enso phenomena in addition extreme precipitation events are examined in association with enso forcing as demonstrated by ropelewski and halpert 1986 they investigated climate linkage between enso events and extreme precipitation occurrences in the present study the number of years showing the enso related extreme precipitation signal is counted during the signal season to assign the highest and lowest levels of the extreme events the its time series are ranked from the highest value to the lowest value normalized by the entire dataset and transformed to the probability time series kahya and dracup 1994 the highest value is assigned to the probability of 80 its while the lowest value is assigned to the probability of 20 its a machine learning technique gaussian mixture model gmm was employed for diminishing the degree of subjectivity when candidate regions were determined based on the magnitude and temporal phase of the enso related precipitation signals the gmm algorithm is based on a statistical learning technique used in identifying a subset of discrete data which represents a feature space as a measurable characteristic the feature can describe phenomena being observed and the corresponding feature data can form a feature space by defining collectively the single or multidimensional range for the purpose of classifying the candidate regions objectively three features are selected in this study i e the intensity of the enso related precipitation teleconnection temporal cycle of each precipitation response and the köppen climate classification all harmonic dial vectors fall somewhere in the feature space the gmm method takes advantage of a probability model instead of objective functions of distance measurements as opposed to the commonly used clustering techniques e g fuzzy c means or k means which are based on distance measures in the gmm algorithm each cluster is classified by a parametric probability density based on a mixture model of probability distribution followed by dataset and the cluster structure is modeled by a finite mixture although the gmm technique has been considered a powerful tool for cluster analysis in many research fields there has been little attention given to its practical application in hydro climatological studies the dimension of the input data affects the results of cluster analysis largely because the gmm is based on a probability model therefore it is of great importance to select an appropriate feature subset for conducting cluster analysis multivariate distributions of a given dataset can be fitted with a normal mixture model for clustering structure the multivariate data y n which are composed of m independent samples with variables comprises c clusters in the dataset and a probability distribution is assigned to each sample with a density function a mixture probability density function pdf is weighed for the densities of c clusters as follows 5 p d f y n β i 1 c p i h i y n μ i v i where p i is mixing proportions h i is normal probability density function μ i is mean of h i and v i is variance matrix if an indicator vector of y is d d 1 d m with d m d n 1 d n i the mixture model log likelihood is as follows 6 l β y 1 y m d n i n 1 n ln i 1 c d n i p i h i y n μ i v i also the parameter β p 1 p i μ 1 μ i v 1 v i can be selected for maximizing the log likelihood here many normal mixture models can be chosen according to the geometric features of each cluster that includes the expression of the cluster variance matrix 3 5 comparative analyses the hypergeometric distribution test is employed to assign the significance level of the enso precipitation correlation a cumulative probability computed from the hypergeometric distribution gives an occurrence significance level of the relationship previously defined for both extreme phases of the enso haan 1977 conducted the hypergeometric distribution test calculating the cumulative probability that at least m successes are obtained in n trials from a finite population of size n containing k successes kahya and dracup 1994 used the hypergeometric test in terms of average value and high low extreme events in the present test two cases i and ii are considered according to the definition of a success in case i a success is defined as the occurrence of years that an its value associated with enso events is higher lower than the median while in case ii a success is defined as the occurrence of the year in which the values of an its are associated with enso events falls in the upper lower 20 of the distribution annual cycle analysis is used as a comparative interpretation of two enso effects on the precipitation anomaly from the perspective of magnitude and annual trend of the signal monthly precipitation time series are transformed into modular coefficients for carrying out annual cycle analysis these modular coefficients remove the effects of dispersed variance and mean values the precipitation data are expressed as percentages for the annual mean values the modular coefficient data are calculated by the rate of each monthly precipitation value compared to the monthly average value for the entire data these annual cycle plots make it possible to determine whether the extreme phases of warm and cold enso events modulate precipitation increasingly or decreasingly cross correlation coefficients are calculated on a seasonal basis to compare the positive and negative enso related precipitation signals five categorized soi data sets like the enso index are correlated with the monthly precipitation time series expressed by percentile ranked probability the resulting correlation coefficient values indicate the magnitude and sign of the relationship between the precipitation patterns and the enso forcing on a seasonal basis more detailed explanation of the data conversion and correlation procedure was described in the data processing of the method section 4 results 4 1 el niño precipitation relationship fig 5 shows the harmonic dial map with the detected candidate regions from the results of composite and harmonic analyses the vectorial map for precipitation indicates five regions of the united states that appear to have a coherent enso response that is the five candidate regions were detected namely the north west region nw the south west region sw the middle inland region mi the south east region se and the north east region ne as shown in table 2 composite precipitation indices for each region indicate that the nw sw mi sw and ne regions may have an enso related response the precipitation composites for the five candidate regions show clearly defined dry and wet seasons within the enso cycle and so they are explained in detail for further consideration in this analysis the north west region nw includes 30 climate divisions extending from washington and northern oregon to western montana and northern wyoming and including almost all of idaho the south west region sw occupies all of arizona the southern parts of california and nevada and part of utah the middle inland region mi consists of eastern colorado western kansas and oklahoma part of nebraska and all of new mexico and texas and covers 37 climate divisions the south east region se covers 32 climate divisions and includes all of florida and south carolina parts of louisiana mississippi alabama and almost all of georgia the north east region ne has the smallest area but contains the largest number of climate divisions among all candidate regions the ne region contains 42 climate divisions and covers almost all of north carolina and virginia eastern pennsylvania and new york and maryland delaware new jersey connecticut rhode island 4 2 la niña precipitation relationship for 22 la niña episodes which are the cold phase of enso the composite and harmonic analyses were performed on the monthly precipitation data the resulting map of harmonic dial vectors fig 6 indicates coherent responses within the five outlined regions the north west region nw the south west region sw the middle inland region mi south east region se and north east region ne enso composites of precipitation indices for each of the regions indicate that the five regions have well defined seasons of potentially significant enso related response the overall results of the composite and harmonic analyses are outlined in table 3 the north west region nw occupies all of washington almost all of oregon idaho montana and the northwestern part of wyoming and covers 34 climate divisions the south west region sw includes 23 climate divisions extending from southern california and to western texas and including all of arizona southern nevada and utah almost all of new mexico the middle inland region mi covers 42 climate divisions and includes all of nebraska kansas oklahoma eastern colorado northeastern new mexico and almost all of texas the south east region se consists of eastern north carolina and all of south carolina georgia alabama florida and covers 36 climate divisions the north east region ne has the smallest area contains 29 climate divisions and covers almost all of virginia and pennsylvania part of north carolina and west virginia and all of maryland delaware new jersey 4 3 comparative analysis of el niño and la niña the probability that the wet dry season occurs at random during the enso event years was tested by the hypergeometric distribution in case i the application of the hypergeometric distribution model results in a very low level of probability of occurrence by chance less than 0 008 for both events in case ii the probability is also very low for both phases of extreme events except for the se region for the la niña events the extreme wet precipitation conditions appear to be almost exclusively related to enso events in the 125 yr period overall results in tables 4 and 5 are also consistent with the high confirmation rates 72 86 for el niño events and 77 82 for la niña events for temporal consistency of the signals all of this implies that the relationship depicted in the aggregate composites is probably due to a nonrandom forcing mechanism i e the tropical thermal anomalies monthly precipitation time series are transformed into modular coefficients for carrying out annual cycle analysis from this resulting series el niño and la niña composites are formed and plotted along with the regional annual cycle figs 7 and 8 examination of this figures reveals two fundamental features first for a typical precipitation behavior during el niño events a suppressed precipitation of the annual cycle during the event year is followed by an enhanced precipitation of the annual cycle from the end of event year to the beginning of the following year second for typical precipitation behavior during la niña events a somewhat increased amplitude during the event year precedes a decreased amplitude from the end of the event year to the beginning of the following year this enhancement and suppression of magnitudes are roughly concurrent with the previously detected wet and dry signal seasons in five core regions also an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation fluctuations between the el niño and the la niña composites during a 24 month period are noticeable in summary the resulting findings suggest that the tropical heating cooling anomalies modulate the annual precipitation cycle within the united states by increasing decreasing table 6 displays the results of calculating cross correlation coefficients these values represent the intensity and sign of the correlation between the enso phenomena and precipitation anomalies this correlation analysis is conducted for the large scale climate indicator enso index and the seasonal precipitation anomalies which use five categorized soi data sets and percentile ranked probabilities respectively as a result the seasonal precipitation anomalies were significantly correlated with both extreme phases of so at a 0 05 significance level the highest positive correlation coefficient values are shown in the lag 0 to lag 2 cases over the nw region and negative correlations are found in the lag 0 to lag 2 lag 1 to lag 3 cases over the sw and mi se and ne regions for the strong warm phase soi condition for the strong cold phase soi condition the highest negative correlation coefficient values are found at the nw region with lag 0 to lag 2 cases and positive correlations are shown at the sw and mi se and ne regions with lag 0 and lag 2 lag 1 to lag 3 cases as a result the stronger warm and cold phases of enso forcing the more and less precipitation with lag time 0 to 3 seasons over the united states 5 discussion as shown in fig 5 the results of this study show negative positive precipitation response to the el niño events at the nw region sw mi se and ne regions during fall 0 to spring seasons especially the amplitude of the positive precipitation departure of an el niño year in the mi and se regions are even higher than that of non el niño years on the contrary during the cold phase of enso phenomena the opposite patterns are detected the monthly precipitation indices are wetter drier than normal for the nw sw mi se and ne core region from fall 0 through spring seasons the amplitude of the negative precipitation departure of the la niña year at the sw and mi regions are much higher than that of a non event year the opposite pattern of precipitation anomalies over the western parts of the united states between the nw region and the sw region was documented in earlier studies cayan and webb 1992 emery and hamilton 1985 cayan and peterson 1989 and it was consistently shown in the relevant composites of the extreme phase of enso forcing cayan and webb 1992 stated that during the mature warm phase of the enso phenomena in association with deepening of the aleutian island low pressure the northward shift of the north pacific storm paths causes wet conditions over alaska and western canada and dry conditions over the northwestern us on the other hand the study by emery and hamilton 1985 showed that during the la niña events the depression of the central pacific low which is located over the aleutian and gulf of alaska modulates a more active low in the eastern gulf of alaska these la niña related atmospheric activities affect the north pacific winter storms shifting toward the northwestern united states as a result wetter than average precipitation patterns are observed over the nw region cayan and peterson 1989 douglas and englehart 1984 investigated the us precipitation patterns in relation to the 1982 1983 enso event and linked the observed wet condition with intensification of a mid latitude trough in the southwestern region of the united states for the climatological causes for the teleconnection cayan and webb 1992 revealed that the sw wet conditions during the enso years are attributed to the mid latitude storm displacement by active southerlies bringing up moisture laden air currents from the subtropical pacific additionally they showed drier than normal conditions during the la niña events over the sw region webb and betancourt 1990 noted that the development of the aleutian low gives rise to the intensification of the sw frontal storms at the time of the extreme phase of enso a study by ely et al 1992 using sea level geopotential height anomalies associated with hydrologic variation over the sw region indicated that the dominant storm producing atmospheric circulation pattern is an anticyclone over the gulf of alaska and a cyclone off the california coast andrade and sellers 1987 examined significant changes in tropical cyclogenesis during enso episodes considering a possible influence of the presence of warm sea surface temperature off the coast of california and pointed out that these atmospheric changes cause frequent tropical cyclone dissipating over arizona also they emphasized that during the warm enso phase anomalous warm water of the west coast of the sw region is a driver of the enhanced precipitation pattern in fall and spring seasons which is the source of energy for the strengthened troughs this warm water weakens the trade wind inversion caused by sinking air resulting from subtropical high as a result the warm water allows more moisture bearing air to enter over the sw region from the perspective of storage effects the findings of andrade and sellers 1988 are consistent with the results of the present study in that the positive enso related precipitation signal has been detected in fall to spring seasons the sw region is one of regions over the united states in which cloudiness correlates significantly with the sea surface temperature over the tropical pacific ocean angell and korshover 1987 employed a combined parameter of sunshine duration and cloud amount as a cloudiness index and identified a significant increase of cloudiness over the sw during 1950 to 1985 they showed that during the warm phase of enso forcing cloudiness is 5 above average while below normal cloudiness exhibits at the time of cold events in addition douglas and englehart 1981 showed a significant correlation between tropical rainfall index and precipitation pattern of the sw region and emphasized that the teleconnection could be explained by the eastward moving low latitude troughs and the corresponding cloudiness webb and betancourt 1990 analyzed simultaneous and lag relationships between precipitation in the line islands and tucson arizona and pointed out tropical cloud masses moving northeastward from the central tropical pacific as a driving factor of the significant correlation this implies that the subtropical jet stream enhanced by the equatorial convection produces more intense storm systems over the sw region an explanation for the apparent enso related signal in the mi region is difficult to construct to find the physical mechanisms for the increased decreased precipitation in the signal seasons and the persistence of this apparent signal douglas and englehart 1984 investigated the heavy precipitation over the united states associated with 1982 1983 enso event and indicated that enhanced precipitation could be linked with the development of a midlatitude trough over the southern part of the country although positive sea surface temperature anomalies are not a normal enso related feature in the northeastern pacific in the enso cycle norton et al 1985 the occurrence of warm water might help to increase precipitation amounts in the mi region the precipitation response in the southeastern united states to the enso phenomena is consistent with ropelewski and halpert 1986 douglas and englehart 1981 ropelewski and halpert 1986 stated that the precipitation response to enso may be more easily explained in terms of direct or shorter range effects related to the enhanced subtropical jet stream and warmer than normal surface water over the pacific douglas and englehart 1981 suggested that the enso related precipitation signal may be an indication of a more direct link to enso forcing than a pacific north american teleconnection pattern pna active enso related convection is typical in the equatorial pacific south of the southeastern united states this convection has been linked to stronger than normal westerlies in the southern parts of the united states including gulf of mexico e g 200 mb enso composites in arkin 1982 and hence a tendency for more frequent storms and precipitation in the southeastern united states this possible direct link to the enso related forcing may account for the consistent precipitation response over the southeastern us rasmusson and wallace 1983 found a strengthened subtropical jet stream displaced southward from its normal position during the mature phases of enso event 1982 1983 this pronounced intensification of the jet stream drove numerous winter storms causing flooding events in the southern parts of the united states additionally they indicated that this region has shown abnormal wet conditions associated with past enso events tropical cyclones infiltrating into the region increase and decrease precipitation but are not the only mechanism responsible for the positive and negative precipitation responses during the warm and cold phases of enso forcing simonson et al 2022 stated that the occurrence of these precipitation patterns could be connected with southward shifted storm tracks over the ne region the circulation shifts are associated with intensified precipitation because of southerly wind anomalies and modulate enhanced moisture laden air transport into the region during the enso event years the persistent occurrence of warm cold sea surface temperatures over the central and eastern equatorial pacific triggers large scale atmospheric fluctuations in the middle latitude based on complex air sea coupled interactions as a result these enso related middle latitude circulations excite abnormal precipitation patterns over the united states 6 summary and conclusions teleconnection between two phases of enso thermal forcing and monthly precipitation anomalies in the united states was investigated using a set of empirical and statistical analyses such as harmonic analysis annual cycle composites and cross correlation analysis the details of the general results for enso related precipitation signals are outlined in tables 2 to 5 from the results of vectorial mapping through composite and harmonic analyses the proposed study area is classified into five core regions designated as the north west region nw the south west region sw the middle inland region mi the south east region se and the north east region ne they showed high levels of spatial coherence and temporal consistency with notable spatial range and amplitude of the precipitation response to enso phenomena the main conclusions are outlined as follows during the el niño events the monthly precipitation anomalies are below normal in the nw region and above normal in the sw mi se and ne regions for the nw region the nov 0 to mar is the signal seasons showing the noticeable consistency in precipitation in association with the warm enso forcing and the sep 0 to apr oct 0 to apr nov 0 to mar and nov 0 to mar are the signal seasons having a high level of temporal consistency in enso related precipitation responses for the sw mi se and ne regions respectively the spatial coherence of the five core regions for the warm thermal forcing ranges from 0 96 to 0 99 and the temporal consistency are between 0 72 and 0 86 especially the mi core region showed the highest magnitude of the positive precipitation departure for the el niño years for the la niña events the monthly precipitation anomalies are above normal in nw region and below normal in the sw mi se and ne regions the results of the composite and harmonic analyses show that the signal season for wet period is october 0 to february and the signal seasons for dry periods are aug 0 to jun oct 0 to jun nov 0 to may and nov 0 to may for the sw mi se and ne regions respectively the spatial coherence rates for the five core regions for la niña events range from 0 94 to 99 and the temporal consistency for each core region are 0 77 to 0 82 comparative analyses of precipitation responses to both warm and cold enso events reveal the high significance level of the enso precipitation correlation with an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation anomalies the nw region shows negative positive tendency for warm cold phases while the sw mi se and ne regions show positive negative responses to the warm cold phases of enso episodes above normal precipitation anomalies during the el niño thermal forcing are more significant than below normal precipitation departures during the la niña events from the results of annual cycle analysis the tropical heating and cooling anomalies of sea surface temperature modulate the annual precipitation cycle over the united states by increasing or decreasing the highest positive negative correlation coefficient values are shown in the lag 0 to lag 2 cases for the nw core regions for the strong warm cold phase soi condition for the sw and mi regions negative positive correlations are found in lag 0 to lag 2 cases for strong warm cold phase soi condition and the same correlations are shown in lag 1 to lag 3 cases for the se and ne regions that is the stronger warm and cold phases of enso forcing the more and less precipitation with lag time 0 to 3 seasons over the united states from the findings above it is concluded that middle latitude precipitation responses to the el niño and la niña phenomena are detectable over the contiguous united states credit authorship contribution statement jai hong lee

2124,information regarding chlorophyll a chla and total nitrogen tn is critical for early warning of algal blooms however reliable models for accurate forecasting of the chla and tn are still lacking due to the optical complexity of coastal waters to address this issue we proposed a novel hybrid model named the ceemdan vmd xgboost sarima cvxs model to forecast chla and tn concentrations the model performance was validated at three hydrological monitoring stations in hong kong china four independent models including extreme gradient boosting xgboost support vector regression svr deep learning dl and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima and three hybrid models including complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan xgboost ceemdan svr and ceemdan dl were developed to compare their performance with the cvxs model in addition the physical mechanisms of the cvxs model were further explored through correlation analysis between the decomposed time series of water quality parameters the result indicated that 1 the cvxs model had the best accuracy among all models for forecasting chla and tn and all the nses remained above 0 97 at three hydrological monitoring stations for forecasting chla the performance of the eight models is ranked as cvxs ceemdan xgboost ceemdan dl ceemdan svr xgboost dl sarima svr for forecasting tn the performance of the eight models is ranked as cvxs ceemdan xgboost ceemdan dl ceemdan svr xgboost svr sarima dl 2 the optimal forecasting time horizons of the cvxs model were one to two months and 3 the variability of chla and tn concentrations induced by hydrologic factors has been inherently embedded in the decomposed time series data thus providing the theoretical basis for the cvxs model forecasting water quality parameters the results of this study are promising with respect to forecasting algal blooms and coastal water resource management keywords water quality machine learning decomposition algorithm extreme gradient boosting algorithm forecasting data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent years harmful algal blooms have been occurring frequently in coastal waters due to anthropogenic activities and global warming leading to a serious threat to marine ecosystems and public health nazeer and nichol 2016 hou et al 2022 the toxic compounds produced by some algal taxa can lead to the deterioration of seawater quality huisman et al 2018 as algae die its decomposition consumes a lot of oxygen and further pollutes the water body michalak et al 2013 algal blooms are in large part related to nutrient enrichment such as the increased terrestrial tn input and can be generally monitored by estimating chla concentration in waters cheng et al 2020 kumar et al 2018 therefore reliable forecasting of these water quality parameters can serve as an early warning for algal blooms and help coastal managers to develop effective prevention and control interventions currently the methods for forecasting chla and tn can be broadly divided into two categories physical based methods and data driven methods kerimoglu et al 2018 physical based methods are mainly to simulate the outbreak process of algal blooms according to the ocean dynamics theory physical based methods have clear physical meaning and strong portability however the defects of physical based methods such as many parameters complex computation and complexity of the model implementation limited the further application of the methods kim et al 2014 data driven methods forecast concentrations of water quality parameters by mining the time order information in historical data thus require much fewer ancillary data such as rainfall temperature and salinity than the physics based methods bedri et al 2014 data driven methods can be further refined into empirical models and machine learning based models alexakis et al 2012 empirical models such as multiple linear regression autoregressive integrated moving average arima and genetic programming algorithms have widely been used in water quality forecasting mohebzadeh et al 2020 muttil et al 2005 chen et al 2015 however coastal eutrophication is a complex process and often associated with the joint effect of the water constituents such as nutrients and total suspended solids tss resulting the changes in algal biomass and biodiversity glibert 2017 thus these empirical models can not well reflect the non linear character of water quality parameter variation leading to higher forecasting errors when applied in coastal waters xie et al 2019 with the strong ability to capture the non linear characteristics of the data machine learning based models can overcome the above mentioned shortcomings of the empirical models and thus have become popular for forecasting water quality concentrations derot et al 2020 gómez et al 2021 hu et al 2021 commonly used machine learning based models include tree models support vector models and neural network models which have been proven to have great potential for water quality forecasting in previous studies he et al 2011 mulia et al 2013 rajaee and boroumand 2015 shamshirband et al 2019 adedeji et al 2022 ye et al 2009 employed the environmental variables as input features and developed an artificial neural network ann to forecast daily chla concentration in xiangxi bay china the r2 value of the training and validating were 0 85 and 0 89 respectively harrison et al 2020 demonstrated the ability of a random forest model to forecast tn concentration by using high frequency sensor data nse 0 85 mae 0 11 mg l 1 and rmse 0 16 mg l 1 wang et al 2022 compared the performance of the multiple linear regression xgboost random forest and multilayer perceptron mlp models for water quality forecasting in the xiaoqing estuary china the result showed that the xgboost model outperformed the other three models nse 0 905 overall the machine learning based models have obtained good accuracy in water quality forecasting however the methods still have shortcomings first the modeling process for forecasting individual water quality parameter requires the inputs of different variables such as turbidity dissolved oxygen do and surface water temperature chau et al 2007 tian et al 2017 mamun et al 2020 since the environmental variables routinely monitored in different regions may vary a lot the transferability of the developed models is substantially limited second the performance of the machine learning based models is significantly affected by the training samples the coastal waters have diverse characteristics of trend periodicity and randomness thus leading to significant uncertainty in the model performance therefore it is urgent and necessary to develop a scheme of higher transferability and reliability for water quality forecasting decomposition algorithms were proved to be useful strategies to extract the dynamic features from the time series data lu and ma 2020 and have been widely used in forecasting hydrological and meteorological parameters such as wind speed rainfall flood and solar radiation antico et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 gao et al 2020 the essence of decomposition is to transfer time series data from non static to static thus the decomposition algorithms can be reasonably considered a novelty method for the pre processing step in the machine learning modeling process the ceemdan and the variational mode decomposition vmd algorithms gained attention among the various decomposition algorithms because of their completely self adaptability and data dependent characteristics previous studies indirectly forecast chla and tn by using the relationship between other water quality variables and the target parameters palani et al 2008 west and dellana 2011 vakili and amanollahi 2020 to date no reported study employs these two decomposition models for forecasting water quality parameters in coastal waters our hypothesis is that the variability of the water quality parameters induced by hydrologic factors has been inherently embedded in the decomposed time series data thus water quality parameters can be directly forecasted by analyzing the fluctuation of sub time series data in this study the ceendan and vmd algorithms are integrated with xgboost and sarima models to develop a new scheme for forecasting chla and tn termed ceemdan xgboost vmd sarima cvxs model to test our hypothesis the aims of this study were to 1 establish a model of higher reliability to accurately forecast chla and tn in coastal waters 2 validate the forecasting capability of the developed models at three hydrological monitoring stations in the coastal area of hong kong and 3 explore the physical mechanisms of the cvxs model 2 methodologies 2 1 xgboost model xgboost was initially proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 and is based on the decision tree algorithm by generating and iterating multiple weak estimators termed the tree model xgboost can construct a strong learner to fit the residual error of the last tree model minimizing the time cost of the computation and efficiently preventing model overfitting li et al 2019 for a given dataset assuming the model has generated k th of weak estimators the output is the sum of the prediction scores on all the branches of the corresponding weak estimator the object function of xgboost can be expressed as follows 1 obj xgboost i 1 n l y i y i k 1 k γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 where l y i y i is the total deviation between the predicted value y i and measured value y i t represents the structural branch of each weak estimator ω is the branch weights γ and λ are two regularization coefficients the regularization term k 1 k γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 was introduced to avoid model overfitting which represents the complexity of the k th estimator 2 2 ceemdan algorithm the empirical mode decomposition emd is one of the most concerning signal adaptive decomposition algorithms proposed by huang et al 1998 it decomposes a nonlinear and multicomponent time series into finite mono component signals termed intrinsic mode functions imfs each imf contains only a single instantaneous frequency which is essentially the smoothing of the time series data however the noise in the signal may cause the mode aliasing in imfs leading to false time frequency distributions and depriving the physical meaning of the imf the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd a noise assisted data analysis method was proposed by wu et al 2009 which adds normally distributed white noise to the original signal to counteract the noise effect occurring in the decomposition process nevertheless the added white noise may still exist after averaging the imf sequence set and the noise after signal reconstruction cannot be ignored the ceemdan is a signal adaptive decomposition algorithm proposed by torres et al 2011 by adding both positive and negative adaptive white noise into the time series data the ceemdan algorithm can well solve the mode aliasing and noise irreducible problems in the emd and eemd algorithms the implementation of the ceemdan algorithm can be formulated as the following steps 1 white noise is added in pairs to the original data to derive two mixtures of the time series data 2 m 1 m 2 1 1 1 1 s n where m1 and m2 are the original time series positive and negative gaussian white noise respectively s is the original time series and n is the gaussian white noise 2 the emd algorithm is applied to decompose each derived time series and a total of 2 n corresponding imf components are obtained 3 obtained each imf of original time series decomposition by averaging the set of imf components acquired in step 2 3 imf j t 1 2 n i 1 2 n imf ij where imf j t is the j th imf of the original time series decomposed by the ceemdan algorithm and imf ij is the i th imf of the j th derived time series the final decomposition results of ceemdan can be expressed as follows 4 j 1 k imf j t r e s where res is the decomposed residual sequence 2 3 vmd algorithm vmd as an adaptive and complete non recursive signal processing algorithm was proposed by dragomiretskiy et al 2014 which provides a theoretical basis for time series decomposition by iteratively calculating the optimal solution of the model in the data decomposition process the vmd algorithm can determine the frequency center and bandwidth of each mode and decompose a signal into several sub signals with specific sparsity properties imfs are defined as amplitude modulation amplitude frequency am fm signals in the vmd algorithm and can be expressed as follows 5 imf i t a i t c o s φ i t where imf i t is the i th imf a i and φ i are the amplitude and the phase of the component respectively the steps of the vmd decomposition are as follows 1 the hilbert huang transform is performed on each mode to compute the associated analytic signal and a unilateral frequency spectrum is obtained 2 convert each mode s frequency spectrum to baseband by mixing with an exponential of the estimated center frequency 3 estimate the bandwidth by gaussian smoothness of demodulated signal and obtain the constrained variation problem as follows 6 min u k w k k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 7 s t k u k f where uk u1 u2 uk is the set of all variational modes wk w1 w2 wk is the center frequency f is the original input signal to solve the above constrained variation problem the quadratic penalty term α and lagrange multiplier λ t are introduced 8 l u k w k λ α k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 f t k 1 k u k t 2 2 λ t k 1 k u k t to avoid the original minimization problem a sequence of iterative sub optimization termed the alternate direction method of multipliers admm was used to update the center frequency and bandwidth the iteration of the center frequency and bandwidth can be formulated as follows 9 u k n 1 ω f ω i k u k n 1 ω i k u i n ω λ n ω 2 1 2 α ω ω k n 2 ω k n 1 0 ω u k ω 2 d ω 0 u k ω 2 d ω k 1 k 2 4 sarima algorithm arima is a statistical method based model which describes the linear correlations between the system s future and the past state sarima model is an enhancement of the arima which takes into account the seasonality of the data and other external factors in time series forecasting wang et al 2021 the sarima model contains seven hyper parameters 10 p d q p d q s where p is the number of lagged observations involved in the sarima model d is the degree of differencing and q is the order of moving average window p d q are the corresponding p d q in seasonal factors s is the size of the period also called the length of the season the sarima model can be expressed as follows 11 a p l b p l s δ d δ s d y t c q l d q l s μ t 12 a p l 1 a 1 l a 2 l 2 a p l p 13 b l 1 b 1 l s b 2 l 2 s b p l ps 14 c q l 1 c 1 l c 2 l 2 c q l q 15 d q l 1 d 1 l s d 2 l 2 s

d and d are the non negative integer difference μt is the white noise series 2 5 correlation analysis correlation analysis was used to identify the relationship between the decomposed time series data of chla tn and other hydrologic factors the pearson correlation coefficient r is a common index to describe the association between two variables the values of r range from 1 to 1 where 0 indicated that there is no relevance and the correlation increases or decreases as the absolute value of r r gradually approaches 1 the negative values of r indicated a negative correlation between variables while the positive values of r indicated a positive correlation the p values for significance tests were calculated to determine whether the correlation between the two variables was significant when the p values are 0 05 the correlation is considered to be significant wang et al 2020 2 6 model development the development of the cvxs model contains the following steps step 1 the ceemdan algorithm was chosen to decompose the original time series data firstly and then generate the finite imfs the statistically significant lag time series of the imfs were determined by the partial autocorrelation function pacf values then these finite imfs were divided into three categories high frequency imf1 and imf2 intermediate frequency the statistically lag time of imf greater than 1 where imf imf3 imfn and low frequencies the statistically lag time of imf equal to 1 where imf imf3 imf respectively the time series data was normalized to strengthen the model performance using the preprocessing module in the scikit learn library version 0 24 2 of python 3 7 4 the ceemdan algorithm was implemented by the emd signal library version 0 2 12 of python 3 7 4 step 2 the vmd algorithm was employed to further resolve the imf1 and imf2 into several sub sequences called modes the pacf values were used once again to compute the statistically significant lag time series of modes the vmd algorithm was implemented by the vmdpy library version 0 2 of python 3 7 4 the central frequency method was used to find an appropriate number k to minimize the sum of the bandwidths of iterative decomposed modes time series huang et al 2016 step3 the corresponding significant lag time series of intermediate frequency imfs and modes were input to the xgboost model to forecast imfs and mode one by one to avoid the overfitting problem of the xgboost model in simple non linear time series forecasting the sarima model was employed for the low frequency imfs forecasting xgboost and sarima models were implemented by the scipy library version 1 7 1 and the statsmodels library version 0 12 2 of python 3 7 4 respectively the tuning hyper parameters of the xgboost model include n estimators subsample learning rate reg lambda reg alpha and max depth step 4 all the forecasted imfs and modes were summed to derive the forecasting results of the origin time series the technical flow chart associated with the method used in this study was shown in fig 1 for comparison the results were benchmarked with the standalone models xgboost svr dl and sarima and one layer decomposing hybrid models ceemdan xgboost ceemdan svr and ceemdan dl svr was implemented by scikit learn library version 0 24 2 dlwas implemented by pytorch library version 1 9 0 of python 3 7 4 2 7 model performance evaluation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias normalized root mean squared error nrmse and ratio of rmse and standard deviation of the measured values rsr were chosen as evaluating metrics in this study to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the cvxs model the nse is sensitive to the fluctuation of the time series data and is commonly used to characterize the stability of the prediction results ahmadisharaf et al 2022 naik et al 2019 the pbias is a robust statistical parameter that is commonly used to identify the average prediction bias allen et al 2007 the nrmse is used to evaluate the model predication error stow et al 2003 the rsr is a well established metric to describe how the errors relative to the magnitude of the observed values ahmad et al 2022 the calculation of four

the three different stations in coastal waters of hong kong china namely the dm1 station at deep bay the vm1 station in victoria harbour and the jm3 station at tseung kwan o fig 2 the selected stations are located in three typical areas and the impact of anthropogenic activities on these areas is substantially different deep bay is the most strongly affected by human activity among the three stations because it lies between the highly urbanized and industrial cities of hong kong and shenzhen the major grain producing areas of hong kong are also located on the deep bay area the agricultural area account for 35 81 in this district fig s1 a land based pollutants such as agricultural and industrial effluents from the rivers of shenzhen and hongkong were discharged through the estuary into the bay leading to frequent water contamination disasters in deep bay wang et al 2020 the victoria harbour is located in the downtown area of hong kong and the impervious area account for 70 38 in this district fig s1 b the high urbanization of victoria harbour has caused great quantity of municipal wastewater continue to flow into the coastal waters and consequently resulted in water contamination tang et al 2008 the tseung k wan o is highly industrialized yau et al 2012 most of the factories are located in the coastal area of this district and the impervious area account for 6 61 in this district fig s1 c thus the water quality of tseung k wan o reflects the influence of industrial wastewater on the water environment the water quality in the three bays is critical to the ecological safety and socio economic development of hong kong the balanced water ecology is of great significance to ensure the health of marine environment chla and tn were commonly used as proxies for eutrophication and algal bloom zhou et al 2020 pahlevan et al 2021 guo et al 2022 thus it is especially critical for the local government to forecast these two water quality indicators for early warning of the eutrophication and algal blooms of the three bays yin and harrison 2007 li et al 2022 in addition the forecast accuracy of the developed model at the three bay areas can verify the generalization ability of the model under different types of water pollutants the water quality data from january 1988 to december 2019 n 384 3 at three stations were collected from the environmental protection interactive centre epic hong kong https cd epic epd gov hk epicriver marine the monitoring frequency of water quality is once a month at each station the epci monitors the marine water quality and collects surface water samples at a depth of 0 5 m marine monitoring work was conducted on board a scientific vessel named dr catherine lam which is equipped with a satellite aided differential global positioning system dgps for accurate location of sampling stations at sea water quality parameters including temperature temp salinity ph turbidity and do were measured in situ by a conductivity temperature depth ctd profiler water samples were sent to the laboratories for analysis of other parameters including chla tn total phosphorus tp silicon oxide sio2 nitrite no2 n kjeldahl nitrogen cn escherichia coli ec total suspended solids tss volatile solid content vsc inorganic nitrogen ion ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nonionic ammonia nitrogen n nh3 n the fifth generation of monthly global climate reanalysis era5 data from january 1988 to december 2019 was acquired from the google earth engine cloud computing platform gee https earthengine google com five meteorological factors in era5 data including mean air temperature mat total precipitation t p surface pressure sp mean sea level pressure mslp and dewpoint temperature dt were selected to investigate the relationship between the meteorological factors and decomposed water quality time series data we divided the chla and tn observation datasets into training and testing sets according to different periods specifically the measured data of chla and tn from january 1988 to august 2013 308 months accounting for 80 of the total dataset was used for the model training and the measured dataset from september 2013 to december 2019 76 months 20 of the total dataset was used for model validation 4 results 4 1 water quality distribution fig 3 depicted the distribution of chla and tn concentrations at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations the chla and tn concentration ranges at the vm1 station were 0 1 50 μg l and 0 12 2 56 mg l respectively the values of these two the parameters at jm3 station were very close to those at the vm1 station with ranges of 0 08 44 μg l and 0 08 1 81 mg l respectively compared to the vm1 and jm3 stations the probability distribution for chla and tn concentrations distribution are noticeably higher at the dm1 station shifted to the right with a range from 0 1 to 260 μg l and 0 1 to 18 01 mg l respectively the high chla concentrations at all three stations indicate a high risk of eutrophication and algal blooms in these areas thus the forecasting of chla and tn concentrations at the three sites can well validate the model s early warning capability for extreme water quality events fig 4 shows the variation of the chla and tn from 1988 to 2019 at the dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations overall there was a consistent variation pattern of chla and tn concentrations the chla and tn concentrations at the three stations exhibited remarkable seasonal changes with the values in summer being considerably higher than in winter the statistics for chla and tn concentrations at the three stations were tabulated in table 1 the dm1 station has the highest median mean and standard deviation values of chla and tn concentrations among the three stations suggesting the water quality of dm1 is the worst this is mainly caused by polluted tributaries flowing from the agricultural areas in the southern region the statistics of chla and tn concentrations at vm1 and jm3 stations are relatively close which can be explained as the relatively close location of these two stations the reasonable ranges of chla and tn concentrations and significant seasonal patterns at the three stations indicate that the measured dataset can well capture the dynamic changes of chla and tn concentrations and thus can be used in the subsequent model construction 4 2 reconstruction of prediction results fig 5 and fig 6 show the time series data and fitting figures of chla and tn forecasted by the cvxs model at the dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations respectively table 2 list the results of four evaluation metrics of the cvxs model the result shows the chla and tn forecasted by the cvxs model had a consistent trend with the in situ measured data all the nse values of the cvxs model for forecasting chla and tn at three stations reached above 0 97 the pbais values of the cvxs model for forecasting chla at three stations were 0 76 0 44 and 10 74 respectively and the nrmse values were 0 21 0 25 and 0 13 the pbais values of the cvxs model for forecasting tn at three stations were 0 11 0 2 and 0 47 respectively with the nrmse of 0 05 0 04 and 0 05 the rsr values of the cvxs model for forecasting chla were 14 76 15 99 and 11 69 respectively and the rsr values were 13 30 8 17 and 8 32 for forecasting tn the variation tendency of chla and tn values forecasted by the cvxs model at all three stations was commendably consistent with the trend of in situ measured data fig 6 shows that the fitting line was consistent with the ideal fitting line which also proves that the cvxs model can accurately forecast the chla and tn concentrations 5 discussion 5 1 model performance comparison the performance of cvxs model was compared with xgboost svr dl sarima ceemdan xgboost ceemdan svr and ceemdan dl models fig 7 and table 4 6 show the fitting figure and statistical indicators results of eight models for forecasting chla and tn at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations the black line in fig 7 is the ideal fitting line the closer model fitting line to the ideal fitting line suggests that the model has a higher forecasting accuracy to comprehensively evaluate the model performance we adapted the method proposed by moriasi et al 2015 to classify the model performance as very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory based on the values nse and pbias if the nse and pbias grading results of the model are both very good we consider the accuracy of the model meets the forecasting requirements the grading methods of nse and pbias are shown in table 3 and the specific values of nse pbias rsr and nrmse for each model are shown in table s1 s3 for forecasting chla the performance of xgboost was very good based on nse and pbias at all the three stations the rsrs were 59 4 45 67 and 62 09 respectively the nse of svr was unsatisfactory at all three stations the pbias of svr was very good at the vm1 and jm3 stations and unsatisfactory at the dm1 station the nse of dl was unsatisfactory at all three stations and the pbias were unsatisfactory good and satisfactory respectively with rse of 81 37 81 37 and 94 34 the nse of sarima was unsatisfactory at the three stations and the pbias were satisfactory unsatisfactory and very good respectively with rsr of 103 66 85 40 and 100 16 table s1 s3 for forecasting tn the nse and pbias of xgboost were very good at all three stations with rsr of 51 26 58 22 and 37 68 respectively the nse of svr was unsatisfactory at all the three stations while the pbias was very good at all the three stations the nse of dl was unsatisfactory at all the three stations while the pbias of dl was very good at vm1 and jm3 stations and satisfactory at dm1 station the nse of sarima was unsatisfactory at all the three stations the pbias of sarima was very good at dm1 and jm3 stations and good at vm1 station the lower pbias values of the svr dl and sarima models at vm1 and jm3 stations could be attributed to the fact that the models overpredict as much as underpredict thus all the single models except the xgboost model have poor fitting performance the xgboost model adopts the boosting algorithm to forecast the target during the training process of the xgboost model a new weak estimator is iteratively generated to fit the residuals of the forecasting results of the previous t 1 weak estimators with the true values of the training samples furthermore the loss function of the xgboost model incorporates a regular term to effectively prevent the overfitting of the model the scatter points were mostly located in the upper part of the ideal fitting line for forecasting chla which indicated the error of svr dl and sarima mainly comes from the estimation of the high values for forecasting tn the errors of the svr and dl mainly come from the overestimation of the measured tn values while the error of the sarima mainly comes from the underestimation of the measured tn values compared to the xgboost model the svr model is rooted in structural risk minimization theory and featured by the use of kernels function and support vectors to construct an optimal classification surface in the feature space to make the learner converges globally optimized cherkassky et al 1997 dl employs a gradient descent algorithm to make the output of the model converge to the true value an activation function such as relu and sigmoid was added to each layer to achieve the nonlinear transformation of data mcclelland 1988 noise caused by the optical complexity of ocean waters makes it difficult for the svr model to determine an optimal hyperplane in nonlinear time series data thus leading to an overestimation of chla and tn the poor performance of dl indicated that the gradient descent approach in the model architecture still struggles to find the global minimum from the training dataset the basic assumption of the sarima model is that the current value depends on the historical time series dataset water quality monitoring data is considered as a non linear and non stationary signal sequence with noise song et al 2021 however these characteristics of the time series data reduce the performance of the sarima model the xgboost model was found as the best performed model among the four standalone models indicating that the boosting algorithm has a better ability than svr dl and sarima to mine the nonlinear characteristics of the time series data although the xgboost had the very good performance among the standalone models based on the nse and pbias the sparsity and periodicity of the water quality data hinder the forecasting ability of xgboost model further improvement with higher rsr and nrmse values for forecasting chla and tn the ceemdan algorithm has been widely used in eliminating autocorrelation in the nonstationary time series forecasting problem song and yao 2022 the introduction of gaussian white noise coefficients and covariance matrix in the decomposition of time series can effectively prevent the intricacy of time series zhang and hong 2019 for forecasting chla and tn the nse and pbias of ceemdan xgboost were very good at all three stations for forecasting chla the nse of ceemdan svr was unsatisfactory satisfactory and good at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations the pbias of ceemdan svr was very good at dm1 and jm3 station and unsatisfactory at vm1 station the nse of ceemdan dl was good at dm1 and vm1 station and very good at jm3 station the pbias of ceemdan dl was good satisfactory and very good at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations respectively for forecasting tn the nse of ceemdan svr was satisfactory at dm1 and jm3 stations and unsatisfactory at vm1 station the pbias of ceemdan svr was very good at vm1 and jm3 stations and unsatisfactory at dm1 station the nse of ceemdan dl was satisfactory good and very good at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations respectively the pbias was very good at vm1 and jm3 stations and satisfactory at dm1 station generally the forecasting accuracy of all the single models had significant improved performance after being processed by the ceemdan algorithm indicating the effectiveness of the ceemdan algorithm in feature extraction and nonlinear denoising the vmd algorithm can perform a non iterative decomposition of the input signal and adaptively select the frequency band with the most diagnostic information miao et al 2019 the cvxs performed very good based on the nse and pbias with the lowest rsr and nrmse values among all models furthermore the fitting line of the cvxs model was closest to the ideal fitting line followed by the ceemdan xgboost model suggesting the cvxs model performed best at all three stations fig 7 overall the accuracy of chla forecasting models at the dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations is ranked from high to low as cvxs ceemdan xgboost ceemdan dl ceemdan svr xgboost dl sarima svr the accuracy of tn forecasting models in dm1 station ranks from high to low as cvxs ceemdan xgboost ceemdan dl ceemdan svr xgboost svr sarima dl the performance of cvxs model outperformed other hybrid models reveled that the vmd algorithm helped to reduce the complexity features of the high frequencies time series to assist the xgboost in better forecasting the future water quality concentrations it is worth mention that the svr and dl models still had the poor fitting ability and higher error after integrating the decomposition algorithm which means the svr and dl are unsuitable as forecasting methods for low temporal resolution data 5 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is widely used for understanding how the model outputs are influenced by the inputs razavi et al 2021 thus we employed sensitivity analysis to investigate the variation in the accuracy of forecasted results with the changes in the percentage of the training dataset more specially we set four simulation scenarios which use 80 70 60 and 50 of total samples for model training and the remaining samples for model testing as shown in fig 8 with the percentage of training datasets decreasing from 80 to 50 the nse values of the cvxs model in chla forecasting at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations decreased 0 174 0 177 and 0 171 respectively the rsr values increased 17 62 17 24 and 16 96 respectively and pbias values increased 12 22 12 07 and 12 49 respectively for forecasting tn the nse values of the cvxs model at the three stations decreased 0 187 0 167 and 0 174 respectively the rsr values increased 17 60 21 05 and 21 92 respectively and the pbias increased 11 96 11 02 and 12 37 respectively overall the performance of cvxs model decreases rapidly with the percentage of training data sets decreased from 80 to 70 moreover the performance of cvxs model slowly decreases in case of the training dataset is smaller the results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the performance of cvxs model depends on the training sample size indeed the data driven model needs to learn enough information to better build the non linear relationship between the input and outputs however one of the biggest challenges in applying machine learning methods to forecast water quality is the limited available data to train the models according to the above sensitive analysis 80 of samples were selected as the training dataset and the developed model provides good accuracy in forecasting the chla and tn concentrations in this case 5 3 analysis of one layer model errors most of the currently available models were feeding the one layer decomposing data to machine learning algorithm under the identification of the optimal lag time to forecast the variation of seawater quality concentration and none of them fully considered the non stationarity and non linearity in sub decomposition sequence fijani et al 2019 attempted to decompose the first imf sequences called a high frequency sequence of the time series and applied the model to the daily chla and do forecasting in the prespa lake however the reason for decomposing high frequency sequences remains unclear besides machine learning algorithms were prone to overfitting in the forecasting of low frequency imfs and residual time series due to the lower dimension feature of training data therefore we chose ceemdan xgboost with the best performance in one layer decomposition models to analyze the origin of model errors according to fig 9 the nse values of the ceemdan xgboost model for chla and tn high frequency imfs imf1 and imf2 forecasting were 0 738 0 870 0 669 and 0 793 respectively while the nse values for the rest imfs forecasting were above 0 960 the results indicate that the errors of the model mainly derive from the forecasting for high frequency imfs this is because the ceemdan algorithm is maybe not enough to completely offset the inherent and newly added noise in high frequency imfs the advantage of the vmd algorithm over the ceemdan method is that there is no residual noise in the decomposed modes and redundant modes can be avoided liu et al 2016 therefore the vmd algorithm was used in the cvxs model to further eliminate the data noise and extract the valid information in the high frequency imfs overall the errors of the one layer model mainly came from the imf1 and imf2 thereby the secondary decomposition of imf1 and imf2 could effectively improve the accuracy of the model for water quality forecasting 5 4 interpretation of the physical mechanisms of the cvxs model the hydrological and meteorological factors play an important role in explaining the temporal variation of water quality parameter concentrations zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 the interaction between water quality parameters is the basis of current research in water environment assessment ni et al 2018 therefore in the previous studies the external hydrological factors such as turbidity and ammonia nitrogen and meteorological factors such as air temperature and rainfall were widely used as the input variables to develop a model for forecasting water quality sharma et al 2019 the data driven methods forecast the water quality by mining the intrinsic patterns of water quality with statistical methodology however the poor understanding of the physical mechanism leads to tension between the interpretability and accuracy of those methods thus the correlation analysis among the chla tn and other hydrologic and climate factors was employed to explore the theoretical basis of the cvxs model according to fig 10 a the correlation between chla and other seawater quality parameters except the n nh3 n was negligible suggesting the interaction between water quality parameters in coastal waters is weaker due to the optical complexity of coastal waters however fig 10 b shows the interaction between water quality parameters was well reflected in the correlation between the decomposed intermediate frequency and low frequency imfs moreover the imfs of some seawater quality parameters are even strongly correlated with the imfs of chla no2 n imf7 with chla imf8 for example the results indicated that the driven effects of other environmental factors on chla have well embedded in the fluctuation of decomposed imfs of chla time series which provides the physical mechanism for the cvxs model according to fig 11 a c for water quality parameters eg no2 n ion and nh3 n with a strong correlation with tn their imfs also have a strong correlation with the imfs of tn for seawater quality parameters eg chla tp and ec et al with negligible correlation to tn their interaction with tn was also revealed in decomposed time series eg tss imf6 tempure imf4 which further supports the robustness of the cvxs model it is worth noting that the correlations between imfs of water quality parameters show large variability eg do with chla tss with tn which can be interpreted as the potential effects of positive and negative feedback between the hydrological elements due to the dynamic hydrological cycle nordstrom et al 2005 according to fig 12 a d the chla was positively correlated with the total precipitation t p mean air temperature mat and dewpoint temperature dt and negatively correlated with the surface pressure sp and mean sea level pressure mslp the tn was positively correlated with the sp and mslp but negatively correlated with t p mat and dt the imfs of chla and tn also showed a correlation with the imfs of meteorological factors some low frequency imfs of meteorological factors are even strongly correlated with the imfs of chla and tn e g dt imf1 and chla imf8 mat imf6 and chla imf8 mslp imf7 and tn imf8 t p and imf6 to this end it can be inferred that the effects of meteorological factors on water quality parameters are indirectly reflected in the temporal changes of imfs of chla and tn overall the above correlation analysis suggested that the decomposed data of chla tn and external variables are correlated with each other which well explained the feasibility of cvxs in forecasting chla and tn without employing other external variables as input e g tp tss and sp 5 5 long term forecasting ability of the cvxs model the water quality data series are decomposed into several subsequences and the cvxs model forecasts the value of each sub sequence at the next time horizon then the predicted results of in next time horizon of the sub sequences were summed to obtain the concentration of the original water quality time series at the next time horizon thus the initial condition of the next time horizon prediction depended on the partial autocorrelation coefficient of the imfs and modes of the sub sequence in this study the partial autocorrelation function pacf was used to determine the appropriate number of input variables for developing each sub series forecasting model the performance of pacf for input selection has been verified in previous studies he et al 2020 we iterate the forecasting results of the cvxs model to check the model accuracy and stability in the long term forecasting of chla and tn concentration the variation of nse values of the cvxs model in different forecasting time horizons is shown in fig 13 the errors of the cvxs model for both chla and tn forecasting increased significantly with the widening of forecasting time horizons when the forecasting time horizon reached three months the nse of the cvxs model for both chla and tn forecasting at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations was lower than 0 9 and these values dropped below 0 6 when the forecasting time horizon reached six months this is because the cvxs model forecasted chla and tn concentrations rely on the partial correlation of time series with its own lagged values causing the limitation of the length of the forecasting time horizon overall the results indicate that the optimal forecasting time horizons of the cvxs model for monthly time series data are one to two months 5 6 uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis is a useful tool to investigate the impacts of different error sources on the model performance loucks et al 2017 generally uncertainty can be classified as epistemic and aleatory according to the nature of missing or unknown information ahmadisharaf et al 2019 for the cvxs model the aleatory is mainly caused by the dynamic and chaotic characteristic of water quality data the source of the epistemic uncertainty of cvxs could be attributed to the imperfect knowledge of data decomposition mechanisms previous studies suggested that appropriate data decomposition strategies and modeling methods are the keys to developing a forecast model yu et al 2022 in cvxs model the ceemdan algorithm is used to decompose the original time series compared with the eemd algorithm the ceemdan algorithm minimizes the noise residuals in the reconstructed time series significantly by adding a limited amount of adaptive white noise however the spurious patterns of time series data may appear in the early stages of decomposition resulting in noise still being included in the first two imfs thus the vmd algorithm was employed to decompose the high frequency decomposed time series data however for water quality time series data from different hydrometric stations the imf number of ceemdan decompositions and the mode number of vmd decompositions could be different resulting in varying forecasting performances of the cvxs model as can be seen from fig 6 the cvxs model performs best at jm3 station for chla forecasting followed by vm station and dm1 station the nse values are 0 984 0 979 and 0 978 respectively at jm3 vm and dm1 stations moreover the prerequisite assumption of the cvxs model is that the variability of the water quality parameters induced by hydrologic factors has been inherently embedded in the decomposed time series data although this hypothesis has been confirmed through the correlation analysis the physical and chemical processes involved in water quality changes in the real world are more complex thus resulting in the uncertainty of the proposed model in water quality forecasting 5 7 the impacts of land use change on water quality land use change can directly reflect the impact of human activities on the coastal environmental wijesiri et al 20018 based on the remote sensing dataset of land use in the districts where the three monitoring stations are located the relationship between the land use change and water quality variation from 1990 to 2019 was analyzed the spatial resolution of the land use dataset is 30 m 30 m the land use classes include cropland forest shrub grassland water snow barren impervious and wetland according to table s4 the land use in the coastal area of hong kong has changed dramatically from 1990 to 2019 the basic trend is an increase in the impervious areas and a decrease in the grassland water barren and forest the impervious area in the three districts increased by 195 95 25 76 and 133 89 respectively according to the table 7 at the dm1 station the chla was negatively correlated with cropland area with r of 0 48 and positively correlated with the shrub area with r of 0 51 the tn was positively correlated with the shrub area and water area with r of 0 39 and 0 40 respectively and presented a negative correlation with impervious area with r of 0 42 at the vm1 station the chla was negatively correlated with water area and barren area with r of 0 42 and 0 39 respectively the tn was positively correlated with cropland area grassland area and barren area with r of 0 58 0 63 and 0 55 respectively and presented a negative correlation with impervious with r of 0 52 at the jm3 station there was no statistically significant correlation between the chla and landcover classes p greater than 0 05 the tn was negatively correlated with shrub area and impervious area both with an r of 0 47 and was positively correlated with barren with r of 0 47 in hong kong a total of 944 algal bloom events were reported between 1975 and 2018 afcd 2019 previous research has shown that the frequency of algal blooms in the coastal waters of hong kong is about 10 to 20 times per year guo et al 2020 the nonpoint source pollution from the urban surface runoff and cropland increases nutrient loading in the coastal waters of hong kong leading to frequent algal blooms qi et al 2004 however the correlation analysis between the area of land use classes and water quality parameters shows that the water quality variation cannot be determined from the changes in land use classes alone lu et al 2021 suggested that combining land use types with other factors e g socioeconomic data could provide a good solution for investigating changes in water quality concentrations wang et al 2020 found that physical conditions such as wind and water currents influenced the algal bloom dynamics in the coastal waters of hong kong the impact mechanism of land use classes on algal bloom outbreaks is complex and needs to be further studied in future work 5 8 results implication and guidance for water environment management over the past two decades the rapid urbanization and economic development deteriorated water quality in china s coastal waters such as the eutrophication and red tides the frequency of harmful algae blooms has drastically increased with the excessive nutrients input from point sources such as the effluent from wastewater treatment plants and nonpoint sources such as river discharges leading to serious coastal water pollution ecosystem degradation and great financial losses for example a bloom event that occurred in the coastal area of fujian province in 2012 caused economic losses of more than 2 billion cny li et al 2019b the golden tide that occurred in the southern yellow sea at the end of 2016 caused economic losses of nearly 500 million cny yan long et al 2019 there is a total of 30170 km2 of sea areas affected by eutrophication in summer according to the bulletin of marin ecology and environment status of china in 2021 https www mee gov cn hjzl sthjzk jagb to improve marine ecological and environmental quality the china government introduced a series of policies to protect water quality in coastal waters such as the marine ecological and environmental protection plan during the 14th five year plan period the action plan for comprehensive treatment of key sea areas and the opinions on strengthening supervision of the ecological environment of mariculture these policies request long term monitoring in parameters like tn and chla in coastal waters to improve water quality therefore the developed model could provide technical support for the implementation of the water environment management policies based on the optical classification method proposed by morel and prieur 1977 the coastal waters can be characterized as case ii in which optical properties are dominated by several optical proxies such as phytoplankton colored dissolved organic matter suspended sediments and detritus these substances individually or collectively influence the oceanic processes morel et al 1980 munnooru et al 2019 previous studies have shown that the complex optical properties of coastal waters influence the distribution of phytoplankton biomass leading to the non linear characteristic of the water quality data dodson et al 2000 mélin and vantrepotte 2015 therefore the accuracy of traditional models is unsatisfactory for water quality forecasting in coastal regions the cvxs model which is based on data driven conceptualization greatly reduces the uncertainty caused by insufficient understanding of the optical complexity of coastal waters moreover the cvxs model only requires the monitored water quality time series data thereby it can be easily applied to other stations this advantage of cvxs model greatly lessens the problem of poor model portability due to the large amount of auxiliary data required the water quality data can be obtained through the nearby hydrological monitoring station which provides new possibilities for monitoring algal blooms and forecasting future eutrophication trends in coastal cities 5 9 limitations of cvxs model in this study the performance of the proposed cvxs model was verified in three coastal hydrological observation stations however some limitations of this study should also be noted 1 the proposed cvxs model is highly data depended the number of training samples and data quality directly affects the accuracy of the model 2 the performance of the cvxs model varies greatly over different forecasting time horizons therefore the forecast values must be updated using new in situ monitoring data to forecast the next time horizon 3 cvxs model is based on the black box mechanism hence a new training process must be performed before applying the cvxs model to other study areas subsequent research is expected to further validate the performance of the cvxs model on the coastal area under various surface heterogeneous climate conditions 6 conclusion in this study we established a hybrid model termed the cvxs model based on decomposition algorithms and machine learning algorithms to forecast chla and tn concentrations in coastal waters the chla and tn concentrations were forecasted based on historical data as it doesn t require the input of any other auxiliary data thus the scheme has a well transferability for applying to other coastal areas by employing two decomposed algorithms the scheme can further improve the forecasting accuracy compared to standalone model and one layer hybrid models by introducing correlation analysis our results showed that there was a strong correlation between imfs of hydrological and meteorologic factors and imfs of chla and tn thus the scheme combined decomposition algorithms and xgboost model can extract the variability in chla and tn time series induced by hydrologic factors thus explaining the physical mechanism of the data driven method overall the scheme proposed in this paper shows the potential of decomposition algorithms and machine learning models to forecast chla and tn concentrations in coastal waters which could help decision making departments to identify the abnormal areas of water and make timely countermeasures credit authorship contribution statement

2124,information regarding chlorophyll a chla and total nitrogen tn is critical for early warning of algal blooms however reliable models for accurate forecasting of the chla and tn are still lacking due to the optical complexity of coastal waters to address this issue we proposed a novel hybrid model named the ceemdan vmd xgboost sarima cvxs model to forecast chla and tn concentrations the model performance was validated at three hydrological monitoring stations in hong kong china four independent models including extreme gradient boosting xgboost support vector regression svr deep learning dl and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima and three hybrid models including complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan xgboost ceemdan svr and ceemdan dl were developed to compare their performance with the cvxs model in addition the physical mechanisms of the cvxs model were further explored through correlation analysis between the decomposed time series of water quality parameters the result indicated that 1 the cvxs model had the best accuracy among all models for forecasting chla and tn and all the nses remained above 0 97 at three hydrological monitoring stations for forecasting chla the performance of the eight models is ranked as cvxs ceemdan xgboost ceemdan dl ceemdan svr xgboost dl sarima svr for forecasting tn the performance of the eight models is ranked as cvxs ceemdan xgboost ceemdan dl ceemdan svr xgboost svr sarima dl 2 the optimal forecasting time horizons of the cvxs model were one to two months and 3 the variability of chla and tn concentrations induced by hydrologic factors has been inherently embedded in the decomposed time series data thus providing the theoretical basis for the cvxs model forecasting water quality parameters the results of this study are promising with respect to forecasting algal blooms and coastal water resource management keywords water quality machine learning decomposition algorithm extreme gradient boosting algorithm forecasting data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent years harmful algal blooms have been occurring frequently in coastal waters due to anthropogenic activities and global warming leading to a serious threat to marine ecosystems and public health nazeer and nichol 2016 hou et al 2022 the toxic compounds produced by some algal taxa can lead to the deterioration of seawater quality huisman et al 2018 as algae die its decomposition consumes a lot of oxygen and further pollutes the water body michalak et al 2013 algal blooms are in large part related to nutrient enrichment such as the increased terrestrial tn input and can be generally monitored by estimating chla concentration in waters cheng et al 2020 kumar et al 2018 therefore reliable forecasting of these water quality parameters can serve as an early warning for algal blooms and help coastal managers to develop effective prevention and control interventions currently the methods for forecasting chla and tn can be broadly divided into two categories physical based methods and data driven methods kerimoglu et al 2018 physical based methods are mainly to simulate the outbreak process of algal blooms according to the ocean dynamics theory physical based methods have clear physical meaning and strong portability however the defects of physical based methods such as many parameters complex computation and complexity of the model implementation limited the further application of the methods kim et al 2014 data driven methods forecast concentrations of water quality parameters by mining the time order information in historical data thus require much fewer ancillary data such as rainfall temperature and salinity than the physics based methods bedri et al 2014 data driven methods can be further refined into empirical models and machine learning based models alexakis et al 2012 empirical models such as multiple linear regression autoregressive integrated moving average arima and genetic programming algorithms have widely been used in water quality forecasting mohebzadeh et al 2020 muttil et al 2005 chen et al 2015 however coastal eutrophication is a complex process and often associated with the joint effect of the water constituents such as nutrients and total suspended solids tss resulting the changes in algal biomass and biodiversity glibert 2017 thus these empirical models can not well reflect the non linear character of water quality parameter variation leading to higher forecasting errors when applied in coastal waters xie et al 2019 with the strong ability to capture the non linear characteristics of the data machine learning based models can overcome the above mentioned shortcomings of the empirical models and thus have become popular for forecasting water quality concentrations derot et al 2020 gómez et al 2021 hu et al 2021 commonly used machine learning based models include tree models support vector models and neural network models which have been proven to have great potential for water quality forecasting in previous studies he et al 2011 mulia et al 2013 rajaee and boroumand 2015 shamshirband et al 2019 adedeji et al 2022 ye et al 2009 employed the environmental variables as input features and developed an artificial neural network ann to forecast daily chla concentration in xiangxi bay china the r2 value of the training and validating were 0 85 and 0 89 respectively harrison et al 2020 demonstrated the ability of a random forest model to forecast tn concentration by using high frequency sensor data nse 0 85 mae 0 11 mg l 1 and rmse 0 16 mg l 1 wang et al 2022 compared the performance of the multiple linear regression xgboost random forest and multilayer perceptron mlp models for water quality forecasting in the xiaoqing estuary china the result showed that the xgboost model outperformed the other three models nse 0 905 overall the machine learning based models have obtained good accuracy in water quality forecasting however the methods still have shortcomings first the modeling process for forecasting individual water quality parameter requires the inputs of different variables such as turbidity dissolved oxygen do and surface water temperature chau et al 2007 tian et al 2017 mamun et al 2020 since the environmental variables routinely monitored in different regions may vary a lot the transferability of the developed models is substantially limited second the performance of the machine learning based models is significantly affected by the training samples the coastal waters have diverse characteristics of trend periodicity and randomness thus leading to significant uncertainty in the model performance therefore it is urgent and necessary to develop a scheme of higher transferability and reliability for water quality forecasting decomposition algorithms were proved to be useful strategies to extract the dynamic features from the time series data lu and ma 2020 and have been widely used in forecasting hydrological and meteorological parameters such as wind speed rainfall flood and solar radiation antico et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 gao et al 2020 the essence of decomposition is to transfer time series data from non static to static thus the decomposition algorithms can be reasonably considered a novelty method for the pre processing step in the machine learning modeling process the ceemdan and the variational mode decomposition vmd algorithms gained attention among the various decomposition algorithms because of their completely self adaptability and data dependent characteristics previous studies indirectly forecast chla and tn by using the relationship between other water quality variables and the target parameters palani et al 2008 west and dellana 2011 vakili and amanollahi 2020 to date no reported study employs these two decomposition models for forecasting water quality parameters in coastal waters our hypothesis is that the variability of the water quality parameters induced by hydrologic factors has been inherently embedded in the decomposed time series data thus water quality parameters can be directly forecasted by analyzing the fluctuation of sub time series data in this study the ceendan and vmd algorithms are integrated with xgboost and sarima models to develop a new scheme for forecasting chla and tn termed ceemdan xgboost vmd sarima cvxs model to test our hypothesis the aims of this study were to 1 establish a model of higher reliability to accurately forecast chla and tn in coastal waters 2 validate the forecasting capability of the developed models at three hydrological monitoring stations in the coastal area of hong kong and 3 explore the physical mechanisms of the cvxs model 2 methodologies 2 1 xgboost model xgboost was initially proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 and is based on the decision tree algorithm by generating and iterating multiple weak estimators termed the tree model xgboost can construct a strong learner to fit the residual error of the last tree model minimizing the time cost of the computation and efficiently preventing model overfitting li et al 2019 for a given dataset assuming the model has generated k th of weak estimators the output is the sum of the prediction scores on all the branches of the corresponding weak estimator the object function of xgboost can be expressed as follows 1 obj xgboost i 1 n l y i y i k 1 k γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 where l y i y i is the total deviation between the predicted value y i and measured value y i t represents the structural branch of each weak estimator ω is the branch weights γ and λ are two regularization coefficients the regularization term k 1 k γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 was introduced to avoid model overfitting which represents the complexity of the k th estimator 2 2 ceemdan algorithm the empirical mode decomposition emd is one of the most concerning signal adaptive decomposition algorithms proposed by huang et al 1998 it decomposes a nonlinear and multicomponent time series into finite mono component signals termed intrinsic mode functions imfs each imf contains only a single instantaneous frequency which is essentially the smoothing of the time series data however the noise in the signal may cause the mode aliasing in imfs leading to false time frequency distributions and depriving the physical meaning of the imf the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd a noise assisted data analysis method was proposed by wu et al 2009 which adds normally distributed white noise to the original signal to counteract the noise effect occurring in the decomposition process nevertheless the added white noise may still exist after averaging the imf sequence set and the noise after signal reconstruction cannot be ignored the ceemdan is a signal adaptive decomposition algorithm proposed by torres et al 2011 by adding both positive and negative adaptive white noise into the time series data the ceemdan algorithm can well solve the mode aliasing and noise irreducible problems in the emd and eemd algorithms the implementation of the ceemdan algorithm can be formulated as the following steps 1 white noise is added in pairs to the original data to derive two mixtures of the time series data 2 m 1 m 2 1 1 1 1 s n where m1 and m2 are the original time series positive and negative gaussian white noise respectively s is the original time series and n is the gaussian white noise 2 the emd algorithm is applied to decompose each derived time series and a total of 2 n corresponding imf components are obtained 3 obtained each imf of original time series decomposition by averaging the set of imf components acquired in step 2 3 imf j t 1 2 n i 1 2 n imf ij where imf j t is the j th imf of the original time series decomposed by the ceemdan algorithm and imf ij is the i th imf of the j th derived time series the final decomposition results of ceemdan can be expressed as follows 4 j 1 k imf j t r e s where res is the decomposed residual sequence 2 3 vmd algorithm vmd as an adaptive and complete non recursive signal processing algorithm was proposed by dragomiretskiy et al 2014 which provides a theoretical basis for time series decomposition by iteratively calculating the optimal solution of the model in the data decomposition process the vmd algorithm can determine the frequency center and bandwidth of each mode and decompose a signal into several sub signals with specific sparsity properties imfs are defined as amplitude modulation amplitude frequency am fm signals in the vmd algorithm and can be expressed as follows 5 imf i t a i t c o s φ i t where imf i t is the i th imf a i and φ i are the amplitude and the phase of the component respectively the steps of the vmd decomposition are as follows 1 the hilbert huang transform is performed on each mode to compute the associated analytic signal and a unilateral frequency spectrum is obtained 2 convert each mode s frequency spectrum to baseband by mixing with an exponential of the estimated center frequency 3 estimate the bandwidth by gaussian smoothness of demodulated signal and obtain the constrained variation problem as follows 6 min u k w k k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 7 s t k u k f where uk u1 u2 uk is the set of all variational modes wk w1 w2 wk is the center frequency f is the original input signal to solve the above constrained variation problem the quadratic penalty term α and lagrange multiplier λ t are introduced 8 l u k w k λ α k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 f t k 1 k u k t 2 2 λ t k 1 k u k t to avoid the original minimization problem a sequence of iterative sub optimization termed the alternate direction method of multipliers admm was used to update the center frequency and bandwidth the iteration of the center frequency and bandwidth can be formulated as follows 9 u k n 1 ω f ω i k u k n 1 ω i k u i n ω λ n ω 2 1 2 α ω ω k n 2 ω k n 1 0 ω u k ω 2 d ω 0 u k ω 2 d ω k 1 k 2 4 sarima algorithm arima is a statistical method based model which describes the linear correlations between the system s future and the past state sarima model is an enhancement of the arima which takes into account the seasonality of the data and other external factors in time series forecasting wang et al 2021 the sarima model contains seven hyper parameters 10 p d q p d q s where p is the number of lagged observations involved in the sarima model d is the degree of differencing and q is the order of moving average window p d q are the corresponding p d q in seasonal factors s is the size of the period also called the length of the season the sarima model can be expressed as follows 11 a p l b p l s δ d δ s d y t c q l d q l s μ t 12 a p l 1 a 1 l a 2 l 2 a p l p 13 b l 1 b 1 l s b 2 l 2 s b p l ps 14 c q l 1 c 1 l c 2 l 2 c q l q 15 d q l 1 d 1 l s d 2 l 2 s

d and d are the non negative integer difference μt is the white noise series 2 5 correlation analysis correlation analysis was used to identify the relationship between the decomposed time series data of chla tn and other hydrologic factors the pearson correlation coefficient r is a common index to describe the association between two variables the values of r range from 1 to 1 where 0 indicated that there is no relevance and the correlation increases or decreases as the absolute value of r r gradually approaches 1 the negative values of r indicated a negative correlation between variables while the positive values of r indicated a positive correlation the p values for significance tests were calculated to determine whether the correlation between the two variables was significant when the p values are 0 05 the correlation is considered to be significant wang et al 2020 2 6 model development the development of the cvxs model contains the following steps step 1 the ceemdan algorithm was chosen to decompose the original time series data firstly and then generate the finite imfs the statistically significant lag time series of the imfs were determined by the partial autocorrelation function pacf values then these finite imfs were divided into three categories high frequency imf1 and imf2 intermediate frequency the statistically lag time of imf greater than 1 where imf imf3 imfn and low frequencies the statistically lag time of imf equal to 1 where imf imf3 imf respectively the time series data was normalized to strengthen the model performance using the preprocessing module in the scikit learn library version 0 24 2 of python 3 7 4 the ceemdan algorithm was implemented by the emd signal library version 0 2 12 of python 3 7 4 step 2 the vmd algorithm was employed to further resolve the imf1 and imf2 into several sub sequences called modes the pacf values were used once again to compute the statistically significant lag time series of modes the vmd algorithm was implemented by the vmdpy library version 0 2 of python 3 7 4 the central frequency method was used to find an appropriate number k to minimize the sum of the bandwidths of iterative decomposed modes time series huang et al 2016 step3 the corresponding significant lag time series of intermediate frequency imfs and modes were input to the xgboost model to forecast imfs and mode one by one to avoid the overfitting problem of the xgboost model in simple non linear time series forecasting the sarima model was employed for the low frequency imfs forecasting xgboost and sarima models were implemented by the scipy library version 1 7 1 and the statsmodels library version 0 12 2 of python 3 7 4 respectively the tuning hyper parameters of the xgboost model include n estimators subsample learning rate reg lambda reg alpha and max depth step 4 all the forecasted imfs and modes were summed to derive the forecasting results of the origin time series the technical flow chart associated with the method used in this study was shown in fig 1 for comparison the results were benchmarked with the standalone models xgboost svr dl and sarima and one layer decomposing hybrid models ceemdan xgboost ceemdan svr and ceemdan dl svr was implemented by scikit learn library version 0 24 2 dlwas implemented by pytorch library version 1 9 0 of python 3 7 4 2 7 model performance evaluation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias normalized root mean squared error nrmse and ratio of rmse and standard deviation of the measured values rsr were chosen as evaluating metrics in this study to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the cvxs model the nse is sensitive to the fluctuation of the time series data and is commonly used to characterize the stability of the prediction results ahmadisharaf et al 2022 naik et al 2019 the pbias is a robust statistical parameter that is commonly used to identify the average prediction bias allen et al 2007 the nrmse is used to evaluate the model predication error stow et al 2003 the rsr is a well established metric to describe how the errors relative to the magnitude of the observed values ahmad et al 2022 the calculation of four evaluating metrics are shown as follows 17 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 18 rsr i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 100 19 nrmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 y 20 pbias i 1 n y i y i i 1 n y i 100 where y i is the measured value y i is the forecasted value y is the average of the observed values y i is the average of the forecasted values and n is the sample size 3 study site this study used the data of the three different stations in coastal waters of hong kong china namely the dm1 station at deep bay the vm1 station in victoria harbour and the jm3 station at tseung kwan o fig 2 the selected stations are located in three typical areas and the impact of anthropogenic activities on these areas is substantially different deep bay is the most strongly affected by human activity among the three stations because it lies between the highly urbanized and industrial cities of hong kong and shenzhen the major grain producing areas of hong kong are also located on the deep bay area the agricultural area account for 35 81 in this district fig s1 a land based pollutants such as agricultural and industrial effluents from the rivers of shenzhen and hongkong were discharged through the estuary into the bay leading to frequent water contamination disasters in deep bay wang et al 2020 the victoria harbour is located in the downtown area of hong kong and the impervious area account for 70 38 in this district fig s1 b the high urbanization of victoria harbour has caused great quantity of municipal wastewater continue to flow into the coastal waters and consequently resulted in water contamination tang et al 2008 the tseung k wan o is highly industrialized yau et al 2012 most of the factories are located in the coastal area of this district and the impervious area account for 6 61 in this district fig s1 c thus the water quality of tseung k wan o reflects the influence of industrial wastewater on the water environment the water quality in the three bays is critical to the ecological safety and socio economic development of hong kong the balanced water ecology is of great significance to ensure the health of marine environment chla and tn were commonly used as proxies for eutrophication and algal bloom zhou et al 2020 pahlevan et al 2021 guo et al 2022 thus it is especially critical for the local government to forecast these two water quality indicators for early warning of the eutrophication and algal blooms of the three bays yin and harrison 2007 li et al 2022 in addition the forecast accuracy of the developed model at the three bay areas can verify the generalization ability of the model under different types of water pollutants the water quality data from january 1988 to december 2019 n 384 3 at three stations were collected from the environmental protection interactive centre epic hong kong https cd epic epd gov hk epicriver marine the monitoring frequency of water quality is once a month at each station the epci monitors the marine water quality and collects surface water samples at a depth of 0 5 m marine monitoring work was conducted on board a scientific vessel named dr catherine lam which is equipped with a satellite aided differential global positioning system dgps for accurate location of sampling stations at sea water quality parameters including temperature temp salinity ph turbidity and do were measured in situ by a conductivity temperature depth ctd profiler water samples were sent to the laboratories for analysis of other parameters including chla tn total phosphorus tp silicon oxide sio2 nitrite no2 n kjeldahl nitrogen cn escherichia coli ec total suspended solids tss volatile solid content vsc inorganic nitrogen ion ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nonionic ammonia nitrogen n nh3 n the fifth generation of monthly global climate reanalysis era5 data from january 1988 to december 2019 was acquired from the google earth engine cloud computing platform gee https earthengine google com five meteorological factors in era5 data including mean air temperature mat total precipitation t p surface pressure sp mean sea level pressure mslp and dewpoint temperature dt were selected to investigate the relationship between the meteorological factors and decomposed water quality time series data we divided the chla and tn observation datasets into training and testing sets according to different periods specifically the measured data of chla and tn from january 1988 to august 2013 308 months accounting for 80 of the total dataset was used for the model training and the measured dataset from september 2013 to december 2019 76 months 20 of the total dataset was used for model validation 4 results 4 1 water quality distribution fig 3 depicted the distribution of chla and tn concentrations at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations the chla and tn concentration ranges at the vm1 station were 0 1 50 μg l and 0 12 2 56 mg l respectively the values of these two the parameters at jm3 station were very close to those at the vm1 station with ranges of 0 08 44 μg l and 0 08 1 81 mg l respectively compared to the vm1 and jm3 stations the probability distribution for chla and tn concentrations distribution are noticeably higher at the dm1 station shifted to the right with a range from 0 1 to 260 μg l and 0 1 to 18 01 mg l respectively the high chla concentrations at all three stations indicate a high risk of eutrophication and algal blooms in these areas thus the forecasting of chla and tn concentrations at the three sites can well validate the model s early warning capability for extreme water quality events fig 4 shows the variation of the chla and tn from 1988 to 2019 at the dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations overall there was a consistent variation pattern of chla and tn concentrations the chla and tn concentrations at the three stations exhibited remarkable seasonal changes with the values in summer being considerably higher than in winter the statistics for chla and tn concentrations at the three stations were tabulated in table 1 the dm1 station has the highest median mean and standard deviation values of chla and tn concentrations among the three stations suggesting the water quality of dm1 is the worst this is mainly caused by polluted tributaries flowing from the agricultural areas in the southern region the statistics of chla and tn concentrations at vm1 and jm3 stations are relatively close which can be explained as the relatively close location of these two stations the reasonable ranges of chla and tn concentrations and significant seasonal patterns at the three stations indicate that the measured dataset can well capture the dynamic changes of chla and tn concentrations and thus can be used in the subsequent model construction 4 2 reconstruction of prediction results fig 5 and fig 6 show the time series data and fitting figures of chla and tn forecasted by the cvxs model at the dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations respectively table 2 list the results of four evaluation metrics of the cvxs model the result shows the chla and tn forecasted by the cvxs model had a consistent trend with the in situ measured data all the nse values of the cvxs model for forecasting chla and tn at three stations reached above 0 97 the pbais values of the cvxs model for forecasting chla at three stations were 0 76 0 44 and 10 74 respectively and the nrmse values were 0 21 0 25 and 0 13 the pbais values of the cvxs model for forecasting tn at three stations were 0 11 0 2 and 0 47 respectively with the nrmse of 0 05 0 04 and 0 05 the rsr values of the cvxs model for forecasting chla were 14 76 15 99 and 11 69 respectively and the rsr values were 13 30 8 17 and 8 32 for forecasting tn the variation tendency of chla and tn values forecasted by the cvxs model at all three stations was commendably consistent with the trend of in situ measured data fig 6 shows that the fitting line was consistent with the ideal fitting line which also proves that the cvxs model can accurately forecast the chla and tn concentrations 5 discussion 5 1 model performance comparison the performance of cvxs model was compared with xgboost svr dl sarima ceemdan xgboost ceemdan svr and ceemdan dl models fig 7 and table 4 6 show the fitting figure and statistical indicators results of eight models for forecasting chla and tn at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations the black line in fig 7 is the ideal fitting line the closer model fitting line to the ideal fitting line suggests that the model has a higher forecasting accuracy to comprehensively evaluate the model performance we adapted the method proposed by moriasi et al 2015 to classify the model performance as very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory based on the values nse and pbias if the nse and pbias grading results of the model are both very good we consider the accuracy of the model meets the forecasting requirements the grading methods of nse and pbias are shown in table 3 and the specific values of nse pbias rsr and nrmse for each model are shown in table s1 s3 for forecasting chla the performance of xgboost was very good based on nse and pbias at all the three stations the rsrs were 59 4 45 67 and 62 09 respectively the nse of svr was unsatisfactory at all three stations the pbias of svr was very good at the vm1 and jm3 stations and unsatisfactory at the dm1 station the nse of dl was unsatisfactory at all three stations and the pbias were unsatisfactory good and satisfactory respectively with rse of 81 37 81 37 and 94 34 the nse of sarima was unsatisfactory at the three stations and the pbias were satisfactory unsatisfactory and very good respectively with rsr of 103 66 85 40 and 100 16 table s1 s3 for forecasting tn the nse and pbias of xgboost were very good at all three stations with rsr of 51 26 58 22 and 37 68 respectively the nse of svr was unsatisfactory at all the three stations while the pbias was very good at all the three stations the nse of dl was unsatisfactory at all the three stations while the pbias of dl was very good at vm1 and jm3 stations and satisfactory at dm1 station the nse of sarima was unsatisfactory at all the three stations the pbias of sarima was very good at dm1 and jm3 stations and good at vm1 station the lower pbias values of the svr dl and sarima models at vm1 and jm3 stations could be attributed to the fact that the models overpredict as much as underpredict thus all the single models except the xgboost model have poor fitting performance the xgboost model adopts the boosting algorithm to forecast the target during the training process of the xgboost model a new weak estimator is iteratively generated to fit the residuals of the forecasting results of the previous t 1 weak estimators with the true values of the training samples furthermore the loss function of the xgboost model incorporates a regular term to effectively prevent the overfitting of the model the scatter points were mostly located in the upper part of the ideal fitting line for forecasting chla which indicated the error of svr dl and sarima mainly comes from the estimation of the high values for forecasting tn the errors of the svr and dl mainly come from the overestimation of the measured tn values while the error of the sarima mainly comes from the underestimation of the measured tn values compared to the xgboost model the svr model is rooted in structural risk minimization theory and featured by the use of kernels function and support vectors to construct an optimal classification surface in the feature space to make the learner converges globally optimized cherkassky et al 1997 dl employs a gradient descent algorithm to make the output of the model converge to the true value an activation function such as relu and sigmoid was added to each layer to achieve the nonlinear transformation of data mcclelland 1988 noise caused by the optical complexity of ocean waters makes it difficult for the svr model to determine an optimal hyperplane in nonlinear time series data thus leading to an overestimation of chla and tn the poor performance of dl indicated that the gradient descent approach in the model architecture still struggles to find the global minimum from the training dataset the basic assumption of the sarima model is that the current value depends on the historical time series dataset water quality monitoring data is considered as a non linear and non stationary signal sequence with noise song et al 2021 however these characteristics of the time series data reduce the performance of the sarima model the xgboost model was found as the best performed model among the four standalone models indicating that the boosting algorithm has a better ability than svr dl and sarima to mine the nonlinear characteristics of the time series data although the xgboost had the very good performance among the standalone models based on the nse and pbias the sparsity and periodicity of the water quality data hinder the forecasting ability of xgboost model further improvement with higher rsr and nrmse values for forecasting chla and tn the ceemdan algorithm has been widely used in eliminating autocorrelation in the nonstationary time series forecasting problem song and yao 2022 the introduction of gaussian white noise coefficients and covariance matrix in the decomposition of time series can effectively prevent the intricacy of time series zhang and hong 2019 for forecasting chla and tn the nse and pbias of ceemdan xgboost were very good at all three stations for forecasting chla the nse of ceemdan svr was unsatisfactory satisfactory and good at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations the pbias of ceemdan svr was very good at dm1 and jm3 station and unsatisfactory at vm1 station the nse of ceemdan dl was good at dm1 and vm1 station and very good at jm3 station the pbias of ceemdan dl was good satisfactory and very good at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations respectively for forecasting tn the nse of ceemdan svr was satisfactory at dm1 and jm3 stations and unsatisfactory at vm1 station the pbias of ceemdan svr was very good at vm1 and jm3 stations and unsatisfactory at dm1 station the nse of ceemdan dl was satisfactory good and very good at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations respectively the pbias was very good at vm1 and jm3 stations and satisfactory at dm1 station generally the forecasting accuracy of all the single models had significant improved performance after being processed by the ceemdan algorithm indicating the effectiveness of the ceemdan algorithm in feature extraction and nonlinear denoising the vmd algorithm can perform a non iterative decomposition of the input signal and adaptively select the frequency band with the most diagnostic information miao et al 2019 the cvxs performed very good based on the nse and pbias with the lowest rsr and nrmse values among all models furthermore the fitting line of the cvxs model was closest to the ideal fitting line followed by the ceemdan xgboost model suggesting the cvxs model performed best at all three stations fig 7 overall the accuracy of chla forecasting models at the dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations is ranked from high to low as cvxs ceemdan xgboost ceemdan dl ceemdan svr xgboost dl sarima svr the accuracy of tn forecasting models in dm1 station ranks from high to low as cvxs ceemdan xgboost ceemdan dl ceemdan svr xgboost svr sarima dl the performance of cvxs model outperformed other hybrid models reveled that the vmd algorithm helped to reduce the complexity features of the high frequencies time series to assist the xgboost in better forecasting the future water quality concentrations it is worth mention that the svr and dl models still had the poor fitting ability and higher error after integrating the decomposition algorithm which means the svr and dl are unsuitable as forecasting methods for low temporal resolution data 5 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is widely used for understanding how the model outputs are influenced by the inputs razavi et al 2021 thus we employed sensitivity analysis to investigate the variation in the accuracy of forecasted results with the changes in the percentage of the training dataset more specially we set four simulation scenarios which use 80 70 60 and 50 of total samples for model training and the remaining samples for model testing as shown in fig 8 with the percentage of training datasets decreasing from 80 to 50 the nse values of the cvxs model in chla forecasting at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations decreased 0 174 0 177 and 0 171 respectively the rsr values increased 17 62 17 24 and 16 96 respectively and pbias values increased 12 22 12 07 and 12 49 respectively for forecasting tn the nse values of the cvxs model at the three stations decreased 0 187 0 167 and 0 174 respectively the rsr values increased 17 60 21 05 and 21 92 respectively and the pbias increased 11 96 11 02 and 12 37 respectively overall the performance of cvxs model decreases rapidly with the percentage of training data sets decreased from 80 to 70 moreover the performance of cvxs model slowly decreases in case of the training dataset is smaller the results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the performance of cvxs model depends on the training sample size indeed the data driven model needs to learn enough information to better build the non linear relationship between the input and outputs however one of the biggest challenges in applying machine learning methods to forecast water quality is the limited available data to train the models according to the above sensitive analysis 80 of samples were selected as the training dataset and the developed model provides good accuracy in forecasting the chla and tn concentrations in this case 5 3 analysis of one layer model errors most of the currently available models were feeding the one layer decomposing data to machine learning algorithm under the identification of the optimal lag time to forecast the variation of seawater quality concentration and none of them fully considered the non stationarity and non linearity in sub decomposition sequence fijani et al 2019 attempted to decompose the first imf sequences called a high frequency sequence of the time series and applied the model to the daily chla and do forecasting in the prespa lake however the reason for decomposing high frequency sequences remains unclear besides machine learning algorithms were prone to overfitting in the forecasting of low frequency imfs and residual time series due to the lower dimension feature of training data therefore we chose ceemdan xgboost with the best performance in one layer decomposition models to analyze the origin of model errors according to fig 9 the nse values of the ceemdan xgboost model for chla and tn high frequency imfs imf1 and imf2 forecasting were 0 738 0 870 0 669 and 0 793 respectively while the nse values for the rest imfs forecasting were above 0 960 the results indicate that the errors of the model mainly derive from the forecasting for high frequency imfs this is because the ceemdan algorithm is maybe not enough to completely offset the inherent and newly added noise in high frequency imfs the advantage of the vmd algorithm over the ceemdan method is that there is no residual noise in the decomposed modes and redundant modes can be avoided liu et al 2016 therefore the vmd algorithm was used in the cvxs model to further eliminate the data noise and extract the valid information in the high frequency imfs overall the errors of the one layer model mainly came from the imf1 and imf2 thereby the secondary decomposition of imf1 and imf2 could effectively improve the accuracy of the model for water quality forecasting 5 4 interpretation of the physical mechanisms of the cvxs model the hydrological and meteorological factors play an important role in explaining the temporal variation of water quality parameter concentrations zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 the interaction between water quality parameters is the basis of current research in water environment assessment ni et al 2018 therefore in the previous studies the external hydrological factors such as turbidity and ammonia nitrogen and meteorological factors such as air temperature and rainfall were widely used as the input variables to develop a model for forecasting water quality sharma et al 2019 the data driven methods forecast the water quality by mining the intrinsic patterns of water quality with statistical methodology however the poor understanding of the physical mechanism leads to tension between the interpretability and accuracy of those methods thus the correlation analysis among the chla tn and other hydrologic and climate factors was employed to explore the theoretical basis of the cvxs model according to fig 10 a the correlation between chla and other seawater quality parameters except the n nh3 n was negligible suggesting the interaction between water quality parameters in coastal waters is weaker due to the optical complexity of coastal waters however fig 10 b shows the interaction between water quality parameters was well reflected in the correlation between the decomposed intermediate frequency and low frequency imfs moreover the imfs of some seawater quality parameters are even strongly correlated with the imfs of chla no2 n imf7 with chla imf8 for example the results indicated that the driven effects of other environmental factors on chla have well embedded in the fluctuation of decomposed imfs of chla time series which provides the physical mechanism for the cvxs model according to fig 11 a c for water quality parameters eg no2 n ion and nh3 n with a strong correlation with tn their imfs also have a strong correlation with the imfs of tn for seawater quality parameters eg chla tp and ec et al with negligible correlation to tn their interaction with tn was also revealed in decomposed time series eg tss imf6 tempure imf4 which further supports the robustness of the cvxs model it is worth noting that the correlations between imfs of water quality parameters show large variability eg do with chla tss with tn which can be interpreted as the potential effects of positive and negative feedback between the hydrological elements due to the dynamic hydrological cycle nordstrom et al 2005 according to fig 12 a d the chla was positively correlated with the total precipitation t p mean air temperature mat and dewpoint temperature dt and negatively correlated with the surface pressure sp and mean sea level pressure mslp the tn was positively correlated with the sp and mslp but negatively correlated with t p mat and dt the imfs of chla and tn also showed a correlation with the imfs of meteorological factors some low frequency imfs of meteorological factors are even strongly correlated with the imfs of chla and tn e g dt imf1 and chla imf8 mat imf6 and chla imf8 mslp imf7 and tn imf8 t p and imf6 to this end it can be inferred that the effects of meteorological factors on water quality parameters are indirectly reflected in the temporal changes of imfs of chla and tn overall the above correlation analysis suggested that the decomposed data of chla tn and external variables are correlated with each other which well explained the feasibility of cvxs in forecasting chla and tn without employing other external variables as input e g tp tss and sp 5 5 long term forecasting ability of the cvxs model the water quality data series are decomposed into several subsequences and the cvxs model forecasts the value of each sub sequence at the next time horizon then the predicted results of in next time horizon of the sub sequences were summed to obtain the concentration of the original water quality time series at the next time horizon thus the initial condition of the next time horizon prediction depended on the partial autocorrelation coefficient of the imfs and modes of the sub sequence in this study the partial autocorrelation function pacf was used to determine the appropriate number of input variables for developing each sub series forecasting model the performance of pacf for input selection has been verified in previous studies he et al 2020 we iterate the forecasting results of the cvxs model to check the model accuracy and stability in the long term forecasting of chla and tn concentration the variation of nse values of the cvxs model in different forecasting time horizons is shown in fig 13 the errors of the cvxs model for both chla and tn forecasting increased significantly with the widening of forecasting time horizons when the forecasting time horizon reached three months the nse of the cvxs model for both chla and tn forecasting at dm1 vm1 and jm3 stations was lower than 0 9 and these values dropped below 0 6 when the forecasting time horizon reached six months this is because the cvxs model forecasted chla and tn concentrations rely on the partial correlation of time series with its own lagged values causing the limitation of the length of the forecasting time horizon overall the results indicate that the optimal forecasting time horizons of the cvxs model for monthly time series data are one to two months 5 6 uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis is a useful tool to investigate the impacts of different error sources on the model performance loucks et al 2017 generally uncertainty can be classified as epistemic and aleatory according to the nature of missing or unknown information ahmadisharaf et al 2019 for the cvxs model the aleatory is mainly caused by the dynamic and chaotic characteristic of water quality data the source of the epistemic uncertainty of cvxs could be attributed to the imperfect knowledge of data decomposition mechanisms previous studies suggested that appropriate data decomposition strategies and modeling methods are the keys to developing a forecast model yu et al 2022 in cvxs model the ceemdan algorithm is used to decompose the original time series compared with the eemd algorithm the ceemdan algorithm minimizes the noise residuals in the reconstructed time series significantly by adding a limited amount of adaptive white noise however the spurious patterns of time series data may appear in the early stages of decomposition resulting in noise still being included in the first two imfs thus the vmd algorithm was employed to decompose the high frequency decomposed time series data however for water quality time series data from different hydrometric stations the imf number of ceemdan decompositions and the mode number of vmd decompositions could be different resulting in varying forecasting performances of the cvxs model as can be seen from fig 6 the cvxs model performs best at jm3 station for chla forecasting followed by vm station and dm1 station the nse values are 0 984 0 979 and 0 978 respectively at jm3 vm and dm1 stations moreover the prerequisite assumption of the cvxs model is that the variability of the water quality parameters induced by hydrologic factors has been inherently embedded in the decomposed time series data although this hypothesis has been confirmed through the correlation analysis the physical and chemical processes involved in water quality changes in the real world are more complex thus resulting in the uncertainty of the proposed model in water quality forecasting 5 7 the impacts of land use change on water quality land use change can directly reflect the impact of human activities on the coastal environmental wijesiri et al 20018 based on the remote sensing dataset of land use in the districts where the three monitoring stations are located the relationship between the land use change and water quality variation from 1990 to 2019 was analyzed the spatial resolution of the land use dataset is 30 m 30 m the land use classes include cropland forest shrub grassland water snow barren impervious and wetland according to table s4 the land use in the coastal area of hong kong has changed dramatically from 1990 to 2019 the basic trend is an increase in the impervious areas and a decrease in the grassland water barren and forest the impervious area in the three districts increased by 195 95 25 76 and 133 89 respectively according to the table 7 at the dm1 station the chla was negatively correlated with cropland area with r of 0 48 and positively correlated with the shrub area with r of 0 51 the tn was positively correlated with the shrub area and water area with r of 0 39 and 0 40 respectively and presented a negative correlation with impervious area with r of 0 42 at the vm1 station the chla was negatively correlated with water area and barren area with r of 0 42 and 0 39 respectively the tn was positively correlated with cropland area grassland area and barren area with r of 0 58 0 63 and 0 55 respectively and presented a negative correlation with impervious with r of 0 52 at the jm3 station there was no statistically significant correlation between the chla and landcover classes p greater than 0 05 the tn was negatively correlated with shrub area and impervious area both with an r of 0 47 and was positively correlated with barren with r of 0 47 in hong kong a total of 944 algal bloom events were reported between 1975 and 2018 afcd 2019 previous research has shown that the frequency of algal blooms in the coastal waters of hong kong is about 10 to 20 times per year guo et al 2020 the nonpoint source pollution from the urban surface runoff and cropland increases nutrient loading in the coastal waters of hong kong leading to frequent algal blooms qi et al 2004 however the correlation analysis between the area of land use classes and water quality parameters shows that the water quality variation cannot be determined from the changes in land use classes alone lu et al 2021 suggested that combining land use types with other factors e g socioeconomic data could provide a good solution for investigating changes in water quality concentrations wang et al 2020 found that physical conditions such as wind and water currents influenced the algal bloom dynamics in the coastal waters of hong kong the impact mechanism of land use classes on algal bloom outbreaks is complex and needs to be further studied in future work 5 8 results implication and guidance for water environment management over the past two decades the rapid urbanization and economic development deteriorated water quality in china s coastal waters such as the eutrophication and red tides the frequency of harmful algae blooms has drastically increased with the excessive nutrients input from point sources such as the effluent from wastewater treatment plants and nonpoint sources such as river discharges leading to serious coastal water pollution ecosystem degradation and great financial losses for example a bloom event that occurred in the coastal area of fujian province in 2012 caused economic losses of more than 2 billion cny li et al 2019b the golden tide that occurred in the southern yellow sea at the end of 2016 caused economic losses of nearly 500 million cny yan long et al 2019 there is a total of 30170 km2 of sea areas affected by eutrophication in summer according to the bulletin of marin ecology and environment status of china in 2021 https www mee gov cn hjzl sthjzk jagb to improve marine ecological and environmental quality the china government introduced a series of policies to protect water quality in coastal waters such as the marine ecological and environmental protection plan during the 14th five year plan period the action plan for comprehensive treatment of key sea areas and the opinions on strengthening supervision of the ecological environment of mariculture these policies request long term monitoring in parameters like tn and chla in coastal waters to improve water quality therefore the developed model could provide technical support for the implementation of the water environment management policies based on the optical classification method proposed by morel and prieur 1977 the coastal waters can be characterized as case ii in which optical properties are dominated by several optical proxies such as phytoplankton colored dissolved organic matter suspended sediments and detritus these substances individually or collectively influence the oceanic processes morel et al 1980 munnooru et al 2019 previous studies have shown that the complex optical properties of coastal waters influence the distribution of phytoplankton biomass leading to the non linear characteristic of the water quality data dodson et al 2000 mélin and vantrepotte 2015 therefore the accuracy of traditional models is unsatisfactory for water quality forecasting in coastal regions the cvxs model which is based on data driven conceptualization greatly reduces the uncertainty caused by insufficient understanding of the optical complexity of coastal waters moreover the cvxs model only requires the monitored water quality time series data thereby it can be easily applied to other stations this advantage of cvxs model greatly lessens the problem of poor model portability due to the large amount of auxiliary data required the water quality data can be obtained through the nearby hydrological monitoring station which provides new possibilities for monitoring algal blooms and forecasting future eutrophication trends in coastal cities 5 9 limitations of cvxs model in this study the performance of the proposed cvxs model was verified in three coastal hydrological observation stations however some limitations of this study should also be noted 1 the proposed cvxs model is highly data depended the number of training samples and data quality directly affects the accuracy of the model 2 the performance of the cvxs model varies greatly over different forecasting time horizons therefore the forecast values must be updated using new in situ monitoring data to forecast the next time horizon 3 cvxs model is based on the black box mechanism hence a new training process must be performed before applying the cvxs model to other study areas subsequent research is expected to further validate the performance of the cvxs model on the coastal area under various surface heterogeneous climate conditions 6 conclusion in this study we established a hybrid model termed the cvxs model based on decomposition algorithms and machine learning algorithms to forecast chla and tn concentrations in coastal waters the chla and tn concentrations were forecasted based on historical data as it doesn t require the input of any other auxiliary data thus the scheme has a well transferability for applying to other coastal areas by employing two decomposed algorithms the scheme can further improve the forecasting accuracy compared to standalone model and one layer hybrid models by introducing correlation analysis our results showed that there was a strong correlation between imfs of hydrological and meteorologic factors and imfs of chla and tn thus the scheme combined decomposition algorithms and xgboost model can extract the variability in chla and tn time series induced by hydrologic factors thus explaining the physical mechanism of the data driven method overall the scheme proposed in this paper shows the potential of decomposition algorithms and machine learning models to forecast chla and tn concentrations in coastal waters which could help decision making departments to identify the abnormal areas of water and make timely countermeasures credit authorship contribution statement
