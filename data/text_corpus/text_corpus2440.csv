12200,groundwater serves more than 80 of agriculture and 60 of drinking water in india thus making it a demandable resource in the study area in this study the groundwater storage change was determined by using rl05 land data product january 2003 to december 2016 which was accessed from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite total soil moisture up to 2m depth canopy water storage and snow water equivalent derived from global land data assimilation system gldas noah was subtracted from terrestrial water storage tws for extracting the groundwater component revealing maximum groundwater storage change by 7 52 cm year in delhi northern uttar pradesh and some parts of haryana in water stressed regions of india january 2003 to december 2016 the groundwater depletion rate in the cities of delhi meerut dehradun and chandigarh are 3 682 0 8 cm year 3 62 0 7 cm year 3 1 0 87 cm year 2 73 0 6 cm year respectively the groundwater storage change gwsc depletion rate observed in delhi meerut dehradun chandigarh in january 2003 to may 2010 are 3 43 1 37 3 41 1 22 3 72 1 52 3 43 1 05 cm year respectively and in august 2010 to december 2016 depletion rate is 5

services igs station at indian institute of science iisc bangalore 2014 2016 is correlated by 0 71 analysis conducted in metro cities delhi chennai bengaluru kolkata and mumbai shows with time succession groundwater storage has suffered a major depletion in spite of quantified rainfall in these places the grace derived gwsc values agrees reasonably with in situ well observations by pearson s coefficient 0 89 0 88 0 87 and 0 74 for delhi haryana punjab and uttar pradesh thereby justifying remote sensing approach and further substantiate our research study that regional gws mapping can be achieved by the grace mission rapidly and accurately graphical abstract image 1 keywords grace gws twsc gwc gps groundwater recharge 1 introduction the valuable resource used in sustenance of agriculture industry and domestic uses globally even in desert or arid regions is groundwater as 230 km3 of groundwater is being used by indian population marking itself as the surplus use of groundwater groundwater is the main source for irrigation 80 between 1970 and 1999 the total area used up for irrigation tripled to 33 100 000 ha and drinking 60 mcguire 2009 the most populated countries of world namely china and india as well as arid areas lacking sustainable quantity of freshwater like middle east and north africa are the provenance of groundwater utilization in superfluous quantity fulfilling activities in field of agriculture industry and household groundwater plays the most vital role and making its mark as a global asset but extravagant use of groundwater can lead to drought as well as serious stringency thus imposing threat on development of ecosystem social and economy foster and loucks 2006 gleeson et al 2010 the land of increased population will continue to face the problem of groundwater shortage if current rate of groundwater depletion globally and increased dweller number is not balanced properly gleeson et al 2012 well the worse has struck the agriculture ground at a rate of 174 since 1950 and hence agriculture has been using the maximum percentage of groundwater at a rate of 90 scanlon et al 2007 wang et al 2006 and scanlon et al 2012 have found depletion in groundwater level up to 100m in some places vividly due to its superfluous use recharging of groundwater is a remarkably slow process and its increased detoriation rate could possibly become a threat to those regions as recovery of previous groundwater rate will be difficult in forthcoming period not only in plains highly populated regions of india but also in hilly regions of himalaya groundwater depletion is a major issue snow melt plays the significant role unlike the plains of india prakash et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2015 the threat not only limits to resource insufficiency economy and social sustenance but also high energy is consumed to extract groundwater when the water head is lowering down drastically imposing a huge pressure on strained supply of energy thus the global hydrological cycle and its correlation to climate change can be inferred by a sound knowledge on changes in storage rate of groundwater döll et al 2014 concurs that study of an area s geology quantifies groundwater storage accurately as well as its variations both temporally and spatially although local change in groundwater level can be delineated by measurements of limited well water level but in large scale like river basin requires both good knowledge of geology as well as close knit well network chen et al 2014 the lowering of water table has been increasing in recent times due to excess extraction of groundwater especially in northern parts of india so as to suffice the hiked population hoque et al 2007 central ground water board cgwb of india 2012 which is actually a matter of concern as the decreased groundwater level shall impose a threat to climate change in future barnett et al 2005 kumar et al 2005 amarasinghe et al 2007 jasrotia et al 2011 2016 jasrotia and kumar 2014 thus north india bagging the title of the most water stressed regions of world cgwb un salvation of groundwater situation has aroused due to climate change alongwith contamination of groundwater resources on large scale and diverting surface water from north india to quench thirst of dry regions in south india india is a country of rising population jain and singh 2003 jha and sinha 2009 chandramouli 2011 washington et al 2012 where every minute there is hike in numbers of people to suffice and quench thirst of this huge population water storage is the primary activity and the stored water derived from within ground subsurface groundwater needs to be analysed scientifically in terms of quality and quantity brockwell et al 2002 kovalevsky 1992 jasrotia et al 2019 adimalla and taloor 2020 haque et al 2020 water crisis rate in india has grown severe and bracing for a turbulent future as well as stresses on groundwater has grown tremendously due to population hike so it is essential to keep a check on levels of groundwater for its long term sustenance john and malik 2006 famiglietti et al 2011 long et al 2016 the limited number of observation wells in hilly as well as arid regions makes it difficult to measure the regional groundwater storage variation the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace paved a possible way to study the water resources regionally rodell and famiglietti 2001 pokhrel et al 2013 this new technology measures groundwater storage variations with real time thus making it a useful tool in recording depletion rates of water bodies large and small yeh et al 2006 rodell et al 2007 although due to its low spatial resolution 200 000 km2 scanlon et al 2012 it becomes difficult to connect grace calculation to ground observation points locally it uses twin satellites tapley et al 2004 famiglietti and rodell 2013 to measure detailed earth s gravity anomaly which studies the distribution of mass ocean geology and climatic changes all over the planet and its variation taking place from time to time it is basically a collaboration between centre for space research at the university of texas at austin nasa s jet propulsion laboratory the german aerospace centre and germany s national research centre for geosciences potsdam there are innumerable excerpts which reflects the service of grace data in studying groundwater storage depletion both at basin and continental scale rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 reager and famiglietti 2013 voss et al 2013 richey et al 2015 but these data require ground validation which shall improve the data algorithms and make data retrieval easy task watkins et al 2015 regarding this very few studies across globe swenson and wahr 2006 rodell et al 2007 strassberg et al 2007 scanlon et al 2012 shamsudduha et al 2012 bhanja et al 2014 panda and wahr 2016 long et al 2016 examples like gangetic basin panda and wahr 2016 part of an indian state gujarat chinnasamy et al 2013 parts of north west india long et al 2016 since 2002 the time of its launch estimation of tws terrestrial water storage change is also recorded successfully in various parts of the world tapley et al 2004 singh et al 2017 grace has shown unmatched accuracy in measuring earth s gravity change for over eleven years and has proved its potential in measuring earth s gravity change by removing geophysical causes e g wahr et al 1998 chen et al 2009 atmospheric and oceanic causes using numerical models bettadpur 2012 over non glaciated land areas and also measured tws changes which includes contributions from water storage changes due to surface snow subsurface soil and groundwater reservoirs which ultimately makes its efficient in quantifying groundwater storage change both in soil and snow global land data assimilation system gldas serves the purpose to absorb information from both satellite and ground data with the help of advanced land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques it runs globally and gives high resolution of 0 25 producing results in 48 h real time previous studies rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 shows that during the period of august 2002 to october 2008 a combined study of grace and gldas was carried out over the ganges bramhaputra river basins defining significant results in depletion of tws the groundwater depletion rate duly noted in northwest india is 17 7 4 5 gt year rodell et al 2009 54 9 gt year april 2002 to june 2008 across northwest to northeast tiwari et al 2009 4 8 0 4 gt year october 2003 to march 2010 california s central valley famiglietti et al 2011 8 3 1 1 gt year 2003 2010 in north china feng et al 2013 determination of terrestrial water storage change is now possible by integrated study of grace and the global positioning system gps the correlation factor and weighted root mean square reduction between grace and gps are 75 6 and 28 9 as suggested by wang et al 2017 according to fritsche et al 2012 the network of 200 gps station worldwide helps in validating the varying rate of continental water storage which is computed by hydrological models the varying water storage rate can cause crustal deformation with displacement in gps reference points used for measurement besides this also results in change of earth s gravity field measured by grace data and also estimates the reduced grace signal schmidt et al 2006 and then compared with tws models likewise calculation subtracting from total gravity variations of mass movements both oceanic and atmospheric the dug well data are provided by central ground water board cgwb of india but these well records shows voids like large temporal gaps missing records or insufficient observations which was screened out through systematic quality control procedures using the datasets of cgwb these well time series afterwards converted to groundwater storage changes for correlating with the same spatial resolution as grace level 2 tws solution we have conducted study in punjab chandigarh dehradun haryana delhi uttar pradesh kolkata mumbai bengaluru where groundwater crisis has literally devoured them the prime reason behind it is overutilization of groundwater for both domestic and commercial purposes the depleting groundwater poses a threat in near future to combat the upcoming risks a venture has been taken upon where interannual variability of groundwater shall be studied from 2003 to 2016 using gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite observations global land data assimilation system gldas land surface models lsm and gps global positioning system together and then validating the results with dug well data provided by cgwb there are 1180 wells have been constructed in northern states of india fig 1 where depletion rate is at its extremity but validation studies has also noted anomalous changes in southern city bengaluru thus the present research shall fulfil the goal of utilizing groundwater in a more productive manner by studying the depletion rate in these thirteen years and try to extract the principal causes behind it for providing a crisis free environment to mankind 2 study area india is located in south of asia is the seventh largest country by area bounded by the indian ocean on the south the arabian sea on the southwest and the bay of bengal on the southeast misra et al 2006 major himalayan origin rivers that substantially flow through india include the ganges and the brahmaputra both of which drains into bay of bengal aggarwal et al 2004 major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding includes godavari the mahanadi the kaveri and the krishna which also drains into the bay of bengal and the narmada and the tapti which drains into the arabian sea coastal features include the marshy rann of kutch of western india and the alluvial sundarbans delta of eastern india the latter is shared with bangladesh india has two archipelagos the lakshadweep coral atolls off india s south western coast and the andaman and nicobar islands a volcanic chain in the andaman sea in the present study evaluation of groundwater storage gws has been carried out in highly populated and industrial regions of india the five major metro cities delhi mumbai chennai kolkata and bengaluru have been selected tables 1 and 2 fig 2 where despite of receiving high intensity rainfall groundwater storage rate depletes sharply which implies the failure of sufficient storage after sustaining the huge population and rising industries mishra et al 2018 similarly cities like chandigarh delhi dehradun and meerut are given special attention where geomorphologically and climatically speaking rainfall is well sufficient for surplus storage of groundwater but the geographical area falls short in fitting rising population and new industrial ventures which deteriorates the beauty of these cities and also disturbs the tectonism of himalaya thereby marking themselves as water stressed regions of india therefore in this study we will justify how the metro cities suffers groundwater depletion because of its sprawling population co2 emissions and rising urban jungle whereas the beauty of northern india is turning into water stressed regions 3 methodology in the present study data are analysed as follows for the period january 2003 to december 2016 each year data was separately analysed with reference to the seasonal variation pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon table 3 for the period january 2003 to december 2016 a monthly time series of grace derived from tws smc gwsc over the cities like meerut dehradun delhi and chandigarh for the period 2003 2016 data obtained from annual variation of groundwater storage and precipitation derived from gwsc were analysed in metro cities like chennai mumbai kolkata delhi and bengaluru for the period may 2005 to november 2016 a comparative study has been carried out for both pre and post monsoon groundwater fluctuation between grace and well data in cities uttar pradesh punjab haryana and delhi and for the period 2014 2016 a comparative study has been carried out between grace gldas derived total gws and gps derived vertical deformation of igs station iisc bangalore gautam et al 2017 3 1 analysis of grace data centre for space research at university of texas austin csr jet propulsion laboratory jpl at california institute of technology and deutsches geoforschungs zentrum gfz provides the monthly grace data which we have utilised the jpl s monthly model in our study area a set of spherical harmonics clm and slm is present in each month s file used for generating the gravity anomaly of a region using this set of spherical harmonics surface mass density has been calculated using the equation 1 wahr et al 1998 to reduce the spatial noise a decorrelation filtering swenson and wahr 2006 and 300 km gaussian smoothing jekeli 1981 has also been applied eq 1 σ θ ϕ a ρ a v e 3 l 0 m 0 l p l m cos θ 2 l 1 1 k l c l m cos m ϕ s l m sin m ϕ where θ ϕ is latitude and longitude k l is love number p l m is normalised legendre function and ρ a v e is average density of water terrestrial water storage tws calculated by grace contains both soil moisture and groundwater soil moisture sm is calculated by averaging four layers 2m depth information sm 1 0 10 cm sm 2 10 40 cm sm 3 40 100 cm and sm 4 100 200 cm all the data are converted into gm cm2 from kg m2 by multiplying with 0 1 thus gldastotal is calculated as tsm cws swe mean tsm cws swe 0 1 thus gws groundwater storage change is estimated from eq 2 rodell et al 2009 eq 2 δ gws δ tws δ sm gldas for creating two dimensional gws maps kernel interpolation with barriers method is equivalent to polynomial interpolation also studies about the barriers in study area it also allows to interpolate the contamination levels of lakes and water bodies thereby obtaining accurate levels compared to methods that doesn t adjust for barriers 3 2 validation of groundwater storage with in situ well data data were obtained from total 1180 wells spread across the states of punjab chandigarh haryana delhi uttar pradesh selection of a suitable well subset for pre processing to achieve the accurate results is necessary because of temporal gaps missing data and variation from well to well in number time series data observations for the well depths bhanja et al 2016 but virtually no metadata was present so identification among the confined and unconfined aquifer type extent of land use and its impact to the local water table or deriving specific yield information at each well site becomes quite difficult places where there is presence of high quality well data in sufficient number simple hydrogeology and dependency on groundwater is high processing of cgwb data is being carried out so we validate the high quality well data selected from the uttar pradesh punjab haryana and delhi with grace derived groundwater storage change over uttar pradesh punjab haryana and delhi vinnikov and robock 2002 3 3 validation of groundwater storage with gps data in this study we have used the gps data of igs station iisc bangalore for the year 2014 2016 and analysed the data using gamit globk 10 70 software in itrf08 reference frame mikhailov et al 2004 the results were obtained in the form of daily solution variation both in horizontal and vertical deformation daily solutions were then converted into monthly solutions so it becomes consistent with the grace data but only vertical deformation has been used since groundwater load plays a considerable role in the strain accumulation in the active tectonic areas machiwal et al 2012 4 results and discussions the groundwater storage change is estimated using the rescaled grace twsc data soil moisture data canopy water storage cws and snow water equivalent swe from gldas various maps are prepared to visualize the status of groundwater regime in india using the rescaled grace jpl level 2 ascii data and gldas soil moisture both having spatial resolution of 10 10 the rate at which the groundwater storage changes since 2003 2016 is determined by variations in colours and its related values fig 2 at three seasonal breaks pre monsoon and post monsoon during pre monsoon march may the gwsc groundwater storage change rate is high around 1 02 cm year dark blue in western central and southern india the rate decreases in value as we venture towards north of india where the decreasing values is demarcated by colour variation of order light blue green yellow orange and red respectively especially at indo gangetic belt reaching to the lowest value 4 64 cm year fig 2a the next seasonal break which is post monsoonal period october december an anomaly is observed in the southern part of india where the gwsc rate should be high because of heavy rainfall but instead of showing the dark blue hue the colour turns light blue to green with scattered yellow spots on it which strongly approves the anomaly and reasons out the overutilization of groundwater there an indicator of booming population and industries which the available groundwater fails to sustain dug well site indicates bengaluru fig 2b the anomaly value lies close to 4 46 cm year the gwsc rate is same as we move towards north like pre monsoonal season unlike pre monsoonal season the rate along the indo gangetic plain decreases more the red colour saturation is more 4 46 cm year the overall groundwater storage changes rates from high 0 48 cm year to low 5 14 cm year affecting the same areas like pre monsoonal event fig 2c so we can decipher from it very that post monsoon could have reported low gwsc as compared to pre monsoon season but it is not the case which clearly indicates the superfluous usage of groundwater leading to storage crisis fig 2d represents the groundwater potential measured yield

dehradun delhi and chandigarh where analysis is done on a large scale resulting in some models which explains the monthly time series of grace derived twsc terrestrial water storage change modelled sm soil moisture rf rainfall and estimated gwsc groundwater storage change the time series is analysed in two phases of the period taken january 2003 to july 2010 and august 2010 to december 2016 in delhi the soil moisture ranges between 0 and 2 cm depletion is gwsc rate is 3 68 0 80 cm year fig 3 a as already mentioned that analysis is carried out in two phases so for the first phase jan 2003 july 2010 the gwsc depletion rate is 3 43 1 37 cm year the graph of gwsc and twsc rises with rise in rainfall rate and vice versa matches the rhythm but in the second phase august 2010 december 2016 where depletion rate is 5 53 1 57 cm year quite high compared to the first phase with rise in rainfall rate the gwsc and twsc graph goes downward to negative values only exception is noticed in september 2011 meerut shows the soil moisture range between 0 and 5 cm depletion is gwsc rate is 3 62 0 70 cm year fig 3b the first phase jan 2003 july 2010 the gwsc depletion rate is 3 41 1 22 cm year the graph of gwsc and twsc rises with rise in rainfall rate and vice versa but in the second phase august 2010 to december 2016 where depletion rate is 7 12 1 40 cm year quite high compared to the first phase with rise in rainfall rate the gwsc and twsc graph goes downward to negative values only exception is noticed in september 2011 fig 3c looking by dehradun the soil moisture range between 0 and 3 cm depletion is gwsc rate is 3 10 0 87 cm year fig 3c the first phase jan 2003 to july 2010 the gwsc depletion rate is 3 72 1 52 cm year the graph of gwsc and twsc matches the rainfall rate but in the second phase august 2010 to december 2016 where depletion rate is 4 98 1 74 cm year quite high compared to the first phase with rise in rainfall rate the gwsc and twsc graph goes downward to negative values exception observed in september 2010 and 2011 chandigarh shows the soil moisture range between 0 and 3 cm depletion is gwsc rate is 2 73 0 60 cm year fig 3d the first phase january 2003 to july 2010 the gwsc depletion rate is 3 43 1 05 cm year the graph of gwsc and twsc matches the rainfall rate but in the second phase august 2010 to december 2016 where depletion rate is 3 92 1 20 cm year little high than the first phase with rise in rainfall rate the gwsc and twsc graph goes downward to negative values exception observed in september 2010 metro cities chennai mumbai kolkata delhi and bengaluru also called urban jungle with its high rise buildings sprawling population and air polluting industries are taken into focus for the study of groundwater storage during the period 2003 2016 taking into consideration the gwsc bar chart and annual precipitation fig 4 a and b comparing them we can see in chennai the gwsc is low in 2003 2005 when the rate of precipitation is 85 170 cm 2006 2007 the gwsc rate rise to 4 5 cm when the rate of precipitation is 100 140 cm 2008 2012 shows a vanishing gwsc rate when rate of precipitation is 20 140 cm 2013 2016 depletes gwsc rate to 5 cm when the rate of precipitation is 70 100 cm mumbai the gwsc is low in 2003 2005 when the rate of precipitation is quite high 2006 2008 the gwsc rate rise to 3 cm when the rate of precipitation decreases indicating less wastage of water 2009 shows a depleting gwsc rate when rate of precipitation is less compared to 2008 2010 2011 depletes gwsc rate to 3 4 cm when the rate of precipitation is 230 250 cm 2012 shows a vanishing gwsc rate whereas the rate of precipitation is 160 cm 2013 2014 observes gwsc rate of 3 4 cm and decreased rainfall 2015 shows vanishing depletion rate and rainfall rate decreases than 14 cm 2016 shows a depleted gwsc rate of 2 cm and rainfall rate of 250 cm which means there has been splurging amount of groundwater usage kolkata the gwsc is 0 4 cm in 2003 2005 when the rate of precipitation is 150 200 cm 2009 2016 the gwsc rate depletes and depletion rate increases proportionately to 9 cm when the rate of precipitation 120 150 cm except for 2013 where rate is 180 cm and 2015 where rate is 160 cm delhi the gwsc shows linear decreasing trend in 2003 2005 15 0 cm when the rate of precipitation is 60 100 cm 2007 2016 the gwsc rate shows a linear depletion rate of 0 22 cm when the rate of precipitation is 50 80 cm with exception in 2010 and 2013 when it rose to maximum bengaluru the gwsc rate shows decreased depletion in 2003 2005 when the rate of precipitation is 60 150 cm 2006 2008 the gwsc rate is 0 7 cm when the rate of precipitation is 70 130 cm 2009 shows a depleting gwsc rate 2010 2011 shows gwsc of 10 cm when the rate of precipitation is 70 60 cm 2012 2016 shows gwsc rate of value 0 to 2 cm when the rate of precipitation is 60 100 cm the populated north and north western states of india uttar pradesh punjab haryana and delhi so we have taken well dug data as well grace data and then reviewed the changes that took place in those data alongwith time till now results were derived using grace data which is nothing but satellite data so for achieving the certainty dug well and tube well data has been used sorted into 1 x 1 to match the pixels of grace data for each region pearson coefficient a linear correlation between two variables x and y here x is grace data and y is well data its value lies between 1 and 1 is calculated new delhi shows pearson coefficient of 0 89 here data shares the same graphical rhythm but a slight depletion is noticed in may 2010 where values of gwc is higher than the gwsc depletion is observed in november 2009 and again rises in november 2010 where the gwsc values are higher than gwc values the trend continues and suffers depletion in november 2010 where both the data matches its sinusoidal curves fig 5 a haryana shows pearson coefficient of 0 88 the gwsc and gwc groundwater change disturbs the rhythm of sinusoidal curve in may 2007 well data shows depletion compared to gwsc values whereas between november 2008 2009 the gwc rises over gwsc values depletion takes place in may 2010 where both the data shows same values again in november 2010 to may 2012 the curve rises but gwc dominates over the gwsc values from november 2012 to november 2016 again a non harmonic curve can be seen fig 5b punjab shows pearson coefficient of 0 87 gwc and gwsc data shows a rhythmic curve and depletion occurs in may 2008 where the gwsc values goes down below zero than the well data values it rises again in november 2008 with well data values dominating the gwsc values with a sharp depletion occurring again in may 2010 where well data and gwsc values matches from nov 2010 to may 2012 the gwsc values shows an upward trend but the well values lie at 0 to 1 cm after november 2012 both the curves deplete and gwsc data values are higher compared to the well data values fig 5c uttar pradesh shows pearson coefficient value of 0 74 gwsc and gwc shows harmonic sinusoidal curve in the month of november 2006 and 2007 peaks of gwsc shows a downward trend whereas in may 2007 peak of gwc rises up the harmony gets disturbed from november 2011 to november 2015 where gwc values dominates in november 2011 2014 over gwsc values and again syncs in may 2016 fig 5d the pearson coefficient calculated in these four states lies between the 1 to 1 which indicates the gwsc and gwc correlates well with each other and thus justifies our derived results fig 6 shows with change in rate of vertical deformation gps site at iisc bangalore the rate of groundwater storage also change seasonal variation forming a sinusoidal curve from april 2014 to september 2014 there is decrease in vertical deformation of value 50 cm as well as groundwater storage change there is a rise in groundwater storage content with increase in rate of vertical deformation from july 2014 to march 2015 of value 5 cm again there is decrease in the rate of both gwsc and vertical deformation from april 2015 to june 2015 of a value of 48 cm this cycle continues and an upward rising trend can be seen from august 2015 to march 2016 of value 20 cm and again decreases from april 2016 to may 2016 of value 45 cm from june 2016 to september 2016 curve rises up reaching a value of 10 cm and falls again to value of 40 cm from october 2016 to december 2016 the data obtained by grace gldas derived total gws cm and gps derived vertical deformation of igs station iisc bangalore 2014 2016 is correlated by 0 71 5 conclusion the groundwater storage change estimated from the grace terrestrial water storage data and gldas soil moisture canopy water and snow water equivalent for 2003 16 came out to be 0 75 cm year to 7 52 cm year it was tedious and time consuming task to verify the results with the ground data as the study region india is composed of various different types of aquifers and a large number of wells including piezometric wells and dug wells therefore we correlate the grace derived groundwater storage fluctuation for areas like delhi haryana uttar pradesh and punjab pixel with the depth to water fluctuated level provided by cgwb the correlation was satisfactory and hence the results validated both gws solutions are strongly correlated and shows a strong linear one to one relationship the groundwater storage change rate shows maximum depletion alongside of northern uttar pradesh delhi and parts of eastern up states of punjab haryana and rajasthan also in water stressed regions of india the groundwater depletion rate of delhi meerut dehradun and chandigarh are 3 68 0 80 cm year 3 62 0 70 cm year 3 10 0 87 cm year 2 73 0 60 cm year respectively the data obtained by grace gldas derived total gws cm and gps derived vertical deformation of igs station iisc bangalore 2014 2016 gives a correlation value of 0 71 this calls special attention on the characteristic volumetric water loss across the plate boundary if unchecked loss of groundwater reserves at this rate will lead to serious water and food scarcity in these regions declaration of competing interest the authors

determined by using rl05 land data product january 2003 to december 2016 which was accessed from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite total soil moisture up to 2m depth canopy water storage and snow water equivalent derived from global land data assimilation system gldas noah was subtracted from terrestrial water storage tws for extracting the groundwater component revealing maximum groundwater storage change by 7 52 cm year in delhi northern uttar pradesh and some parts of haryana in water stressed regions of india january 2003 to december 2016 the groundwater depletion rate in the cities of delhi meerut dehradun and chandigarh are 3 682 0 8 cm year 3 62 0 7 cm year 3 1 0 87 cm year 2 73 0 6 cm year respectively the groundwater storage change gwsc depletion

s coefficient 0 89 0 88 0 87 and 0 74 for delhi haryana punjab and uttar pradesh thereby justifying remote sensing approach and further substantiate our research study that regional gws mapping can be achieved by the grace mission rapidly and accurately graphical abstract image 1 keywords grace gws twsc gwc gps groundwater recharge 1 introduction the valuable resource used in sustenance of agriculture industry and domestic uses globally even in desert or arid regions is groundwater as 230 km3 of groundwater is being used by indian population marking itself as the surplus use of groundwater groundwater is the main source for irrigation 80 between 1970 and 1999 the total area used up for irrigation tripled to 33 100 000 ha and drinking 60 mcguire 2009 the most populated countries of world namely china and india as well as arid areas lacking sustainable quantity of freshwater like middle east and north africa are the provenance of groundwater utilization in superfluous quantity fulfilling activities in field of agriculture industry and household groundwater plays the most vital role and making its mark as a global asset but extravagant use of groundwater can lead to drought as well as serious stringency thus imposing threat on development of ecosystem social and economy foster and loucks 2006 gleeson et al 2010 the land of increased population will continue to face the problem of groundwater shortage if current rate of groundwater depletion globally and increased dweller number is not balanced properly gleeson et al 2012 well the worse has struck the agriculture ground at a rate of 174 since 1950 and hence agriculture has been using the maximum percentage of groundwater at a rate of 90 scanlon et al 2007 wang et al 2006 and scanlon et al 2012 have found depletion in groundwater level up to 100m in some places vividly due to its superfluous use recharging of groundwater is a remarkably slow process and its increased detoriation rate could possibly become a threat to those regions as recovery of previous groundwater rate will be difficult in forthcoming period not only in plains highly populated regions of india but also in hilly regions of himalaya groundwater depletion is a major issue snow melt plays the significant role unlike the plains of india prakash et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2015 the threat not only limits to resource insufficiency economy and social sustenance but also high energy is consumed to extract groundwater when the water head is lowering down drastically imposing a huge pressure on strained supply of energy thus the global hydrological cycle and its correlation to climate change can be inferred by a sound knowledge on changes in storage rate of groundwater döll et al 2014 concurs that study of an area s geology quantifies groundwater storage accurately as well as its variations both temporally and spatially although local change in groundwater level can be delineated by measurements of limited well water level but in large scale like river basin requires both good knowledge of geology as well as close knit well network chen et al 2014 the lowering of water table has been increasing in recent times due to excess extraction of groundwater especially in northern parts of india so as to suffice the hiked population hoque et al 2007 central ground water board cgwb of india 2012 which is actually a matter of concern as the decreased groundwater level shall impose a threat to climate change in future barnett et al 2005 kumar et al 2005 amarasinghe et al 2007 jasrotia et al 2011 2016 jasrotia and kumar 2014 thus north india bagging the title of the most water stressed regions of world cgwb un salvation of groundwater situation has aroused due to climate change alongwith contamination of groundwater resources on large scale and diverting surface water from north india to quench thirst of dry regions in south india india is a country of rising population jain and singh 2003 jha and sinha 2009 chandramouli 2011 washington et al 2012 where every minute there is hike in numbers of people to suffice and quench thirst of this huge population water storage is the primary activity and the stored water derived from within ground subsurface groundwater needs to be analysed scientifically in terms of quality and quantity brockwell et al 2002 kovalevsky 1992 jasrotia et al 2019 adimalla and taloor 2020 haque et al 2020 water crisis rate in india has grown severe and bracing for a turbulent future as well as stresses on groundwater has grown tremendously due to population hike so it is essential to keep a check on levels of groundwater for its long term sustenance john and malik 2006 famiglietti et al 2011 long et al 2016 the limited number of observation wells in hilly as well as arid regions makes it difficult to measure the regional groundwater storage variation the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace paved a possible way to study the water resources regionally rodell and famiglietti 2001 pokhrel et al 2013 this new technology measures groundwater storage variations with real time thus making it a useful tool in recording depletion rates of water bodies large and small yeh et al 2006 rodell et al 2007 although due to its low spatial resolution 200 000 km2 scanlon et al 2012 it becomes difficult to connect grace calculation to ground observation points locally it uses twin satellites tapley et al 2004 famiglietti and rodell 2013 to measure detailed earth s gravity anomaly which studies the distribution of mass ocean geology and climatic changes all over the planet and its variation taking place from time to time it is basically a collaboration between centre for space research at the university of texas at austin nasa s jet propulsion laboratory the german aerospace centre and germany s national research centre for geosciences potsdam there are innumerable excerpts which reflects the service of grace data in studying groundwater storage depletion both at basin and continental scale rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 reager and famiglietti 2013 voss et al 2013 richey et al 2015 but these data require ground validation which shall improve the data algorithms and make data retrieval easy task watkins et al 2015 regarding this very few studies across globe swenson and wahr 2006 rodell et al 2007 strassberg et al 2007 scanlon et al 2012 shamsudduha et al 2012 bhanja et al 2014 panda and wahr 2016 long et al 2016 examples like gangetic basin panda and wahr 2016 part of an indian state gujarat chinnasamy et al 2013 parts of north west india long et al 2016 since 2002 the time of its launch estimation of tws terrestrial water storage change is also recorded successfully in various parts of the world tapley et al 2004 singh et al 2017 grace has shown unmatched accuracy in measuring earth s gravity change for over eleven years and has proved its potential in measuring earth s gravity change by removing geophysical causes e g wahr et al 1998 chen et al 2009 atmospheric and oceanic causes using numerical models bettadpur 2012 over non glaciated land areas and also measured tws changes which includes contributions from water storage changes due to surface snow subsurface soil and groundwater reservoirs which ultimately makes its efficient in quantifying groundwater storage change both in soil and snow global land data assimilation system gldas serves the purpose to absorb information from both satellite and ground data with the help of advanced land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques it runs globally and gives high resolution of 0 25 producing results in 48 h real time previous studies rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 shows that during the period of august 2002 to october 2008 a combined study of grace and gldas was carried out over the ganges bramhaputra river basins defining significant results in depletion of tws the groundwater depletion rate duly noted in northwest india is 17 7 4 5 gt year rodell et al 2009 54 9 gt year april 2002 to june 2008 across northwest to northeast tiwari et al 2009 4 8 0 4 gt year october 2003 to march 2010 california s central valley famiglietti et al 2011 8 3 1 1 gt year 2003 2010 in north china feng et al 2013 determination of terrestrial water storage change is now possible by integrated study of grace and the global positioning system gps the correlation factor and weighted root mean square reduction between grace and gps are 75 6 and 28 9 as suggested by wang et al 2017 according to fritsche et al 2012 the network of 200 gps station worldwide helps in validating the varying rate of continental water storage which is computed by hydrological models the varying water storage rate can cause crustal deformation with displacement in gps reference points used for measurement besides this also results in change of earth s gravity field measured by grace data and also estimates the reduced grace signal schmidt et al 2006 and then compared with tws models likewise calculation subtracting from total gravity variations of mass movements both oceanic and atmospheric the dug well data are provided by central ground water board cgwb of india but these well records shows voids like large temporal gaps missing records or insufficient observations which was screened out through systematic quality control procedures using the datasets of cgwb these well time series afterwards converted to groundwater storage changes for correlating with the same spatial resolution as grace level 2 tws solution we have conducted study in punjab chandigarh dehradun haryana delhi uttar pradesh kolkata mumbai bengaluru where groundwater crisis has literally devoured them the prime reason behind it is overutilization of groundwater for both domestic and commercial purposes the depleting groundwater poses a threat in near future to combat the upcoming risks a venture has been taken upon where interannual variability of groundwater shall be studied from 2003 to 2016 using gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite observations global land data assimilation system gldas land surface models lsm and gps global positioning system together and then validating the results with dug well data provided by cgwb there are 1180 wells have been constructed in northern states of india fig 1 where depletion rate is at its extremity but validation studies has also noted anomalous changes in southern city bengaluru thus the present research shall fulfil the goal of utilizing groundwater in a more productive manner by studying the depletion rate in these thirteen years and try to extract the principal causes behind it for providing a crisis free environment to mankind 2 study area india is located in south of asia is the seventh largest country by area bounded by the indian ocean on the south the arabian sea on the southwest and the bay of bengal on the southeast misra et al 2006 major himalayan origin rivers that substantially flow through india include the ganges and the brahmaputra both of which drains into bay of bengal aggarwal et al 2004 major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding includes godavari the mahanadi the kaveri and the krishna which also drains into the bay of bengal and the narmada and the tapti which drains into the arabian sea coastal features include the marshy rann of kutch of western india and the alluvial sundarbans delta of eastern india the latter is shared with bangladesh india has two archipelagos the lakshadweep coral atolls off india s south western coast and the andaman and nicobar islands a volcanic chain in the andaman sea in the present study evaluation of groundwater storage gws has been carried out in highly populated and industrial regions of india the five major metro cities delhi mumbai chennai kolkata and bengaluru have been selected tables 1 and 2 fig 2 where despite of receiving high intensity rainfall groundwater storage rate depletes sharply which implies the failure of sufficient storage after sustaining the huge population and rising industries mishra et al 2018 similarly cities like chandigarh delhi dehradun and meerut are given special attention where geomorphologically and climatically speaking rainfall is well sufficient for surplus storage of groundwater but the geographical area falls short in fitting rising population and new industrial ventures which deteriorates the beauty of these cities and also disturbs the tectonism of himalaya thereby marking themselves as water stressed regions of india therefore in this study we will justify how the metro cities suffers groundwater depletion because of its sprawling population co2 emissions and rising urban jungle whereas the beauty of northern india is turning into water stressed regions 3 methodology in the present study data are analysed as follows for the period january 2003 to december 2016 each year data was separately analysed with reference to the seasonal variation pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon table 3 for the period january 2003 to december 2016 a monthly time series of grace derived from tws smc gwsc over the cities like meerut dehradun delhi and chandigarh for the period 2003 2016 data obtained from annual variation of groundwater storage and precipitation derived from gwsc were analysed in metro cities like chennai mumbai kolkata delhi and bengaluru for the period may 2005 to november 2016 a comparative study has been carried out for both pre and post monsoon groundwater fluctuation between grace and well data in cities uttar pradesh punjab haryana and delhi and for the period 2014 2016 a comparative study has been carried out between grace gldas derived total gws and gps derived vertical deformation of igs station iisc bangalore gautam et al 2017 3 1 analysis of grace data centre for space research at university of texas austin csr jet propulsion laboratory jpl at california institute of technology and deutsches geoforschungs zentrum gfz provides the monthly grace data which we have utilised the jpl s monthly model in our study area a set of spherical harmonics clm and slm is present in each month s file used for generating the gravity anomaly of a region using this set of spherical harmonics surface mass density has been calculated using the equation 1 wahr et al 1998 to reduce the spatial noise a decorrelation filtering swenson and wahr 2006 and 300 km gaussian smoothing jekeli 1981 has also been applied eq 1 σ θ ϕ a ρ a v e 3 l 0 m 0 l p l m cos θ 2 l 1 1 k l c l m cos m ϕ s l m sin m ϕ where θ ϕ is latitude and longitude k l is love number p l m is normalised legendre function and ρ a v e is average density of water terrestrial water storage tws calculated by grace contains both soil moisture and groundwater soil moisture sm is calculated by averaging four layers 2m depth information sm 1 0 10 cm sm 2 10 40 cm sm 3 40 100 cm and sm 4 100 200 cm all the data are converted into gm cm2 from kg m2 by multiplying with 0 1 thus gldastotal is calculated as tsm cws swe mean tsm cws swe 0 1 thus gws groundwater storage change is estimated from eq 2 rodell et al 2009 eq 2 δ gws δ tws δ sm gldas for creating two dimensional gws maps kernel interpolation with barriers method is equivalent to polynomial interpolation also studies about the barriers in study area it also allows to interpolate the contamination levels of lakes and water bodies thereby obtaining accurate levels compared to methods that doesn t adjust for barriers 3 2 validation of groundwater storage with in situ well data data were obtained from total 1180 wells spread across the states of punjab chandigarh haryana delhi uttar pradesh selection of a suitable well subset for pre processing to achieve the accurate results is necessary because of temporal gaps missing data and variation from well to well in number time series data observations for the well depths bhanja et al 2016 but virtually no metadata was present so identification among the confined and unconfined aquifer type extent of land use and its impact to the local water table or deriving specific yield information at each well site becomes quite difficult places where there is presence of high quality well data in sufficient number simple hydrogeology and dependency on groundwater is high processing of cgwb data is being carried out so we validate the high quality well data selected from the uttar pradesh punjab haryana and delhi with grace derived groundwater storage change over uttar pradesh punjab haryana and delhi vinnikov and robock 2002 3 3 validation of groundwater storage with gps data in this study we have used the gps data of igs station iisc bangalore for the year 2014 2016 and analysed the data using gamit globk 10 70 software in itrf08 reference frame mikhailov et al 2004 the results were obtained in the form of daily solution variation both in horizontal and vertical deformation daily solutions were then converted into monthly solutions so it becomes consistent with the grace data but only vertical deformation has been used since groundwater load plays a considerable role in the strain accumulation in the active tectonic areas machiwal et al 2012 4 results and discussions the groundwater storage change is estimated using the rescaled grace twsc data soil moisture data canopy water storage cws and snow water equivalent swe from gldas various maps are prepared to visualize the status of groundwater regime in india using the rescaled grace jpl level 2 ascii data and gldas soil moisture both having spatial resolution of 10 10 the rate at which the groundwater storage changes since 2003 2016 is determined by variations in colours and its related values fig 2 at three seasonal breaks pre monsoon and post monsoon during pre monsoon march may the gwsc groundwater storage change rate is high around 1 02 cm year dark blue in western central and southern india the rate decreases in value as we venture towards north of india where the decreasing values is demarcated by colour variation of order light blue green yellow orange and red respectively especially at indo gangetic belt reaching to the lowest value 4 64 cm year fig 2a the next seasonal break which is post monsoonal period october december an anomaly is observed in the southern part of india where the gwsc rate should be high because of heavy rainfall but instead of showing the dark blue hue the colour turns light blue to green with scattered yellow spots on it which strongly approves the anomaly and reasons out the overutilization of groundwater there an indicator of booming population and industries which the available groundwater fails to sustain dug well site indicates bengaluru fig 2b the anomaly value lies close to 4 46 cm year the gwsc rate is same as we move towards north like pre monsoonal season unlike pre monsoonal season the rate along the indo gangetic plain decreases more the red colour saturation is more 4 46 cm year the overall groundwater storage changes rates from high 0 48 cm year to low 5 14 cm year affecting the same areas like pre monsoonal event fig 2c so we can decipher from it very that post monsoon could have reported low gwsc as compared to pre monsoon season but it is not the case which clearly indicates the superfluous usage of groundwater leading to storage crisis fig 2d represents the groundwater potential measured yield

dehradun delhi and chandigarh where analysis is done on a large scale resulting in some models which explains the monthly time series of grace derived twsc terrestrial water storage change modelled sm soil moisture rf rainfall and estimated gwsc groundwater storage change the time series is analysed in two phases of the period taken january 2003 to july 2010 and august 2010 to december 2016 in delhi the soil moisture ranges between 0 and 2 cm depletion is gwsc rate is 3 68 0 80 cm year fig 3 a as already mentioned that analysis is carried out in two phases so for the first phase jan 2003 july 2010 the gwsc depletion rate is 3 43 1 37 cm year the graph of gwsc and twsc rises with rise in rainfall rate and vice versa matches the rhythm but in the second phase august 2010 december 2016 where depletion rate is 5 53 1 57 cm year quite high compared to the first phase with rise in rainfall rate the gwsc and twsc graph goes downward to negative values only exception is noticed in september 2011 meerut shows the soil moisture range between 0 and 5 cm depletion is gwsc rate is 3 62 0 70 cm year fig 3b the first phase jan 2003 july 2010 the gwsc depletion rate is 3 41 1 22 cm year the graph of gwsc and twsc rises with rise in rainfall rate and vice versa but in the second phase august 2010 to december 2016 where depletion rate is 7 12 1 40 cm year quite high compared to the first phase with rise in rainfall rate the gwsc and twsc graph goes downward to negative values only exception is noticed in september 2011 fig 3c looking by dehradun the soil moisture range between 0 and 3 cm depletion is gwsc rate is 3 10 0 87 cm year fig 3c the first phase jan 2003 to july 2010 the gwsc depletion rate is 3 72 1 52 cm year the graph of gwsc and twsc matches the rainfall rate but in the second phase august 2010 to december 2016 where depletion rate is 4 98 1 74 cm year quite high compared to the first phase with rise in rainfall rate the gwsc and twsc graph goes downward to negative values exception observed in september 2010 and 2011 chandigarh shows the soil moisture range between 0 and 3 cm depletion is gwsc rate is 2 73 0 60 cm year fig 3d the first phase january 2003 to july 2010 the gwsc depletion rate is 3 43 1 05 cm year the graph of gwsc and twsc matches the rainfall rate but in the second phase august 2010 to december 2016 where depletion rate is 3 92 1 20 cm year little high than the first phase with rise in rainfall rate the gwsc and twsc graph goes downward to negative values exception observed in september 2010 metro cities chennai mumbai kolkata delhi and bengaluru also called urban jungle with its high rise buildings sprawling population and air polluting industries are taken into focus for the study of groundwater storage during the period 2003 2016 taking into consideration the gwsc bar chart and annual precipitation fig 4 a and b comparing them we can see in chennai the gwsc is low in 2003 2005 when the rate of precipitation is 85 170 cm 2006 2007 the gwsc rate rise to 4 5 cm when the rate of precipitation is 100 140 cm 2008 2012 shows a vanishing gwsc rate when rate of precipitation is 20 140 cm 2013 2016 depletes gwsc rate to 5 cm when the rate of precipitation is 70 100 cm mumbai the gwsc is low in 2003 2005 when the rate of precipitation is quite high 2006 2008 the gwsc rate rise to 3 cm when the rate of precipitation decreases indicating less wastage of water 2009 shows a depleting gwsc rate when rate of precipitation is less compared to 2008 2010 2011 depletes gwsc rate to 3 4 cm when the rate of precipitation is 230 250 cm 2012 shows a vanishing gwsc rate whereas the rate of precipitation is 160 cm 2013 2014 observes gwsc rate of 3 4 cm and decreased rainfall 2015 shows vanishing depletion rate and rainfall rate decreases than 14 cm 2016 shows a depleted gwsc rate of 2 cm and rainfall rate of 250 cm which means there has been splurging amount of groundwater usage kolkata the gwsc is 0 4 cm in 2003 2005 when the rate of precipitation is 150 200 cm 2009 2016 the gwsc rate depletes and depletion rate increases proportionately to 9 cm when the rate of precipitation 120 150 cm except for 2013 where rate is 180 cm and 2015 where rate is 160 cm delhi the gwsc shows linear decreasing trend in 2003 2005 15 0 cm when the rate of precipitation is 60 100 cm 2007 2016 the gwsc rate shows a linear depletion rate of 0 22 cm when the rate of precipitation is 50 80 cm with exception in 2010 and 2013 when it rose to maximum bengaluru the gwsc rate shows decreased depletion in 2003 2005 when the rate of precipitation is 60 150 cm 2006 2008 the gwsc rate is 0 7 cm when the rate of precipitation is 70 130 cm 2009 shows a depleting gwsc rate 2010 2011 shows gwsc of 10 cm when the rate of precipitation is 70 60 cm 2012 2016 shows gwsc rate of value 0 to 2 cm when the rate of precipitation is 60 100 cm the populated north and north western states of india uttar pradesh punjab haryana and delhi so we have taken well dug data as well grace data and then reviewed the changes that took place in those data alongwith time till now results were derived using grace data which is nothing but satellite data so for achieving the certainty dug well and tube well data has been used sorted into 1 x 1 to match the pixels of grace data for each region pearson coefficient a linear correlation between two variables x and y here x is grace data and y is well data its value lies between 1 and 1 is calculated new delhi shows pearson coefficient of 0 89 here data shares the same graphical rhythm but a slight depletion is noticed in may 2010 where values of gwc is higher than the gwsc depletion is observed in november 2009 and again rises in november 2010 where the gwsc values are higher than gwc values the trend continues and suffers depletion in november 2010 where both the data matches its sinusoidal curves fig 5 a haryana shows pearson coefficient of 0 88 the gwsc and gwc groundwater change disturbs the rhythm of sinusoidal curve in may 2007 well data shows depletion compared to gwsc values whereas between november 2008 2009 the gwc rises over gwsc values depletion takes place in may 2010 where both the data shows same values again in november 2010 to may 2012 the curve rises but gwc dominates over the gwsc values from november 2012 to november 2016 again a non harmonic curve can be seen fig 5b punjab shows pearson coefficient of 0 87 gwc and gwsc data shows a rhythmic curve and depletion occurs in may 2008 where the gwsc values goes down below zero than the well data values it rises again in november 2008 with well data values dominating the gwsc values with a sharp depletion occurring again in may 2010 where well data and gwsc values matches from nov 2010 to may 2012 the gwsc values shows an upward trend but the well values lie at 0 to 1 cm after november 2012 both the curves deplete and gwsc data values are higher compared to the well data values fig 5c uttar pradesh shows pearson coefficient value of 0 74 gwsc and gwc shows harmonic sinusoidal curve in the month of november 2006 and 2007 peaks of gwsc shows a downward trend whereas in may 2007 peak of gwc rises up the harmony gets disturbed from november 2011 to november 2015 where gwc values dominates in november 2011 2014 over gwsc values and again syncs in may 2016 fig 5d the pearson coefficient calculated in these four states lies between the 1 to 1 which indicates the gwsc and gwc correlates well with each other and thus justifies our derived results fig 6 shows with change in rate of vertical deformation gps site at iisc bangalore the rate of groundwater storage also change seasonal variation forming a sinusoidal curve from april 2014 to september 2014 there is decrease in vertical deformation of value 50 cm as well as groundwater storage change there is a rise in groundwater storage content with increase in rate of vertical deformation from july 2014 to march 2015 of value 5 cm again there is decrease in the rate of both gwsc and vertical deformation from april 2015 to june 2015 of a value of 48 cm this cycle continues and an upward rising trend can be seen from august 2015 to march 2016 of value 20 cm and again decreases from april 2016 to may 2016 of value 45 cm from june 2016 to september 2016 curve rises up reaching a value of 10 cm and falls again to value of 40 cm from october 2016 to december 2016 the data obtained by grace gldas derived total gws cm and gps derived vertical deformation of igs station iisc bangalore 2014 2016 is correlated by 0 71 5 conclusion the groundwater storage change estimated from the grace terrestrial water storage data and gldas soil moisture canopy water and snow water equivalent for 2003 16 came out to be 0 75 cm year to 7 52 cm year it was tedious and time consuming task to verify the results with the ground data as the study region india is composed of various different types of aquifers and a large number of wells including piezometric wells and dug wells therefore we correlate the grace derived groundwater storage fluctuation for areas like delhi haryana uttar pradesh and punjab pixel with the depth to water fluctuated level provided by cgwb the correlation was satisfactory and hence the results validated both gws solutions are strongly correlated and shows a strong linear one to one relationship the groundwater storage change rate shows maximum depletion alongside of northern uttar pradesh delhi and parts of eastern up states of punjab haryana and rajasthan also in water stressed regions of india the groundwater depletion rate of delhi meerut dehradun and chandigarh are 3 68 0 80 cm year 3 62 0 70 cm year 3 10 0 87 cm year 2 73 0 60 cm year respectively the data obtained by grace gldas derived total gws cm and gps derived vertical deformation of igs station iisc bangalore 2014 2016 gives a correlation value of 0 71 this calls special attention on the characteristic volumetric water loss across the plate boundary if unchecked loss of groundwater reserves at this rate will lead to serious water and food scarcity in these regions declaration of competing interest the authors

12201,due to over exploitation and unsustainable groundwater resource management dhaka the capital city of bangladesh has posed an alarming risk of elimination in terms of quantity and its quality therefore this study intended to evaluate the threat of groundwater contamination by geostatistical approach considering several major trace elementals concentrations besides a number of pollution evaluation indices i e single factor pollution index i nemerow pollution index ni heavy metal evaluation index hei and the degree of contamination c d were also used to quantify the level of the studied trace metal pollution in groundwater the results of best fitted semivariogram model showed the moderate spatial dependence for fe ni and hei and weak spatial dependence for mn from cross validation result it was found that ordinary kriging produces the most accurate distribution maps for fe mn ni and hei thematic maps showed the spatial distribution of fe mn ni and hei which exhibited an increasing trend of pollution towards the western and the south western part in the study area besides probability maps were developed using indicator and the probability kriging methods to assess the risk of groundwater pollution which also illustrated almost similar trend like thematic maps however standard error maps showed evidence that the indicator kriging is more suitable method than that of the probability kriging to estimate the risk of groundwater metal contamination therefore it has been suggested that geostatistical method can be used for planners and policy makers to develop strategies for sustainable management of groundwater resources and to minimize the pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater pollution geostatistics heavy metals kriging water evaluation indices 1 introduction bangladesh has abundant easily accessible groundwater within the unconsolidated and fluvio deltaic sands that provide drinking water for 97 of its 160 million inhabitants bbs 2014 but due to industrialization and rapid population growth in urban areas natural geochemical processes are affecting and changes the groundwater composition prabha et al 2013 kumar et al 2017a islam et al 2017b to meet the extra demand approximately 1 9x106 m3 day groundwater is extracting by the dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa and responsible body of domestic water supply for city dwellers knappett et al 2016 currently the city is forced to meet 78 of its water requirement from groundwater while only two thirds of households can access to water supply system of dhaka city so groundwater level is declining by 2 3 m per year due to continuous large scale abstraction nahar et al 2014 bodrud doza et al 2019 simultaneously the quality of groundwater has been affected by various human activities kumar et al 2013 2017b hossain et al 2018 according to the recent study peripheral rivers of dhaka city i e the buriganga the turag the shitalakhya and the balu rivers are contaminated by trace metals through industrial effluents traffic emissions brick kilns and terrestrial runoff rahman et al 2014 islam and azam 2015 islam and huda 2016 rahman and islam 2016 natural recharge leakage from water supply network and storm drainage system contributes to vertical recharge of this area which may deteriorate the groundwater quality burgess et al 2011 bodrud doza et al 2019 moreover groundwater also contaminated by various trace elements due to natural phenomenon i e erosion and weathering of rocks odukoya 2015 kumar et al 2009 2016 which may pose serious health effects if exceed the permissible limit giri and singh 2015 naz et al 2016 however iron fe and manganese mn are the most abundant and often presents in groundwater due to large deposits in earth s surface edet et al 2011 islam et al 2017c the presence of excessive fe in groundwater can cause unusual metallic taste and can create disease if ingested beyond permissible limit rahman and gagnon 2014 ahmed et al 2018 again mn can causes different neurological disorder who 2011 it also responsible for dna damage and chromosomal alteration that create toxic effects to embryo and fetus gerber et al 2002 furthermore zinc zn can be moved to groundwater by natural processes or leaching from anthropogenic activities and creates unwanted astringent taste if exceeds 3 0 mg l thus groundwater contamination and quality monitoring becomes an immense concerning issues for sustainable and safe water supply for the city dwellers but due to continuous variability in physical chemical and controlling factors a comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring is quite a complex way to perform kumar et al 2013 islam et al 2017b c over the last several years geostatistical technique like semivariogram and kriging interpolation models were widely used to evaluate the spatial patterns of changing hydrochemical parameters of groundwater webster and oliver 2001 kumar and ahmed 2003 adhikary et al 2010 islam et al 2017a geostatistical techniques can be used to predict the pollution concentration in un sampled locations orton et al 2009 however in geostatistics kriging is considered as one of the best interpolation methods and widely used in groundwater study by many researchers e g araghinejad and burn 2005 kumar and remadevi 2006 adhikary et al 2010 2011 bhuiyan et al 2016 islam et al 2017a however investigation of groundwater contamination source identification and their special distribution is essential for the planners and decision makers for better water quality management but unfortunately published recent research on groundwater of dhaka city is very limited therefore the present study has been targeted to evaluate the present status of selected trace metals contamination and their distribution in groundwater of dhaka city area using different indices and geo statistical techniques the research findings form this study might have useful repercussion related to both groundwater quality monitoring and groundwater suitability for drinking purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and hydrological setting the study focused on the dhaka city area situated between latitudes 23 40 and 23 54 n and longitudes 90 20 and 90 28 e fig 1 the city covering an area of 370 km2 and bounded by the interconnecting streams i e tongi canal to the north the buriganga river to the south the turag river to west and the balu river to the east however these rivers are used much less compared to groundwater for drinking purpose dhaka city implies 40 of madhupur tract an elevated pleistocene terrace and rest of 60 consist of recent alluvium which contains abandoned ancient or recent river channels and floodplain sediments hoque et al 2007 2014 fig 2 a the rivers around the city controlled by numerous faults on madhupur tract and may influence the aquifer river interaction epc mmp 1991 hoque et al 2007 the main source of groundwater in the city is dupi tila sands aquifer and groundwater extraction was found to be more than 100 m deeper hoque et al 2007 this dupi tila formation consists of silt and clay fig 2b and categorized into upper dupi tila aquifer udta and lower dupi tila aquifer ldta hoque 2004 ahmed et al 2011 rahman et al 2013a b 2 2 sampling and analytical procedure a total of 23 groundwater samples were collected from the pre selected sampling points of dhaka city which have been depicted in fig 1 during the period of april 2016 the depths of the tube wells in study area were varied from 57 91 to 320 04 m geographical location of the selected wells were determined by global positioning system gps receiver kansas usa prior to sampling each well were pumped for 10 min until it purged out approximately twice the well volume or until steady state chemical conditions were obtained usgs 2006 groundwater samples were filtered through pre combusted 470 c for 4 h 0 45 μm whatman gf c glass fiber filters for the analyses of trace elements the filtered water samples were acidified with supra pure hno3 wako chemical co japan to reach a ph 2 to stop decomposing of elements present in water apha 1998 the samples were collected in high density polypropylene bottles rinsed with 1 hno3 and washed with distilled water and properly labelled the ph of water samples was measured on spot by using portable ph meter model sension tm1 hach international usa and total dissolved solids tds by tds meter model hi8734 hanna romania dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured by shimadzu toc l cpn total organic carbon analyzer with an asi l auto sampler shimadzu kyoto japan by calculating the difference between total carbon tc and inorganic carbon ic following the method described elsewhere rahman et al 2013a b flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer model spectraa 55b varian was used to determine the fe mn and zn concentrations following apha 1998 guidelines the instrument was linearly calibrated with standards before use triplicate performance of 10 of all samples and check analysis standards for every 10 samples were done to determine the measurement error and to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the measurement techniques the minimum detection limits mdls for fe mn and zn were set by 15 0 μg l 5 0 μg l and 8 0 μg l respectively 2 3 pollution evaluation indices single factor pollution index i nemerow pollution index ni heavy metal evaluation index hei and the degree of contamination c d were evaluated using the methods described in table 1 single factor pollution index evaluates the cumulative pollution degree of a certain trace metals while ni considered both the mean value of certain trace metal and the effects of high concentrations of pollutants on environmental quality huang et al 2016 moreover hei gives an insight the overall quality of the groundwater with respect to trace metals edet and offiong 2002 kumar et al 2019 and the c d was calculated to determine the status of groundwater contamination backman et al 1997 islam et al 2016 2 4 geostatistical approach for spatial variability models geostatistical analysis were applied to imitate the spatial distribution of groundwater chemistry marko et al 2014 the kriging and semivariogram models have been used for spatial distribution of the groundwater parameters in study area these interpolation techniques are well documented in the recent literatures e g masoud 2014 tapoglou et al 2014 and marko et al 2014 among the approaches kriging is considered one of the most popular and robust interpolation techniques it combines spatial correlation with dependence in the prediction process of studied variables islam et al 2018 in this study ordinary simple indicator and probability kriging interpolation models were applied to delineate the groundwater contamination spatial distribution of groundwater characteristics can be determined using thematic plot generated by ordinary kriging as well as by simple kriging methods wackernagel 1995 ordinary kriging is widely used methods serves to estimate a value at a point of a region for which a variogram is known wackernagel 1995 whereas simple kriging is the interpolation method mostly rely on the similarity of the nearby sampling points however indicator kriging makes no assumption of normality and is essentially a non parametric counterpart to ordinary kriging sada 2007 instead of assuming a normal distribution at each estimated location indicator kriging builds the cumulative distribution function at each point based on the behavior and correlation structure of indicator transformed data points in the neighborhood carr and mao 1993 moreover probability kriging was estimated by following journel and deutsch 1997 groundwater quality standard guided by usepa 2006 and eu 1998 also plotted in this study as cutoff values for both indicator and probability kriging methods by following adhikary et al 2010 furthermore from different semivariogram models the best fitted semivariogram model for selected groundwater parameters were constructed through trial and error for all possible parameters the prediction performances of the fitted models were examined by cross validation tests the mean error me mean square error mse root mean square error rmse average standard error asr and root mean square standardized error rmsse were assessed to establish the best fitted model by the following equations 1 m e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i ² 3 m s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 4 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i ² 5 a s e 1 n i 1 n p i i 1 n p i n 2 where n is the observed point number o and p is observed values and predicted values at location i os is standardized observed value and ps is standardized predicted value after completing the cross validation process kriging maps were produced to clarify the possible distribution of water quality parameters using arcgis 10 3 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 trace elements in groundwater the statistical summary of physicochemical parameters and trace metals concentrations in groundwater samples along with the recommended standards values doe 1997 indian standard 2012 who 2011 usepa 2006 eu 1998 are presented in table 2 the study revealed that ph values in the groundwater samples were varied from 6 66 to 8 19 with an average of 7 32 indicating the water in the study areas were slightly acidic to alkaline in nature the average value of tds in the study area was 72 22 mg l ranging from 32 90 to 211 00 mg l within the permissible limit suggested by usepa 2006 who 2011 indian standard 2012 and doe 1997 bangladesh standard table 2 it was found that the mean value of fe is 208 09 μg l with the highest value of 737 00 μg l table 2 this study revealed that fe concentration in groundwater samples was fallen within the bangladesh standard doe 1997 and nearly 26 samples exceed the who 2011 usepa 2006 and indian standard 2012 while almost 39 exceed the eu 1998 standard the maximum concentration of mn in groundwater samples was found to be 193 40 μg l with an average value and standard deviation of 57 58 μg l and 53 18 respectively table 2 though most of the samples showed that the concentration of mn level were below than that of doe 1997 who 2011 and indian standard 2012 but 43 of the samples had the average concentration higher than the permissible limit set by the eu 1998 and usepa 2006 for drinking purposes the concentrations of zn in the groundwater samples were found very negligible and within the permissible limits usually it originated from geogenic source but several anthropogenic factors e g industrial waste metal plating mining activity also influence to increase the concentration into groundwater zamani et al 2012 usgs 2016 in study area the maximum concentration for zn was found 166 40 μg l with an average value of 21 01 μg l table 2 in general mean concentrations of trace metals were followed a descending order as fe mn zn subsequently doc concentration in groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 67 to 51 50 mg l with an average value of 21 71 mg l table 2 organic matter presence in the sediments might have played a significant role to generate anaerobic environments in the aquifers rahman et al 2013a b ahmed et al 2018 it was also noted that doc showed moderate to strong correlation with fe as expected from microbial mediated reductive dissolution of feooh halim et al 2010 das et al 2015 nevertheless the concentrations of trace metals in groundwater systems resulting from oxidation process of sulfide minerals bhuiyan et al 2010 metal sulfides other than pyrite will not necessarily produce acidity but will release soluble metal ions into solution for instance sphalerite zns is released zn into environment by oxidization process bhuiyanet al 2010 gogoi et al 2015 similarly mn is released from siderite sakurovs et al 2007 therefore it has been suggested that redox potential might cause a gentle oxidation and subsequently releasing metal ions into groundwater bgs and dphe 2001 bhattacharya et al 2001 2002 however the method of ficklin et al 1992 modified by caboi et al 1999 was applied for water classification using ph and metal load in water samples subsequently metals load was computed as fe mn zn mg l and it was found that all the samples plot in the field of near neutral low metal fig 3 it might be happened due to the reasons that ph might have influence on the retention of heavy metals in aquifer lee and saunders 2003 this near neutral low metal characteristic is representing the good quality of water with very low metal concentration 3 2 water quality and pollution status the results of pollution evaluation indices are presented in table 3 and the single factor pollution index of trace metals in groundwater is shown in fig 4 which was computed using eu 1998 and usepa 2006 standards for drinking water the single factor pollution index i of fe at sampling sites s1 s2 s4 s6 s8 s9 s10 s14 and s19 were 1 indicating fe concentration in groundwater exceeded the standard fe is one of the metals having abundant crustal presence and possibly high due to the nonpoint pollutant sources along with partial natural weathering processes bhuiyan et al 2016 ahmed et al 2018 besides the single factor pollution index i for mn at sites s2 s4 s6 s8 s9 s10 s15 s20 and s22 also exceeded the standard high concentration of fe was found at the s1 sample while mn concentration was very high at the sampling point of s15 on the other hand s4 and s9 samples had high concentration of fe and mn mn concentration is higher due to the influence of industrial activities along with natural release into aquifers from sediment and rocks ahmed et al 2018 however the single factor pollution index i for zn was not exceed 1 indicating the contents of this trace metal met the standard limit on the other hand nemerow pollution index ni was used to assess how multi elements pollute groundwater at a single sampling site the range of ni for the groundwater samples were 0 07 2 89 with a mean value of 1 149 table 3 the results of ni showed that most of the samples were in the cluster of no trace metal pollution to slight trace metal pollution sampling points s1 s4 s9 s10 and s15 simply indicating moderate trace metal pollution fig 5 the degree of contamination c d adopted from backman et al 1997 were used as a reference for estimating the extent of metal pollution the mean value of c d in studied samples was 0 91 which ranging from 0 to 3 93 table 3 however it was found that around 34 78 samples s1 s4 s5 s6 s8 s9 s10 s15 exceed the mean values table 4 according to backman et al 1997 and edet and offiong 2002 c d being classified into three categories low c d 1 medium c d 1 3 and high c d 3 it was found that most of the samples had low c d values whereas s1 s5 s8 s10 and s15 fallen at the medium categories and s4 and s9 had higher values greater than 3 suggests that they were highly polluted by trace metals i e fe and mn it was noted that these sampling points were located in the south western part of the city which is near to the river buriganga such results may have occurred due to the influence of peripheral river recharge of the aquifers the heavy metal evaluation index hei introduced by edet and offiong 2002 was used in this study to reveal a better understanding of the pollution indices the index range extended from 0 14 to 5 93 with a mean value of 2 19 table 3 the hei values for 47 83 groundwater samples s1 s2 s4 s5 s6 s8 s9 s10 s14 s15 and s19 were found higher than the mean value of hei table 4 shows that the values of hei and c d were fallen below their respective mean values and their corresponding negative percent deviations indicated medium to good quality of water similar conclusion was drawn by prasad and bose 2001 edet and offiong 2002 and bhuiyan et al 2010 in case of similar findings in different study areas pearson s correlation matrix was also used to evaluate the relationship between the trace metals and pollution evaluated indices i e ni hei and c d that is presented in table 5 correlation matrix depicts inter elemental relationships as well as new associations between the elements islam et al 2017b matrix showed that fe and mn had significant correlations with all the indices suggesting that these metals may originating from the same source contribute to major pollution 3 3 geostatistical model and spatial distribution of trace metals thematic maps for fe and mn concentrations and drinking water evaluation indices ni and hei in the study area were developed by kriging methods for each method the predicted and observed values were compared using the accuracy measures to test the robustness of the model ghanbarpour et al 2013 however the comparison of different geostatistical techniques for the element of fe is shown in table 6 a model was considered robust and accurate whenever me is close to zero and rmse is small as can be seen in table 6 for fe ordinary kriging technique using gaussian variogram model is the most accurate interpolation method based on overall comparison of all accuracy measures me rmse mse rmsse and ase as a result ordinary kriging with different variogram models produced better predictions of fe concentrations when compared with simple kriging methods comparisons of ordinary and simple kriging for each trace metal and drinking water evaluation indices were conducted using similar procedure table 7 illustrate the comparison between geostatistical methods for fe mn ni and hei data sets the cross validation has shown that ordinary kriging method produces the most accurate distribution maps for fe mn ni and hei indicates more accurate predictions of pollution distribution ghanbarpour et al 2013 while gaussian models described the best spatial correlation for accurate measurement of fe ni and hei and exponential models shown the best performance for mn measurement ghanbarpour et al 2013 scatter plots presented the measured vs predicted values of fe mn ni and hei are shown in fig 6 the correlation coefficients between the measured and the predicted values were 0 434 0 587 0 579 and 0 548 for fe mn ni and hei respectively which were used for model validation except fe all others correlation coefficients were more than that of 0 5 which indicated that there might have possible correlation between the measured and the predicted values for each parameter marko et al 2014 again fig 7 represents the best fitted semivariogram models for fe mn ni and hei however nugget sill and model range for analyzed parameters are presented in table 8 the range distance varied on the basis of trace metal and indices except for ni the range values 0 10 0 14 km were found to be almost similar in all parameters ni range values indicated groundwater in the area is free from metal pollution zhong et al 2015 the spatial dependence of groundwater quality index is classified into three categories such as strong dependence 25 moderate dependence 25 75 and weak dependence 75 shi et al 2007 marko et al 2014 in this study moderate spatial dependency was found except mn that showed the weak spatial dependence the weak spatial dependency of mn that has revealed in semivariogram shape fig 7b may be due to high variability of mn these moderate and weak dependency characteristics could be originated from geochemical variation and human activities like shifting the land towards agricultural practices to urbanization and industrialization islam et al 2017a semivariogram parameters were introduced to display the distribution maps of trace elements in the study area the thematic maps present the spatial distribution of fe mn ni and hei are shown in fig 8 the dark color represented the high concentrations while the light color represents low concentrations in fig 8a it was observed that fe concentration is higher towards the western part of the study area the reason for this distribution might be attributable to the recharge of groundwater from highly polluted rivers such as turag and buriganga burgess et al 2011 and the existence of industrial zone at the western part of the study area it was also observed that fe concentration is higher in the north eastern part of the study area suggesting the unusual enrichment from erosion of pleistocene madhupur clay urban influence and recharge from the contaminated balu river and tangi canal situated in the north eastern part of dhaka city the low concentration of fe was found in the central part of the study area which relatively safe for drinking purpose the thematic map of mn fig 8b showed that south western part of the study area is highly affected however mn concentration was higher than the other areas due to the effect of industrial effluents and recharge from the polluted river buriganga ahmed et al 2010 contaminated industrial effluent percolate into the soil and reach the groundwater wongsasuluk et al 2014 spatial distribution map of ni and hei demonstrated a similar pattern with an increasing trend at the western margin in the study area fig 8c and d probability maps for fe and mn concentrations in groundwater samples were illustrated in fig 9 these were generated using indicator kriging and probability kriging methods to model the spatial variability of heavy metals the probability of trace metal concentrations in groundwater being higher than the threshold value at un sampled locations which can be used to indicate the possibility of contamination adhikary et al 2011 the probability map of fe fig 9a showed that fe concentration is higher at the western part of study area it was also found from the study that the groundwater of the industrial zone is vulnerable for drinking purpose in case of mn fig 9b it was found that the south western and the central western part of the study area stand for the highest probability of exceedance from the threshold value the probability maps generated from the probability kriging are shown in fig 9c and 9d the trend at the probability map of fe obtained by the probability kriging fig 9c similar to that of probability map obtained by indicator kriging likewise from the probability map of mn fig 9d it is found that the central western part and the south western part of the study area having highest probability of exceedance over the threshold value which seems to be the same result obtained by using indicator kriging both the results of indicator kriging and probability kriging suggesting that groundwater of dhaka city being contaminated due to anthropogenic influence and infiltration of the industrial landfill and urban effluents however extensive groundwater pumping results driving the recharge of groundwater by the polluted peripheral rivers ahmed et al 2010 burgess et al 2011 by using this result the decision maker may use the probability to determine whether or not un sampled locations or areas require more concern and at the same time obtain information about uncertainty and use it to avoid making incorrect decisions adhikary et al 2011 statistical errors of indicator kriging and probability kriging such as me rmse mse rmsse and ase for fe and mn are presented in table 9 and the standard error maps for fe and mn are shown in fig 10 it was found that errors of me and mse were close to zero and rmsse was close to one the close similarity found between the mean error values of the kriging methods however mse values of indicator kriging were less than that of the probability kriging which indicated greater variability in estimated probabilities similar results were also obtained for rmse and ase values which revealed the higher accuracy in the estimation of indicator kriging fig 10 suggests that the lowest error term was found in the central part of the study area and the highest error term was found at the boundary sites for all the trace metals this result may be originated due to boundary effects for predicting metal pollution risk in the groundwater of the study area indicator kriging method was found to be better than the probability kriging method standard error maps of indicator kriging showed quite similarities in fe 0 530 0 575 and mn 0 416 0 576 error values fig 10a and c this result indicated that indicator kriging is more suitable than probability kriging for better illustration of groundwater pollution more accurately 4 conclusions groundwater quality in dhaka city of bangladesh were investigated for assessing the trace metals contamination as well as suitability for drinking purpose a set of geostatistical approaches were applied to exhibit the resulting assessment the metal ph relation showed that groundwater of the study area contained near neutral low metal however results of the pollution indices i e i ni c d and hei revealed that the groundwater in the study area is faintly contaminated by the studied trace metals through the ordinary kriging method the variations of different metal concentrations over the study area were drawn which helped to display the variations of pollutant concentrations the generated maps using the experimental data projected that fe and mn concentration is higher towards the western and the south western parts respectively while ni and hei demonstrated the similar pattern with an increasing trend at the western margin of the study area the cross validation results revealed that the indicator kriging estimations was more accurate than the probability kriging estimations this finding suggested that the indicator kriging method could improve the accuracy of estimating the probability of metal concentrations being higher than a threshold value it was also observed that groundwater aquifers of dhaka city were heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities and now in a risk of quality deterioration so it is necessary to continuous monitoring of groundwater quality and strengthen research regarding pollution remediation and safe aquifer recharge for sustainable groundwater management acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge department of environmental sciences jahangirnagar university and chemistry division of atomic energy center dhaka for providing logistic and technical support the authors would also like to extends great gratitude to mr md morshedul haque and mr hyeng geun ji for

12201,due to over exploitation and unsustainable groundwater resource management dhaka the capital city of bangladesh has posed an alarming risk of elimination in terms of quantity and its quality

evaluation indices i e single factor pollution index i nemerow pollution index ni heavy metal evaluation index hei and the degree of contamination c d were also used to quantify the level of the studied trace metal pollution in groundwater the results of best fitted semivariogram model showed the moderate spatial dependence for fe ni and hei and weak spatial dependence for mn from cross validation result it was found that ordinary kriging produces the most accurate distribution maps for fe mn ni and hei thematic maps showed the spatial distribution of fe mn ni and hei which exhibited an increasing trend of pollution towards the western and the south western part in the study area besides probability maps were developed using indicator and the probability kriging methods to assess the risk of groundwater pollution which also illustrated almost similar trend like thematic maps however standard error maps showed evidence that the indicator kriging is more suitable method than that of the probability kriging to estimate the risk of groundwater metal contamination therefore it has been suggested that geostatistical method can be used for planners and policy makers to develop

implies 40 of madhupur tract an elevated pleistocene terrace and rest of 60 consist of recent alluvium which contains abandoned ancient or recent river channels and floodplain sediments hoque et al 2007 2014 fig 2 a the rivers around the city controlled by numerous faults on madhupur tract and may influence the aquifer river interaction epc mmp 1991 hoque et al 2007 the main source of groundwater in the city is dupi tila sands aquifer and groundwater extraction was found to be more than 100 m deeper hoque et al 2007 this dupi tila formation consists of silt and clay fig 2b and categorized into upper dupi tila aquifer udta and lower dupi tila aquifer ldta hoque 2004 ahmed et al 2011 rahman et al 2013a b 2 2 sampling and analytical procedure a total of 23 groundwater samples were collected from the pre selected sampling points of dhaka city which have been depicted in fig 1 during the period of april 2016 the depths of the tube wells in study area were varied from 57 91 to 320 04 m geographical location of the selected wells were determined by global positioning system gps receiver kansas usa prior to sampling each well were pumped for 10 min until it purged out approximately twice the well volume or until steady state chemical conditions were obtained usgs 2006 groundwater samples were filtered through pre combusted 470 c for 4 h 0 45 μm whatman gf c glass fiber filters for the analyses of trace elements the filtered water samples were acidified with supra pure hno3 wako chemical co japan to reach a ph 2 to stop decomposing of elements present in water apha 1998 the samples were collected in high density polypropylene bottles rinsed with 1 hno3 and washed with distilled water and properly labelled the ph of water samples was measured on spot by using portable ph meter model sension tm1 hach international usa and total dissolved solids tds by tds meter model hi8734 hanna romania dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured by shimadzu toc l cpn total organic carbon analyzer with an asi l auto sampler shimadzu kyoto japan by calculating the difference between total carbon tc and inorganic carbon ic following the method described elsewhere rahman et al 2013a b flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer model spectraa 55b varian was used to determine the fe mn and zn concentrations following apha 1998 guidelines the instrument was linearly calibrated with standards before use triplicate performance of 10 of all samples and check analysis standards for every 10 samples were done to determine the measurement error and to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the measurement techniques the minimum detection limits mdls for fe mn and zn were set by 15 0 μg l 5 0 μg l and 8 0 μg l respectively 2 3 pollution evaluation indices single factor pollution index i nemerow pollution index ni heavy metal evaluation index hei and the degree of contamination c d were evaluated using the methods described in table 1 single factor pollution index evaluates the cumulative pollution degree of a certain trace metals while ni considered both the mean value of certain trace metal and the effects of high concentrations of pollutants on environmental quality huang et al 2016 moreover hei gives an insight the overall quality of the groundwater with respect to trace metals edet and offiong 2002 kumar et al 2019 and the c d was calculated to determine the status of groundwater contamination backman et al 1997 islam et al 2016 2 4 geostatistical approach for spatial variability models geostatistical analysis were applied to imitate the spatial distribution of groundwater chemistry marko et al 2014 the kriging and semivariogram models have been used for spatial distribution of the groundwater parameters in study area these interpolation techniques are well documented in the recent literatures e g masoud 2014 tapoglou et al 2014 and marko et al 2014 among the approaches kriging is considered one of the most popular and robust interpolation techniques it combines spatial correlation with dependence in the prediction process of studied variables islam et al 2018 in this study ordinary simple indicator and probability kriging interpolation models were applied to delineate the groundwater contamination spatial distribution of groundwater characteristics can be determined using thematic plot generated by ordinary kriging as well as by simple kriging methods wackernagel 1995 ordinary kriging is widely used methods serves to estimate a value at a point of a region for which a variogram is known wackernagel 1995 whereas simple kriging is the interpolation method mostly rely on the similarity of the nearby sampling points however indicator kriging makes no assumption of normality and is essentially a non parametric counterpart to ordinary kriging sada 2007 instead of assuming a normal distribution at each estimated location indicator kriging builds the cumulative distribution function at each point based on the behavior and correlation structure of indicator transformed data points in the neighborhood carr and mao 1993 moreover probability kriging was estimated by following journel and deutsch 1997 groundwater quality standard guided by usepa 2006 and eu 1998 also plotted in this study as cutoff values for both indicator and probability kriging methods by following adhikary et al 2010 furthermore from different semivariogram models the best fitted semivariogram model for selected groundwater parameters were constructed through trial and error for all possible parameters the prediction performances of the fitted models were examined by cross validation tests the mean error me mean square error mse root mean square error rmse average standard error asr and root mean square standardized error rmsse were assessed to establish the best fitted model by the following equations 1 m e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i ² 3 m s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 4 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i ² 5 a s e 1 n i 1 n p i i 1 n p i n 2 where n is the observed point number o and p is observed values and predicted values at location i os is standardized observed value and ps is standardized predicted value after completing the cross validation process kriging maps were produced to clarify the possible distribution of water quality parameters using arcgis 10 3 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 trace elements in groundwater the statistical summary of physicochemical parameters and trace metals concentrations in groundwater samples along with the recommended standards values doe 1997 indian standard 2012 who 2011 usepa 2006 eu 1998 are presented in table 2 the study revealed that ph values in the groundwater samples were varied from 6 66 to 8 19 with an average of 7 32 indicating the water in the study areas were slightly acidic to alkaline in nature the average value of tds in the study area was 72 22 mg l ranging from 32 90 to 211 00 mg l within the permissible limit suggested by usepa 2006 who 2011 indian standard 2012 and doe 1997 bangladesh standard table 2 it was found that the mean value of fe is 208 09 μg l with the highest value of 737 00 μg l table 2 this study revealed that fe concentration in groundwater samples was fallen within the bangladesh standard doe 1997 and nearly 26 samples exceed the who 2011 usepa 2006 and indian standard 2012 while almost 39 exceed the eu 1998 standard the maximum concentration of mn in groundwater samples was found to be 193 40 μg l with an average value and standard deviation of 57 58 μg l and 53 18 respectively table 2 though most of the samples showed that the concentration of mn level were below than that of doe 1997 who 2011 and indian standard 2012 but 43 of the samples had the average concentration higher than the permissible limit set by the eu 1998 and usepa 2006 for drinking purposes the concentrations of zn in the groundwater samples were found very negligible and within the permissible limits usually it originated from geogenic source but several anthropogenic factors e g industrial waste metal plating mining activity also influence to increase the concentration into groundwater zamani et al 2012 usgs 2016 in study area the maximum concentration for zn was found 166 40 μg l with an average value of 21 01 μg l table 2 in general mean concentrations of trace metals were followed a descending order as fe mn zn subsequently doc concentration in groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 67 to 51 50 mg l with an average value of 21 71 mg l table 2 organic matter presence in the sediments might have played a significant role to generate anaerobic environments in the aquifers rahman et al 2013a b ahmed et al 2018 it was also noted that doc showed moderate to strong correlation with fe as expected from microbial mediated reductive dissolution of feooh halim et al 2010 das et al 2015 nevertheless the concentrations of trace metals in groundwater systems resulting from oxidation process of sulfide minerals bhuiyan et al 2010 metal sulfides other than pyrite will not necessarily produce acidity but will release soluble metal ions into solution for instance sphalerite zns is released zn into environment by oxidization process bhuiyanet al 2010 gogoi et al 2015 similarly mn is released from siderite sakurovs et al 2007 therefore it has been suggested that redox potential might cause a gentle oxidation and subsequently releasing metal ions into groundwater bgs and dphe 2001 bhattacharya et al 2001 2002 however the method of ficklin et al 1992 modified by caboi et al 1999 was applied for water classification using ph and metal load in water samples subsequently metals load was computed as fe mn zn mg l and it was found that all the samples plot in the field of near neutral low metal fig 3 it might be happened due to the reasons that ph might have influence on the retention of heavy metals in aquifer lee and saunders 2003 this near neutral low metal characteristic is representing the good quality of water with very low metal concentration 3 2 water quality and pollution status the results of pollution evaluation indices are presented in table 3 and the single factor pollution index of trace metals in groundwater is shown in fig 4 which was computed using eu 1998 and usepa 2006 standards for drinking water the single factor pollution index i of fe at sampling sites s1 s2 s4 s6 s8 s9 s10 s14 and s19 were 1 indicating fe concentration in groundwater exceeded the standard fe is one of the metals having abundant crustal presence and possibly high due to the nonpoint pollutant sources along with partial natural weathering processes bhuiyan et al 2016 ahmed et al 2018 besides the single factor pollution index i for mn at sites s2 s4 s6 s8 s9 s10 s15 s20 and s22 also exceeded the standard high concentration of fe was found at the s1 sample while mn concentration was very high at the sampling point of s15 on the other hand s4 and s9 samples had high concentration of fe and mn mn concentration is higher due to the influence of industrial activities along with natural release into aquifers from sediment and rocks ahmed et al 2018 however the single factor pollution index i for zn was not exceed 1 indicating the contents of this trace metal met the standard limit on the other hand nemerow pollution index ni was used to assess how multi elements pollute groundwater at a single sampling site the range of ni for the groundwater samples were 0 07 2 89 with a mean value of 1 149 table 3 the results of ni showed that most of the samples were in the cluster of no trace metal pollution to slight trace metal pollution sampling points s1 s4 s9 s10 and s15 simply indicating moderate trace metal pollution fig 5 the degree of contamination c d adopted from backman et al 1997 were used as a reference for estimating the extent of metal pollution the mean value of c d in studied samples was 0 91 which ranging from 0 to 3 93 table 3 however it was found that around 34 78 samples s1 s4 s5 s6 s8 s9 s10 s15 exceed the mean values table 4 according to backman et al 1997 and edet and offiong 2002 c d being classified into three categories low c d 1 medium c d 1 3 and high c d 3 it was found that most of the samples had low c d values whereas s1 s5 s8 s10 and s15 fallen at the medium categories and s4 and s9 had higher values greater than 3 suggests that they were highly polluted by trace metals i e fe and mn it was noted that these sampling points were located in the south western part of the city which is near to the river buriganga such results may have occurred due to the influence of peripheral river recharge of the aquifers the heavy metal evaluation index hei introduced by edet and offiong 2002 was used in this study to reveal a better understanding of the pollution indices the index range extended from 0 14 to 5 93 with a mean value of 2 19 table 3 the hei values for 47 83 groundwater samples s1 s2 s4 s5 s6 s8 s9 s10 s14 s15 and s19 were found higher than the mean value of hei table 4 shows that the values of hei and c d were fallen below their respective mean values and their corresponding negative percent deviations indicated medium to good quality of water similar conclusion was drawn by prasad and bose 2001 edet and offiong 2002 and bhuiyan et al 2010 in case of similar findings in different study areas pearson s correlation matrix was also used to evaluate the relationship between the trace metals and pollution evaluated indices i e ni hei and c d that is presented in table 5 correlation matrix depicts inter elemental relationships as well as new associations between the elements islam et al 2017b matrix showed that fe and mn had significant correlations with all the indices suggesting that these metals may originating from the same source contribute to major pollution 3 3 geostatistical model and spatial distribution of trace metals thematic maps for fe and mn concentrations and drinking water evaluation indices ni and hei in the study area were developed by kriging methods for each method the predicted and observed values were compared using the accuracy measures to test the robustness of the model ghanbarpour et al 2013 however the comparison of different geostatistical techniques for the element of fe is shown in table 6 a model was considered robust and accurate whenever me is close to zero and rmse is small as can be seen in table 6 for fe ordinary kriging technique using gaussian variogram model is the most accurate interpolation method based on overall comparison of all accuracy measures me rmse mse rmsse and ase as a result ordinary kriging with different variogram models produced better predictions of fe concentrations when compared with simple kriging methods comparisons of ordinary and simple kriging for each trace metal and drinking water evaluation indices were conducted using similar procedure table 7 illustrate the comparison between geostatistical methods for fe mn ni and hei data sets the cross validation has shown that ordinary kriging method produces the most accurate distribution maps for fe mn ni and hei indicates more accurate predictions of pollution distribution ghanbarpour et al 2013 while gaussian models described the best spatial correlation for accurate measurement of fe ni and hei and exponential models shown the best performance for mn measurement ghanbarpour et al 2013 scatter plots presented the measured vs predicted values of fe mn ni and hei are shown in fig 6 the correlation coefficients between the measured and the predicted values were 0 434 0 587 0 579 and 0 548 for fe mn ni and hei respectively which were used for model validation except fe all others correlation coefficients were more than that of 0 5 which indicated that there might have possible correlation between the measured and the predicted values for each parameter marko et al 2014 again fig 7 represents the best fitted semivariogram models for fe mn ni and hei however nugget sill and model range for analyzed parameters are presented in table 8 the range distance varied on the basis of trace metal and indices except for ni the range values 0 10 0 14 km were found to be almost similar in all parameters ni range values indicated groundwater in the area is free from metal pollution zhong et al 2015 the spatial dependence of groundwater quality index is classified into three categories such as strong dependence 25 moderate dependence 25 75 and weak dependence 75 shi et al 2007 marko et al 2014 in this study moderate spatial dependency was found except mn that showed the weak spatial dependence the weak spatial dependency of mn that has revealed in semivariogram shape fig 7b may be due to high variability of mn these moderate and weak dependency characteristics could be originated from geochemical variation and human activities like shifting the land towards agricultural practices to urbanization and industrialization islam et al 2017a semivariogram parameters were introduced to display the distribution maps of trace elements in the study area the thematic maps present the spatial distribution of fe mn ni and hei are shown in fig 8 the dark color represented the high concentrations while the light color represents low concentrations in fig 8a it was observed that fe concentration is higher towards the western part of the study area the reason for this distribution might be attributable to the recharge of groundwater from highly polluted rivers such as turag and buriganga burgess et al 2011 and the existence of industrial zone at the western part of the study area it was also observed that fe concentration is higher in the north eastern part of the study area suggesting the unusual enrichment from erosion of pleistocene madhupur clay urban influence and recharge from the contaminated balu river and tangi canal situated in the north eastern part of dhaka city the low concentration of fe was found in the central part of the study area which relatively safe for drinking purpose the thematic map of mn fig 8b showed that south western part of the study area is highly affected however mn concentration was higher than the other areas due to the effect of industrial effluents and recharge from the polluted river buriganga ahmed et al 2010 contaminated industrial effluent percolate into the soil and reach the groundwater wongsasuluk et al 2014 spatial distribution map of ni and hei demonstrated a similar pattern with an increasing trend at the western margin in the study area fig 8c and d probability maps for fe and mn concentrations in groundwater samples were illustrated in fig 9 these were generated using indicator kriging and probability kriging methods to model the spatial variability of heavy metals the probability of trace metal concentrations in groundwater being higher than the threshold value at un sampled locations which can be used to indicate the possibility of contamination adhikary et al 2011 the probability map of fe fig 9a showed that fe concentration is higher at the western part of study area it was also found from the study that the groundwater of the industrial zone is vulnerable for drinking purpose in case of mn fig 9b it was found that the south western and the central western part of the study area stand for the highest probability of exceedance from the threshold value the probability maps generated from the probability kriging are shown in fig 9c and 9d the trend at the probability map of fe obtained by the probability kriging fig 9c similar to that of probability map obtained by indicator kriging likewise from the probability map of mn fig 9d it is found that the central western part and the south western part of the study area having highest probability of exceedance over the threshold value which seems to be the same result obtained by using indicator kriging both the results of indicator kriging and probability kriging suggesting that groundwater of dhaka city being contaminated due to anthropogenic influence and infiltration of the industrial landfill and urban effluents however extensive groundwater pumping results driving the recharge of groundwater by the polluted peripheral rivers ahmed et al 2010 burgess et al 2011 by using this result the decision maker may use the probability to determine whether or not un sampled locations or areas require more concern and at the same time obtain information about uncertainty and use it to avoid making incorrect decisions adhikary et al 2011 statistical errors of indicator kriging and probability kriging such as me rmse mse rmsse and ase for fe and mn are presented in table 9 and the standard error maps for fe and mn are shown in fig 10 it was found that errors of me and mse were close to zero and rmsse was close to one the close similarity found between the mean error values of the kriging methods however mse values of indicator kriging were less than that of the probability kriging which indicated greater variability in estimated probabilities similar results were also obtained for rmse and ase values which revealed the higher accuracy in the estimation of indicator kriging fig 10 suggests that the lowest error term was found in the central part of the study area and the highest error term was found at the boundary sites for all the trace metals this result may be originated due to boundary effects for predicting metal pollution risk in the groundwater of the study area indicator kriging method was found to be better than the probability kriging method standard error maps of indicator kriging showed quite similarities in fe 0 530 0 575 and mn 0 416 0 576 error values fig 10a and c this result indicated that indicator kriging is more suitable than probability kriging for better illustration of groundwater pollution more accurately 4 conclusions groundwater quality in dhaka city of bangladesh were investigated for assessing the trace metals contamination as well as suitability for drinking purpose a set of geostatistical approaches were applied to exhibit the resulting assessment the metal ph relation showed that groundwater of the study area contained near neutral low metal however results of the pollution indices i e i ni c d and hei revealed that the groundwater in the study area is faintly contaminated by the studied trace metals through the ordinary kriging method the variations of different metal concentrations over the study area were drawn which helped to display the variations of pollutant concentrations the generated maps using the experimental data projected that fe and mn concentration is higher towards the western and the south western parts respectively while ni and hei demonstrated the similar pattern with an increasing trend at the western margin of the study area the cross validation results revealed that the indicator kriging estimations was more accurate than the probability kriging estimations this finding suggested that the indicator kriging method could improve the accuracy of estimating the probability of metal concentrations being higher than a threshold value it was also observed that groundwater aquifers of dhaka city were heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities and now in a risk of quality deterioration so it is necessary to continuous monitoring of groundwater quality and strengthen research regarding pollution remediation and safe aquifer recharge for sustainable groundwater management acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge department of environmental sciences jahangirnagar university and

12202,the aim of this study is to assess the quality of surface water of piyain river adopting two different approaches the first approach determines the classification of water samples by the traditional water quality index and the second one is focused on water classification analysis with the aid of the mamdani fuzzy logic mfl for this case the relative weight of water quality parameter is computed based on the analytic hierarchy process ahp the ahp is a multiple criteria decision making procedure which provides a methodology to calibrate the numeric scale for the measurement of quantitative as well as qualitative performances the relative importance of different attributes is given on a scale from 1 to 9 in fuzzy water quality assessment procedure the trapezoidal membership functions are used because of its highest classification accuracy also it can characterize the dynamic behavior of the water quality parameters twenty one parameters are tested for the assessment of water quality however arsenic is not found in the water samples so the rest twenty parameters is divided into three groups for utilizing the hierarchy by grouping some criteria total sixty nine rules are used three for each indicator and three for each partial group in hydro chemical analysis it is found that typical value of sulfate 0 12 2 8 mg l sodium 2 5 7 mg l chloride 1 05 4 11 mg l potassium 0 4 2 6 mg l is extremely lower thanstandard value where the standard for bangladesh is 400 mg l 200 mg l 150 600 mg l 12 mg l respectively specific conductivity 45 7 135 μs cm calcium 5 5 28 mg l magnesium 1 24 5 mg l are below standard where the standard values are 500 μs cm 75 mg l 30 35 mg l correspondingly the measured value of ph 6 31 6 96 is between who and bangladesh standard 6 5 8 5 turbidity 3 5 99 ntu is higher with respect to who guideline 5 ntu bangladesh standard 10 ntu the computed wqi value ranges from 19 84 to 154 21 whereas fwqi1 and fwqi2 value ranges from 47 6 to 78 4 and from 51 8 to 80 7 respectively it suggests that the surface water of the river exhibits good water condition besides the quality of water sample from quarry area is found average to good in a nutshell fwqi2is more reliable than fwqi and wqi hence it can be applied for monitoring water quality problem locally or regionally graphical abstract image 1 keywords sand and gravel quarry mining wqi mamdani fuzzy logic analytic hierarchy process surface water quality water sustainability 1 introduction sand and gravel are major raw materials used in construction industry due to rapid industrialization urbanization and associated development the demand of sand and gravel has raised especially in the developing country jaflong is one of the main extraction points of sand and gravel in bangladesh the piyain river in jaflong has developed the alluvial fans which are found along the foot of the meghalaya plateau due to the decrease in channel gradient and reduction in velocity the streams leave their canyons causes the deposition of sand and gravel sediments consequently forms a fan shaped or conical delta every monsoon season it carries millions of tons of sand and gravel in downstream part this sand and gravel are extracted with the dredging machine locally known as the boma machine for its extreme noise the mine water and effluent are directly discharged into the piyain river the surface water resources of a nation are vitally important to the daily life the main uses of surface water include drinking and household chores irrigation uses and the other industrial purposes discharge of industrial and mining water into river water without any treatment or purification causing the pollution of water chima et al 2010 howladar et al 2014 the quarry mining activities in jaflong area are suspected to contaminate the surface water of the river basin and stream flow of the river the protection of aquatic life as well as human life is merely depended upon river water in the developed countries the environmental monitoring agencies are more active they monitor the quality of water resource frequently and environmental laws are strictly followed there but in the developing countries like bangladesh environmental laws are not fully abiding by the conventional water quality monitoring techniques are compared with the specific water quality parameters and levels with their guideline standard values specified by different monitoring and supervisory agencies water quality index aims at giving a single value to the water of a source on the basis of one or the other system horton s water quality index is considered as the forerunner of the modern wqis abbasi and abbasi 2012 after that numerous water quality indices have been formulated by several national and international organizations such as weight arithmetic water quality index wawqi national sanitation foundation water quality index nfswqi canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccmewqi oregon water quality index owqi etc in recent years sadat noori et al 2013 applied wqi along with geographical information system gis to understand the groundwater quality status of saveh nobaran aquifer in iran hosseini moghari et al 2015 and tiri et al 2018 compared the conventional wqi with fwqi they showed that the elimination of some required parameters in the development of fwqi did not decrease the accuracy of water quality classification however omitting some other parameters with undesirable values made the classification of water quality unreliable armanuos et al 2015 and dahiya et al 2007 studied ground water quality with arcgis in the western nile delta aquifer egypt karbassi et al 2011 evaluated the gorganrood river water quality by available nsf water quality index subsequently the nine present nsf parameters weights have been changed and modified using the analytical hierarchy process ahp method as well as expert s opinion in the newly developed wqi more weights are given to relation with these parameters it can be said that the factors like dissolved oxygen fecal coliform and biological oxygen demand when compared with nsfwqi the fuzzy inference is the process of formulating the mapping from a given input to an output using fuzzy logic the mapping then provides a basis from which decisions can be made or patterns discerned the fuzzy inference systems have been successfully implemented in fields such as automatic control data classifications decision analysis expert systems and computer vision the mathworks inc 2015 abdullah et al 2008 noted that the fuzzy inference system fis may successfully harmonize the inherent discrepancies and interpret complex conditions these studies developed a new water quality model and showed that this river water quality model can be extended to determine the non regulated contaminants in water analysis of water quality of ebro river by ocampo duque et al 2006 mentioned that the fuzzy logic is an appropriate and alternative tool to be used in developing effective water management plans in spain raman et al 2009 used uniq2007 model unit which is constructed with control elements having dynamic fuzzy logic properties wherein target non linearity can be input to result in a perfect evaluation of water quality this water quality assessor probe can provide better quality index or identify the status of river with 90 perfection thus this study aims at assessing the impact of quarry mining in jaflong area on the surface water of piyain river two methods are adopted here to evaluate the water quality grade of the river the first approach determines the classification of water samples by water quality index and the second one is focused on water classification analysis with the aid of mamdani fuzzy logic where the relative weight of water quality parameter is computed based on the analytic hierarchy process ahp 1 1 research area the study area is located in the gowainghatupazila of sylhet district it issituated at the border between bangladesh and the indian state meghalaya it lies between n 25 10 51 1 latitude and e 92 01 02 2 longitude the piyain river is a branch of the surma river originated from the umgat river of the hilly area of assam following southward the river enters into bangladesh through sylhet district and branches out into two rivers namely the piyain river and the dauki or jaflong river the total length of piyain river is about 145 km the crystal clear water of piyain river which flows from india through bangladesh used to be the most prominent assets of jaflong during monsoons the river current wash down precious rocks and pebbles today it is the hub of the stone crushing industry but the river is dying losing its vitality and beauty 2 methodology 2 1 sample collection and laboratory analysis totalforty 40 water samples is collected very carefully in one 1 liter plastic bottles from study area among them some samples are collected from the quarry area and some samples from the river the samples collected from quarry area are from pumped water from quarry quarry sinkhole and quarry dug well also water leaching from the quarry is also collected the latitude longitude and elevation are recorded during the time of sampling with the help of gps reading fig 1 the detail information about the water samples and the sampling locations are also recorded before collecting the samples dry clean and sterilized plastic bottles is used to avoid any type of contaminations all bottles are washed well and rinsed with demineralized water before sampling immediately after sampling ph specific conductivity and total dissolved solids are measured in the field with help of a portable ph and an ec tds meter moreover the detail chemical analysis is carried out in the laboratory using following laboratory instruments details is given in table 1 1 atomic absorption spectroscopy aas pg999 graphite furnace power supply

romania 5 digital ph meter model 720 wtw service germany 6 oven digital model boxun china 2 2 water quality index wqi water quality index is calculated for the grouping of water in which the integration of parametric information on water quality data and the expert s knowledge based on their relative importance and weight sahu and sikdar 2008 wqi mathematically summarizes the information from numerous water quality parameters into a single output value the present research employs 20 water quality parameters for calculating the wqi a multi layer computational procedure is required for wqi evaluation in the first step all the parameters have been assigned a weight wi according to their relative importance in the overall water quality through human consumption point of view later the relative weight wi pawar et al 2014 of each parameter is computed as follows i w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters the weights and relative weight of the parameters are presented in table 2 the next step is the calculation of quality rating scale qi which is calculated as follows ii q i c i s i 100 where ci is the measured value of each parameter in each water sample and si is the standard value for each parameter for computing the wqi boateng et al 2016 the si is first determined for each parameter iii s i i w i q i where si i is the sub index of ith parameter finally wqi is evaluated as follows iv wqi s i i wqi boateng et al 2016 classifies the water samples within five classes shown in table 3 2 3 mamdani fuzzy interface system the mamdani s fuzzy inference system is the most frequently used fuzzy interface system it is amid the first control systems built using fuzzy set theory recommended in 1975 by ebrahim mamdani a general fuzzy system is composed of several steps fig 2 the first step is to take the input output and define the degree to which they belong to each of the appropriate fuzzy sets using membership functions a membership function is a curve that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value between 0 and 1 the input space is called the universe of discourse the output axis is called the membership value μ if x is the universe of discourse and its elements are denoted by x then a fuzzy set a in x is defined as a set of ordered pairs mamdani and assilian 1975 v a x

algebraic integration 2 4 development of fuzzy water quality index fwqi in fuzzy water quality assessment trapezoidal membership functions are most often used trapezoidal membership function can classify the parameters used for the assessment of water quality more accurately in that way trapezoidal membership functions are characterizing the dynamic behavior of the water quality parameters kiurski milosevic et al 2015 the membership function consists of core support and boundary explained by ross 2010 shown in fig 3 the trapezoidal membership functions obtained for all twenty water quality parameters as follows vii f x a b c d 0 x a x a b a a x b 1 b x c d x d c c x d 0 d x viii f x a b c d max min x a b a 1 d x d c 0 the membership function is obtained with the help of expert

each parameter and three for each partial group each rule has only one antecedent in order to facilitate the weight assignment in fwqi1 each rule has unit weight whereas the fwqi2 the weight is obtained by the analytic hierarchy process ahp 2 5 the analytic hierarchy process the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a multiple criteria decision making procedure which is introduced by saaty 1990 2003 it also provides a methodology to calibrate the numeric scale for the measurement of quantitative as well as qualitative performances vaidya and kumar 2006 this is an eigen value approach to the pair wise comparisons the relative importance of different attributes is given on a 1 to 9 scale as per table 5 then the pairwise comparisons of various criteria generated are organized into a square matrix the diagonal elements of the matrix are 1 the criterion in the ith row is better than criterion in the jth column if the value of element i j is more than 1 otherwise the criterion in the jth column is better than that in the ith row the j i element of the matrix is the reciprocal of the i j element the elements of the normalized eigenvector are termed weights with respect to the criteria or sub criteria and ratings with respect to the alternatives the consistency of the matrix of order n is evaluated the details have been interpreted by saaty 1990 2003 3 results and discussions 3 1 the statistics of hydrochemical characteristics of water twenty parameters were divided in three groups and their range of measured value is shown in figs 4 7 8 the ph value of the water samples collected from the piyain river ranges from 6 31 to 6 96 it indicates that the water is acidic in nature yet within the permissible limit 6 5 8 5 given by the bangladesh standard and the who 2011 guideline these values are typical for natural surface water and optimum for most organisms the ph value of water sample collected from quarry and sinkhole created due to quarry is found about 6 9 normally sand and gravel mining has less impact on ph yen and hashim 2013 howladar 2012 the ph is near neutral may be due to present of limestone outcrop in surrounding area because limestone can buffer ph changes in water and keep it to near neutral there is no strong correlation between ph and other parameters the specific conductivity of the water samples in the pyain river ranges from 45 7 to 135 μs cm the samples collected from pumped groundwater from quarry mine which are discharged to the river exhibit have specific conductivity greater than one hundred μs cm the water with high mineral contents tends to have higher conductivity it is a general indication of high dissolved solids concentration in the water hossain et al 2010 mangukiya et al 2012 yen and hashim 2013 bayram and önsoy 2014 which is shown in fig 5 specific conductivity has a strong positive correlation r 0 919 0 909 0 994 with total alkalinity total hardness and total dissolved solids tds respectively turbidity of water sample sare found high in the study region test result shows that 82 5 sample surpasses the who standard limit and 40 samples bangladesh standard limit for turbidity for drinking purpose turbidity is much higher in the territory which can prompt the gastrointestinal diseases and limit the development of submerged aquatic plants alkalinity represents the buffering capacity of water and its ability of water to resist the change in ph the areas rich in granites conglomerates and sandstones may have low alkalinity and therefore poor buffering capacity total alkalinity of the estimated water is in the range of 16 60 mg l as caco3 for the protection of aquatic life the buffering capacity should be at least 20 mg l observation revealed that there is a decrease in alkalinity in the water of the downstream of river a strong positive correlation is found between total alkalinity with total hardness r 0 867 total dissolved solids r 0 901 and sodium r 0 856 respectively total hardness attained in the water samples varies from 10 to 44 mg l as caco3 those values are very low with respect to the who guideline and bangladesh standard for surface water howladar et al 2017 total hardness has a strong and positive correlation with total dissolved solids r 0 911 which is shown in fig 6 total dissolved solids concentration is the sum of the cations positively charged and anions negatively charged in the water range of 34 4 101 3 mg l total dissolved solids test provides a qualitative measure of the amount of dissolved ions like conductivity it can serve as an indicator of other water quality problems iron iii concentration in the water samples varies from 0 09 to 0 36 mg l only one sample has exceeded the permissible limit of 0 3 mg l and in quarry mine water the iron concentration is approaching near 0 3 mg l high concentration of iron can indicate runoff from mining operations or industrial effluent the variation of iron is a function of local geological conditions iron is moderately and positively correlated with sodium r 0 588 potassium r 0 534 sulfate r 0 556 phosphate r 0 567 chloride r 0 513 and ammonia r 0 604 extensive analysis of calcium in water samples shows that ca ii ranges from 5 5 to 28 mg lis found within the acceptable limit the maximum limit of calcium is found in the pumped water discharge from the quarry mine and its value gradually decreases as the water flows in the river stream in the piyain river magnesium concentration is found within the range of 1 24 5 mg l i e all are in the acceptable limit the maximum amount of magnesium is found in the pumped water discharge of quarry and minimum in the groundwater which is leeching through the dihing formation in the quarry area sodium 2 5 7 mg l is very low in comparison to the who and the bangladesh standard for surface water the highest amount of sodium is found in the pumped water discharge from the quarry sodium is moderately and positively correlated with potassium r 0 757 phosphate r 0 736 chloride r 0 785 and others potassium i concentration observed in the water samples in the range of 0 4 2 6 mg l and are very low in contrast to the who and bangladesh standard for surface water quality arsenic is one of the most important parameters for the environmental water quality assessment but in this investigation no traceable amount of arsenic is found cadmium concentration in the tested water samples is found to be in the ranges from 0 008 to 0 0043 mg l and those values are very low in comparison to the standard limit for surface water zn ii concentration in the water samples is found between 0 11 and 0 33 mg l with an average of 0 207which moderately and positively correlated with chloride r 0 55 the average concentration of chromium iii is 0 0026 and below the permissible limit of the who and the bangladesh standard for surface water soluble silica found in the water samples varies from 6 75 to 16 22 mg l must have been favored by both the high silica content of the host parent rocks and high degree of weathering that characterizes the tropical regions since a large number of people in the encompassing territory utilize this water for drinking reason it suggests that lion s share of the inhabitants is exposed to water borne silica on a daily basis some of the reported cases of shortness of breath fatigue loss of appetite tuberculosis among the patients not exposed to airborne silica may be a symptom of exposure to high concentration of dissolved silica gbadebo et al 2017 howladar et al 2016 ponsadailakshmi et al 2017 shah et al 2018 on the other hand silica in drinking water plays as antidote of aluminum and reduces the risk of alzheimer diseases gillette guyonnet et al 2007 sulfate concentration in water samples is found between 0 12 and 2 8 mg l the highest concentration of sulfate is found in the discharged pumped water of quarry and the values are observed almost uniform in the downstream of river the concentration of phosphate is within the range of 0 17 0 59 mg l and all values are within the acceptable limit nitrate no3 2 chloride cl and ammonia nh4 concentration are found in the ranges of 0 11 mg l to 0 48 mg l 1 05 4 11 mg l and 0 06 0 32 mg l respectively which are all within the acceptable limit of the who and the bangladesh standard 3 2 wqi analysis the calculation of water quality index wqi is done by weighted arithmetic index method water quality index is one of the most effective tools to monitor the surface as well as ground water pollution and can be used efficiently in the implementation of water quality upgrading programs mangukiya et al 2012 howladar 2017 ponsadailakshmi et al 2017 shah et al 2018 it is one of the aggregate indices that have been accepted as a rating that reflects the composite influence on the overall quality of numbers of precise water quality characteristics alam and pathak 2010 higher value of water quality index indicates poor quality of water and lower value shows better water quality the maximum weight 5 has been assigned to the parameters like total dissolved solids nitrate and chloride due to its major importance in water quality assessment weight 4 is assigned to ph specific conductivity turbidity iron and sulfate chromium is allotted with weight 3 and total alkalinity total hardness calcium magnesium sodium potassium cadmium zinc soluble silica phosphate ammonia which is given the minimum weight 2 the wqi values range from 19 84 to 154 21 as shown in fig 9 analyzing wqi it is clear that the water flowing in the river steam is excellent to good quality as per wqi value but few water samples collected from quarry area is in poor quality sample 12 is water sample from quarry dug well sample 13 is groundwater leaching from dihing formation and sample 14 is sump water of quarry these samples are collected from same longitude and latitude but different elevation the wqi for sample 13 is excellent but 12 and 14 is in good quality the reason is specific conductivity turbidity total alkalinity hardness total dissolved solids iron magnesium sodium potassium zinc soluble silica sulfate phosphate nitrate chloride concentration of sample 13 is less then sample 12 and 14 the categorization of water leads to excellent quality because of their high value of specific conductivity turbidity and total alkalinity in some sample though their specific conductivity and total alkalinity is high but their wqi is less because of low turbidity see fig 10 3 3 fwqi analysis the present study analyzed total 40 water sample of the piyain river with fuzzy water quality index fwqi two different models have been developed here fwqi1 and fwqi2 in fwqi1 all the parameters have unit weight but the weights of parameters in fwqi2 has been obtained from the ahp recommended by saaty is given in fig 11 it shows in primary parameter group turbidity gets the highest weight and specific conductivity gets the lowest weight in cation group iron gets highest weight and soluble silica gets the lowest weight because there is no health standard for soluble silica in the who guideline and the bangladesh standard in anion group chloride gets the highest and phosphate gets the lowest priority in overall fuzzy water quality index anion group gets the highest priority followed by cation group and primary parameter group all groups have consistency ratio less than 0 1 indicates the judgments that have been done is consistent see figs 12 13 the index value for fwqi1 is in the range of 47 6 78 4 which indicates an average to poor water quality see fig 12 all parameters have unit weight that means equal contribution in overall water quality condition it also indicates that the water flowing in the river is in good quality but the water samples collected from quarry quarry sinkhole and quarry dug well is not as good as previously found in wqi analysis in fwqi2 the index value ranges from 51 8 to 80 7 see fig 13 this result reflects an average to good water condition in the area the index value of fwqi2 is different than fwqi1 because of their relative weight is different from fwqi1 the comparative contribution to the overall fuzzy water index fwqi2 for groups of parameters is shown in fig 14 it shows that the cation group and anion group have greater effects on water quality index than the primary parameter group cation and anion group led to high values of fwq indexes which indicate a relative good condition of cations and anions the overall water quality in piyain river is good due to this acceptable value of anion group and cation group the primary parameter group shows that their contribution in water quality in sample 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 28 29 and 36 is below 40 that means the primary parameter of water collected from quarry sinkhole pumped water from quarry is not satisfactory the parameters of cation group and anion group are acceptable in all most 40 samples in some cases the concentration of some anions and cations is very low which improves the overall water quality though other parameter is not good 3 4 comparison of different analysis and the quality of water in the area a contrast between the proposed fuzzy water quality index fwqi1 and fwqi2 along with wqi index is shown in fig 15 these indexes differ because of their different weighting procedure in fwqi1 and fwqi2 the index value does not fluctuate too much as in the case of wqi wqi is a deterministic model where all the parameters must be weighted and a highly weighted parameter which has high concentration can manipulate the total water quality when measured value is above the standard value then the quality rating scale is high and it indicates high water quality index which lead to poor water quality but it is not true for all parameter it is a major drawback of conventional water quality index for example in case of ph if measured value is below the standard than it indicates acidic water and above standard it indicates alkaline water both are not acceptable for good water quality again if specific conductivity is low then water quality is good but low total alkalinity indicates poor water quality wqican t deal with uncertainties and human subjectivity but fuzzy logic does not depend on a single parameter rather it is a useful and flexible tools for integrating the experts knowledge and the existing uncertainties associated with water resources and environmental confusions that s why fuzzy water quality index is more reliable than other quality index according to wqi water quality of 82 50 water sample is in excellent quality 7 5 is in good and 10 is in poor category but according to fwqi1 80 is in average and 20 is in poor category and fwqi2 57 5 is in good and 42 5 in average category actually in fwqi2 water 75 sample shows their index value above 70 which is too close to good water condition and the rest 25 shows average water quality 4 conclusions and recommendations the surface water resources of a nation are extremely important to everyday life the effluents from quarry mining activities are directly discharged into the piyain river without any treatment or purification for that reason the measured value of total dissolved solids and soluble silica has an increasing trend in the quarry zone but it decreases as the mine water flows downstream in the river the continuity of sediment transportation has been interrupted by unplanned bridges for carrying sand and gravel by truck oil lubricants kerosene etc used for transportation of sand and gravel and boma machine operation are also contaminating the water quality the study encompasses an assessment of a new water quality index employing fuzzy logic and analytic hierarchy process it represents physical and chemical variables that govern the overall quality of surface water that is used for potable and household use total twenty one water quality parameters are measured for establishing wqi and fwqi to assess the quality of surface water fuzzy model has proved that water quality has good quality as shown in fig 16 but turbidity is always high there more studies should be taken in order to find out the biological conditions for the aquatic life existing in the piyain river analyzing wqi it is clear that the water flowing in the river steam is good quality but the water sample collected from pumped water of quarry quarry pond quarry dug well is in poor quality fwqi1 and fwqi2analysis also implicate that about75 water sample shows their index value above 70 which is very close to good water condition and the rest 25 shows average water quality in the samples collected from quarry the measured value of anion group and cation group is higher than the samples collected from river but their difference is not that much high in case of primary parameter the measured value is high in the quarry than river the overall water quality in the piyain river is good due to the acceptable value of anions and cations group of water in addition by contrasting the conventional wqi the outcome illustrates that the eradication of a number of desirable components in development of fwqi1 and fwqi2 did not reduce the accuracy of water quality classification however excluding various additional components with detrimental values reflected the classification of water quality undependable consequently the computed wqi and fwqi is capable of modeling the water quality status of a region based upon the available water quality parameters thus based on the explained merits of wqi and fwqi these techniques should be applied for the monitoring of complex water quality problem in the region in conventional wqi a highly concentrated parameter can manipulate the overall water quality index and it can t characterize the dynamic behavior of water quality parameters in fwqi1 all parameter has unit weight that means all parameter has equal contribution on overall water quality index which is not true at all fwqi2 overcome all these disadvantages by using membership function for conventional wqi and ahp weights for fwqi1 at the end it can be concluded that this computed new fwqi2 will be more helpful than wqi and fwqi1 for decision makers in reporting the condition of surface water quality and analysis of spatial and temporal changes in the river water and also it is believed that fuzzy logic concepts could be an effective tool for the water environmental policy making

12202,the aim of this study is to assess the quality of surface water of piyain river adopting two different approaches the first approach determines the classification of water samples by the traditional water quality index and the second one is focused on water classification analysis with the aid of the mamdani fuzzy logic mfl for this case the relative weight of water quality parameter is computed based on the analytic hierarchy process ahp the ahp is a multiple criteria decision making procedure which provides a methodology to calibrate the numeric scale for the measurement of quantitative as well as qualitative performances the relative importance of different attributes is given on a scale from 1 to 9 in fuzzy water quality assessment procedure the trapezoidal membership functions are used because of its highest classification accuracy also it can characterize the dynamic behavior of the water quality parameters twenty one parameters are tested for the assessment of water quality however arsenic is not found in the water samples so the rest twenty parameters is divided into three groups for utilizing the hierarchy by grouping some criteria total sixty nine rules are used three for each indicator and three for each partial group in hydro chemical analysis it is found that typical value of sulfate 0 12 2 8 mg l sodium 2 5 7 mg l chloride 1 05 4 11 mg l potassium 0 4 2 6 mg l is extremely lower thanstandard value where the standard for bangladesh is 400 mg l 200 mg l 150 600 mg l 12 mg l respectively specific conductivity 45 7 135 μs cm calcium 5 5 28 mg l magnesium 1 24 5 mg l are below standard where the standard values are 500 μs cm 75 mg l 30 35 mg l correspondingly the measured value of ph 6 31 6 96 is between who and bangladesh standard 6 5 8 5 turbidity 3 5 99 ntu is higher with respect to who guideline 5 ntu bangladesh standard 10 ntu the computed wqi value ranges from 19 84 to 154 21 whereas fwqi1 and fwqi2 value ranges from 47 6 to 78 4 and from 51 8 to 80 7 respectively it suggests that the surface water of the river exhibits good water condition besides the quality of water sample from quarry area is found average to good in a nutshell fwqi2is more reliable than fwqi and wqi hence it can be applied for monitoring water quality problem locally or regionally graphical abstract image 1 keywords sand and gravel quarry mining wqi mamdani fuzzy logic analytic hierarchy process surface water quality water sustainability 1 introduction sand and gravel are major raw materials used in construction industry due to rapid industrialization urbanization and associated development the demand of sand and gravel has raised especially in the developing country jaflong is one of the main extraction points of sand and gravel in bangladesh the piyain river in jaflong has developed the alluvial fans which are found along the foot of the meghalaya plateau due to the decrease in channel gradient and reduction in velocity the streams leave their canyons causes the deposition of sand and gravel sediments consequently forms a fan shaped or conical delta every monsoon season it carries millions of tons of sand and gravel in downstream part this sand and gravel are extracted with the dredging machine locally known as the boma machine for its extreme noise the mine water and effluent are directly discharged into the piyain river the surface water resources of a nation are vitally important to the daily life the main uses of surface water include drinking and household chores irrigation uses and the other industrial purposes discharge of industrial and mining water into river water without any treatment or purification causing the pollution of water chima et al 2010 howladar et al 2014 the quarry mining activities in jaflong area are suspected to contaminate the surface water of the river basin and stream flow of the river the protection of aquatic life as well as human life is merely depended upon river water in the developed countries the environmental monitoring agencies are more active they monitor the quality of water resource frequently and environmental laws are strictly followed there but in the developing countries like bangladesh environmental laws are not fully abiding by the conventional water quality monitoring techniques are compared with the specific water quality parameters and levels with their guideline standard values specified by different monitoring and supervisory agencies water quality index aims at giving a single value to the water of a source on the basis of one or the other system horton s water quality index is considered as the forerunner of the modern wqis abbasi and abbasi 2012 after that numerous water quality indices have been formulated by several national and international organizations such as weight arithmetic water quality index wawqi national sanitation foundation water quality index nfswqi canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccmewqi oregon water quality index owqi etc in recent years sadat noori et al 2013 applied wqi along with geographical information system gis to understand the groundwater quality status of saveh nobaran aquifer in iran hosseini moghari et al 2015 and tiri et al 2018 compared the conventional wqi with fwqi they showed that the elimination of some required parameters in the development of fwqi did not decrease the accuracy of water quality classification however omitting some other parameters with undesirable values made the classification of water quality unreliable armanuos et al 2015 and dahiya et al 2007 studied ground water quality with arcgis in the western nile delta aquifer egypt karbassi et al 2011 evaluated the gorganrood river water quality by available nsf water quality index subsequently the nine present nsf parameters weights have been changed and modified using the analytical hierarchy process ahp method as well as expert s opinion in the newly developed wqi more weights are given to relation with these parameters it can be said that the factors like dissolved oxygen fecal coliform and biological oxygen demand when compared with nsfwqi the fuzzy inference is the process of formulating the mapping from a given input to an output using fuzzy logic the mapping then provides a basis from which decisions can be made or patterns discerned the fuzzy inference systems have been successfully implemented in fields such as automatic control data classifications decision analysis expert systems and computer vision the mathworks inc 2015 abdullah et al 2008 noted that the fuzzy inference system fis may successfully harmonize the inherent discrepancies and interpret complex conditions these studies developed a new water quality model and showed that this river water quality model can be extended to determine the non regulated contaminants in water analysis of water quality of ebro river by ocampo duque et al 2006 mentioned that the fuzzy logic is an appropriate and alternative tool to be used in developing effective water management plans in spain raman et al 2009 used uniq2007 model unit which is constructed with control elements having dynamic fuzzy logic properties wherein target non linearity can be input to result in a perfect evaluation of water quality this water quality assessor probe can provide better quality index or identify the status of river with 90 perfection thus this study aims at assessing the impact of quarry mining in jaflong area on the surface water of piyain river two methods are adopted here to evaluate the water quality grade of the river the first approach determines the classification of water samples by water quality index and the second one is focused on water classification analysis with the aid of mamdani fuzzy logic where the relative weight of water quality parameter is computed based on the analytic hierarchy process ahp 1 1 research area the study area is located in the gowainghatupazila of sylhet district it issituated at the border between bangladesh and the indian state meghalaya it lies between n 25 10 51 1 latitude and e 92 01 02 2 longitude the piyain river is a branch of the surma river originated from the umgat river of the hilly area of assam following southward the river enters into bangladesh through sylhet district and branches out into two rivers namely the piyain river and the dauki or jaflong river the total length of piyain river is about 145 km the crystal clear water of piyain river which flows from india through bangladesh used to be the most prominent assets of jaflong during monsoons the river current wash down precious rocks and pebbles today it is the hub of the stone crushing industry but the river is dying losing its vitality and beauty 2 methodology 2 1 sample collection and laboratory analysis totalforty 40 water samples is collected very carefully in one 1 liter plastic bottles from study area among them some samples are collected from the quarry area and some samples from the river the samples collected from quarry area are from pumped water from quarry quarry sinkhole and quarry dug well also water leaching from the quarry is also collected the latitude longitude and elevation are recorded during the time of sampling with the help of gps reading fig 1 the detail information about the water samples and the sampling locations are also recorded before collecting the samples dry clean and sterilized plastic bottles is used to avoid any type of contaminations all bottles are washed well and rinsed with demineralized water before sampling immediately after sampling ph specific conductivity and total dissolved solids are measured in the field with help of a portable ph and an ec tds meter moreover the detail chemical analysis is carried out in the laboratory using following laboratory instruments details is given in table 1 1 atomic absorption spectroscopy aas pg999 graphite furnace power supply

romania 5 digital ph meter model 720 wtw service germany 6 oven digital model boxun china 2 2 water quality index wqi water quality index is calculated for the grouping of water in which the integration of parametric information on water quality data and the expert s knowledge based on their relative importance and weight sahu and sikdar 2008 wqi mathematically summarizes the information from numerous water quality parameters into a single output value the present research employs 20 water quality parameters for calculating the wqi a multi layer computational procedure is required for wqi evaluation in the first step all the parameters have been assigned a weight wi according to their relative importance in the overall water quality through human consumption point of view later the relative weight wi pawar et al 2014 of each parameter is computed as follows i w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters the weights and relative weight of the parameters are presented in table 2 the next step is the calculation of quality rating scale qi which is calculated as follows ii q i c i s i 100 where ci is the measured value of each parameter in each water sample and si is the standard value for each parameter for computing the wqi boateng et al 2016 the si is first determined for each parameter iii s i i w i q i where si i is the sub index of ith parameter finally wqi is evaluated as follows iv wqi s i i wqi boateng et al 2016 classifies the water samples within five classes shown in table 3 2 3 mamdani fuzzy interface system the mamdani s fuzzy inference system is the most frequently used fuzzy interface system it is amid the first control systems built using fuzzy set theory recommended in 1975 by ebrahim mamdani a general fuzzy system is composed of several steps fig 2 the first step is to take the input output and define the degree to which they belong to each of the appropriate fuzzy sets using membership functions a membership function is a curve that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value between 0 and 1 the input space is called the universe of discourse the output axis is called the membership value μ if x is the universe of discourse and its elements are denoted by x then a fuzzy set a in x is defined as a set of ordered pairs mamdani and assilian 1975 v a x μa x x x μa x is called the membership function of x in a the fuzzy rule base contains rule that includes all possible fuzzy relations between inputs and output the input to the fuzzy operator is two or more membership values from fuzzified input variables mamdani and assilian 1975 in the implication method we have to determine the rule s weight every rule has a weight a number between 0 and 1 which is applied to the number given by the antecedent defuzzification is the step where the output values obtained in the form of fuzzy set resolve to a single numeric value mamdani and assilian 1975 centroid defuzzification is the most widespread and physically appealing of all the defuzzification methods it is given by the algebraic expression vi z μ c z z d z μ c z d z where denotes an algebraic integration 2 4 development of fuzzy water quality index fwqi in fuzzy water quality assessment trapezoidal membership functions are most often used trapezoidal membership function can classify the parameters used for the assessment of water quality more accurately in that way trapezoidal membership functions are characterizing the dynamic behavior of the water quality parameters kiurski milosevic et al 2015 the membership function consists of core support and boundary explained by ross 2010 shown in fig 3 the trapezoidal membership functions obtained for all twenty water quality parameters as follows vii f x a b c d 0 x a x a b a a x b 1 b x c d x d c c x d 0 d x viii f x a b c d max min x a b a 1 d x d c 0 the membership function is obtained with the help of expert knowledge water quality standard by who and bangladesh bureau of statistics and other the list of parameter and their membership function is given in table 4 total sixty nine rules are used three for each parameter and three for each partial group each rule has only one antecedent in order to facilitate the weight assignment in fwqi1 each rule has unit weight whereas the fwqi2 the weight is obtained by the analytic hierarchy process ahp 2 5 the analytic hierarchy process the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a multiple criteria decision making procedure which is introduced by saaty 1990 2003 it also provides a methodology to calibrate the numeric scale for the measurement of quantitative as well as qualitative performances vaidya and kumar 2006 this is an eigen value approach to the pair wise comparisons the relative importance of different attributes is given on a 1 to 9 scale as per table 5 then the pairwise comparisons of various criteria generated are organized into a square matrix the diagonal elements of the matrix are 1 the criterion in the ith row is better than criterion in the jth column if the value of element i j is more than 1 otherwise the criterion in the jth column is better than that in the ith row the j i element of the matrix is the reciprocal of the i j element the elements of the normalized eigenvector are termed weights with respect to the criteria or sub criteria and ratings with respect to the alternatives the consistency of the matrix of order n is evaluated the details have been interpreted by saaty 1990 2003 3 results and discussions 3 1 the statistics of hydrochemical characteristics of water twenty parameters were divided in three groups and their range of measured value is shown in figs 4 7 8 the ph value of the water samples collected from the piyain river ranges from 6 31 to 6 96 it indicates that the water is acidic in nature yet within the permissible limit 6 5 8 5 given by the bangladesh standard and the who 2011 guideline these values are typical for natural surface water and optimum for most organisms the ph value of water sample collected from quarry and sinkhole created due to quarry is found about 6 9 normally sand and gravel mining has less impact on ph yen and hashim 2013 howladar 2012 the ph is near neutral may be due to present of limestone outcrop in surrounding area because limestone can buffer ph changes in water and keep it to near neutral there is no strong correlation between ph and other parameters the specific conductivity of the water samples in the pyain river ranges from 45 7 to 135 μs cm the samples collected from pumped groundwater from quarry mine which are discharged to the river exhibit have specific conductivity greater than one hundred μs cm the water with high mineral contents tends to have higher conductivity it is a general indication of high dissolved solids concentration in the water hossain et al 2010 mangukiya et al 2012 yen and hashim 2013 bayram and önsoy 2014 which is shown in fig 5 specific conductivity has a strong positive correlation r 0 919 0 909 0 994 with total alkalinity total hardness and total dissolved solids tds respectively turbidity of water sample sare found high in the study region test result shows that 82 5 sample surpasses the who standard limit and 40 samples bangladesh standard limit for turbidity for drinking purpose turbidity is much higher in the territory which can prompt the gastrointestinal diseases and limit the development of submerged aquatic plants alkalinity represents the buffering capacity of water and its ability of water to resist the change in ph the areas rich in granites conglomerates and sandstones may have low alkalinity and therefore poor buffering capacity total alkalinity of the estimated water is in the range of 16 60 mg l as caco3 for the protection of aquatic life the buffering capacity should be at least 20 mg l observation revealed that there is a decrease in alkalinity in the water of the downstream of river a strong positive correlation is found between total alkalinity with total hardness r 0 867 total dissolved solids r 0 901 and sodium r 0 856 respectively total hardness attained in the water samples varies from 10 to 44 mg l as caco3 those values are very low with respect to the who guideline and bangladesh standard for surface water howladar et al 2017 total hardness has a strong and positive correlation with total dissolved solids r 0 911 which is shown in fig 6 total dissolved solids concentration is the sum of the cations positively charged and anions negatively charged in the water range of 34 4 101 3 mg l total dissolved solids test provides a qualitative measure of the amount of dissolved ions like conductivity it can serve as an indicator of other water quality problems iron iii concentration in the water samples varies from 0 09 to 0 36 mg l only one sample has exceeded the permissible limit of 0 3 mg l and in quarry mine water the iron concentration is approaching near 0 3 mg l high concentration of iron can indicate runoff from mining operations or industrial effluent the variation of iron is a function of local geological conditions iron is moderately and positively correlated with sodium r 0 588 potassium r 0 534 sulfate r 0 556 phosphate r 0 567 chloride r 0 513 and ammonia r 0 604 extensive analysis of calcium in water samples shows that ca ii ranges from 5 5 to 28 mg lis found within the acceptable limit the maximum limit of calcium is found in the pumped water discharge from the quarry mine and its value gradually decreases as the water flows in the river stream in the piyain river magnesium concentration is found within the range of 1 24 5 mg l i e all are in the acceptable limit the maximum amount of magnesium is found in the pumped water discharge of quarry and minimum in the groundwater which is leeching through the dihing formation in the quarry area sodium 2 5 7 mg l is very low in comparison to the who and the bangladesh standard for surface water the highest amount of sodium is found in the pumped water discharge from the quarry sodium is moderately and positively correlated with potassium r 0 757 phosphate r 0 736 chloride r 0 785 and others potassium i concentration observed in the water samples in the range of 0 4 2 6 mg l and are very low in contrast to the who and bangladesh standard for surface water quality arsenic is one of the most important parameters for the environmental water quality assessment but in this investigation no traceable amount of arsenic is found cadmium concentration in the tested water samples is found to be in the ranges from 0 008 to 0 0043 mg l and those values are very low in comparison to the standard limit for surface water zn ii concentration in the water samples is found between 0 11 and 0 33 mg l with an average of 0 207which moderately and positively correlated with chloride r 0 55 the average concentration of chromium iii is 0 0026 and below the permissible limit of the who and the bangladesh standard for surface water soluble silica found in the water samples varies from 6 75 to 16 22 mg l must have been favored by both the high silica content of the host parent rocks and high degree of weathering that characterizes the tropical regions since a large number of people in the encompassing territory utilize this water for drinking reason it suggests that lion s share of the inhabitants is exposed to water borne silica on a daily basis some of the reported cases of shortness of breath fatigue loss of appetite tuberculosis among the patients not exposed to airborne silica may be a symptom of exposure to high concentration of dissolved silica gbadebo et al 2017 howladar et al 2016 ponsadailakshmi et al 2017 shah et al 2018 on the other hand silica in drinking water plays as antidote of aluminum and reduces the risk of alzheimer diseases gillette guyonnet et al 2007 sulfate concentration in water samples is found between 0 12 and 2 8 mg l the highest concentration of sulfate is found in the discharged pumped water of quarry and the values are observed almost uniform in the downstream of river the concentration of phosphate is within the range of 0 17 0 59 mg l and all values are within the acceptable limit nitrate no3 2 chloride cl and ammonia nh4 concentration are found in the ranges of 0 11 mg l to 0 48 mg l 1 05 4 11 mg l and 0 06 0 32 mg l respectively which are all within the acceptable limit of the who and the bangladesh standard 3 2 wqi analysis the calculation of water quality index wqi is done by weighted arithmetic index method water quality index is one of the most effective tools to monitor the surface as well as ground water pollution and can be used efficiently in the implementation of water quality upgrading programs mangukiya et al 2012 howladar 2017 ponsadailakshmi et al 2017 shah et al 2018 it is one of the aggregate indices that have been accepted as a rating that reflects the composite influence on the overall quality of numbers of precise water quality characteristics alam and pathak 2010 higher value of water quality index indicates poor quality of water and lower value shows better water quality the maximum weight 5 has been assigned to the parameters like total dissolved solids nitrate and chloride due to its major importance in water quality assessment weight 4 is assigned to ph specific conductivity turbidity iron and sulfate chromium is allotted with weight 3 and total alkalinity total hardness calcium magnesium sodium potassium cadmium zinc soluble silica phosphate ammonia which is given the minimum weight 2 the wqi values range from 19 84 to 154 21 as shown in fig 9 analyzing wqi it is clear that the water flowing in the river steam is excellent to good quality as per wqi value but few water samples collected from quarry area is in poor quality sample 12 is water sample from quarry dug well sample 13 is groundwater leaching from dihing formation and sample 14 is sump water of quarry these samples are collected from same longitude and latitude but different elevation the wqi for sample 13 is excellent but 12 and 14 is in good quality the reason is specific conductivity turbidity total alkalinity hardness total dissolved solids iron magnesium sodium potassium zinc soluble silica sulfate phosphate nitrate chloride concentration of sample 13 is less then sample 12 and 14 the categorization of water leads to excellent quality because of their high value of specific conductivity turbidity and total alkalinity in some sample though their specific conductivity and total alkalinity is high but their wqi is less because of low turbidity see fig 10 3 3 fwqi analysis the present study analyzed total 40 water sample of the piyain river with fuzzy water quality index fwqi two different models have been developed here fwqi1 and fwqi2 in fwqi1 all the parameters have unit weight but the weights of parameters in fwqi2 has been obtained from the ahp recommended by saaty is given in fig 11 it shows in primary parameter group turbidity gets the highest weight and specific conductivity gets the lowest weight in cation group iron gets highest weight and soluble silica gets the lowest weight because there is no health standard for soluble silica in the who guideline and the bangladesh standard in anion group chloride gets the highest and phosphate gets the lowest priority in overall fuzzy water quality index anion group gets the highest priority followed by cation group and primary parameter group all groups have consistency ratio less than 0 1 indicates the judgments that have been done is consistent see figs 12 13 the index value for fwqi1 is in the range of 47 6 78 4 which indicates an average to poor water quality see fig 12 all parameters have unit weight that means equal contribution in overall water quality condition it also indicates that the water flowing in the river is in good quality but the water samples collected from quarry quarry sinkhole and quarry dug well is not as good as previously found in wqi analysis in fwqi2 the index value ranges from 51 8 to 80 7 see fig 13 this result reflects an average to good water condition in the area the index value of fwqi2 is different than fwqi1 because of their relative weight is different from fwqi1 the comparative contribution to the overall fuzzy water index fwqi2 for groups of parameters is shown in fig 14 it shows that the cation group and anion group have greater effects on water quality index than the primary parameter group cation and anion group led to high values of fwq indexes which indicate a relative good condition of cations and anions the overall water quality in piyain river is good due to this acceptable value of anion group and cation group the primary parameter group shows that their contribution in water quality in sample 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 28 29 and 36 is below 40 that means the primary parameter of water collected from quarry sinkhole pumped water from quarry is not satisfactory the parameters of cation group and anion group are acceptable in all most 40 samples in some cases the concentration of some anions and cations is very low which improves the overall water quality though other parameter is not good 3 4 comparison of different analysis and the quality of water in the area a contrast between the proposed fuzzy water quality index fwqi1 and fwqi2 along with wqi index is shown in fig 15 these indexes differ because of their different weighting procedure in fwqi1 and fwqi2 the index value does not fluctuate too much as in the case of wqi wqi is a deterministic model where all the parameters must be weighted and a highly weighted parameter which has high concentration can manipulate the total water quality when measured value is above the standard value then the quality rating scale is high and it indicates high water quality index which lead to poor water quality but it is not true for all parameter it is a major drawback of conventional water quality index for example in case of ph if measured value is below the standard than it indicates acidic water and above standard it indicates alkaline water both are not acceptable for good water quality again if specific conductivity is low then water quality is good but low total alkalinity indicates poor water quality wqican t deal with uncertainties and human subjectivity but fuzzy logic does not depend on a single parameter rather it is a useful and flexible tools for integrating the experts knowledge and the existing uncertainties associated with water resources and environmental confusions that s why fuzzy water quality index is more reliable than other quality index according to wqi water quality of 82 50 water sample is in excellent quality 7 5 is in good and 10 is in poor category but according to fwqi1 80 is in average and 20 is in poor category and fwqi2 57 5 is in good and 42 5 in average category actually in fwqi2 water 75 sample shows their index value above 70 which is too close to good water condition and the rest 25 shows average water quality 4 conclusions and recommendations the surface water resources of a nation are extremely important to everyday life the effluents from quarry mining activities are directly discharged into the piyain river without any treatment or purification for that reason the measured value of total dissolved solids and soluble silica has an increasing trend in the quarry zone but it decreases as the mine water flows downstream in the river the continuity of sediment transportation has been interrupted by unplanned bridges for carrying sand and gravel by truck oil lubricants kerosene etc used for transportation of sand and gravel and boma machine operation are also contaminating the water quality the study encompasses an assessment of a new water quality index employing fuzzy logic and analytic hierarchy process it represents physical and chemical variables that govern the overall quality of surface water that is used for potable and household use total twenty one water quality parameters are measured for establishing wqi and fwqi to assess the quality of surface water fuzzy model has proved that water quality has good quality as shown in fig 16 but turbidity is always high there more studies should be taken in order to find out the biological conditions for the aquatic life existing in the piyain river analyzing wqi it is clear that the water flowing in the river steam is good quality but the water sample collected from pumped water of quarry quarry pond quarry dug well is in poor quality fwqi1 and fwqi2analysis also implicate that about75 water sample shows their index value above 70 which is very close to good water condition and the rest 25 shows average water quality in the samples collected from quarry the measured value of anion group and cation group is higher than the samples collected from river but their difference is not that much high in case of primary parameter the measured value is high in the quarry than river the overall water quality in the piyain river is good due to the acceptable value of anions and cations group of water in addition by contrasting the conventional wqi the outcome illustrates that the eradication of a number of desirable components in development of fwqi1 and fwqi2 did not reduce the accuracy of water quality classification however excluding various additional components with detrimental values reflected the classification of water quality undependable consequently the computed wqi and fwqi is capable of modeling the water quality status of a region based upon the available water quality parameters thus based on the explained merits of wqi and fwqi these techniques should be applied for the monitoring of complex water quality problem in the region in conventional wqi a highly concentrated parameter can manipulate the overall water quality index and it can t characterize the dynamic behavior of water quality parameters in fwqi1 all parameter has unit weight that means all parameter has equal contribution on overall water quality index which is not true at all fwqi2 overcome all these disadvantages by using membership function for conventional wqi and ahp weights for fwqi1 at the end it can be concluded that this computed new fwqi2 will be more helpful than wqi and fwqi1 for decision makers in reporting the condition of surface water quality and analysis of spatial and temporal changes in the river water and also it is believed that fuzzy logic concepts could be an effective tool for the water environmental policy making

12203,limited resources and increased water demand associated with fast socio economic development and expansion in the irrigated land in southern algeria have led to overexploitation of groundwater and caused a significant water table drawdown as well as groundwater quality degradation due to saline water intrusion solar distillation is an interesting alternative source for producing drinking water from brackish water for the purpose of supplying isolated communities in remote areas the present seeks to improve the performance of a glass solar still through increasing the productivity of freshwater by the use of different new absorbers such as gravel polyethylene and sand as heat storage systems the solar distiller under study was fabricated with cheap glass and healthy materials and was tested under the climatic conditions of the city of adrar in the southern part of algeria where solar energy and underground saline water are abundant the experimental results show that gravel produces the highest quantity of fresh water i e 5 l per m2 per day followed by black polyethylene with 4 48 l m2 d and then sand with 3 84 l m2 d it is interesting to note that the daily freshwater productivities of gravel and black polyethylene are respectively 32 20 and 16 67 higher than that of sand in addition it was found that gravel is the best absorber and has the highest productivity as compared to the other absorbers the solar radiation intensity is quite high the maximum value was found equal to 1131 013 w m2 moreover the quality of water is reflected in its total dissolved salts tds level which is of the order of 21 247 mg l from feed water with a tds content of about 3062 60 mg l hence the efficiency of the solar still is approximately 99 30 graphical abstract image 1 keywords city of adrar glass basin local material productivity solar still 1 introduction clean drinking water is essential to life the social and economic development of any nation depends heavily on this substance human life would not be possible without potable or fresh drinking water hansen and murugavel 2017 indeed fresh water remains a pressing concern throughout the entire world today the provision of clean water to meet the growing water demands for agriculture industry and households is becoming increasingly difficult for a large number of countries over the last few years the problem of freshwater scarcity has become one of the main challenges all over the world potable water is an indispensable element for life water in general is widely employed in industry and agriculture though more than 70 of the earth surface is covered with water only 1 of that amount can directly be used by human beings and other living organisms on the other hand it is worth knowing that about 97 5 of water on our planet earth is salt water part of which can be treated and converted to distilled water rahbar and esfahani 2012 kabeel 2009 algeria is one of the countries most affected by freshwater shortage since the year 2007 this problem has been partly solved in the northern part of the country through the installation of several seawater desalination units however the southern region where water scarcity is becoming increasingly critical is still suffering from the shortage of that substance this is particularly experienced in the arid zones the city of adrar is located in southwestern algeria the last few years have witnessed a rapid increase in its population and a remarkable expansion of its irrigated land and industrial development this situation has led to overexploitation of groundwater and consequently caused a huge water table drawdown in addition groundwater quality degradation has become a serious issue in this region as water salinity is growing nowadays modern technology offers some sophisticated techniques such as ion exchange reverse osmosis and electrodialysis for water purification unfortunately these techniques are generally costly and require a lot of energy consumption solar desalination technology can be used to produce fresh water from brackish water for the purpose of supplying isolated sparse low density populated areas in the algerian sahara where solar energy and underground saline water are abundant sellami et al 2017 solar stills are cheap and necessitate low maintenance costs but can produce only small amounts of fresh water duffie jone and beckman william 2013 solar distillation of brackish water is a practical and interesting option that can offer life to those regions where the lack of fresh water hinders development in the algerian arid zones people have always relied on underground water reservoirs for their fresh water needs however the quality of water from such sources is not always good due to the presence of salt boukar and harmim 2005 the algerian territory is a particularly sunny area especially its sahara desert which is considered as the region most exposed to the sun in the world nasri et al 1968 this territory may benefit from between 2500 and 4000 h of sunshine per year the city of adrar enjoys a substantial amount of solar radiation with long sunshine hours high ambient temperature and high solar radiation intensity 7 kwh m2 day benatiallah et al 1968 solar energy is abundant renewable pollution free and available on site solar stills are the simplest solar distillation units they are cheap and need low maintenance but most of them suffer from low productivity and poor efficiency kaushal 2010 water resources in the southwestern part of algeria are limited and groundwater is sometimes the only source of fresh water available for the inhabitants of the region in the algerian sahara drinking water is mainly supplied by groundwater reservoirs from the aquifers of the terminal complex and continental intercalary albian water which are located in the western part of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas better known under the acronym sass for its french name système aquifer du sahara septentrional sass sekkoumet al ning 2012 the freshwater supplies in these regions come essentially from the groundwater of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas this huge aquifer which is shared by algeria libya and tunisia contains considerable but partly renewable water resources the north western sahara aquifer system extends over a vast area of more than one million km2 with seven hundred thousand 700 000 km2 in algeria eighty thousand 80 000 km2 in tunisia and two hundred and fifty thousand 250 000 km2 in libya this aquifer consists of a complex superposition of layers with the two main ones located in two different geological formations namely the continental intercalary ci or albian and the terminal complex tc the exploitation of this system dates back to several years this was done first through the direct exploitation of the water sources and then through the construction of surface wells and foggaras depending on the structural contexts and later through deep drills which sometimes exceeded one thousand 1000 meters of depth in some cases observatoire du sahel et sahra oss 2014 the intensive use of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas by the three countries 8800 water points drillings wells sources and foggaras has caused growing stress on that precious resource thus increasing the risks of saltwater intrusion and salinization loss of artesian pressure depletion of natural outlets and lowering of the water table the nwsas zone covers different eco regions ranging from desert areas with an annual rainfall rate lower than 100 mm and an evapotranspiration rate higher than 3000 mm to arid areas with an annual rainfall between 100 and 200 mm and an evapotranspiration rate between 2000 and 2500 mm cedare 2014 during the second half of the 20th century the use of groundwater from the nwsa system increased considerably which resulted in a significant increase in water demand that went from 0 6 to 2 5 billion m3 year in the three neighbor countries oss 2008 the evolution of intense water withdrawal from the aquifers of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas has exposed the entire region to major risks such as strong inter country interference disappearance of artesian water drying up of natural outlets foggaras increased depth to water due to excessive pumping and water salinization 5 2 g l oss 2003 numerous efforts have been made by researchers around the world to enhance the productivity of passive solar stills whose performance could be improved by achieving the adequate modifications in the still design and selecting the most suitable operating parameters voropoulos et al 2004 ahsan et al 2014 note that the external cooling of the glass cover was used for the purpose of increasing the solar still productivity similarly several authors suggested a thin film of water flowing over the external glass cover arunkumaret al 2012 on the other hand harris samuel et al harris samuel et al 2016 made an attempt to improve the thermal efficiency of a solar still using encapsulated salt as a thermal energy storage material the results obtained showed that if the surface area of water in the basin is increased while using salt as a heat storage material then the fresh water productivity can be enhanced it may be up to 133 higher than that obtained with a conventional basin type solar still in addition the study revealed that using salt and sand as heat storage materials during night time allowed achieving yields equal to 0 5 kg m2 and 0 3 kg m2 respectively similarly rajaseenivasan et al 2016 carried out a theoretical and experimental study on the performance of a glass basin solar still equipped with an integrated preheated water supply they found out that the presence of charcoal in fins allowed augmenting the total distillate output of the system up to 3 61 kg day moreover elango and murugavel 2015 presented a new approach to enhance the solar still productivity by introducing glass as the basin material single and double basin double slope solar stills with identical basin area were fabricated using glass it turned out that the single basin solar still productivity is more than the productivity of a double basin solar still during the hot period kabeel et al 2018 succeeded in improving the fresh water productivity and thermal performance of a conventional basin type solar still using a sensible heat storage material fixed on jute cloth wrapped over the entire surface of the basin with different masses of water the results obtained suggest that the production of fresh water depends on a number of parameters such the mass of sensible energy material and the depth of water in the basin the quantities of fresh water produced by the solar still when using the smallest amount of salt water mw 20 kg with and without jute cloth fixed on sensible heat storage material were found equal to 5 9 and 5 kg m2 respectively phadatare and verma 2007 conducted an experimental study on the performance of a single slope single plastic basin solar still the sidewalls of the still were made up of 3 mm thick black acrylic sheets and insulated with 2 5 cm thick glass wool with 2 cm depth of water in the distiller the maximum distillate production of the still was 2 1 l m2 day phase change materials pcms also called latent heat storage materials may also be used for thermal energy storage building heating and cooling applications hansen and murugavel 2017 the latent heat storage technique provides much higher energy storage density with a small temperature difference between storing and releasing heat these materials are quite advantageous for their low cost high energy storage density and isothermal operating characteristics phase change materials may be employed for the production of distilled water using solar energy they are used as a bridge to cross the difference between the energy source and the distillation unit gugulothu et al 2015 to do this sellami et al 2017 carried out an experimental work on the performance of a solar still using an additional inner heat storage system while covering the absorber surface with some blackened sponge layers the result obtained showed that a 0 5 cm thick sponge layer increases the yield by 58 however a 1 0 cm thick sponge layer resulted in a yield improvement of only 23 03 ouar et al 2017 investigated the effect of using a 0 5 cm thick layer of bitumen 100 g of charcoal and 10 drops of black chinese ink per liter of brackish water on the performance of the solar still under the local climatic conditions of the city of ouargla in algeria they reached the conclusion that bitumen charcoal and black ink can improve the water distillate output by 25 35 18 42 and 6 87 respectively as compared with a conventional solar still for their part kabbel and abdelgaied kabeel and abdelgaied 2016 inquired experimentally the effect of adding paraffin wax as a phase change material pcm for storing energy in order to enhance the performance of a solar still through the increase in freshwater production they found out that the daily freshwater productivity of a solar still with a phase change material pcm was 67 18 higher than that obtained with a conventional solar still furthermore the solar still integrated with a pcm is more interesting in terms of daily freshwater production with 67 68 8 improvement as compared to a conventional solar still similarly el sebaii et al 2009 developed a mathematical model for a single basin solar still with and without phase change material pcm placed under the basin liner of the still the solar still performance was investigated by computer simulation the numerical calculations were carried out using stearic acid as a phase change material the effect of the pcm mass on the daytime and nighttime productivity and efficiency of the still for different masses of basin water was also investigated the findings indicated that the daytime productivity decreased when the pcm mass increased but the overnight productivity and daily productivity significantly increased when the pcm mass rose this may be attributed to the greater amount of heat stored within the pcm sellami et al 2016 investigated experimentally the effect of using equal masses of portland cement and alluvial sand for the purpose of improving the yield of a conventional solar still they achieved a productivity gain of 39 70 by adding 300 g of the cement this gain was approximately equal to 31 61 when a mass of 200 g of the mixture was employed moreover they found out that the addition of 100 g of cement increases the yield by 25 49 however a cement layer of 400 g enhanced the yield by only 33 08 for their part dashtban and tabrizi 2011 carried out an experimental analysis on a weir type cascade solar still integrated with a latent heat thermal energy storage system this solar still was designed with the view of enhancing its productivity by placing an 18 kg and 2 cm thick layer of paraffin wax beneath the absorber plate for keeping the operating temperature of the still high enough to produce distillated water in the absence of sunlight particularly at night in addition they developed a theoretical model for the solar still with and without pcm and then they compared the results obtained with the experimental ones they concluded that the daily solar still productivity was theoretically equal to 6 7 and 5 1 kg m2 day with and without pcm respectively these findings allowed concluding that the productivity of the still with pcm was theoretically 31 higher than that without pcm also a phase change material pcm was added to a concentrator coupled hemispherical basin solar still in order to augment its efficiency and improve its distillate yield two modes of operation were investigated experimentally by arunkumar et al 2013 the first one concerned a single slope solar still without the phase change material and the second involved a single slope solar still with the pcm the experimental results indicated that when the thermal storage material was integrated into the concentrator coupled hemispherical basin solar still the productivity was increased by 26 therefore it may be concluded that productivity is significantly higher as a result of integrating the pcm into the solar still on the other hand srivastava and agrawal 2013 investigated experimentally the effect of placing porous fins into the basin of a conventional solar still supplied with black wick material the results obtained show that the temperature of water is about 25 smaller than that of the conventional distiller also the productivity yield in summer and winter was 30 and 45 higher respectively in addition an increase in fresh water yield of about 22 2 was observed when the depth of water decreased from 0 04 to 0 03 m the present article aims at assessing the performance of a single basin solar still using healthy materials that are locally available it also makes an attempt to ensure a good quality of distilled water production without any contamination by iron derivatives this system was entirely fabricated with cheap locally available glass the experiments were conducted in order to study the effect of sand polyethylene and gravel as sensible heat storage materials for the purpose of increasing the absorbency of the basin and consequently enhancing the freshwater productivity of the solar still moreover the effect of different environmental and operational parameters on the still productivity was inquired as well the environmental parameters include the solar intensity and ambient temperature 2 experimental methodology 2 1 solar still description the solar still under study is fabricated with cheap 4 mm thick glass the desalination system consists of a basin painted black inside with different absorbers i e gravel black polyethylene film and sand as sensible heat storage materials to ensure maximum absorption of solar irradiance the basin area is 0 50 m 0 50 m 0 25 m2 it is enclosed by a 4 mm thick glass top cover the side and bottom walls of the basin are covered by an insulation material such as a 4 cm polystyrene layer in order to prevent convective heat losses the assembly reposes in a 16 mm thick wooden box the entire solar still is kept along the north south direction in order to take in maximum solar radiation at 10 inclination relative to the horizontal as shown in the figure below fig 1 with the aim of increasing the solar still yield different local materials such as gravel black polyethylene film and sand were used as heat storage materials the experiments were carried out to determine whether the output of the solar still can be ameliorated by improving the performance of its absorber using the following materials a black polyethylene film about 2 mm thick placed inside the still a layer of sand washed with distilled water about 1 cm thick and mass 4 kg put in the still tray a layer of gravel washed with distilled water about 1 cm thick and mass 3 kg laid in the still the experiments were conducted during a three day period under the same meteorological conditions in the region of adrar in algeria with a small variation in the solar intensity and ambient temperature throughout that period fig 2 shows the photograph view of the different absorbers used in the glass solar still the distiller was fed in brackish water by means of a galvanized steel tank of 10 l capacity the distillate water was collected in the distillate collector at the end of the roof silicone was employed to ensure good sealing between the different constituents of the distiller fig 3 shows a schematic drawing of the solar still under consideration 2 2 experimental setup and procedure the experiments were conducted between 7 00 a m and 7 00 p m with a time interval of 30 60 min measurement intervals during the month of june of the year 2017 in adrar a city located in southwestern algeria its geographical coordinates are 27 53 north and 0 16 west the experimental system was oriented along the north south direction to receive maximum solar radiation during the test days the temperatures of the main components of the still namely water and glass cover were measured by calibrated k type thermocouples the k z cmp21 type pyranometer was used to measure the global horizontal solar radiation in w m2 the ambient temperature ta in c was measured with a campbell cs215 temperature probe these data were collected from the enermena meteorological network station at the renewable energy research unit in the saharan environment urerms in adrar a calibrated beaker with graduations ranging from 0 to 1000 ml with 10 ml accuracy was employed for measuring the quantity of fresh water the water depth in the solar distiller was fixed at 1 5

physical and chemical analysis results of groundwater before and after distillation are summarized in table 1 3 results and discussion the characteristics of the measured solar irradiance versus time are shown in fig 4 this figure clearly suggests that the solar intensity increases during the morning and reaches a maximum value of 1131 013 w m2 at 01 00 p m during the month of june it also shows that solar irradiation is more intense from 11 a m to 3 p m whereas it is less intense after 5 p m fig 5 illustrates the variation of the ambient temperature over time it is clearly seen that the temperatures increase during the morning hours to reach a maximum value of 42 47 c at 01 00 p m the variation of the temperature depends on the variation of the solar irradiation after 2 00 p m the ambient temperature gradually decreases along with the solar energy intensity it can easily be noticed that the temperature remains high even after 07 00 p m which favors condensation even after 20 00

polyethylene absorbers were used as compared to that of sand it can also be seen that gravel is the best absorber and gives the highest productivity maximum distillate output of 5000 ml m2 day as compared with the other absorbers fig 7 displays the distribution of hourly distillate productivity for the different absorbers used in the still basin during the experimental day note that the production rate was not uniform throughout the experiment the productivity of solar still was maximal at 01 00 p m it is obviously inferred that the hourly solar still productivity with gravel is higher than that obtained with sand and polyethylene fig 8 depicts the experimental results of the hourly variation of basin water temperature for different absorbers used in the basin of the solar still it turned out that gravel could attain the highest basin water temperature value 82 2 c at 2 00 p m it is followed by polyethylene for which the basin water temperature was found equal to 79 9 c at 2 00 p m as for sand the maximum water temperature was 69 3 c at about 2 00 p m fig 9 shows the evolution of glass temperature with different absorbers used in the solar still basin it can easily be observed that the cover glass temperature when using polyethylene is higher than that recorded with gravel or sand this can certainly be attributed to the radiation reflected towards the glass

are shown in table 1 these findings suggest that the distilled water is safe to drink and complies with the world health organization who standards and guidelines who world health organisation 2011 it is worth pointing out that the water obtained from the solar still is very poor in mineral salts and therefore two volumes of distilled water are to be mixed with one volume of brackish water in order to obtain three volumes of useable fresh water this would give an additional volume of 912 5 l m2 year 3 2 cost estimation of solar still solar stills for rural communities in remote areas must be

12203,limited resources and increased water demand associated with fast socio economic development and expansion in the irrigated land in southern algeria have led to overexploitation of groundwater and caused a significant water table drawdown as well as groundwater quality degradation due to saline water intrusion solar distillation is an interesting alternative source for producing drinking water from brackish water for the purpose of supplying isolated communities in remote areas the present seeks to improve the performance of a glass solar still through increasing the productivity of freshwater by the use of different new absorbers such as gravel polyethylene and sand as heat storage systems the solar distiller under study was fabricated with cheap glass and healthy materials and was tested under the climatic conditions of the city of adrar in the southern part of algeria where solar energy and underground saline water are abundant the experimental results show that gravel produces the highest quantity of fresh water i e 5 l per m2 per day followed by black polyethylene with 4 48 l m2 d and then sand with 3 84 l m2 d it is interesting to note that the daily freshwater productivities of gravel and black polyethylene are respectively 32 20 and 16 67 higher than that of sand in addition it was found that gravel is the best absorber and has the highest productivity as compared to the other absorbers the solar radiation intensity is quite high the maximum value was found equal to 1131 013 w m2 moreover the quality of water is reflected in its total dissolved salts tds level which is of the order of 21 247 mg l from feed water with a tds content of about 3062 60 mg l hence the efficiency of the solar still is approximately 99 30 graphical abstract image 1

this substance human life would not be possible without potable or fresh drinking water hansen and murugavel 2017 indeed fresh water remains a pressing concern throughout the entire world today the provision of clean water to meet the growing water demands for agriculture industry and households is becoming increasingly difficult for a large number of countries over the last few years the problem of freshwater scarcity has become one of the main challenges all over the world potable water is an indispensable element for life water in general is widely employed in industry and agriculture though more than 70 of the earth surface is covered with water only 1 of that amount can directly be used by human beings and other living organisms on the other hand it is worth knowing that about 97 5 of water on our planet earth is salt water part of which can be treated and converted to distilled water rahbar and esfahani 2012 kabeel 2009 algeria is one of the countries most affected by freshwater shortage since the year 2007 this problem has been partly solved in the northern part of the country through the installation of several seawater desalination units however the southern region where water scarcity is becoming increasingly critical is still suffering from the shortage of that substance this is particularly experienced in the arid zones the city of adrar is located in southwestern algeria the last few years have witnessed a rapid increase in its population and a remarkable expansion of its irrigated land and industrial development this situation has led to overexploitation of groundwater and consequently caused a huge water table drawdown in addition groundwater quality degradation has become a serious issue in this region as water salinity is growing nowadays modern technology offers some sophisticated techniques such as ion exchange reverse osmosis and electrodialysis for water purification unfortunately these techniques are generally costly and require a lot of energy consumption solar desalination technology can be used to produce fresh water from brackish water for the purpose of supplying isolated sparse low density populated areas in the algerian sahara where solar energy and underground saline water are abundant sellami et al 2017 solar stills are cheap and necessitate low maintenance costs but can produce only small amounts of fresh water duffie jone and beckman william 2013 solar distillation of brackish water is a practical and interesting option that can offer life to those regions where the lack of fresh water hinders development in the algerian arid zones people have always relied on underground water reservoirs for their fresh water needs however the quality of water from such sources is not always good due to the presence of salt boukar and harmim 2005 the algerian territory is a particularly sunny area especially its sahara desert which is considered as the region most exposed to the sun in the world nasri et al 1968 this territory may benefit from between 2500 and 4000 h of sunshine per year the city of adrar enjoys a substantial amount of solar radiation with long sunshine hours high ambient temperature and high solar radiation intensity 7 kwh m2 day benatiallah et al 1968 solar energy is abundant renewable pollution free and available on site solar stills are the simplest solar distillation units they are cheap and need low maintenance but most of them suffer from low productivity and poor efficiency kaushal 2010 water resources in the southwestern part of algeria are limited and groundwater is sometimes the only source of fresh water available for the inhabitants of the region in the algerian sahara drinking water is mainly supplied by groundwater reservoirs from the aquifers of the terminal complex and continental intercalary albian water which are located in the western part of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas better known under the acronym sass for its french name système aquifer du sahara septentrional sass sekkoumet al ning 2012 the freshwater supplies in these regions come essentially from the groundwater of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas this huge aquifer which is shared by algeria libya and tunisia contains considerable but partly renewable water resources the north western sahara aquifer system extends over a vast area of more than one million km2 with seven hundred thousand 700 000 km2 in algeria eighty thousand 80 000 km2 in tunisia and two hundred and fifty thousand 250 000 km2 in libya this aquifer consists of a complex superposition of layers with the two main ones located in two different geological formations namely the continental intercalary ci or albian and the terminal complex tc the exploitation of this system dates back to several years this was done first through the direct exploitation of the water sources and then through the construction of surface wells and foggaras depending on the structural contexts and later through deep drills which sometimes exceeded one thousand 1000 meters of depth in some cases observatoire du sahel et sahra oss 2014 the intensive use of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas by the three countries 8800 water points drillings wells sources and foggaras has caused growing stress on that precious resource thus increasing the risks of saltwater intrusion and salinization loss of artesian pressure depletion of natural outlets and lowering of the water table the nwsas zone covers different eco regions ranging from desert areas with an annual rainfall rate lower than 100 mm and an evapotranspiration rate higher than 3000 mm to arid areas with an annual rainfall between 100 and 200 mm and an evapotranspiration rate between 2000 and 2500 mm cedare 2014 during the second half of the 20th century the use of groundwater from the nwsa system increased considerably which resulted in a significant increase in water demand that went from 0 6 to 2 5 billion m3 year in the three neighbor countries oss 2008 the evolution of intense water withdrawal from the aquifers of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas has exposed the entire region to major risks such as strong inter country interference disappearance of artesian water drying up of natural outlets foggaras increased depth to water due to excessive pumping and water salinization 5 2 g l oss 2003 numerous efforts have been made by researchers around the world to enhance the productivity of passive solar stills whose performance could be improved by achieving the adequate modifications in the still design and selecting the most suitable operating parameters voropoulos et al 2004 ahsan et al 2014 note that the external cooling of the glass cover was used for the purpose of increasing the solar still productivity similarly several authors suggested a thin film of water flowing over the external glass cover arunkumaret al 2012 on the other hand harris samuel et al harris samuel et al 2016 made an attempt to improve the thermal efficiency of a solar still using encapsulated salt as a thermal energy storage material the results obtained showed that if the surface area of water in the basin is increased while using salt as a heat storage material then the fresh water productivity can be enhanced it may be up to 133 higher than that obtained with a conventional basin type solar still in addition the study revealed that using salt and sand as heat storage materials during night time allowed achieving yields equal to 0 5 kg m2 and 0 3 kg m2 respectively similarly rajaseenivasan et al 2016 carried out a theoretical and experimental study on the performance of a glass basin solar still equipped with an integrated preheated water supply they found out that the presence of charcoal in fins allowed augmenting the total distillate output of the system up to 3 61 kg day moreover elango and murugavel 2015 presented a new approach to enhance the solar still productivity by introducing glass as the basin material single and double basin double slope solar stills with identical basin area were fabricated using glass it turned out that the single basin solar still productivity is more than the productivity of a double basin solar still during the hot period kabeel et al 2018 succeeded in improving the fresh water productivity and thermal performance of a conventional basin type solar still using a sensible heat storage material fixed on jute cloth wrapped over the entire surface of the basin with different masses of water the results obtained suggest that the production of fresh water depends on a number of parameters such the mass of sensible energy material and the depth of water in the basin the quantities of fresh water produced by the solar still when using the smallest amount of salt water mw 20 kg with and without jute cloth fixed on sensible heat storage material were found equal to 5 9 and 5 kg m2 respectively phadatare and verma 2007 conducted an experimental study on the performance of a single slope single plastic basin solar still the sidewalls of the still were made up of 3 mm thick black acrylic sheets and insulated with 2 5 cm thick glass wool with 2 cm depth of water in the distiller the maximum distillate production of the still was 2 1 l m2 day phase change materials pcms also called latent heat storage materials may also be used for thermal energy storage building heating and cooling applications hansen and murugavel 2017 the latent heat storage technique provides much higher energy storage density with a small temperature difference between storing and releasing heat these materials are quite advantageous for their low cost high energy storage density and isothermal operating characteristics phase change materials may be employed for the production of distilled water using solar energy they are used as a bridge to cross the difference between the energy source and the distillation unit gugulothu et al 2015 to do this sellami et al 2017 carried out an experimental work on the performance of a solar still using an additional inner heat storage system while covering the absorber surface with some blackened sponge layers the result obtained showed that a 0 5 cm thick sponge layer increases the yield by 58 however a 1 0 cm thick sponge layer resulted in a yield improvement of only 23 03 ouar et al 2017 investigated the effect of using a 0 5 cm thick layer of bitumen 100 g of charcoal and 10 drops of black chinese ink per liter of brackish water on the performance of the solar still under the local climatic conditions of the city of ouargla in algeria they reached the conclusion that bitumen charcoal and black ink can improve the water distillate output by 25 35 18 42 and 6 87 respectively as compared with a conventional solar still for their part kabbel and abdelgaied kabeel and abdelgaied 2016 inquired experimentally the effect of adding paraffin wax as a phase change material pcm for storing energy in order to enhance the performance of a solar still through the increase in freshwater production they found out that the daily freshwater productivity of a solar still with a phase change material pcm was 67 18 higher than that obtained with a conventional solar still furthermore the solar still integrated with a pcm is more interesting in terms of daily freshwater production with 67 68 8 improvement as compared to a conventional solar still similarly el sebaii et al 2009 developed a mathematical model for a single basin solar still with and without phase change material pcm placed under the basin liner of the still the solar still performance was investigated by computer simulation the numerical calculations were carried out using stearic acid as a phase change material the effect of the pcm mass on the daytime and nighttime productivity and efficiency of the still for different masses of basin water was also investigated the findings indicated that the daytime productivity decreased when the pcm mass increased but the overnight productivity and daily productivity significantly increased when the pcm mass rose this may be attributed to the greater amount of heat stored within the pcm sellami et al 2016 investigated experimentally the effect of using equal masses of portland cement and alluvial sand for the purpose of improving the yield of a conventional solar still they achieved a productivity gain of 39 70 by adding 300 g of the cement this gain was approximately equal to 31 61 when a mass of 200 g of the mixture was employed moreover they found out that the addition of 100 g of cement increases the yield by 25 49 however a cement layer of 400 g enhanced the yield by only 33 08 for their part dashtban and tabrizi 2011 carried out an experimental analysis on a weir type cascade solar still integrated with a latent heat thermal energy storage system this solar still was designed with the view of enhancing its productivity by placing an 18 kg and 2 cm thick layer of paraffin wax beneath the absorber plate for keeping the operating temperature of the still high enough to produce distillated water in the absence of sunlight particularly at night in addition they developed a theoretical model for the solar still with and without pcm and then they compared the results obtained with the experimental ones they concluded that the daily solar still productivity was theoretically equal to 6 7 and 5 1 kg m2 day with and without pcm respectively these findings allowed concluding that the productivity of the still with pcm was theoretically 31 higher than that without pcm also a phase change material pcm was added to a concentrator coupled hemispherical basin solar still in order to augment its efficiency and improve its distillate yield two modes of operation were investigated experimentally by arunkumar et al 2013 the first one concerned a single slope solar still without the phase change material and the second involved a single slope solar still with the pcm the experimental results indicated that when the thermal storage material was integrated into the concentrator coupled hemispherical basin solar still the productivity was increased by 26 therefore it may be concluded that productivity is significantly higher as a result of integrating the pcm into the solar still on the other hand srivastava and agrawal 2013 investigated experimentally the effect of placing porous fins into the basin of a conventional solar still supplied with black wick material the results obtained show that the temperature of water is about 25 smaller than that of the conventional distiller also the productivity yield in summer and winter was 30 and 45 higher respectively in addition an increase in fresh water yield of about 22 2 was observed when the depth of water decreased from 0 04 to 0 03 m the present article aims at assessing the performance of a single basin solar still using healthy materials that are locally available it also makes an attempt to ensure a good quality of distilled water production without any contamination by iron derivatives this system was entirely fabricated with cheap locally available glass the experiments were conducted in order to study the effect of sand polyethylene and gravel as sensible heat storage materials for the purpose of increasing the absorbency of the basin and consequently enhancing the freshwater productivity of the solar still moreover the effect of different environmental and operational parameters on the still productivity was inquired as well the environmental parameters include the solar intensity and ambient temperature 2 experimental methodology 2 1 solar still description the solar still under study is fabricated with cheap 4 mm thick glass the desalination system consists of a basin painted black inside with different absorbers i e gravel black polyethylene film and sand as sensible heat storage materials to ensure maximum absorption of solar irradiance the basin area is 0 50 m 0 50 m 0 25 m2 it is enclosed by a 4 mm thick glass top cover the side and bottom walls of the basin are covered by an insulation material such as a 4 cm polystyrene layer in order to prevent convective heat losses the assembly reposes in a 16 mm thick wooden box the entire solar still is kept along the north south direction in order to take in maximum solar radiation at 10 inclination relative to the horizontal as shown in the figure below fig 1 with the aim of increasing the solar still yield different local materials such as gravel black polyethylene film and sand were used as heat storage materials the experiments were carried out to determine whether the output of the solar still can be ameliorated by improving the performance of its absorber using the following materials a black polyethylene film about 2 mm thick placed inside the still a layer of sand washed with distilled water about 1 cm thick and mass 4 kg put in the still tray a layer of gravel washed with distilled water about 1 cm thick and mass 3 kg laid in the still the experiments were conducted during a three day period under the same meteorological conditions in the region of adrar in algeria with a small variation in the solar intensity and ambient temperature throughout that period fig 2 shows the photograph view of the different absorbers used in the glass solar still the distiller was fed in brackish water by means of a galvanized steel tank of 10 l capacity the distillate water was collected in the distillate collector at the end of the roof silicone was employed to ensure good sealing between the different constituents of the distiller fig 3 shows a schematic drawing of the solar still under consideration 2 2 experimental setup and procedure the experiments were conducted between 7 00 a m and 7 00 p m with a time interval of 30 60 min measurement intervals during the month of june of the year 2017 in adrar a city located in southwestern algeria its geographical coordinates are 27 53 north and 0 16 west the experimental system was oriented along the north south direction to receive maximum solar radiation during the test days the temperatures of the main components of the still namely water and glass cover were measured by calibrated k type thermocouples the k z cmp21 type pyranometer was used to measure the global horizontal solar radiation in w m2 the ambient temperature ta in c was measured with a campbell cs215 temperature probe these data were collected from the enermena meteorological network station at the renewable energy research unit in the saharan environment urerms in adrar a calibrated beaker with graduations ranging from 0 to 1000 ml with 10 ml accuracy was employed for measuring the quantity of fresh water the water depth in the solar distiller was fixed at 1 5 cm the conductivity and ph values were measured in situ using a wtw 31 5i conductivity meter and a wtw 31 5i ph meter the other physicochemical parameters such as the total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as well as chloride cl sulfate so 4 2 and nitrate no 3 contents were evaluated at the laboratory of the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh located in the city of adrar the physical and chemical analysis results of groundwater before and after distillation are summarized in table 1 3 results and discussion the characteristics of the measured solar irradiance versus time are shown in fig 4 this figure clearly suggests that the solar intensity increases during the morning and reaches a maximum value of 1131 013 w m2 at 01 00 p m during the month of june it also shows that solar irradiation is more intense from 11 a m to 3 p m whereas it is less intense after 5 p m fig 5 illustrates the variation of the ambient temperature over time it is clearly seen that the

found equal to 3 84 4 48 and 5 l m2 day for sand polyethylene and gravel respectively the accumulated water productivity of the solar still was increased by 30 20 and 16 67 when gravel and polyethylene absorbers were used as compared to that of sand it can also be seen that gravel is the best absorber and gives the highest productivity maximum distillate output of 5000 ml m2 day as compared with the other absorbers fig 7 displays the distribution of hourly distillate productivity for the different absorbers used in the still basin during the experimental day note that the

ammonium persulfate nh4s2o3 from merck germany hydrochloric acid hcl 35 stannic chloride sncl4 and orthophosphoric acid h3po4 85 from qualigens india ltd analytical grade chemicals were used as received 2 2 synthesis of pani tp for the synthesis of the composite firstly solutions of 5 c6h5nh2 0 1m sncl4 and 0 1m nh4s2o3 were prepared in 1m hcl 50 ml of 0 1m orthophosphoric acid solution was prepared in demineralised water dmw for preparing polyaniline equal volume of 5 c6h5nh2 and 0 1 m nh4s2o3 100 ml each were mixed together with constant stirring the mixture was kept for 30 min at temperature below 10 c for obtaining green coloured polyaniline gel for preparing sn iv phosphate precipitate 150 ml of 0 1m sncl4 solution was added in 50 ml of orthophosphoric acid solution and ph of the mixtures was adjusted to 1 the organic phase i e gel of polyaniline was added to sn iv phosphate precipitate inorganic phase and mixture was mixed well with constant stirring the green coloured gel thus obtained was left for digestion for 24 h and then filtered by suction the excess acid from the gel was removed by washing with dmw and dried in an air oven at 50 c the nanocomposite thus formed was crushed to fine powder for its subsequent use in adsorption studies 2 3 characterization of pani tp the physical morphology of the composite was determined using scanning electron microscopic sem technique jsm 6 510 lv jeol japan elemental constituents were evaluated by energy dispersive x ray edx spectrometer inca x sight the particle size of pani tp was determined using transmission electron microscope tem tem jem 2 100 jeol japan surface area of pani tp was determined by n2 adsorption desorption employing brunauer emmett teller bet method using quanta chrome nova 1 000 analyzer the composite was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir perkin elmer 1 730 usa for determining functional groups of the material 2 4 batch adsorption studies the adsorption studies were carried out employing batch mode using adsorbent dose of 10 g l 1 in 10 ml of metal solution throughout the experiments process variables selected in the present study included solution s ph dose of pani tp contact time and cu ii concentration for studying the influence of contact time and initial cu ii concentration mixture of metal solution and pani tp was shaken for different time interval with metal concentration ranging from 20 to 100 mg l 1 the solutions were then centrifuged at 800 rpm and the liquid thus separated out supernatant liquid was subjected to analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas the percent adsorption and adsorption capacity for cu ii were determined as follows 1 a d s o r p t i o n c o c e c o 100 2 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q e c o c e m v influence of ph was evaluated by varying solution s ph from 2 to 10 through the addition of 0 1n hcl and naoh solution after adjusting the ph solutions were treated with adsorbent dose of 10 g l 1 and left to attain equilibrium the solution was then analysed by aas for final cu ii concentration an adsorbent dose effect was investigated by varying adsorbent dose from 5 to 50 g l 1 keeping the volume of metal solution to a constant level adsorption experiments were also conducted at varying temperature 30 50 c for studying different isotherm models the thermodynamic study was also conducted for determining the spontaneity and enthalpy change of the adsorption process 2 5 leaching experiment in order to investigate the leaching of sn iv from pani tp in hcl solution 0 1 g of composite material was treated with 10 ml hcl solution of varying concentration 0 01 1n for 24 h the mixture was then centrifuged and supernatant liquid was analysed for sn iv concentration by aas 2 6 breakthrough experiment the breakthrough experiment was conducted in glass column having internal diameter 0 6 cm 0 1 g of adsorbent was transferred into the column packed with glass wool metal solution of 50 mg l 1 initial concentration co was allowed to flow down the column with flowing speed of 1 ml min 1 the effluent was first collected in fractions of 10 ml up to 100 ml and 50 ml fractions upto the remaining volume each fraction was analysed for final cu ii concentration ce by aas ce co was plotted against the volume of effluent for obtaining a breakthrough curve 2 7 desorption study desorption of cu ii which is being adsorbed by the adsorbent in breakthrough experiment was carried out using 0 1n hydrochloride solution as desorbing eluent the column was rinsed thoroughly with demineralised water dmw to wash off unadsorbed cu ii and then desorbing eluent percolate through the column at a speed of 1 ml min 1 withdrawn effluent was collected and analysed by aas for cu ii concentration in the effluent 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of different metal ions by pani tp the adsorption efficiency of pani tp composite towards different heavy metal ions was checked employing single metal ion solution having concentration 50 mg l 1 for each metal system percent adsorption of metal ions followed the order as depicted in fig 1 it is evident from the figure that cu ii was adsorbed to the highest extent higher adsorption affinity exhibited by pani tp towards cu ii than the other tested metals may be explained on the basis of outer shell electronic configuration of metal ions the outer electronic configuration of metal ions are cu ii 3d9 pb ii 5d10 6s2 ni ii 3d8 cd ii 4d10 and cr vi 3d0 we know that completely filled and half filled orbitals are much stable than partially filled orbitals and hence less reactive cu ii and ni ii have partially filled d orbitals and hence exhibited more reactivity for the adsorption sites than the other metal ions however cu ii was adsorbed to the highest extent which might be due to the fact that cu ii need only one electron to completely filled its d orbital and hence cu ii was readily attracted and adsorbed by pani tp fulfilling its electron deficiency making stable complex with the adsorbent 3 2 characterization of pani tp composite physical surface morphology and elemental constituent of the composite material was investigated by sem and edx analysis fig 2 fig 2a depicts sem micrograph with edx spectra of pani tp before adsorption the surface of the composite material appeared to be coarse with irregular structures dispersed throughout the surface the corresponding edx spectra revealed c o sn and p as the major constituent of the composite material presence of sn and p in the structure indicated successful formation of pani tp composite table 1 sem micrograph of the composite after cu ii adsorption showed increased surface density with white patches appearing all over the surface which might be due to the cu ii loading the corresponding edx spectra showed cu ii peak indicating successful adsorption of cu ii on to the surface of the composite tem image fig 3 of the composite indicated well dispersed distribution of pani tp matrix with average particle size of 23 40 nm suggesting successful formation of nanocomposite the specific surface area of pani tp as calculated by bet method was found to be 32 m2 g 1 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of composite material was also recorded and is shown in fig 4 according to the iupac classification the isotherm belong to type iv li et al 2011 indicating surface structure to be mesoporous a rapid elevation in volume of nitrogen adsorbed at a high relative pressure and a hysteresis loop as found in the present case fig 4 are characteristics of mesoporous materials wang et al 2010 the ftir spectra of pani tp before and after cu ii adsorption are shown in fig 5 in ftir spectra of pani tp before adsorption fig 5a a short peak appearing at 3265 cm 1 was aroused due to n h stretching of the aromatic ring a sharp and intense absorption peak in the region 1509 1583 cm 1 was associated with nitrogen quinine kumar et al 2017 absorption peak appearing at 1297 cm 1 and in the region 1174 1042 cm 1 was aroused as a consequence of stretching vibrations of c n and c n group a strong peak at 469 cm 1 appeared due to c h of the pani ring bhaumik et al 2013 after cu ii adsorption fig 5b peak at 1174 cm 1 disappeared after indicating interaction of cu ii with nitrogen as the peak at 1174 cm 1 corresponds to c n group moreover the intensities of all the absorption peaks reduced significantly which might be due to the cu ii loading on pani tp surface 3 3 initial metal concentration and contact time effect adsorption of cu ii onto pani tp at varying initial metal concentration 20 100 mg l 1 was conducted at time intervals ranging from 5 to 380 min fig 6 the value of qe increased as cu ii concentration increased from 20 to 100 mg l 1 which was due to the enhanced concentration gradient maximum cu ii uptake at equilibrium were 1 99 4 86 7 61 and 9 25 mg g 1 at 20 50 80 and 100 mg l 1 initial cu ii concentrations respectively the required contact time for reaching equilibrium was concentration dependent the phenomena occurred due to the reason that for lesser metal ions there were sufficient vacant sites for adsorbing them rapidly while vacant sites fell short when cu ii concentration increased thus adsorption occurred via internal pore diffusion which is a slower step at higher concentration mittal et al 2015 the equilibrium time was 20 min for cu ii concentration 20 mg l 1 it was 30 min for 50 mg l 1 and for concentration 80 100 mg l 1 equilibrium time was found to be 120 min 3 4 ph effect study of ph effect is an important aspect as it greatly influences adsorption phenomena by changing surface charge and ionic species of metal the ph of the metal solution was varied from 1 to 10 the adsorption of cu ii increased as initial ph value phi of the metal solution increased reaching its highest value at ph 6 fig 7 at phi 1 cu2 uptake 18 was inhibited due to higher h concentration masking the adsorbent surface and repelling cu2 ions the final ph phf value remained the same at phi 1 at phi 2 phf slightly increased to 3 9 and cu ii adsorption increased to 38 however when phi was set to 4 phf sharply increased to 6 9 and cu ii uptake increased to 87 increase in cu ii uptake at higher ph occurred as a result of lesser h ions in the solution and elevation in phf value might have occurred as a consequence of h adsorption together with cu2 the percent adsorption of cu ii continued to increase 98 up to ph 6 and then become almost constant above ph 6 the effect of electrolyte on cu ii adsorption by pani tp was investigated using 0 1n kno3 solution it is evident from fig 6 that electrolyte has a negligible effect on cu ii adsorption 3 5 adsorbent dose effect the study of pani tp dosage influence on cu ii adsorption indicated increase in adsorption and a decrease in qe value of cu ii fig 8 the increase in adsorption with increasing dose was simply due to increase in adsorption sites however the amount of cu ii adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent decreased this was due to the reason that as adsorbent dose increased active sites responsible for adsorption remain unoccupied as the concentration of metal ions remained constant while active sites keep on increasing thus the availability of excessive active sites which remained unsaturated caused adsorption capacity to decrease semerjian 2010 3 6 isotherm study isotherm study is helpful in developing an idea about the distribution of adsorbate metal ion between liquid phase metal solution and solid phase adsorbent manzoor et al 2013 the equilibrium isotherm data were fitted in two different isotherm models as discussed below non linear curve fitting tool of origin software version 9 1 was utilized for the analysis of experimental data fig 9 3 6 1 langmuir isotherm model the model describes adsorption of solute particles on homogeneous surface forming a single layer the model assumes uniform distribution of adsorption sites with no transmigration of adsorbed particles oliveira et al 2008 the model can be represented in its mathematical form as 3 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where qm mg g 1 represents maximum monolayer adsorption capacity the constant b l g 1 indicated adsorption energy reflecting how strong the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent is the model s parameters are tabulated in table 2 it is evident from the table that qm increased with temperature indicating endothermic nature of the process high r2 0 999 and the lower χ2 value indicated the better applicability of langmuir model 3 6 2 freundlich isotherm model freundlich isotherm model assumes that the ratio of solute particles adsorbed and that remaining in the solution changes as the concentration changed the model typically describes adsorption process to be occurring on the heterogeneous surface mathematical representation of the model is as follows 4 q e k f c e 1 n where kf mg g 1 l mg 1 and n are model constant each representing adsorption capacity and adsorption affinity and are listed in table 2 it is evident from the table that kf increases with temperature supporting the result obtained from langmuir model 3 7 thermodynamics study temperature influencing the adsorption process was ascertained by carrying thermodynamic study in the temperature range of 30 50 c various parameters of a thermodynamic study indicating spontaneity and energy of the adsorption process includes standard enthalpy change δho gibbs free energy change δgo and standard entropy change δso these parameters can be obtained from the following mathematical relations 5 log k c δ s o 2 303 r δ h o 2 303 r t 6 δ g o r t ln k c where kc r j mol 1k 1 and t k are equilibrium constant gas constant and temperature respectively the equilibrium constant kc was obtained as 7 k c c a c c e where cac is cu ii concentration on pani tp surface and ce is the amount of cu ii that remained in the solution after adsorption the parameters δho and δso for the process were obtained from the slope and the intercept of log kc versus 1 t plot figure not shown by employing equation 5 the positive value of δho and negative δgo values at all the studied temperature suggested endothermic and spontaneous nature of the process the spontaneity increased with increasing temperature as indicated by increasing δgo value a small but positive δso value suggested increased randomness at solid liquid interface table 3 3 8 kinetics study various kinetic models are reported in the literature for describing metal adsorption rate from wastewater the adsorption mechanism generally involves a chemical reaction between metal ions and adsorbent functional groups in addition other mechanisms such as pore diffusion liquid film etc may also be involved ho and mckay 2002 to investigate the exact mechanism controlling cu ii uptake rate the experimental data were evaluated using following kinetic models 3 8 1 pseudo first order kinetic model the model assumes that the change in rate of solute uptake is directly related to the difference in saturation concentration zhao et al 2014 linearly the model is expressed as 8 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where k1 min 1 is model s rate constant the values of qe cal and k1 were obtained from the intercept and slope of the linear plots of log qe qt versus t figure not shown and are listed in table 4 adsorption capacity as obtained from the model qe cal differed appreciably from that obtained experimentally qe exp moreover the experimental data points deviate from straight line figure not shown these observations suggested nonapplicability of the model for cu ii adsorption onto pani tp 3 8 2 pseudo second order kinetic model according to the model the rate controlling step in adsorption process is chemical reaction involving exchange or sharing of electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent rao and khatoon 2017 the linear form of the model is expressed as t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2 g mg 1min 1 is model s rate constant the intercept and slope of the linear plots of t qt versus t gave the value of qe cal and k2 which are listed in table 4 it is evident from the table that qe cal and qe exp are in good agreement in addition the experimental data points lie exactly on linear plots at all the studied concentrations fig 10 a it can therefore be concluded that the model is well obeyed suggesting chemisorption to be rate determining step in the present process 3 8 3 intra particle diffusion model the model was employed for determining the type of diffusion involved in the process mathematically the model can be represented as q e k i d t 1 2 i where kid mg g 1 min 1 is model s rate constant and i is another constant of the model indicating the boundary layer effect the values of various parameters along with r2 values are listed in table 4 high r2 values at all concentrations indicated the better applicability of the model the plots of qe versus t1 2 at various cu ii concentration deviated from the origin fig 10b this deviation indicated that adsorption rate is not governed by intra particle diffusion only but other type of diffusion like film or pore diffusion might also be involved ghodbana and hamdaoui 2008 3 9 leaching experiment the result obtained from leaching experiment indicated that pani tp is quite stable in hcl solution from the experiment it was found that at concentrations less than 0 6n no or only a negligible amount of sn iv was leached out in the hcl solution appreciable amount of sn iv appeared only at and above concentration 0 6n table 5 thus it can be concluded that hcl solution can be safely used as desorbing eluent for desorbing cu ii from pani tp up to concentration 0 4n 3 10 breakthrough study breakthrough study in the adsorption process is important as it is directly related to the feasibility of process design gupta et al 2001 for obtaining the breakthrough curve ce co ratio were plotted against effluent volume ml fig 11 a the point at which cu ii started appearing in the effluent was taken as breakthrough point in the present case the curve indicated that metal ion started appearing in the effluent after passing 100 ml of cu ii solution the breakthrough and exhaustive capacities as obtained from the breakthrough curve were 50 and 100 mg g 1 3 11 desorption study desorption of the spent pani tp obtained from breakthrough experiment was conducted utilizing 0 1n hydrochloride solution as desorbing eluent during breakthrough experiment a total of 9 7 mg of cu ii was retained upon passing 500 ml cu ii solution upon passing 100 ml of desorbing eluent 9 3 mg of cu ii was recovered giving 95 desorption within 80 ml of the effluent fig 11b 3 12 mechanism for cu ii binding on pani tp polyaniline tin phosphate contains nitrogen atom attached with polyaniline ring imparting high chemical reactivity to the composite material nitrogen atom having lone pair of electron can be effectively act as a binding site to form a metal complex thus cu ii belonging to transition metal group can easily form coordination bond with lone pair of electron using its vacant d orbital ghorbani and eisazadeh 2013 moreover ftir spectra of pani tp after adsorption of cu ii showed changes around peak corresponding to c n group indicating involvement of nitrogen in cu ii adsorption in this regard a possible binding force responsible for cu ii ion adsorption onto the composite material could be coordination bond 4 conclusions a polymer based nanocomposite pani tp was successfully synthesized and characterized by different characterization tools tem analysis reveals particle size of the composite material to be in nano range the nanocomposite adsorbent showed excellent adsorption efficiency towards cu ii with maximum adsorption 98 occurring at ph 6 the kinetics of the adsorption process was fast with maximum uptake reaching within the time range of 20 120 min depending on the initial metal concentration high breakthrough and exhaustive capacities indicated the better applicability of the adsorbent in column process desorption study suggested effective reusability of the adsorbent thus making pani tp an efficient and cost effective adsorbent for cu ii abatement from aqueous media acknowledgment the authors are grateful to the university sophisticated instrumentation facility usif aligarh india for providing required characterization facilities

strong peak at 469 cm 1 appeared due to c h of the pani ring bhaumik et al 2013 after cu ii adsorption fig 5b peak at 1174 cm 1 disappeared after indicating interaction of cu ii with nitrogen as the peak at 1174 cm 1 corresponds to c n group moreover the intensities of all the absorption peaks reduced significantly which might be due to the cu ii loading on pani tp surface 3 3 initial metal concentration and contact time effect adsorption of cu ii onto pani tp at varying initial metal concentration 20 100 mg l 1 was conducted at time intervals ranging from 5 to 380 min fig 6 the value of qe increased as cu ii concentration increased from 20 to 100 mg l 1 which was due to the enhanced concentration gradient maximum cu ii uptake at equilibrium were 1 99 4 86 7 61 and 9 25 mg g 1 at 20 50 80 and 100 mg l 1 initial cu ii concentrations respectively the required contact time for reaching equilibrium was concentration dependent the phenomena occurred due to the reason that for lesser metal ions there were sufficient vacant sites for adsorbing them rapidly while vacant sites fell short when cu ii concentration increased thus adsorption occurred via internal pore diffusion which is a slower step at higher concentration mittal et al 2015 the equilibrium time was 20 min for cu ii concentration 20 mg l 1 it was 30 min for 50 mg l 1 and for concentration 80 100 mg l 1 equilibrium time was found to be 120 min 3 4 ph effect study of ph effect is an important aspect as it greatly influences adsorption phenomena by changing surface charge and ionic species of metal the ph of the metal solution was varied from 1 to 10 the adsorption of cu ii increased as initial ph value phi of the metal solution increased reaching its highest value at ph 6 fig 7 at phi 1 cu2 uptake 18 was inhibited due to higher h concentration masking the adsorbent surface and repelling cu2 ions the final ph phf value remained the same at phi 1 at phi 2 phf slightly increased to 3 9 and cu ii adsorption increased to 38 however when phi was set to 4 phf sharply increased to 6 9 and cu ii uptake increased to 87 increase in cu ii uptake at higher ph occurred as a result of lesser h ions in the solution and elevation in phf value might have occurred as a consequence of h adsorption together with cu2 the percent adsorption of cu ii continued to increase 98 up to ph 6 and then become almost constant above ph 6 the effect of electrolyte on cu ii adsorption by pani tp was investigated using 0 1n kno3 solution it is evident from fig 6 that electrolyte has a negligible effect on cu ii adsorption 3 5 adsorbent dose effect the study of pani tp dosage influence on cu ii adsorption indicated increase in adsorption and a decrease in qe value of cu ii fig 8 the increase in adsorption with increasing dose was simply due to increase in adsorption sites however the amount of cu ii adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent decreased this was due to the reason that as adsorbent dose increased active sites responsible for adsorption remain unoccupied as the concentration of metal ions remained constant while active sites keep on increasing thus the availability of excessive active sites which remained unsaturated caused adsorption capacity to decrease semerjian 2010 3 6 isotherm study isotherm study is helpful in developing an idea about the distribution of adsorbate metal ion between liquid phase metal solution and solid phase adsorbent manzoor et al 2013 the equilibrium isotherm data were fitted in two different isotherm models as discussed below non linear curve fitting tool of origin software version 9 1 was utilized for the analysis of experimental data fig 9 3 6 1 langmuir isotherm model the model describes adsorption of solute particles on homogeneous surface forming a single layer the model assumes uniform distribution of adsorption sites with no transmigration of adsorbed particles oliveira et al 2008 the model can be represented in its mathematical form as 3 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where qm mg g 1 represents maximum monolayer adsorption capacity the constant b l g 1 indicated adsorption energy reflecting how strong the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent is the model s parameters are tabulated in table 2 it is evident from the table that qm increased with temperature indicating endothermic nature of the process high r2 0 999 and the lower χ2 value indicated the better applicability of langmuir model 3 6 2 freundlich isotherm model freundlich isotherm model assumes that the ratio of solute particles adsorbed and that remaining in the solution changes as the concentration changed the model typically describes adsorption process to be occurring on the heterogeneous surface mathematical representation of the model is as follows 4 q e k f c e 1 n where kf mg g 1 l mg 1 and n are model constant each representing adsorption capacity and adsorption affinity and are listed in table 2 it is evident from the table that kf increases with temperature supporting the result obtained from langmuir model 3 7 thermodynamics study temperature influencing the adsorption process was ascertained by carrying thermodynamic study in the temperature range of 30 50 c various parameters of a thermodynamic study indicating spontaneity and energy of the adsorption process includes standard enthalpy change δho gibbs free energy change δgo and standard entropy change δso these parameters can be obtained from the following mathematical relations 5 log k c δ s o 2 303 r δ h o 2 303 r t 6 δ g o r t ln k c where kc r j mol 1k 1 and t k are equilibrium constant gas constant and temperature respectively the equilibrium constant kc was obtained as 7 k c c a c c e where cac is cu ii concentration on pani tp surface and ce is the amount of cu ii that remained in the solution after adsorption the parameters δho and δso for the process were obtained from the slope and the intercept of log kc versus 1 t plot figure not shown by employing equation 5 the positive value of δho and negative δgo values at all the studied temperature suggested endothermic and spontaneous nature of the process the spontaneity increased with increasing temperature as indicated by increasing δgo value a small but positive δso value suggested increased randomness at solid liquid interface table 3 3 8 kinetics study various kinetic models are reported in the literature for describing metal adsorption rate from wastewater the adsorption mechanism generally involves a chemical reaction between metal ions and adsorbent functional groups in addition other mechanisms such as pore diffusion liquid film etc may also be involved ho and mckay 2002 to investigate the exact mechanism controlling cu ii uptake rate the experimental data were evaluated using following kinetic models 3 8 1 pseudo first order kinetic model the model assumes that the change in rate of solute uptake is directly related to the difference in saturation concentration zhao et al 2014 linearly the model is expressed as 8 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where k1 min 1 is model s rate constant the values of qe cal and k1 were obtained from the intercept and slope of the linear plots of log qe qt versus t figure not shown and are listed in table 4 adsorption capacity as obtained from the model qe cal differed appreciably from that obtained experimentally qe exp moreover the experimental data points deviate from straight line figure not shown these observations suggested nonapplicability of the model for cu ii adsorption onto pani tp 3 8 2 pseudo second order kinetic model according to the model the rate controlling step in adsorption process is chemical reaction involving exchange or sharing of electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent rao and khatoon 2017 the linear form of the model is expressed as t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2 g mg 1min 1 is model s rate constant the intercept and slope of the linear plots of t qt versus t gave the value of qe cal and k2 which are listed in table 4 it is evident from the table that qe cal and qe exp are in good agreement in addition the experimental data points lie exactly on linear plots at all the studied concentrations fig 10 a it can therefore be concluded that the model is well obeyed suggesting chemisorption to be rate determining step in the present process 3 8 3 intra particle diffusion model the model was employed for determining the type of diffusion involved in the process mathematically the model can be represented as q e k i d t 1 2 i where kid mg g 1 min 1 is model s rate constant and i is another constant of the model indicating the boundary layer effect the values of various parameters along with r2 values are listed in table 4 high r2 values at all concentrations indicated the better applicability of the model the plots of qe versus t1 2 at various cu ii concentration deviated from the origin fig 10b this deviation indicated that adsorption rate is not governed by intra particle diffusion only but other type of diffusion like film or pore diffusion might also be involved ghodbana and hamdaoui 2008 3 9 leaching experiment the result obtained from leaching experiment indicated that pani tp is quite stable in hcl solution from the experiment it was found that at concentrations less than 0 6n no or only a negligible amount of sn iv was leached out in the hcl solution appreciable amount of sn iv appeared only at and above concentration 0 6n table 5 thus it can be concluded that hcl solution can be safely used as desorbing eluent for desorbing cu ii from pani tp up to concentration 0 4n 3 10 breakthrough study breakthrough study in the adsorption process is important as it is directly related to the feasibility of process design gupta et al 2001 for obtaining the breakthrough curve ce co ratio were plotted against effluent volume ml fig 11 a the point at which cu ii started appearing in the effluent was taken as breakthrough point in the present case the curve indicated that metal ion started appearing in the effluent after passing 100 ml of cu ii solution the breakthrough and exhaustive capacities as obtained from the breakthrough curve were 50 and 100 mg g 1 3 11 desorption study desorption of the spent pani tp obtained from breakthrough experiment was conducted utilizing 0 1n hydrochloride solution as desorbing eluent during breakthrough experiment a total of 9 7 mg of cu ii was retained upon passing 500 ml cu ii solution upon passing 100 ml of desorbing eluent 9 3 mg of cu ii was recovered giving 95 desorption within 80 ml of the effluent fig 11b 3 12 mechanism for cu ii binding on pani tp polyaniline tin phosphate contains nitrogen atom attached with polyaniline ring imparting high chemical reactivity to the composite material nitrogen atom having lone pair of electron can be effectively act as a binding site to form a metal complex thus cu ii belonging to transition metal group can easily form coordination bond with lone pair of electron using its vacant d orbital ghorbani and eisazadeh 2013 moreover ftir spectra of pani tp after adsorption of cu ii showed changes around peak corresponding to c n group indicating involvement of nitrogen in cu ii adsorption in this regard a possible binding force responsible for cu ii ion adsorption onto the composite material could be coordination bond 4 conclusions a polymer based nanocomposite pani tp was successfully synthesized and characterized by different characterization tools tem analysis reveals particle size of the composite material to be in nano range the nanocomposite adsorbent showed excellent adsorption efficiency towards cu ii with maximum adsorption 98 occurring at ph 6 the kinetics of the adsorption process was fast with maximum uptake reaching within the time range of 20 120 min depending on the initial metal concentration high breakthrough and exhaustive capacities indicated the better applicability of the adsorbent in column process desorption study suggested effective reusability of the adsorbent thus making pani tp an efficient and cost effective adsorbent for cu ii abatement
