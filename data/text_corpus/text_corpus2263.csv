11315,aerated irrigation ai is well recognized to improve yield and water use efficiency wue by improving the soil root zone environment and increasing crop water and fertilizer absorption however the effects of ai on crop yield and wue are variable we conducted a meta analysis to 1 quantify the effect of ai on crop yield and wue and 2 identify soil factors and management practices that favor increased yield and wue under ai relative to control results showed that ai is benefit to increase crop yields and wue grand mean increases of 19 3 and 17 9 respectively however its effectiveness depends on the environmental and managerial factors of the studies evaluated larger responses were found in medium textured soils acidic soils ph 7 and or crops receiving high levels of irrigation at

operation keywords aerated irrigation yield water use efficiency meta analysis 1 introduction by 2050 the global population is expected to reach 9 billion an increase of 3 billion people from 2000 bagatur 2014 this rapidly increasing population creates a huge challenge for feeding the population on decreasing arable land area and scarce water resources water is an essential substance for ensuring agricultural productivity sauer et al 2010 a report by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 suggested that water scarcity affects 4 billion people globally furthermore competition for water resources among agricultural industrial and urban consumers has become increasingly serious in order to ensure water availability and feed the growing human population it is necessary to develop novel strategies for growing crops that reduce the amount of water used while also increasing or at least maintaining yield one practice that has been proposed to increase water use efficiency wue is an irrigation strategy called aerated irrigation ai bhattarai et al 2006 abuarab et al 2013 the rhizosphere during irrigation and several hours after irrigation remains near saturated which significantly decreases air permeability and oxygen level in the root zone niu et al 2012a oxygen deficiency in the root zone has been shown to inhibit root growth reducing the ability of the root system to absorb water and resulting in drainage and leakage of higher water volumes with concomitant decreases in wue bhattarai et al 2006 niu et al 2012b however ai can transport aerated water to the root zone which has the potential to ameliorate hypoxic or anoxic conditions and promote plant water and nutrient uptake many researchers have studied the effects of ai on crops but the results are not consistent some studies indicated that ai greatly increases crop yield ranging from 20 to 150 which is very important for saving scarce water resources and maintaining higher crop yield busscher 1982 melsted et al 1949 bryce et al 1982 opposite results however have indicated that ai not only has no effect on crop yield but even delayed flowering and fruit formation bonachela et al 2010 ben noah 2012 vyrlas et al 2014 this raises the question is it necessary to conduct ai when to irrigation previous studies have reported that different ai methods have different effects on crops which may be due to factors such as crop type soil characteristics and burial depth of subsurface tubing chen et al 2011 niu et al 2013 li et al 2016a how do we then conduct ai based on experimental conditions answer this question is difficult when experiments at only one location meta analysis however is a statistical model used to analyze datapoints from separate empirical studies stanley and jarrell 1989 meta analyses have the advantage of being able to systematically account for a complex set of potential factors that may inﬂuence some dependent variable of concern and to draw conclusions from the literature smith and kaoru 1990 stanley 2001 we applied a meta analysis to systematically analyze the available information on the effect of ai on yield and wue such a comprehensive analysis may increase the quantitative understanding of ai on yield and wue and may help to improve recommendations for ai application therefore our objectives were to 1 quantify the effects of ai systems on wue

seven studies met our inclusion criteria representing eight countries and reporting 71 ai to ck yield comparisons and 57 ai to ck wue comparisons for different crop species supplementary table s1 the dataset included field experiments 70 and pot experiments 30 but no significant difference was found between the categories the majority of the studies used venturi and compressor equipment and conducted ai in subsurface drip irrigation systems overall the ai increased yield by 19 3 ci 14 4 24 6 and wue by 17 9 ci 14 7 21 3 compared to control treatment fig 1 3 2 aerated factors the aerated method aerated frequency and aerated quantity increased crop yield and wue relative to the control but with varying degrees of success venturi had the highest positive effect on crop yield 20 6 which was significantly higher than that of peroxides and compressor while compressor showed the lowest effect fig 2 a for wue venturi also showed the largest increase 19 5 but there were no significant differences among the aerated methods fig 2b the mean effect sizes were a 10 9 increase in crop yield and a 17 9 increase in wue the effect of ai on crop yield increased with increasing aerated quantity fig 2c this effect was significantly larger for the high ai 22 8 compared with the low ai 15 9 for wue although the largest effect was also observed for the high ai there were no significant differences among the categories tested fig 2d overall the ai quantity increased yield by 17 2 ci 16 3 18 2 and wue by 18 2 ci 14 7 21 7 the mean effect size of ai frequency on crop yield and wue were increased by 19 6 ci 16 23 4 and 18 0 ci 14 4 21 7 compared with the control no significant differences were found for the group ai frequency fig 2e and f 3 3 soil factors the response ratio of crop yield and wue following addition of ai was affected by soil ph fig 3 a and b the relative crop yield was significantly higher in acidic soils ph 7 than soils with ph 7 for wue although the highest effect was also found in soil with ph 7 no significant differences were found among the categories tested crop yield and wue responses to ai addition also varied with soil texture fig 3c and d overall the mean effect size for crop yield and wue was significantly higher than control treatment the effect on crop yield was lowest in fine textured soils compared with medium and coarse textured soils and no significant difference was found between the three groups for crop yield the same trend was also found for wue in terms of crop yield soil bulk density 1 35 showed a significantly higher response than soil bulk density 1 35 to the application of ai fig 3e these two soil bulk density classes also significantly influenced the effect of ai on wue fig 3f however the ai performed better with bulk density 1 35 with relative wue being 20 2 ci 18 6 21 9 compared to 10 3 ci 8 2 12 6 in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 3 4 management factors with regard to the influence of burial depth of subsurface tubing on ai performance burial depths 20 cm increased wue but not crop yield fig 4 a and b the mean effect sizes were a 10 8 increase in crop yield and a 17 1 increase in wue burial depths from 10 to 20 cm had the highest positive effect on crop yield 18 6 which was significantly higher than that of burial depth 20 cm but not than that of burial depth 10 cm fig 4a for the wue the burial depths from 10 to 20 cm also showed the largest increase 17 4 but there were no significant differences between these three groups the response ratio of crop yield and wue following addition of ai was affected by irrigation levels fig 4c and d although there was a positive response for the two groups the increase of crop yield and wue was significantly larger when ai was applied to higher irrigation levels 100 fc the application of ai increased yield and wue for all crop types compared to the control treatment fig 4e and f 3 5 analysis of publication bias for the two of the comparisons i e crop yield and wue under ai and control carried out in the present study the funnel plots obtained were asymmetrical thirty three effect sizes were estimated as missing on the right side of the grand mean for crop yield and we corrected for that with the trim and ﬁll method this correction changed the magnitude of the effect size but did not affect the significance r 1 032 ci 0 987 1 079 p 0 05 while six effect sizes were estimated as missing for wue the magnitude of the effect size did not change obviously the fail safe numbers rosenberg s nfs for the database of crop yield and wue were 20 486 and 6 797 respectively far beyond the threshold of 5 n 10 needed to consider the mean effect size robust because of this we did not consider publication bias to be a problem for our meta analysis we also suspect that statistically significant effects we identified would only be changed due to many unpublished relationships 4 discussion 4 1 general effect of ai on yield and wue our study indicated that application of ai may be considered an effective strategy to increase crop yield and wue this effect seems to be highly consistent as it was observed for most of the experimental soil environmental and management factors evaluated in the meta analysis however the efficiency of ai was also dependent on these factors 4 2 ai factors effect on yield and wue application of venturi had the highest positive effect on crop yield and wue under ai while compressor had the minimum effect fig 2a and b this effect was expected because the air injection alone generally led to larger air losses a similar result was reported by elder and benson 1999 who indicated that air was solely injected into the subsurface drip irrigation system sdi the air was emitted in the form of a vertical stream directly to the soil surface from above the emitter and aerated only a small soil volume the application of ai using a compressor may therefore increase air losses decreasing the overall effect of ai on crop yield and wue this result is opposite to that observed by busscher 1982 for pepper where higher crop yield was obtained using a compressor perhaps because the sandy substrate of the culture provided more pore spaces for natural diffusion the effect of low aerated frequency 3d was higher than in ai with high aerated frequency 3d fig 2e and f the most likely mechanism by which aeration frequency regulated the effect of ai was by affecting the degree of soil disturbance the high aerated frequency 3d probably enhanced the airflow in the soil thus increasing cavitation and other factors that have negative effects on plant roots li et al 2016b 4 3 soil factors effect on yield and wue ai yield and wue in acidic soils were higher than in soils with a ph 7 fig 3 possibly due to the following reasons first nitrogen losses in alkaline soils will most likely be higher because of ammonia volatilization carrijo et al 2017 aerobic conditions tend to experience more volatilization liu et al 2012 so reduced nitrogen absorption under ai in alkaline soils may result in lower yields second a high level of na in alkaline soil can lead to na toxicity effects in plants which is a very serious problem especially under aerobic conditions that promote the growth of the root system and the absorption of water and fertilizer by crops bhattarai et al 2005 li et al 2016c higher na concentration resulted in higher uptake abrol et al 1985 and thus tolerance to na may be lower in crops under ai a smaller effect size of ai on crop yield and wue was found for fine textured soils compared to medium and coarse textured soils fig 3 soil texture is one of the most important factors affecting soil aeration fine textured soils have small pores that become more easily anaerobic and remain that way for longer durations than coarser textured soils bollmann and conrad 1998 groffman and tiedje 1991 drew 1990 indicated that the oxygen diffusion rate in clay soils can be 30 times smaller than in sandy soils furthermore the oxygen partial pressure in the fine textured soil after ai might still be lower reducing root respiration and causing a reduction in water and mineral uptake and in crop biomass goorahoo et al 2002 also reported similar results that the benefits of oxygation in fine textured soils are less than in coarser textured soils high bulk density 1 35 showed a larger yield response to ai application than low bulk density 1 35 fig 3e high soil bulk density can result in hypoxia or anoxia in the soil due to increasing soil compaction reducing nutrient uptake and elongation of roots and inhibiting soil aeration wolkowski and lowery 2008 all of which significantly inhibit plant growth ityel et al 2014 ai significantly improved soil aeration which was generally higher in high bulk density soils 1 35 than in lower bulk density soils 1 35 as shown in fig 3f wue of ai in soils with high bulk density 1 35 is lower most likely due to increased water consumption due to the vigorous growth of plants which is much higher than the increase of yield 4 4 effect of management factors on yield and wue burial depth of subsurface tubing at 10 20 cm caused the highest ai yield and wue compared with 10 cm and 20 cm fig 4 the reason for this may be improved water use and the combination of ai with soil water and air at the root zone compared to deeper drip placement as well as a reduced risk of air emitted directly to the soil surface in shallow drip placements heuberger et al 2001 also reported that plant growth and yield did not benefit from drip tape 5 cm deep also oxygation benefits are most likely not due to deeper tape placement because the additional oxygen is made available close to the emitter and root mass among the studies included in our database wen et al 2013 reported 15 cm for tomato and chen et al 2011 reported 10 cm for cotton as a consequence the larger effect size of ai was 10 20 cm for drip tape placement depths increasing irrigation levels showed a larger positive response to ai application in terms of crop yield and wue fig 4 a similar result was also reported by yin and cai 2014 who showed that ai at an irrigation level at 125 of field capacity significantly increased tomato yield and wue this could be expected because the air pathway becomes more tortuosity at higher irrigation levels which reduces diffusion rates of soil oxygen therefore the effect of ai on improvement of soil oxygen status will have a greater impact on crop yields and wue it might be argued that at higher irrigation levels the response to ai will be less pronounced as the irrigation levels may be above the optimum so such yield and wue may not respond positively to ai applications li et al 2016a jia et al 2011 in addition only a venturi device needs to install in the first part of the pipeline to achieve ai which is a simple and easy operation the input costs of drip irrigation and venturi equipment are estimated based on five years of recycling and reuse for example the net income for wheat was 25 higher with ai than in the ck treatment table 1 ai techniques are thus easy to operate and highly economically efficient and can be widely used 5 conclusions overall the use of ai increase yield by 19 3 95 ci 14 4 24 6 and wue by 17 9 95 ci 14 7 21 3 these benefits were most pronounced in soils with a ph 7 or high volumetric water contents when ai was imposed in practical application using venturi aeration equipment with drip tape placement depth of 10 20 cm and aerated frequency greater than once every three days is recommended as the most suitable choice the main advantages of ai techniques are low cost and easy operation and thus ai technology can be widely used this study provides a quantitative analysis of the currently available literature more effort however was clearly needed for reporting experimental details if data were to be used to extrapolate findings to other locations and to further develop management guidelines aerated treatment was highly variable between studies and was often not well described especially for the ai studies details on the special aerated timing and amount are essential for understanding the results the number of studies and observations was too limited to conduct interactive analysis that may be of great importance in developing ai practices our results demonstrated that ai is a promising practice but more efforts is needed to scale the results to irrigation districts with additional constraints acknowledgments

method aerated frequency and aerated quantity increased crop yield and wue relative to the control but with varying degrees of success venturi had the highest positive effect on crop yield 20 6 which was significantly higher than that of peroxides and compressor while compressor showed the lowest effect fig 2 a for wue venturi also showed the largest increase 19 5 but there were no significant differences among the aerated methods fig 2b the mean effect sizes were a 10 9 increase in crop yield and a 17 9 increase in wue the effect of ai on crop yield increased with increasing aerated quantity fig 2c this effect was significantly larger for the high ai 22 8 compared with the low ai 15 9 for wue although the largest effect was also observed for the high ai there were no significant differences among the categories tested fig 2d overall the ai quantity increased yield by 17 2 ci 16 3 18 2 and wue by 18 2 ci 14 7 21 7 the mean effect size of ai frequency on crop yield and wue were increased by 19 6 ci 16 23 4 and 18 0 ci 14 4 21 7 compared with the control no significant differences were found for the group ai frequency fig 2e and f 3 3 soil factors the response ratio of crop yield and wue following addition of ai was affected by soil ph fig 3 a and b the relative crop yield was significantly higher in acidic soils ph 7 than soils with ph 7 for wue although the highest effect was also found in soil with ph 7 no significant differences were found among the categories tested crop yield and wue responses to ai addition also varied with soil texture fig 3c and d overall the mean effect size for crop yield and wue was significantly higher than control treatment the effect on crop yield was lowest in fine textured soils compared with medium and coarse textured soils and no significant difference was found between the three groups for crop yield the same trend was also found for wue in terms of crop yield soil bulk density 1 35 showed a significantly higher response than soil bulk density 1 35 to the application of ai fig 3e these two soil bulk density classes also significantly influenced the effect of ai on wue fig 3f however the ai performed better with bulk density 1 35 with relative wue being 20 2 ci 18 6 21 9 compared to 10 3 ci 8 2 12 6 in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 3 4 management factors with regard to the influence of burial depth of subsurface tubing on ai performance burial depths 20 cm increased wue but not crop yield fig 4 a and b the mean effect sizes were a 10 8 increase in crop yield and a 17 1 increase in wue burial depths from 10 to 20 cm had the highest positive effect on crop yield 18 6 which was significantly higher than that of burial depth 20 cm but not than that of burial depth 10 cm fig 4a for the wue the burial depths from 10 to 20 cm also showed the largest increase 17 4 but there were no significant differences between these three groups the response ratio of crop yield and wue following addition of ai was affected by irrigation levels fig 4c and d although there was a positive response for the two groups the increase of crop yield and wue was significantly larger when ai was applied to higher irrigation levels 100 fc the application of ai increased yield and wue for all crop types compared to the control treatment fig 4e and f 3 5 analysis of publication bias for the two of the comparisons i e crop yield and wue under ai and control carried out in the present study the funnel plots obtained were asymmetrical thirty three effect sizes were estimated as missing on the right side of the grand mean for crop yield and we corrected for that with the trim and ﬁll method this correction changed the magnitude of the effect size but did not affect the significance r 1 032 ci 0 987 1 079 p 0 05 while six effect sizes were estimated as missing for wue the magnitude of the effect size did not change obviously the fail safe numbers rosenberg s nfs for the database of crop yield and wue were 20 486 and 6 797 respectively far beyond the threshold of 5 n 10 needed to consider the mean effect size robust because of this we did not consider publication bias to be a problem for our meta analysis we also suspect that statistically significant effects we identified would only be changed due to many unpublished relationships 4 discussion 4 1 general effect of ai on yield and wue our study indicated that application of ai may be considered an effective strategy to increase crop yield and wue this effect seems to be highly consistent as it was observed for most of the experimental soil environmental and management factors evaluated in the meta analysis however the efficiency of ai was also dependent on these factors 4 2 ai factors effect on yield and wue application of venturi had the highest positive effect on crop yield and wue under ai while compressor had the minimum effect fig 2a and b this effect was expected because the air injection alone generally led to larger air losses a similar result was reported by elder and benson 1999 who indicated that air was solely injected into the subsurface drip irrigation system sdi the air was emitted in the form of a vertical stream directly to the soil surface from above the emitter and aerated only a small soil volume the application of ai using a compressor may therefore increase air losses decreasing the overall effect of ai on crop yield and wue this result is opposite to that observed by busscher 1982 for pepper where higher crop yield was obtained using a compressor perhaps because the sandy substrate of the culture provided more pore spaces for natural diffusion the effect of low aerated frequency 3d was higher than in ai with high aerated frequency 3d fig 2e and f the most likely mechanism by which aeration frequency regulated the effect of ai was by affecting the degree of soil disturbance the high aerated frequency 3d probably enhanced the airflow in the soil thus increasing cavitation and other factors that have negative effects on plant roots li et al 2016b 4 3 soil factors effect on yield and wue ai yield and wue in acidic soils were higher than in soils with a ph 7 fig 3 possibly due to the following reasons first nitrogen losses in alkaline soils will most likely be higher because of ammonia volatilization carrijo et al 2017 aerobic conditions tend to experience more volatilization liu et al 2012 so reduced nitrogen absorption under ai in alkaline soils may result in lower yields second a high level of na in alkaline soil can lead to na toxicity effects in plants which is a very serious problem especially under aerobic conditions that promote the growth of the root system and the absorption of water and fertilizer by crops bhattarai et al 2005 li et al 2016c higher na concentration resulted in higher uptake abrol et al 1985 and thus tolerance to na may be lower in crops under ai a smaller effect size of ai on crop yield and wue was found for fine textured soils compared to medium and coarse textured soils fig 3 soil texture is one of the most important factors affecting soil aeration fine textured soils have small pores that become more easily anaerobic and remain that way for longer durations than coarser textured soils bollmann and conrad 1998 groffman and tiedje 1991 drew 1990 indicated that the oxygen diffusion rate in clay soils can be 30 times smaller than in sandy soils furthermore the oxygen partial pressure in the fine textured soil after ai might still be lower reducing root respiration and causing a reduction in water and mineral uptake and in crop biomass goorahoo et al 2002 also reported similar results that the benefits of oxygation in fine textured soils are less than in coarser textured soils high bulk density 1 35 showed a larger yield response to ai application than low bulk density 1 35 fig 3e high soil bulk density can result in hypoxia or anoxia in the soil due to increasing soil compaction reducing nutrient uptake and elongation of roots and inhibiting soil aeration wolkowski and lowery 2008 all of which significantly inhibit plant growth ityel et al 2014 ai significantly improved soil aeration which was generally higher in high bulk density soils 1 35 than in lower bulk density soils 1 35 as shown in fig 3f wue of ai in soils with high bulk density 1 35 is lower most likely due to increased water consumption due to the vigorous growth of plants which is much higher than the increase of yield 4 4 effect of management factors on yield and wue burial depth of subsurface tubing at 10 20 cm caused the highest ai yield and wue compared with 10 cm and 20 cm fig 4 the reason for this may be improved water use and the combination of ai with soil water and air at the root zone compared to deeper drip placement as well as a reduced risk of air emitted directly to the soil surface in shallow drip placements heuberger et al 2001 also reported that plant growth and yield did not benefit from drip tape 5 cm deep also oxygation benefits are most likely not due to deeper tape placement because the additional oxygen is made available close to the emitter and root mass among the studies included in our database wen et al 2013 reported 15 cm for tomato and chen et al 2011 reported 10 cm for cotton as a consequence the larger effect size of ai was 10 20 cm for drip tape placement depths increasing irrigation levels showed a larger positive response to ai application in terms of crop yield and wue fig 4 a similar result was also reported by yin and cai 2014 who showed that ai at an irrigation level at 125 of field capacity significantly increased tomato yield and wue this could be expected because the air pathway becomes more tortuosity at higher irrigation levels which reduces diffusion rates of soil oxygen therefore the effect of ai on improvement of soil oxygen status will have a greater impact on crop yields and wue it might be argued that at higher irrigation levels the response to ai will be less pronounced as the irrigation levels may be above the optimum so such yield and wue may not respond positively to ai applications li et al 2016a jia et al 2011 in addition only a venturi device needs to install in the first part of the pipeline to achieve ai which is a simple and easy operation the input costs of drip irrigation and venturi equipment are estimated based on five years of recycling and reuse for example the net income for wheat was 25 higher with ai than in the ck treatment table 1 ai techniques are thus easy to operate and highly economically efficient and can be widely used 5 conclusions overall the use of ai increase yield by 19 3 95 ci 14 4 24 6 and wue by 17 9 95 ci 14 7 21 3 these benefits were most pronounced in soils with a ph 7 or high volumetric water contents when ai was imposed in practical application using venturi aeration equipment with drip tape placement depth of 10 20 cm and aerated frequency greater than once every three days is recommended as the most suitable choice the main advantages of ai techniques are low cost and easy operation and thus ai technology can be widely used this study provides a quantitative analysis of the currently available literature more effort however was clearly needed for reporting experimental details if data were to be used to extrapolate findings to other locations and to further develop management guidelines aerated treatment was highly variable between studies and was often not well described especially for the ai studies details on the special aerated timing and amount are essential for understanding the results the number of studies and observations was too limited to conduct interactive analysis that may be of great importance in developing ai practices our results demonstrated that ai is a promising practice but more efforts is needed to scale the results to irrigation districts with additional constraints acknowledgments

11316,excessive nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation in facility vegetable production cause n leaching which leads to a series of environmental problems it is urgent to develop practical management strategies to reduce n leaching while maintaining or increasing yield and water use efficiency wue in the present study a greenhouse experiment was conducted in the mollisols of northeastern china where eggplant was planted as the main vegetable we aimed to evaluate the effects of different fertilization and irrigation practices on n leaching eggplant yield and wue four treatments were set applying regular amounts of fertilizer and irrigation wf reducing chemical fertilizer application rates by 20 w80 f reducing irrigation by 20 80 wf and adding biochar into the wf treatment wf b the results showed that the wf b treatment significantly decreased n leaching while increasing eggplant yield and wue by 5 5 and 11 respectively in comparison with the results of the wf treatment the amount of n leaching eggplant yield and wue in the w80 f treatment were quite similar with those in the wf treatment compared with the wf treatment the 80 wf treatment significantly decreased n leaching and increased wue however it casued a sharp decrease in yield our results demonstrated that adding biochar may be a good practice for minimizing n leaching and increasing yield and wue in facility vegetable production systems keywords nitrogen leaching irrigation and fertilization practices biochar addition water use efficiency n distribution 1 introduction excessive application of nitrogen n fertilizers to arable lands leads to a large amount of n losses via leaching which not only causes water pollution du et al 2011 shi et al 2009 zhu et al 2005 but also increases the cost of agricultural production galloway et al 2008 to meet the demand for vegetables large amounts of water have been used for irrigation liang et al 2018 which aggravates n leaching min et al 2011 song et al 2009 compared to the level of fertilizer and irrigation for traditional vegetable land more fertilizers and irrigation are applied in facility vegetable production which makes n leaching more serious in the past decades facility vegetable cultivation has expanded worldwide particularly in china where it accounts for more than 90 of all the global area chang et al 2013 in the rapid expansion of facility agriculture excessive n fertilization and irrigation have caused more nitrogen transferring downward with water which has increased n losses via leaching therefore it is imperative to abate n leaching on facility vegetable lands from the viewpoints of both sustainable production and the environment various fertilizer and water management practices for preventing n leaching have been suggested including reducing the n application rate decreasing the irrigation amount or combining them together however most of the studies on these topics have focused on field or pot experiments and the effects of these practices are in debate decreasing the irrigation amount has been proven to be an efficient way to prevent n leaching fan et al 2014 jamali et al 2015 oppong danso2015 but may cause yield losses in some cases woli et al 2016 the effects of reducing the n application rate may have little effect on n leaching and caused significant yield loss in some studies heumann et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 but some studies also revealed that reducing n application rates decreased n leaching significantly without yield losses li et al 2015 min et al 2012 thus a systematic analysis on whether reducing fertilizer or decreasing irrigation could minimize n leaching losses while maintaining yields on facility vegetable lands should be conducted in recent years biochar incorporation and application to agricultural soils have been reported to improve soil physicochemical properties and enhance crop yield barrow 2012 lin et al 2015 thomazini et al 2015 this process has also been used for reducing n leaching in agricultural soils singh et al 2010 xu et al 2016 yoo et al 2014 zheng et al 2013 due to its adsorption properties biochar can adsorb nh4 n or no3 n and increase water holding capacity which would contribute to the reduction of n leaching directly wang et al 2015 xu et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 on the other hand biochar additions also enhanced microbial biomass and changed bacterial community structures of the soil song et al 2014 xu et al 2016 which would indirectly mitigate n leaching however the benefits of biochar applications varied with land management practices schomberg et al 2012 thus we need a better understanding of how biochar influences n leaching in facility vegetable production systems with intensive cultivation fertilization and irrigation in northeastern china facility agriculture is expanding rapidly due to the climate characteristics and it is expected to reach 267 000 ha in this area in 2020 chinese ministry of agriculture 2015 which will increase the risk for n leaching furthermore the typical soil in this region is mollisol which is quite different from other soils the unique soil type in this region may mean that the previous practice of minimizing n leaching does not work in this region the effect of different fertilization and irrigation management practices on n leaching remains unclear in the mollisol region in this study we hypothesized that reducing all n application rates decreasing irrigation and adding biochar could reduce n leaching but reducing n application rates and decreasing irrigation would cause yield losses while adding biochar would enhance vegetable yields therefore the objectives of this study were to determine what is a better practice for minimizing n leaching among reducing n application rates decreasing irrigation and adding biochar and to investigate the effect of different practices on water use efficiency wue and vegetable yield we believe that this work can improve knowledge about the impact of reducing n application rates decreasing irrigation and adding biochar in facility vegetable production systems in mollisols of northeastern china and provide information to guide sustainable development of facility vegetable production in northeastern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted at the

were built in 2002 and were oriented south north with an area of 324 m2 12 m in width and 27 m in length eggplant has been planted in the greenhouses since 2002 the eggplant variety was longqie 8 in 2017 on 10th march 2017 eggplant seeds were sowed in float tray for nursery the young plants were transplanted on 3rd may 2017 when the eggplant matured it was picked by hand the first picking was on 29th june 2017 and the last picking was on 5th october 2017 in total 14 picking were done during the period and the frequency was about once per week according to the soil texture classification system of the usda the present tested soil is mollisol the initial physical and chemical properties of the soil profile are listed in table 1 the soil was tilled and seedbeds 1 m in width 50 cm between two seedbeds were prepared before eggplant transplantation a drip tape was placed in the middle of seedbed and then the bed was covered with black polyethylene mulch 1 2 m in width two rows of eggplant plants were transplanted with 50 cm spacing in rows and 50 cm line spacing 2 2 experimental design the experiment was designed as follows 1 regular fertilization and irrigation wf in this treatment 5 t ha 1organic fertilizer and 72 72 and 110 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively were applied as basal fertilizer and were fully mixed into the 0 20 cm layer when the soil was tilled

was applied in a hole near each plant after transplanting approximately 27 m3 ha 1 water was used for irrigation when the plant recovered 45 m3 ha 1 water was used for irrigation every 7 10 days the irrigation was ceased at the last picking stage of the eggplants 2 reducing 20 chemical fertilizer and regular irrigation amount w80 f in this treatment 5 t ha 1 organic fertilizer and 57 6 57 6 and 88 kg ha 1 for n p2o5 and k2o respectively were applied as basal fertilizer and were fully mixed into the 0 20 cm layer when tilling the soil a fertilizer of 56 kg n ha 1 was used as the dressing in the early fruiting stage and 18 4 kg n ha 1 together with 90 4 kg k2o ha 1 was top dressed in the full bearing period the top dressing fertilizer was applied in a hole near each plant irrigation

fertilizer and irrigation wf b in this treatment 30 t ha 1 biochar was added into soil together with basal fertilizers and the other fertilization amounts and frequencies were the same as the ck treatment irrigation amount and frequency were the same with wf commercial organic fertilizer with n p2o5 k2o 5 3 3 urea with 46 n superphosphate with 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate with 50 k2o were used as the basal and topdressing fertilizers and drip irrigation systems were applied in this experiment a completely randomized design with three replications was used biochar was made from fruit wood under 600 the total carbon total nitrogen and ph of biochar are 715 g kg 1 6 9 g kg 1 and 8 87 respectively the plot area was 18 m2 6 m in length 3 m in width in each plot a leachate collecting device was installed in 2016 briefly a pit length 1 5 m width 0 8 m depth 0 9 m was dug in the middle of each plot and soils from the pit were separated by 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 90 cm another hole diameter φ 40 cm depth 35 cm was dug at the bottom of the pit to place the leachate collecting bucket together with the cover then a plastic film was used to separate the pit from the bulk soil both by the surroundings and bottom a ring was used to connect the plastic film and bucket together and then the plastic film above the bucket cover was removed quartz sand diameter φ 1 3 mm was placed on the filtering mesh to act as a filter then the pit was refilled with soil previously dug in a reverse order i e filling the soil in the order of 60 90 cm 40 60 cm 20 40 cm and 0 20 cm when filling 60 cm of the pit 30 cm from the surface the plastic film attached to the surroundings was removed and then a protection pipe was placed on the leachate collecting line and air connecting line then the remaining soil was refilled as described above and then the surface was flattened fig s1 2 3 sampling and analysis of soil leachate and plant samples after the eggplants were harvested on oct 5th 2017 5 cores were randomly sampled in each plot every 20 cm until 100 cm using a soil auger φ 4 cm soil samples from each layer were thoroughly mixed half of the soil samples were stored at 4 for nitrate and ammonium analyses within 1 week a fresh soil sample equivalent to 10 g oven dried soil was extracted by shaking with 100 ml 1 m kcl solution for 1 h on a rotary shaker followed by filtration the extracts were directly analyzed for nh4 n and no3 n using a distillation titration method by kjeldahl analyzer buchi k360 switzerland or were stored at 20 c in a refrigerator until they were analyzed by the same method within 1 months leachate samples were collected from the leachate collecting bucket by a vacuum pump the collecting system is shown in fig s1 a 3 l collecting bottle was connected to the leachate collecting line and then the bottle was connected to a 1 l buffer bottle to prevent the leachate from damaging the vacuum pump leachate was collected before irrigation every time leachate samples were stored at 20 c in a refrigerator for nh4 n and no3 n analysis within 15 days analysis methods were the same as those for the soil nh4 n and no3 n extracts analysis eggplants were picked at the mature period and then weighed to calculate yield 2 4 calculations and statistical analyses total yield was calculated by adding the yield from each picking together the

significant differences were reported at the 0 05 probability level in the text 3 results 3 1 n leaching in 2017 the cumulative no3 n leaching losses were 14 83 79 88 kg n ha 1 which was far higher than that of nh4 n at only 1 48 9 36 kg n ha 1 the total n leaching losses were 21 37 89 78 kg n ha 1 table 2 compared with the wf treatment the reducing irrigation treatment significantly reduced the no3 n nh4 n and total n leaching amount by 80 64 and 76 respectively and adding biochar significantly reduced no3 n nh4 n and total n leaching by 74 84 and 73 respectively however no significant difference was detected in the no3 n nh4 n and total n leaching amounts between the w80 f and wf treatments when considering the contributions of mineralized n to n leaching the percentages of no3 n nh4 n to total n were similar in wf and 80 wf which was nearly 81 and in wf b the proportion increased to 85 but the percentage of no3 n nh4 n increased sharply in w80 f which was approximately 98 3 2 n distribution in the soil profile in this study the nh4 n contents in all the treatments exhibited similar trends in the 0 100 cm soil layers the nh4 n concentrations were highest in the 0 20 cm layer and gradually decreased as soil depth increased fig 1 a which ranged from 17 62 to 50 65 mg kg 1 no significant difference in nh4 n concentrations was observed between the wf and w80 f treatments across the whole profile but the nh4 n contents in the 80 wf treatment remained lower compared with those in the wf treatment in each layer in the 0 20 cm layer the nh4 n concentration was the highest in the wf b treatment 50 66 mg kg 1 which was significantly higher than those in the wf 34 64 mg kg 1 w80 f 32 83 mg kg 1 and 80 wf 28 31 mg kg 1 treatments interestingly the nh4 n concentration in the wf b treatment became the lowest among four treatments below 40 cm the no3 n concentrations were also the highest at the 0 20 cm depth and decreased as soil depth increased in all treatments fig 1b which were 77 51 232 35mg kg 1 across all profiles the no3 n concentration was the lowest in each layer in the 80 wf treatment among four treatments while no significant difference was detected in no3 n contents between the wf and w80 f treatments across the whole profile the no3 n concentrations in the wf b treatment were significantly higher than those in the wf w80 f and 80 wf treatments in the 0 20 cm layers and 20 40 cm layers below 40 cm the no3 n concentrations in the wf b treatment became similar to those in the 80 wf treatment and were significantly lower than those in the wf and w80 f treatments 3 3 eggplant yield and water use efficiency the eggplant yields were 58 7 65 3 t ha 1 in 2017 no significant difference in yields was detected between the wf and w80 f treatments compared with the wf treatment decreasing irrigation caused a significant yield loss of 5 while adding biochar significantly increased eggplant yield by 6 evaporation et ranged from 348 to 445 mm compared with the wf treatment in the 80 wf and wf b treatments et was significantly decreased by 22 and 15 on average respectively however reducing chemical fertilizer amounts exerted no significant influence on et table 3 wue ranged from 136 9 to 168 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 with an order of 80 wf wf b wf w80 f wue significantly increased in the 80 wf and wf b treatments wue increased by 21 5 and 11 0 respectively compared with that in the wf treatment 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different practices on n leaching despite our hypothesis reducing chemical fertilizers by 20 exerted little influence on n leaching in the present study and this result was consistent with some previous studies heumann et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the result of reducing the n application rate is not surprising as large amounts of organic fertilizer were applied in this experiment to meet the n demand of eggplant more organic fertilizers will be mineralized due to the lack of chemical fertilizers thus resulting in similar nh4 n and no3 n concentrations with the wf treatment in the upper layers fig 1 in addition the warm and moist conditions in greenhouses are favorable for the mineralization of organic fertilizer guo et al 2010 the mineralization of organic fertilizer together with the regular irrigation amount resulted in small changes in n leaching in the w80 f treatment this result indicated that reducing chemical fertilizers alone may not work in minimizing n leaching in facility vegetable production systems in the mollisol region reducing both chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers or reducing chemical fertilizers together with adding some mineralization inhibitors would be better to minimize n leaching in facility vegetable production system in northeastern china in accordance with our hypothesis decreasing the irrigation amount by 20 significantly reduced n leaching in this study first less irrigation directly decreased the amount of leachate then water deficiency promoted root growth ashraf et al 2008 baque et al 2006 noack et al 2010 which might increase water and nutrients uptake by plants ashraf et al 2005 and reduce n leaching on the other hand water deficit had a negative impact on soil microbial biomass microbial diversity and enzyme activities bastida et al 2017 thus inhibiting the transformation of n and decreasing the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations fig 1 which could also contribute to minimizing n leaching substantially decreasing irrigation significantly reduced n leaching and caused a decrease in available nutrients which may influence yield thus further investigation is needed to show whether decreasing irrigation is a proper practice in facility vegetable production systems with mollisols in our study the addition of biochar significantly decreased n leaching and this result was similar to previous studies clough et al 2013 the application of biochar enhances microbial communities for n transformation song et al 2014 thus enhancing the mineralization of organic nitrogen and nitrification deluca et al 2015 jien et al 2017 however enhanced mineralization and nitrification does bring more risk of n leaching due to the absorption ability of biochar previous indoor batch sorption experiments proved that biochar can adsorb and effectively remove nh4 n and no3 n from aqueous solutions wang et al 2015 yao et al 2012 the n concentrations in the surface layers were significantly higher in the wf b treatment in the present study fig 1 which showed the enhanced n transformation and the strong absorption ability of biochar for nh4 n and no3 n furthermore the results also demonstrated that improved n adsorption can explain the biochar induced n leaching reduction effect in a soil system the application of biochar would increase soil water holding capacity bayabil et al 2015 verheijen et al 2010 which also contributes to reducing n leaching by reducing water transfer downward zheng et al 2013 in addition to the absorption ability of biochar the enhanced soil structure after biochar application has also been suggested as a mechanism for the reduction of n leaching yoo et al 2014 the application of biochar increased the percentages of aggregates of sizes 53 to 1000 μm which were capable of holding available water within soils hence n dissolved in soil solution could be held within the soil system resulting in reduced n leaching the application of biochar not only reduced n leaching but also improved soil available nutrients adding biochar would be a reasonable practice for minimizing n leaching while improving soil fertility 4 2 effects of different practices on yield and wue reducing chemical fertilizers exerted no significant influence on yield and wue previous studies have proven that reducing chemical fertilizers amounts does not decrease vegetable yield especially in the presence of organic fertilizer li et al 2015 min et al 2012 in facility vegetable

2002 who demonstrated that water deficiency resulted in a reduction in fresh fruit yields previous studies also showed that water deficiency increased vegetable wue values kirnak et al 2002 patanè and cosentino 2010 the higher wue of plants under water deficiency conditions is because water stressed plants wilt far more than unstressed plants and wilting invariably occurs at times when the

11316,excessive nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation in facility vegetable production cause n leaching which leads to a series of environmental problems it is urgent to develop practical management strategies to reduce n leaching while maintaining or increasing yield and water use efficiency wue in the present study a greenhouse experiment was conducted in the mollisols of northeastern china where eggplant was planted as the main vegetable we aimed to evaluate the effects of different fertilization and irrigation practices on n leaching eggplant yield and wue four treatments were set applying regular amounts of fertilizer and irrigation wf reducing chemical fertilizer application rates by 20 w80 f reducing irrigation by 20 80 wf and adding biochar into the wf treatment wf b the results showed that the wf b treatment significantly decreased n leaching while increasing eggplant yield and wue by 5 5 and 11 respectively in comparison with the results of the wf treatment the amount of n leaching eggplant yield and wue in the w80 f treatment were quite similar with those in the wf treatment compared with the wf treatment the 80 wf treatment significantly decreased n leaching and increased wue however it casued a sharp decrease in yield our results demonstrated that adding biochar may be a good practice for minimizing n leaching and increasing yield and wue in facility vegetable production systems keywords nitrogen leaching irrigation and fertilization practices biochar addition water use efficiency n distribution 1 introduction excessive application of nitrogen n fertilizers to arable lands leads to a large amount of n losses via leaching which not only causes water pollution du et al 2011 shi et al 2009 zhu et al 2005 but also increases the cost of agricultural production galloway et al 2008 to meet the demand for vegetables large amounts of water have been used for irrigation liang et al 2018 which aggravates n leaching min et al 2011 song et al 2009 compared to the level of fertilizer and irrigation for traditional vegetable land more fertilizers and irrigation are applied in facility vegetable production which makes n leaching more serious in the past decades facility vegetable cultivation has expanded worldwide particularly in china where it accounts for more than 90 of all the global area chang et al 2013 in the rapid expansion of facility agriculture excessive n fertilization and irrigation have caused more nitrogen transferring downward with water which has increased n losses via leaching therefore it is imperative to abate n leaching on facility vegetable lands from the viewpoints of both sustainable production and the environment various fertilizer and water management practices for preventing n leaching have been suggested including reducing the n application rate decreasing the irrigation amount or combining them together however most of the studies on these topics have focused on field or pot experiments and the effects of these practices are in debate decreasing the irrigation amount has been proven to be an efficient way to prevent n leaching fan et al 2014 jamali et al 2015 oppong danso2015 but may cause yield losses in some cases woli et al 2016 the effects of reducing the n application rate may have little effect on n leaching and caused significant yield loss in some studies heumann et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 but some studies also revealed that reducing n application rates decreased n leaching significantly without yield losses li et al 2015 min et al 2012 thus a systematic analysis on whether reducing fertilizer or decreasing irrigation could minimize n leaching losses while maintaining yields on facility vegetable lands should be conducted in recent years biochar incorporation and application to agricultural soils have been reported to improve soil physicochemical properties and enhance crop yield barrow 2012 lin et al 2015 thomazini et al 2015 this process has also been used for reducing n leaching in agricultural soils singh et al 2010 xu et al 2016 yoo et al 2014 zheng et al 2013 due to its adsorption properties biochar can adsorb nh4 n or no3 n and increase water holding capacity which would contribute to the reduction of n leaching directly wang et al 2015 xu et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 on the other hand biochar additions also enhanced microbial biomass and changed bacterial community structures of the soil song et al 2014 xu et al 2016 which would indirectly mitigate n leaching however the benefits of biochar applications varied with land management practices schomberg et al 2012 thus we need a better understanding of how biochar influences n leaching in facility vegetable production systems with intensive cultivation fertilization and irrigation in northeastern china facility agriculture is expanding rapidly due to the climate characteristics and it is expected to reach 267 000 ha in this area in 2020 chinese ministry of agriculture 2015 which will increase the risk for n leaching furthermore the typical soil in this region is mollisol which is quite different from other soils the unique soil type in this region may mean that the previous practice of minimizing n leaching does not work in this region the effect of different fertilization and irrigation management practices on n leaching remains unclear in the mollisol region in this study we hypothesized that reducing all n application rates decreasing irrigation and adding biochar could reduce n leaching but reducing n application rates and decreasing irrigation would cause yield losses while adding biochar would enhance vegetable yields therefore the objectives of this study were to determine what is a better practice for minimizing n leaching among reducing n application rates decreasing irrigation and adding biochar and to investigate the effect of different practices on water use efficiency wue and vegetable yield we believe that this work can improve knowledge about the impact of reducing n application rates decreasing irrigation and adding biochar in facility vegetable production systems in mollisols of northeastern china and provide information to guide sustainable development of facility vegetable production in northeastern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted at the

2017 on 10th march 2017 eggplant seeds were sowed in float tray for nursery the young plants were transplanted on 3rd may 2017 when the eggplant matured it was picked by hand the first picking was on 29th june 2017 and the last picking was on 5th october 2017 in total 14 picking were done during the period and the frequency was about once per week according to the soil texture classification system of the usda the present tested soil is mollisol the initial physical and chemical properties of the soil profile are listed in table 1 the soil was tilled and seedbeds 1 m in width 50 cm between two seedbeds were prepared before eggplant transplantation a drip tape was placed in the middle of seedbed and then the bed was covered with black polyethylene mulch 1 2 m in width two rows of eggplant plants were transplanted with 50 cm spacing in rows and 50 cm line spacing 2 2 experimental design the experiment was designed as follows 1 regular fertilization and irrigation wf in this

treatment irrigation amount and frequency were the same with wf commercial organic fertilizer with n p2o5 k2o 5 3 3 urea with 46 n superphosphate with 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate with 50 k2o were used as the basal and topdressing fertilizers and drip irrigation systems were applied in this experiment a completely randomized design with three replications was used biochar was made from fruit wood under 600 the total carbon total nitrogen and ph of biochar are 715 g kg 1 6 9 g kg 1 and 8 87 respectively the plot area was 18 m2 6 m in length 3 m in width in each plot a leachate collecting device was installed in 2016 briefly a pit length 1 5 m width 0 8 m depth 0 9 m was dug in the middle of each plot and soils from the pit were separated by 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 90 cm another hole diameter φ 40 cm depth 35 cm was dug at the bottom of the pit to place the leachate collecting bucket together with the cover then a plastic film was used to separate the pit from the bulk soil both by the surroundings and bottom a ring was used to connect the plastic film and bucket together and then the plastic film above the bucket cover was removed quartz sand diameter φ 1 3 mm was placed on the filtering mesh to act as a filter then the pit was refilled with soil previously dug in a reverse order i e filling the soil in the order of 60 90 cm 40 60 cm 20 40 cm and 0 20 cm when filling 60 cm of the pit 30 cm from the surface the plastic film attached to the surroundings was removed and then a protection pipe was placed on the leachate collecting line and air connecting line then the remaining soil was refilled as described above and then the surface was flattened fig s1 2 3 sampling and analysis of soil leachate and plant samples after the eggplants were harvested on oct 5th 2017 5 cores were randomly sampled in each plot every 20 cm until 100 cm using a soil auger φ 4 cm soil samples from each layer were thoroughly mixed half of the soil samples were stored at 4 for nitrate and ammonium analyses within 1 week a fresh soil sample equivalent to 10 g oven dried soil was extracted by shaking with 100 ml 1 m kcl solution for 1 h on a rotary shaker followed by filtration the extracts were directly analyzed for nh4 n and no3 n using a distillation titration method by kjeldahl analyzer buchi k360 switzerland or were stored at 20 c in a refrigerator until they were analyzed by the same method within 1 months leachate samples were collected from the leachate collecting bucket by a vacuum pump the collecting system is shown in fig s1 a 3 l collecting bottle was connected to the leachate collecting line and then the bottle was connected to a 1 l buffer bottle to prevent the leachate from damaging the vacuum pump leachate was collected before irrigation every time leachate samples were stored at 20 c in a refrigerator for nh4 n and no3 n analysis within 15 days analysis methods were the same as those for the soil nh4 n and no3 n extracts analysis eggplants were picked at the mature period and then weighed to calculate yield 2 4 calculations and statistical analyses total yield was calculated by adding the yield from each picking together the evapotranspiration et was calculated according to the water balance formula huang et al 2005 1 et p i c sws d r where p mm is the precipitation during the growing season p 0 in this study i mm is the

significant differences were reported at the 0 05 probability level in the text 3 results 3 1 n leaching in 2017 the cumulative no3 n leaching losses were 14 83 79 88 kg n ha 1 which was far higher than that of nh4 n at only 1 48 9 36 kg n ha 1 the total n leaching losses were 21 37 89 78 kg n ha 1 table 2 compared with the wf treatment the reducing irrigation treatment significantly reduced the no3 n nh4 n and total n leaching amount by 80 64 and 76 respectively and adding biochar significantly reduced no3 n nh4 n and total n leaching by 74 84 and 73 respectively however no significant difference was detected in the no3 n nh4 n and total n leaching amounts between the w80 f and wf treatments when considering the contributions of mineralized n to n leaching the percentages of no3 n nh4 n to total n were similar in wf and 80 wf which was nearly 81 and in wf b the proportion increased to 85 but the percentage of no3 n nh4 n increased sharply in w80 f which was approximately 98 3 2 n distribution in the soil profile in this study the nh4 n contents in all the treatments exhibited similar trends in the 0 100 cm soil layers the nh4 n concentrations were highest in the 0 20 cm layer and gradually decreased as soil depth increased fig 1 a which ranged from 17 62 to 50 65 mg kg 1 no significant difference in nh4 n concentrations was observed between the wf and w80 f treatments across the whole profile but the nh4 n contents in the 80 wf treatment remained lower compared with those in the wf treatment in each layer in the 0 20 cm layer the nh4 n concentration was the highest in the wf b treatment 50 66 mg kg 1 which was significantly higher than those in the wf 34 64 mg kg 1 w80 f 32 83 mg kg 1 and 80 wf 28 31 mg kg 1 treatments interestingly the nh4 n concentration in the wf b treatment became the lowest among four treatments below 40 cm the no3 n concentrations were also the highest at the 0 20 cm depth and decreased as soil depth increased in all treatments fig 1b which were 77 51 232 35mg kg 1 across all profiles the no3 n concentration was the lowest in each layer in the 80 wf treatment among four treatments while no significant difference was detected in no3 n contents between the wf and w80 f treatments across the whole profile the no3 n concentrations in the wf b treatment were significantly higher than those in the wf w80 f and 80 wf treatments in the 0 20 cm layers and 20 40 cm layers below 40 cm the no3 n concentrations in the wf b treatment became similar to those in the 80 wf treatment and were significantly lower than those in the wf and w80 f treatments 3 3 eggplant yield and water use efficiency the eggplant yields were 58 7 65 3 t ha 1 in 2017 no significant difference in yields was detected between the wf and w80 f treatments compared with the wf treatment decreasing irrigation caused a significant yield loss of 5 while adding biochar significantly increased eggplant yield by 6 evaporation et ranged from 348 to 445 mm compared with the wf treatment in the 80 wf and wf b treatments et was significantly decreased by 22 and 15 on average respectively however reducing chemical fertilizer amounts exerted no significant influence on et table 3 wue ranged from 136 9 to 168 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 with an order of 80 wf wf b wf w80 f wue significantly increased in the 80 wf and wf b treatments wue increased by 21 5 and 11 0 respectively compared with that in the wf treatment 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different practices on n leaching despite our hypothesis reducing chemical fertilizers by 20 exerted little influence on n leaching in the present study and this result was consistent with some previous studies heumann et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the result of reducing the n application rate is not surprising as large amounts of organic fertilizer were applied in this experiment to meet the n demand of eggplant more organic fertilizers will be mineralized due to the lack of chemical fertilizers thus resulting in similar nh4 n and no3 n concentrations with the wf treatment in the upper layers fig 1 in addition the warm and moist conditions in greenhouses are favorable for the mineralization of organic fertilizer guo et al 2010 the mineralization of organic fertilizer together with the regular irrigation amount resulted in small changes in n leaching in the w80 f treatment this result indicated that reducing chemical fertilizers alone may not work in minimizing n leaching in facility vegetable production systems in the mollisol region reducing both chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers or reducing chemical fertilizers together with adding some mineralization inhibitors would be better to minimize n leaching in facility vegetable production system in northeastern china in accordance with our hypothesis decreasing the irrigation amount by 20 significantly reduced n leaching in this study first less irrigation directly decreased the amount of leachate then water deficiency promoted root growth ashraf et al 2008 baque et al 2006 noack et al 2010 which might increase water and nutrients uptake by plants ashraf et al 2005 and reduce n leaching on the other hand water deficit had a negative impact on soil microbial biomass microbial diversity and enzyme activities bastida et al 2017 thus inhibiting the transformation of n and decreasing the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations fig 1 which could also contribute to minimizing n leaching substantially decreasing irrigation significantly reduced n leaching and caused a decrease in available nutrients which may influence yield thus further investigation is needed to show whether decreasing irrigation is a proper practice in facility vegetable production systems with mollisols in our study the addition of biochar significantly decreased n leaching and this result was similar to previous studies clough et al 2013 the application of biochar enhances microbial communities for n transformation song et al 2014 thus enhancing the mineralization of organic nitrogen and nitrification deluca et al 2015 jien et al 2017 however enhanced mineralization and nitrification does bring more risk of n leaching due to the absorption ability of biochar previous indoor batch sorption experiments proved that biochar can adsorb and effectively remove nh4 n and no3 n from aqueous solutions wang et al 2015 yao et al 2012 the n concentrations in the surface layers were significantly higher in the wf b treatment in the present study fig 1 which showed the enhanced n transformation and the strong absorption ability of biochar for nh4 n and no3 n furthermore the results also demonstrated that improved n adsorption can explain the biochar induced n leaching reduction effect in a soil system the application of biochar would increase soil water holding capacity bayabil et al 2015 verheijen et al 2010 which also contributes to reducing n leaching by reducing water transfer downward zheng et al 2013 in addition to the absorption ability of biochar the enhanced soil structure after biochar application has also been suggested as a mechanism for the reduction of n leaching yoo et al 2014 the application of biochar increased the percentages of aggregates of sizes 53 to 1000 μm which were capable of holding available water within soils hence n dissolved in soil solution could be held within the soil system resulting in reduced n leaching the application of biochar not only reduced n leaching but also improved soil available nutrients adding biochar would be a reasonable practice for minimizing n leaching while improving soil fertility 4 2 effects of different practices on yield and wue reducing chemical fertilizers exerted no significant influence on yield and wue previous

11317,water and nitrogen n deficit are globally the most frequently limiting factors for agricultural crops while both often occur together to evaluate the interactive effects of water deficit and n nutrition on remote sensing data rainout shelter field experiments were conducted in winter wheat during 2013 2014 canopy spectral reflectance and infrared thermal imaging parameters were correlated to biochemical physiological morphological and production characteristics correlation analysis revealed that stomatal response to water deficit is best estimated using the npci normalized pigment chlorophyll index vegetation index and also by the cwsi crop water stress index thermal index a variety of vegetation indices can be used to estimate grain yield among which the best performing is the normalized red edge red index nreri that index shows the highest correlation irrespective of water deficit and n nutrition although none of the indices provided good detection of n content in plants the total n uptake in wheat grain was reliably estimated by the tcari osavi transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index optimized soil adjusted vegetation index the results demonstrated that utilization of n for yield or grain protein formation was largely determined by water availability and the relationships between vegetation indices and grain protein content thus have a distinct slope under water deficit in summary the spectral and thermal indices can provide satisfactory estimation irrespective of interactions between water and n deficit for grain yield n uptake and stomatal responses however when estimating the grain protein content the water availability should be considered keywords agroecosystem drought grain yield infrared thermography spectral reflectance 1 introduction water deficit wd is considered to be the main environmental factor limiting plant growth photosynthesis and productivity worldwide jones and corlett 1992 this fact will increasingly be true in the future under climate change despite the recent considerable improvement in understanding plant responses to wd several knowledge gaps can be highlighted most of these gaps relate to unknown interactions among other environmental factors from the perspective of agricultural practice the most important interaction with wd is that of nitrogen n availability n is often considered the major limiting factor after wd for plant growth and crop productivity indeed n is involved in the functioning of meristematic tissues in photosynthesis and in determining the protein content of harvested organs xu et al 2012 additionally spatial variation in soil and temporal changes in weather conditions results in high spatiotemporal variability in water and nutrient availability this in turn impacts significantly upon crop productivity and n leaching or runoff from agricultural fields to ground or surface water resources the availability of water or n can also significantly affect the input use efficiency of the counterpart factor reviewed by gonzalez dugo et al 2010 and thus modulate too the impacts on production parameters to be able to estimate in a timely manner the heterogeneity and prevent negative impacts on crop productivity and environment there is increasing demand for a robust method able to detect small changes in crop growth physiology and production parameters as a response to water or nutrient availability on relatively large areas such method also should be able to identify the major cause of such changes to optimize following crop management and inputs spectral reflectance and infrared thermography constitute the most promising approaches in remote sensing of crop canopies to detect spatial variability of either n or wd reviewed by pinter et al 2003 bandyopadhyay et al 2014 by providing both spatial and temporal information remote sensing based on spectral reflectance may function as an important source of data for site specific crop management to improve nutrient and water use efficiency and reduce n losses spectral reflectance of crop canopies in individual spectral bands is determined by various morphological structural and physiological parameters statistically significant correlations often have been found among spectral characteristics and chlorophyll content nutrition status aboveground biomass and wd reviewed by hatfield et al 2008 several vegetation indices have been used to estimate effects of wd on crop productivity and stability for example peñuelas et al 1997 developed the water index wi based on reflectance at 900 and 970 nm to estimate water status in plants in other studies different spectral indices are used for estimation of drought effects such as the photochemical reflectance index pri elsheery and cao 2008 brown pigment index bpi peñuelas et al 2004 and simple ratio or normalized difference vegetation index sr ndvi aparicio et al 2000 correspondingly several vegetation indices have been proposed for non destructive estimation of plant n status in field crops it has been demonstrated that due to the rapid saturation of vegetation indices based on reflectance in the blue and red bands merzlyak and gitelson 1995 higher linearity of response to n status and thus improved reliability of detection at medium and high levels of n supply is achieved with indices using red edge e g klem et al 2014 li et al 2014 or green gitelson et al 2003 xue et al 2004 reflectance bands however there are only isolated studies dealing with the combined effect of wd and n nutrition on canopy reflectance e g peñuelas et al 1994 the possibility for simultaneous evaluation of the wd and n status effects and their interactions in terms of the physiological responses crop yield and quality using spectral reflectance remains insufficiently explored this lack of knowledge may lead to misinterpretation in evaluating the impact of wd and undermine decision processes regarding n nutrition recently increased attention has been devoted to the use of infrared thermal imaging for detecting plant responses to wd this has included the development of several water stress indices reviewed by maes and steppe 2012 but interactions between the effect of n nutrition and wd on thermal data are yet almost unknown the primary aim of this study was therefore to examine perspective ways for simultaneous evaluation of wd and n status in winter wheat via spectral reflectance and infrared thermal imaging and to explore direct relationships of reflectance and thermal parameters with plant physiology morphology grain yield and quality we thus formulated the following hypotheses 1 wd and n deficiency both cause a similar reduction in morphometric and production parameters 2 nitrogen fertilization alleviates negative effects of wd 3 the wd and n effects on physiological parameters can be separated using specific vegetation and thermal indices 4 final grain yield and protein content can be predicted using spectral reflectance irrespective of stress type 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the experiment was conducted at two experimental sites near the

sown with winter wheat triticum aestivum variety tiguan the sowing density was 3 5 million of germinating seeds per hectare with row distance 0 125 m the plots were separated within blocks by buffering strips of 2 m sown with winter wheat while the blocks were separated by 4 m grass strips the plots were randomized in blocks and each combination of wd and n nutrition treatment was replicated four times at each site see fig 1 for manipulating incident precipitation rainout shelters were constructed over the experimental plot the rainout shelters consisted of a wood frame covered by polycarbonate transparent strips the strips were arranged as louvers to exclude precipitation completely from the experimental plot while still enabling sufficient air movement and minimizing temperature and relative humidity artifacts the upper part 0 3 m of the side wall was also covered by polycarbonate strips to avoid an effect of horizontal precipitation the roof had a 20 incline and on its lowest side was mounted a gutter that channeled the intercepted water out of the plot a trench 0 2 m wide was dug and sheathed with a steel barrier to separate the soil of the roofed plots from the neighboring soil the rainout shelters were installed at the middle of stem elongation 8 may 2013 and 6 may 2014 to simulate wd at both sites the simulated wd lasted until early milk ripening stage

rain o matic meteorological pronamic denmark at the end of the wd period soil moisture had been reduced relatively by 68 and 65 in 2013 and by 41 and 32 in 2014 at the babicka and vetrolam sites respectively as compared to the control treatment 100 fig 2 the effect of n nutrition was studied at two levels control without n fertilization n0 0 kg ha 1 and with n fertilization n140 140 kg ha 1 nitrogen was applied as a liquid containing n in three forms nh4 no3 and urea in the ratio 1 1 2 dam 390 fertilizer duslo sk the n was applied in two doses april and may in 2013 and in three doses during march april in 2014 the total n dose consisted of one or two regeneration doses during tillering in 2013 and 2014 respectively and from one production dose during stem elongation two regeneration doses in 2014 were used due to slower crop development during early spring the combinations of both factors resulted in the following treatments n0 c n0 wd n140 c and n140 wd 2 2 morphometric and production analyses on 13 june 2013 and 11 june 2014 plant samples stems leaves and spikes were collected to evaluate the impact of the wd period on morphometric characteristics three stems were collected from each plot stem and spike lengths were measured as well as leaf length width area and dry weight in two leaves within the vertical plant profile flag leaf f and first leaf below flag leaf f 1 specific leaf area sla was calculated from the dry weight of leaves and leaf area at the harvest ripening stage the weight of total aboveground biomass and grain yield were determined after manually harvesting an area of 2 0 5 m2 per each plot leaves f and f 1 sampled at the time of morphological measurements and grain samples were analyzed to determine n content in dry

spectralon labsphere usa the reflected radiances were directly converted to spectral reflectance within the rs3 spectral acquisition software asd inc the average reflectance spectrum from two independent measurements for each plot replication was used to calculate vegetation and chlorophyll indices the calculated indices are listed in table 1 thermal airborne data were acquired using the

kolmogorov smirnov test a three way fixed effect anova model was used for the general analysis of the site water deficit and n nutrition effects to compare the differences between means within tables

reflectance or infrared thermal parameters tukey s post hoc p 0 05 test was used pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze relationships between vegetation or thermal indices and production or physiological parameters all statistical tests were conducted using statistica 12 software statsoft usa 3 results 3 1 morphometric characteristics in the present study the effect of wd and n nutrition on morphometric parameters of winter wheat was more pronounced in 2013 and at the vetrolam site for some morphometric parameters significant differences were also found in 2014 at the vetrolam site and in 2013 at the babicka site table 2 generally almost no effect of either wd or n nutrition was found at the babicka site in 2014 the effect of wd was most pronounced on total shoot dry weight as a result of simulated wd the shoot biomass was reduced by 1 and 18 in 2013 and by 27 and 8 in 2014 in the n0 and n140 treatments respectively at the vetrolam site at the babicka site the changes in total shoot biomass were 2 and 15 in 2013 and 18 and 3 in 2014 for the n0 and n140 treatments respectively thus the effect of n nutrition on wd response was opposite at both sites depending on the year in 2013 the negative effect of wd was alleviated by lower n dose n0 whereas in 2014 the alleviation of wd effect occurred at the higher n dose n140 the decrease in shoot dry weight was reflected in a reduction of morphometric parameters for individual aboveground plant parts such as stem length leaf length and leaf area while wd effect was more pronounced in stem biomass the total leaf biomass was more affected by n nutrition the morphometric parameters of flag leaf f were particularly influenced by n nutrition for example the leaf area of flag leaf was stimulated by n nutrition at the vetrolam site by 57 and 20 in 2013 and by 44 and 109 in 2014 for c and wd treatments respectively at the babicka site the effect of n nutrition on leaf area of flag leaf was much lower leaf area of f leaves changed by 46 and 8 in 2013 and by 4 and 10 in 2014 for c and wd treatments respectively the interactive effects between wd and n nutrition observed in total shoot biomass were similarly found in leaf morphometry for the combinations of year and n nutrition 2013 n0 and 2014 n140 wd caused an only small reduction or even stimulation of leaf area while in 2013 n140 and 2014 n0 wd reduced leaf area significantly and particularly at the vetrolam site 3 2 production characteristics the results of anova table 3 from both years revealed a significant effect of site on aboveground biomass and grain yield but not on grain protein content while the yield level was similar at the babicka site in both years a relatively large yield decline was recorded at the vetrolam site in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of the decline in yield at the vetrolam site the differences between sites decreased to the p 0 05 level of significance in 2014 whereas the effect of site was significant at the p 0 01 level in 2013 in addition the effect of site was the opposite in individual years while in 2013 the higher yields were recorded at the vetrolam site in 2014 yields were higher at the babicka site similar results were observed for aboveground biomass in 2013 the effect of wd was highly significant p 0 01 on the values of aboveground biomass and yield and only significant at p 0 05 for grain protein content by contrast in 2014 the impact of wd showed a highly significant effect p 0 01 only on the protein content while this effect on aboveground biomass and yield was not statistically significant effect of n nutrition on production parameters was statistically significant in both years a highly significant effect p 0 01 of n nutrition was observed on protein content in both years on grain yield in 2013 and on aboveground biomass in 2014 in the remaining cases the effect of n nutrition was significant at the level p 0 05 mutual interactions of effects of site wd and n nutrition on production characteristics were mostly statistically insignificant only in the case of grain protein content were statistically significant interactions between site and n nutrition p 0 05 and between wd and n nutrition p 0 01 observed these significant interactions however were seen only in 2013 it is evident from the figures showing mean production parameters figs 3 and 4 that in the case of aboveground biomass and grain yield the effects of n nutrition and wd were the opposite that is to say that higher n nutrition increased yield and aboveground biomass while wd decreased these production parameters conversely for protein content both factors have the same effect as higher n nutrition and wd caused protein content to increase in 2013 wd reduced the yield of the treatment n140 to the level of unfertilized treatment n0 at both sites in 2014 the impact of wd on yield and aboveground biomass was not demonstrated to be statistically significant on the other hand in 2014 the impact of wd on the grain protein content became more visible the combination of higher levels of n nutrition and wd n140 wd increased the protein content relatively by 67 and 43 as compared to the n0 c treatment whereas the effect of n nutrition itself n140 c was demonstrated by an increase in grain protein by 36 and 15 for the babicka and vetrolam sites respectively fig 4 from the figures of mean production parameters figs 3 and 4 it is also possible to summarize that the effect of n nutrition on aboveground biomass yield and grain protein content was similar in both years and at both sites the impact of wd differed between years while in 2013 the effect of wd was more pronounced on grain yield and less so on grain protein content in 2014 it was the opposite as grain yield was almost not affected by wd but the grain protein content increased significantly 3 3 gas exchange parameters water and n use efficiency both gas exchange parameters a max and gsmax show similar patterns for response to wd and n nutrition these results demonstrate interactions with year and site and generally positive effect of higher nitrogen dose n140 in 2013 and negative effect in 2014 irrespective of wd fig 5 the negative effect of wd on gas exchange parameters was altered by both year and site in 2013 a max and gsmax were more reduced at the vetrolam site and for a max the effect of wd was statistically significant only for the n0 treatment whereas for gsmax this effect was significant in the case of both n treatments in 2014 the wd effect was relatively less pronounced and statistically significant only at the babicka site for a max this effect was significant for the n0 treatment whereas for gsmax it was significant for both n treatments intrinsic water use efficiency a max gsmax and grain nitrogen use efficiency both show evident interactions with the year but not with the site fig 6 a max gsmax was increased by wd similarly for all combinations of n treatment year and site however a significant effect of wd was revealed only in isolated cases grain nitrogen use efficiency showed in all combinations of year and site its highest level under the n0 c treatment and lowest level under n140 wd this means that both higher nitrogen fertilization and water deficit decrease the grain nitrogen use efficiency comparison of years shows this effect to be more evident in 2013 3 4 spectral reflectance and infrared thermography measurements relationships with physiological and production parameters twenty five different spectral reflectance indices table 1 were calculated from the reflectance measurements at canopy level together with the cwsi index calculated from airborne thermal imaging data for each replication these values were used to analyze correlations with the most important physiological parameters related to wd effect measured at the same time or production parameters evaluated at the full ripening stage table 4 the results of correlation analysis show that both a max and gsmax were relatively well estimated using a variety of spectral indices in 2013 but not in 2014 data not shown the only vegetation index showing a significant correlation with gsmax in both years and also across both years was the normalized pigment chlorophyll index npci fig 7 e and f this index can therefore be used to evaluate the physiological response to water deficiency i e stomatal closure relationships between npci and gsmax have an inverse character and it is obvious that these relationships are less influenced by other factors such as n nutrition the cwsi thermal index showed lower correlation coefficients relative to gsmax in comparison with npci table 4 the relationship between cwsi and gsmax has an inverse character but in comparing the years 2013 and 2014 we can see that the slope changed significantly fig 8 this indicates greater difficulty in comparing results for distinct environmental conditions moreover in 2014 the effect of n nutrition on the relationship between cwsi and gsmax is noteworthy the higher n dose n140 generally showed lower gsmax values for similar cwsis both production parameters i e aboveground biomass and grain yield showed relatively strong correlations with a wide range of spectral indices table 4 the highest values of correlation coefficients across both years for grain yield were achieved for the normalized red edge red index nreri with their virtually identical slopes fig 7a and b these relationships show a very similar pattern for both years from the values of correlation coefficients table 4 it is also evident that the estimation of n content in leaves as well as grain protein content using the spectral reflectance can be very difficult in the case of some parameters statistically significant values of correlation coefficients were achieved but the correlations strongly differed between years data not shown and thus were not used for detailed regression analysis on the other hand if the amount of n in grain is expressed per ground area unit thus as n uptake by grain per hectare the correlation coefficients for a number of spectral indices increased and became significant table 4 the highest value of correlation coefficients for a summary of both years was achieved in the tcari osavi transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index optimized soil adjusted vegetation index the relationships between tcari osavi and n uptake by grain per unit area are shown in fig 7c and d these relationships exhibit virtually identical slope values which documents independence from the effect of year although the correlations between the grain protein content and spectral indices are generally not statistically significant table 4 detailed analysis of the relationships has shown that these are in many cases divided into two separate relationships for wd and control treatment these relationships are then also relatively stable when comparing between the two experimental years an example in fig 9 shows the relationships for index nreri which generally exhibits the highest correlation coefficients for relationship to grain protein content 4 discussion 4 1 morphometric characteristics although the effect of wd on plant growth is usually observed with a certain delay mathobo et al 2017 the effect on meristems is virtually instantaneous and growth reduction is regarded as the primary impact of wd tardieu et al 2011 reduced growth under wd results in reduced sink and accumulation of assimilates leading to feedback regulation of photosynthesis körner 2003 similarly n deficiency strongly reduces sink for assimilates through limited growth paul and foyer 2001 limited growth and hence reduced sink for assimilates are likely the main integrating factors determining the interactive effects of wd and n nutrition in our study the interactive effects of wd and n nutrition on morphometric parameters were dependent on year and site in 2013 wd caused more pronounced reductions of morphometric parameters under higher n availability n140 at both sites however in 2014 the effect of wd was higher under low n availability n0 and this was observed only at site vetrolam while wd effect was more pronounced in stem biomass the total leaf biomass was more affected by n nutrition lower n availability is often reported to increase drought tolerance e g arora et al 2001 on the other hand some studies have documented that higher n application can alleviate wd effects on plant growth saneoka et al 2004 these differences can be explained by different total n dose or n availability while both sub optimal and over optimal doses are suggested to reduce tolerance to wd excessive n in soil generally increases leaf area and reduces root to shoot ratio poorter et al 2012 however a slight increase of nutrient availability can stimulate root growth such patterns result in increased transpiration and the same or lower water uptake under excess n availability alleviating effect of lower n supply on morphometric parameters under drought stress was demonstrated by wu et al 2008 in sophora davidii however they also found negative effect of no n supply on drought stress sensitivity appropriate n dose can thus stimulate plant growth under wd through higher root to shoot ratio and water use efficiency accordingly the opposite interactive effects of wd and n availability on morphometric parameters in 2013 and 2014 and differences between sites in 2014 can result from different total n availability through n mineralization higher effects of wd on morphometric characteristics can thus be a sign of excessive or limiting n availability while no effect suggests appropriate n availability 4 2 production characteristics effect of wd on grain yield and aboveground biomass was in our experiment strongly influenced by year the effect of wd on aboveground biomass and yield was significant only in 2013 as is evident from the soil moisture dynamics wd in 2013 was manifested earlier and more significantly and particularly due to subsequent lower precipitation the wd persisted until the end of vegetation late wd affects grain yield mainly by reducing thousand grain weight ginkel van et al 1997 thus continued wd in 2013 probably resulted in the effect on both the number of grains per spike and the thousand grain weight and finally in a more significant wd effect on grain yield in 2013 we found slightly higher effect of wd under higher n doses accordingly barraclough et al 1989 revealed slightly lower relative grain yield reduction due to wd under lower n availability also sadras 2002 recommended reduced n doses under severe terminal drought stress as the higher n doses can reduce harvest index and grain yield although the effect of n nutrition on yield response to wd in our study was relatively low and statistically insignificant these results are in accordance with changes in intrinsic water use efficiency the higher intrinsic water use efficiency in 2014 under higher n nutrition resulted in relatively lower yield reduction as compared to 2013 in which year the yield reduction was greater for the n140 treatment in the present study no significant interactions between n nutrition and wd effects were found in the aboveground biomass and grain yield a significant interaction between the effect of n nutrition and wd was demonstrated only in grain protein content this effect was similar in 2013 and 2014 and it is evident that the effect of wd on increasing protein content is manifested more strongly under higher n dose n140 similarly gooding et al 2003 showed that grain protein content was increased by wd and particularly when wd lasted till the end of grain growth furthermore terman et al 1969 demonstrated that the effect of n nutrition on the grain protein content is to a large extent modulated by conditions for yield formation if the effect of n nutrition on yield is high then the impact on grain protein content is reduced and vice versa these facts confirm our findings which show that the grain protein content rises when higher n dose is combined with wd limiting the grain yield 4 3 gas exchange parameters water and n use efficiency similarly to production parameters the effect of wd on plant physiology was also substantially influenced by year in contrast with grain yield and aboveground biomass the physiological parameters were significantly affected only in 2014 it is obvious that weather and particularly water supply before and after the wd period are reflected in the severity of wd and thus also in growth and physiological responses however no clear interactions between the effects of wd and n availability on plant physiology were found in the present study in general very rapid response to wd is observed in stomatal conductance in addition to reduced transpiration stomatal closure also leads to a decrease in co2 assimilation rate and limitation of both primary and secondary photosynthetic processes cornic 2000 the third major manifestation of wd effect is an acceleration of plant senescence leading to a decline in chlorophyll content leaf water content and leaf area munné bosch and alegre 2000 the combined effects of wd and n availability on photosynthesis can be interconnected through regulation of sink körner 2003 and interactions between the accumulation of assimilates and abscisic acid pourtau et al 2004 the interactive effect of n nutrition and wd on physiological parameters was studied in wheat by shangguan et al 2000 they found that the effects of n nutrition on photosynthetic parameters vary according to the water availability in addition they reported that intrinsic water use efficiency was reduced significantly by drought stress in an n fertilized treatment the year also affected in our study the direction of physiological response to n supply while in 2013 n generally increased a max and gsmax in 2014 was the response to higher n dose opposite shangguan 1997 demonstrated that stomatal conductance increases with higher levels of n nutrition but simultaneously becomes also more sensitive to lack of water the higher sensitivity of stomata under higher n dose in our study thus resulted in an increase of intrinsic water use efficiency in 2014 versus 2013 in which year generally more water was available detection of real n needs to achieve optimum yields with the highest n use efficiency under specific environmental conditions is one of today s major crop production challenges because the changing conditions can significantly influence both yield potential and n use efficiency n use efficiency generally decreases with increasing n dose barraclough et al 2010 which was also confirmed in our results however n use efficiency can be also affected by environmental factors such as soil cassman et al 2002 and water availability gonzalez dugo et al 2010 or by genotype e g barraclough et al 2010 in our study we demonstrated a significant effect of year on n use efficiency which also modulated the effect of n dose the differences in n use efficiency decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 fan and li 2001 demonstrated in wheat that n use efficiency was increased by wd and diminished by the dose of n applied wd treatment generally exhibited higher n use efficiency than for irrigated treatments and this effect was more pronounced when the amount of available n was greater onillon et al 1995 on the contrary our results show a slight but consistent decrease in n use efficiency under wd wd which occurs at the beginning of grain ripening probably change the allocation of n in grain and n which cannot be used for higher yield formation under wd is stored in grain as protein gooding et al 2003 conversely n deficiency also affects water use efficiency the overall level of transpiration and water uptake from the soil reviewed by gonzalez dugo et al 2010 4 4 spectral reflectance and infrared thermography measurements relationships with physiological and production parameters distinct manifestations of wd and n nutrition impacts on plant growth and physiology are also reflected in possibilities for using remote sensing methods decline of leaf area and aboveground biomass under wd results in the decrease of vegetation indices based on the difference between red and nir bands such as ndvi aparicio et al 2002 but due to the early saturation of ndvi already at relatively low leaf area index it has been demonstrated more reliable to use indices based on reflectance in green or red edge spectral bands gitelson et al 2003 within this study the estimation of aboveground biomass and grain yield by ndvi and indices based on red edge e g nreri zm anmb650 720 and green e g ndgi bands provided similar results indicating no saturation of spectral indices at higher biomass or grain yield despite limitations due to the early saturation of ndvi at larger amounts of aboveground biomass the good estimation of the responses to wd has been confirmed by a number of studies in wheat stands e g aparicio et al 2002 gutiérrez rodríguez et al 2004 comparable estimation of wd effect on biomass and grain yield was also achieved by water index wi peñuelas et al 1997 based on reflectance at 970 nm on the contrary leaf n content protein content in grain and n uptake in grain are best estimated by red edge index nreri indicating early saturation of other indices direct estimation of the n content in leaves was nevertheless rather problematic particularly due to the large annual variability of these relationships on the other hand n uptake per unit area was reliably estimated using the nreri even when comparing results from different years diagnostics of n status in plants using spectral reflectance is usually based on very close correlation between the n and chlorophyll contents and thus on the absorption properties of chlorophylls e g yoder and pettigrew crosby 1995 within this study the npci index was proven to be the most reliable indicator of the wd effect on stomatal conductance the npci is calculated from reflectance at wavelengths 430 and 680 nm peñuelas et al 1994 and reflects primarily changes in the carotenoids chlorophylls ratio but it can also be affected by changes in the chlorophyll a b ratio due to distinct absorption of chlorophyll a and b at these two wavelengths under wd plants usually increase carotenoid levels to cope with oxidative stress munné bosch and alegre 2002 although the decrease of the chlorophyll a b ratio under wd has been demonstrated e g loggini et al 1999 in other studies an increase in the chlorophyll a b ratio has been shown alberte et al 1977 in the present study relatively high correlation coefficients for relationship to gsmax were also found for the indices pri and srpi the index pri is related particularly to the conversion of carotenoids within the xanthophyll cycle gamon et al 1992 which is crucial for protecting against the excessive light demmig adams and adams 1996 but it can be influenced too by wd thenot et al 2002 while significant progress has been made in developing spectral reflectance methods for independent detection of n nutrition and water status and these have become commercially available for agricultural practice jasper et al 2009 the interactions between n nutrition and water availability from the perspective of remote sensing remain little explored from the correlation analysis carried out for spectral reflectance and infrared thermography indices it is evident that the best vegetation indices for estimating the impact of wd on stomatal conductance e g npci are also influenced by n status moreover the best indices for estimating n status e g nreri are affected by wd thus a number of indices show significant correlation with both g smax and n uptake combined effects of wd and n nutrition on spectral reflectance were studied by schlemmer et al 2005 significant relationships with chlorophyll content at a number of reflectance wavelengths and conversely less close relationships with relative water content imply a better ability of reflectance measurements to estimate the n status our results show that the use of infrared thermal imaging index cwsi can improve the separation of wd and n nutrition effects as cwsi is less affected by n content however thermal imaging data are considerably affected by year as the canopy temperature is besides water status subjected to effects of irradiance wind speed and vapor pressure deficit jones et al 2009 5 conclusions the main objective of our study was to show perspective ways for simultaneous evaluation of wd and n status in winter wheat by spectral reflectance and infrared thermal imaging and to examine interactive effects of wd and n nutrition on relationships with plant physiology morphology grain yield and quality we can conclude that 1 among all physiological production and qualitative parameters studied the significant interactive effect of wd and n nutrition was found in grain protein content so that the effect of wd on grain protein content was more pronounced under higher n dose 2 n fertilization does not alleviate negative effects of wd and for some parameters was the effect of wd even amplified 3 using specific vegetation and thermal indices it was feasible to separate prediction of physiological effects of wd and n nutrition and also to resolve the interactive effects of these two factors 4 the spectral and thermal indices can provide a reliable estimation of grain yield aboveground biomass and n uptake irrespective of interactions between wd and n status however when estimating the grain protein content the interactive effect of water availability should be considered acknowledgments this work was supported by nazv grant no qj1220007 and by the ministry of education youth and

11317,water and nitrogen n deficit are globally the most frequently limiting factors for agricultural crops while both often occur together to evaluate the interactive effects of water deficit and n nutrition on remote sensing data rainout shelter field experiments were conducted in winter wheat during 2013 2014 canopy spectral reflectance and infrared thermal imaging parameters were correlated to biochemical physiological morphological and production characteristics correlation analysis revealed that stomatal response to water deficit is best estimated using the npci normalized pigment chlorophyll index vegetation index and also by the cwsi crop water stress index thermal index a variety of vegetation indices can be used to estimate grain yield among which the best performing is the normalized red edge red index nreri that index shows the highest correlation irrespective of water deficit and n nutrition although none of the indices provided good detection of n content in plants the total n uptake in wheat grain was reliably estimated by the tcari osavi transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index optimized soil adjusted vegetation index the results demonstrated that utilization of n for yield or grain protein formation was largely determined by water availability and the relationships between vegetation indices and grain protein content thus have a distinct slope under water deficit in summary the spectral and thermal indices can provide satisfactory estimation irrespective of interactions between water and n deficit for grain yield n uptake and stomatal responses however when estimating the grain protein content the water availability should be considered keywords agroecosystem drought grain yield infrared thermography spectral reflectance 1 introduction water deficit wd is considered to be the main environmental factor limiting plant growth photosynthesis and productivity worldwide jones and corlett 1992 this fact will increasingly be true in the future under climate change despite the recent considerable improvement in understanding plant responses to wd several knowledge gaps can be highlighted most of these gaps relate to unknown interactions among other environmental factors from the perspective of agricultural practice the most important interaction with wd is that of nitrogen n availability n is often considered the major limiting factor after wd for plant growth and crop productivity indeed n is involved in the functioning of meristematic tissues in photosynthesis and in determining the protein content of harvested organs xu et al 2012 additionally spatial variation in soil and temporal changes in weather conditions results in high spatiotemporal variability in water and nutrient availability this in turn impacts significantly upon crop productivity and n leaching or runoff from agricultural fields to ground or surface water resources the availability of water or n can also significantly affect the input use efficiency of the counterpart factor reviewed by gonzalez dugo et al 2010 and thus modulate too the impacts on production parameters to be able to estimate in a timely manner the heterogeneity and prevent negative impacts on crop productivity and environment there is increasing demand for a robust method able to detect small changes in crop growth physiology and production parameters as a response to water or nutrient availability on relatively large areas such method also should be able to identify the major cause of such changes to optimize following crop management and inputs spectral reflectance and infrared thermography constitute the most promising approaches in remote sensing of crop canopies to detect spatial variability of either n or wd reviewed by pinter et al 2003 bandyopadhyay et al 2014 by providing both spatial and temporal information remote sensing based on spectral reflectance may function as an important source of data for site specific crop management to improve nutrient and water use efficiency and reduce n losses spectral reflectance of crop canopies in individual spectral bands is determined by various morphological structural and physiological parameters statistically significant correlations often have been found among spectral characteristics and chlorophyll content nutrition status aboveground biomass and wd reviewed by hatfield et al 2008 several vegetation indices have been used to estimate effects of wd on crop productivity and stability for example peñuelas et al 1997 developed the water index wi based on reflectance at 900 and 970 nm to estimate water status in plants in other studies different spectral indices are used for estimation of drought effects such as the photochemical reflectance index pri elsheery and cao 2008 brown pigment index bpi peñuelas et al 2004 and simple ratio or normalized difference vegetation index sr ndvi aparicio et al 2000 correspondingly several vegetation indices have been proposed for non destructive estimation of plant n status in field crops it has been demonstrated that due to the rapid saturation of vegetation indices based on reflectance in the blue and red bands merzlyak and gitelson 1995 higher linearity of response to n status and thus improved reliability of detection at medium and high levels of n supply is achieved with indices using red edge e g klem et al 2014 li et al 2014 or green gitelson et al 2003 xue et al 2004 reflectance bands however there are only isolated studies dealing with the combined effect of wd and n nutrition on canopy reflectance e g peñuelas et al 1994 the possibility for simultaneous evaluation of the wd and n status effects and their interactions in terms of the physiological responses crop yield and quality using spectral reflectance remains insufficiently explored this lack of knowledge may lead to misinterpretation in evaluating the impact of wd and undermine decision processes regarding n nutrition recently increased attention has been devoted to the use of infrared thermal imaging for detecting plant responses to wd this has included the development of several water stress indices reviewed by maes and steppe 2012 but interactions between the effect of n nutrition and wd on thermal data are yet almost unknown the primary aim of this study was therefore to examine perspective ways for simultaneous evaluation of wd and n status in winter wheat via spectral reflectance and infrared thermal imaging and to explore direct relationships of reflectance and thermal parameters with plant physiology morphology grain yield and quality we thus formulated the following hypotheses 1 wd and n deficiency both cause a similar reduction in morphometric and production parameters 2 nitrogen fertilization alleviates negative effects of wd 3 the wd and n effects on physiological parameters can be separated using specific vegetation and thermal indices 4 final grain yield and protein content can be predicted using spectral reflectance irrespective of stress type 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the experiment was conducted at two experimental sites near the municipality of banín in the czech republic babicka 49 40 4 n 16 27 5 e 460 m a s l and vetrolam 49 39 9 n 16 28 4 e 475 m a s l during two growing seasons 2013 and 2014 the location is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 7 6 c and mean sum of precipitation 629 mm long term averages 2000 2012 the soil type at the sites belongs to retisols fao soil groups plots of size 45 m2 4 5 10 m were sown with winter wheat triticum aestivum variety tiguan the sowing density was 3 5 million of germinating seeds per hectare with row distance 0 125 m the plots were separated within blocks by buffering strips of 2 m sown with winter wheat while the blocks were separated by 4 m grass strips the plots were randomized in blocks and each combination of wd and n nutrition treatment was replicated four times at each site see fig 1 for manipulating incident precipitation rainout shelters were constructed over the experimental plot the rainout shelters consisted of a wood frame covered by polycarbonate transparent strips the strips were arranged as louvers to exclude precipitation completely from the experimental plot while still enabling sufficient air movement and minimizing temperature and relative humidity artifacts the upper part 0 3 m of the side wall was also covered by polycarbonate strips to avoid an effect of horizontal precipitation the roof had a 20 incline and on its lowest side was mounted a gutter that channeled the intercepted water out of the plot a trench 0 2 m wide was dug and sheathed with a steel barrier to separate the soil of the roofed plots from the neighboring soil the rainout shelters were installed at the middle of stem elongation 8 may 2013 and 6 may 2014 to simulate wd at both sites the simulated wd lasted until early milk ripening stage 12 june 2013 and 8 june 2014 control c treatment plots without rainout shelters were exposed to natural precipitation during the experiment soil moisture and temperature were continually monitored

rain o matic meteorological pronamic denmark at the end of the wd period soil moisture had been reduced relatively by 68 and 65 in 2013 and by 41 and 32 in 2014 at the babicka and vetrolam sites respectively as compared to the control treatment 100 fig 2 the effect of n nutrition was studied at two levels control without n fertilization n0 0 kg ha 1 and with n fertilization n140 140 kg ha 1 nitrogen was applied as a liquid containing n in three forms nh4 no3 and urea in the ratio 1 1 2 dam 390 fertilizer duslo sk the n was applied in two doses april and may in 2013 and in three doses during march april in 2014 the total n dose consisted of one or two regeneration doses during tillering in 2013 and 2014 respectively and from one production dose during stem elongation two regeneration doses in 2014 were used due to slower crop development during early spring the combinations of both factors resulted in the following treatments n0 c n0 wd n140 c and n140 wd 2 2 morphometric and production analyses on 13 june 2013 and 11 june 2014 plant samples stems leaves and spikes were collected to evaluate the impact of the wd period on morphometric characteristics three stems were collected from each plot stem and spike lengths were measured as well as leaf length width area and dry weight in two leaves within the vertical plant profile flag leaf f and first leaf below flag leaf f 1 specific leaf area sla was calculated from the dry weight of leaves and leaf area at the harvest ripening stage the weight of total aboveground biomass and grain yield were determined after manually harvesting an area of 2 0 5 m2 per each plot leaves f and f 1 sampled at the time of morphological measurements and grain samples were analyzed to determine n content in dry mass using the flash 2000 elemental analyzer thermo scientific usa grain protein content was calculated from total n content using the generally accepted conversion coefficient of 5 7 for wheat 2 3

spectralon labsphere usa the reflected radiances were directly converted to spectral reflectance within the rs3 spectral acquisition software asd inc the average reflectance spectrum from two independent measurements for each plot replication was used to calculate vegetation and chlorophyll indices the calculated indices are listed in table 1 thermal airborne data were acquired using the same setup around noon on 17 june 2013 and 9 june 2014 the rainout shelters were removed at least 2 h before airborne thermal data acquisition image data were acquired using an sc 660 infrared thermal camera flir systems usa from a height of 1050 m above ground level the spatial resolution of 1 3 m was achieved uncorrected values of canopy temperature were used for further analysis the crop water stress index cwsi was calculated in accordance with jackson et al 1988 as follows cwsi tcrop tmin tmax tmin where tcrop is the actual canopy temperature in the analyzed plot tmin is the minimum and tmax the maximum canopy temperature within the experiment 2 5 statistical analysis before calculating analysis of variance the data for individual parameters were tested for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test a three way fixed effect anova model was used for the general analysis of the site water deficit and n nutrition effects to compare the differences between means within tables

reflectance or infrared thermal parameters tukey s post hoc p 0 05 test was used pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze relationships between vegetation or thermal indices and production or physiological parameters all statistical tests were conducted using statistica 12 software statsoft usa 3 results 3 1 morphometric characteristics in the present study the effect of wd and n nutrition on morphometric parameters of winter wheat was more pronounced in 2013 and at the vetrolam site for some morphometric parameters significant differences were also found in 2014 at the vetrolam site and in 2013 at the babicka site table 2 generally almost no effect of either wd or n nutrition was found at the babicka site in 2014 the effect of wd was most pronounced on total shoot dry weight as a result of simulated wd the shoot biomass was reduced by 1 and 18 in 2013 and by 27 and 8 in 2014 in the n0 and n140 treatments respectively at the vetrolam site at the babicka site the changes in total shoot biomass were 2 and 15 in 2013 and 18 and 3 in 2014 for the n0 and n140 treatments respectively thus the effect of n nutrition on wd response was opposite at both sites depending on the year in 2013 the negative effect of wd was alleviated by lower n dose n0 whereas in 2014 the alleviation of wd effect occurred at the higher n dose n140 the decrease in shoot dry weight was reflected in a reduction of morphometric parameters for individual aboveground plant parts such as stem length leaf length and leaf area while wd effect was more pronounced in stem biomass the total leaf biomass was more affected by n nutrition the morphometric parameters of flag leaf f were particularly influenced by n nutrition for example the leaf area of flag leaf was stimulated by n nutrition at the vetrolam site by 57 and 20 in 2013 and by 44 and 109 in 2014 for c and wd treatments respectively at the babicka site the effect of n nutrition on leaf area of flag leaf was much lower leaf area of f leaves changed by 46 and 8 in 2013 and by 4 and 10 in 2014 for c and wd treatments respectively the interactive effects between wd and n nutrition observed in total shoot biomass were similarly found in leaf morphometry for the combinations of year and n nutrition 2013 n0 and 2014 n140 wd caused an only small reduction or even stimulation of leaf area while in 2013 n140 and 2014 n0 wd reduced leaf area significantly and particularly at the vetrolam site 3 2 production characteristics the results of anova table 3 from both years revealed a significant effect of site on aboveground biomass and grain yield but not on grain protein content while the yield level was similar at the babicka site in both years a relatively large yield decline was recorded at the vetrolam site in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of the decline in yield at the vetrolam site the differences between sites decreased to the p 0 05 level of significance in 2014 whereas the effect of site was significant at the p 0 01 level in 2013 in addition the effect of site was the opposite in individual years while in 2013 the higher yields were recorded at the vetrolam site in 2014 yields were higher at the babicka site similar results were observed for aboveground biomass in 2013 the effect of wd was highly significant p 0 01 on the values of aboveground biomass and yield and only significant at p 0 05 for grain protein content by contrast in 2014 the impact of wd showed a highly significant effect p 0 01 only on the protein content while this effect on aboveground biomass and yield was not statistically significant effect of n nutrition on production parameters was statistically significant in both years a highly significant effect p 0 01 of n nutrition was observed on protein content in both years on grain yield in 2013 and on aboveground biomass in 2014 in the remaining cases the effect of n nutrition was significant at the level p 0 05 mutual interactions of effects of site wd and n nutrition on production characteristics were mostly statistically insignificant only in the case of grain protein content were statistically significant interactions between site and n nutrition p 0 05 and between wd and n nutrition p 0 01 observed these significant interactions however were seen only in 2013 it is evident from the figures showing mean production parameters figs 3 and 4 that in the case of aboveground biomass and grain yield the effects of n nutrition and wd were the opposite that is to say that higher n nutrition increased yield and aboveground biomass while wd decreased these production parameters conversely for protein content both factors have the same effect as higher n nutrition and wd caused protein content to increase in 2013 wd reduced the yield of the treatment n140 to the level of unfertilized treatment n0 at both sites in 2014 the impact of wd on yield and aboveground biomass was not demonstrated to be statistically significant on the other hand in 2014 the impact of wd on the grain protein content became more visible the combination of higher levels of n nutrition and wd n140 wd increased the protein content relatively by 67 and 43 as compared to the n0 c treatment whereas the effect of n nutrition itself n140 c was demonstrated by an increase in grain protein by 36 and 15 for the babicka and vetrolam sites respectively fig 4 from the figures of mean production parameters figs 3 and 4 it is also possible to summarize that the effect of n nutrition on aboveground biomass yield and grain protein content was similar in both years and at both sites the impact of wd differed between years while in 2013 the effect of wd was more pronounced on grain yield and less so on grain protein content in 2014 it was the opposite as grain yield was almost not affected by wd but the grain protein content increased significantly 3 3 gas exchange parameters water and n use efficiency both gas exchange parameters a max and gsmax show similar patterns for response to wd and n nutrition these results demonstrate interactions with year and site and generally positive effect of higher nitrogen dose n140 in 2013 and negative effect in 2014 irrespective of wd fig 5 the negative effect of wd on gas exchange parameters was altered by both year and site in 2013 a max and gsmax were more reduced at the vetrolam site and for a max the effect of wd was statistically significant only for the n0 treatment whereas for gsmax this effect was significant in the case of both n treatments in 2014 the wd effect was relatively less pronounced and statistically significant only at the babicka site for a max this effect was significant for the n0 treatment whereas for gsmax it was significant for both n treatments intrinsic water use efficiency a max gsmax and grain nitrogen use efficiency both show evident interactions with the year but not with the site fig 6 a max gsmax was increased by wd similarly for all combinations of n treatment year and site however a significant effect of wd was revealed only in isolated cases grain nitrogen use efficiency showed in all combinations of year and site its highest level under the n0 c treatment and lowest level under n140 wd this means that both higher nitrogen fertilization and water deficit decrease the grain nitrogen use efficiency comparison of years shows this effect to be more evident in 2013 3 4 spectral reflectance and infrared thermography measurements relationships with physiological and production parameters twenty five different spectral reflectance indices table 1 were calculated from the reflectance measurements at canopy level together with the cwsi index calculated from airborne thermal imaging data for each replication these values were used to analyze correlations with the most important physiological parameters related to wd effect measured at the same time or production parameters evaluated at the full ripening stage table 4 the results of correlation analysis show that both a max and gsmax were relatively well estimated using a variety of spectral indices in 2013 but not in 2014 data not shown the only vegetation index showing a significant correlation with gsmax in both years and also across both years was the normalized pigment chlorophyll index npci fig 7 e and f this index can therefore be used to evaluate the physiological response to water deficiency i e stomatal closure relationships between npci and gsmax have an inverse character and it is obvious that these relationships are less influenced by other factors such as n nutrition the cwsi thermal index showed lower correlation coefficients relative to gsmax in comparison with npci table 4 the relationship between cwsi and gsmax has an inverse character but in comparing the years 2013 and 2014 we can see that the slope changed significantly fig 8 this indicates greater difficulty in comparing results for distinct environmental conditions moreover in 2014 the effect of n nutrition on the relationship between cwsi and gsmax is noteworthy the higher n dose n140 generally showed lower gsmax values for similar cwsis both production parameters i e aboveground biomass and grain yield showed relatively strong correlations with a wide range of spectral indices table 4 the highest values of correlation coefficients across both years for grain yield were achieved for the normalized red edge red index nreri with their virtually identical slopes fig 7a and b these relationships show a very similar pattern for both years from the values of correlation coefficients table 4 it is also evident that the estimation of n content in leaves as well as grain protein content using the spectral reflectance can be very difficult in the case of some parameters statistically significant values of correlation coefficients were achieved but the correlations strongly differed between years data not shown and thus were not used for detailed regression analysis on the other hand if the amount of n in grain is expressed per ground area unit thus as n uptake by grain per hectare the correlation coefficients for a number of spectral indices increased and became significant table 4 the highest value of correlation coefficients for a summary of both years was achieved in the tcari osavi transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index optimized soil adjusted vegetation index the relationships between tcari osavi and n uptake by grain per unit area are shown in fig 7c and d these relationships exhibit virtually identical slope values which documents independence from the effect of year although the correlations between the grain protein content and spectral indices are generally not statistically significant table 4 detailed analysis of the relationships has shown that these are in many cases divided into two separate relationships for wd and control treatment these relationships are then also relatively stable when comparing between the two experimental years an example in fig 9 shows the relationships for index nreri which generally exhibits the highest correlation coefficients for relationship to grain protein content 4 discussion 4 1 morphometric characteristics although the effect of wd on plant growth is usually observed with a certain delay mathobo et al 2017 the effect on meristems is virtually instantaneous and growth reduction is regarded as the primary impact of wd tardieu et al 2011 reduced growth under wd results in reduced sink and accumulation of assimilates leading to feedback regulation of photosynthesis körner 2003 similarly n deficiency strongly reduces sink for assimilates through limited growth paul and foyer 2001 limited growth and hence reduced sink for assimilates are likely the main integrating factors determining the interactive effects of wd and n nutrition in our study the interactive effects of wd and n nutrition on morphometric parameters were dependent on year and site in 2013 wd caused more pronounced reductions of morphometric parameters under higher n availability n140 at both sites however in 2014 the effect of wd was higher under low n availability n0 and this was observed only at site vetrolam while wd effect was more pronounced in stem biomass the total leaf biomass was more affected by n nutrition lower n availability is often reported to increase drought tolerance e g arora et al 2001 on the other hand some studies have documented that higher n application can alleviate wd effects on plant growth saneoka et al 2004 these differences can be explained by different total n dose or n availability while both sub optimal and over optimal doses are suggested to reduce tolerance to wd excessive n in soil generally increases leaf area and reduces root to shoot ratio poorter et al 2012 however a slight increase of nutrient availability can stimulate root growth such patterns result in increased transpiration and the same or lower water uptake under excess n availability alleviating effect of lower n supply on morphometric parameters under drought stress was demonstrated by wu et al 2008 in sophora davidii however they also found negative effect of no n supply on drought stress sensitivity appropriate n dose can thus stimulate plant growth under wd through higher root to shoot ratio and water use efficiency accordingly the opposite interactive effects of wd and n availability on morphometric parameters in 2013 and 2014 and differences between sites in 2014 can result from different total n availability through n mineralization higher effects of wd on morphometric characteristics can thus be a sign of excessive or limiting n availability while no effect suggests appropriate n availability 4 2 production characteristics effect of wd on grain yield and aboveground biomass was in our experiment strongly influenced by year the effect of wd on aboveground biomass and yield was significant only in 2013 as is evident from the soil moisture dynamics wd in 2013 was manifested earlier and more significantly and particularly due to subsequent lower precipitation the wd persisted until the end of vegetation late wd affects grain yield mainly by reducing thousand grain weight ginkel van et al 1997 thus continued wd in 2013 probably resulted in the effect on both the number of grains per spike and the thousand grain weight and finally in a more significant wd effect on grain yield in 2013 we found slightly higher effect of wd under higher n doses accordingly barraclough et al 1989 revealed slightly lower relative grain yield reduction due to wd under lower n availability also sadras 2002 recommended reduced n doses under severe terminal drought stress as the higher n doses can reduce harvest index and grain yield although the effect of n nutrition on yield response to wd in our study was relatively low and statistically insignificant these results are in accordance with changes in intrinsic water use efficiency the higher intrinsic water use efficiency in 2014 under higher n nutrition resulted in relatively lower yield reduction as compared to 2013 in which year the yield reduction was greater for the n140 treatment in the present study no significant interactions between n nutrition and wd effects were found in the aboveground biomass and grain yield a significant interaction between the effect of n nutrition and wd was demonstrated only in grain protein content this effect was similar in 2013 and 2014 and it is evident that the effect of wd on increasing protein content is manifested more strongly under higher n dose n140 similarly gooding et al 2003 showed that grain protein content was increased by wd and particularly when wd lasted till the end of grain growth furthermore terman et al 1969 demonstrated that the effect of n nutrition on the grain protein content is to a large extent modulated by conditions for yield formation if the effect of n nutrition on yield is high then the impact on grain protein content is reduced and vice versa these facts confirm our findings which show that the grain protein content rises when higher n dose is combined with wd limiting the grain yield 4 3 gas exchange parameters water and n use efficiency similarly to production parameters the effect of wd on plant physiology was also substantially influenced by year in contrast with grain yield and aboveground biomass the physiological parameters were significantly affected only in 2014 it is obvious that weather and particularly water supply before and after the wd period are reflected in the severity of wd and thus also in growth and physiological responses however no clear interactions between the effects of wd and n availability on plant physiology were found in the present study in general very rapid response to wd is observed in stomatal conductance in addition to reduced transpiration stomatal closure also leads to a decrease in co2 assimilation rate and limitation of both primary and secondary photosynthetic processes cornic 2000 the third major manifestation of wd effect is an acceleration of plant senescence leading to a decline in chlorophyll content leaf water content and leaf area munné bosch and alegre 2000 the combined effects of wd and n availability on photosynthesis can be interconnected through regulation of sink körner 2003 and interactions between the accumulation of assimilates and abscisic acid pourtau et al 2004 the interactive effect of n nutrition and wd on physiological parameters was studied in wheat by shangguan et al 2000 they found that the effects of n nutrition on photosynthetic parameters vary according to the water availability in addition they reported that intrinsic water use efficiency was reduced significantly by drought stress in an n fertilized treatment the year also affected in our study the direction of physiological response to n supply while in 2013 n generally increased a max and gsmax in 2014 was the response to higher n dose opposite shangguan 1997 demonstrated that stomatal conductance increases with higher levels of n nutrition but simultaneously becomes also more sensitive to lack of water the higher sensitivity of stomata under higher n dose in our study thus resulted in an increase of intrinsic water use efficiency in 2014 versus 2013 in which year generally more water was available detection of real n needs to achieve optimum yields with the highest n use efficiency under specific environmental conditions is one of today s major crop production challenges because the changing conditions can significantly influence both yield potential and n use efficiency n use efficiency generally decreases with increasing n dose barraclough et al 2010 which was also confirmed in our results however n use efficiency can be also affected by environmental factors such as soil cassman et al 2002 and water availability gonzalez dugo et al 2010 or by genotype e g barraclough et al 2010 in our study we demonstrated a significant effect of year on n use efficiency which also modulated the effect of n dose the differences in n use efficiency decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 fan and li 2001 demonstrated in wheat that n use efficiency was increased by wd and diminished by the dose of n applied wd treatment generally exhibited higher n use efficiency than for irrigated treatments and this effect was more pronounced when the amount of available n was greater onillon et al 1995 on the contrary our results show a slight but consistent decrease in n use efficiency under wd wd which occurs at the beginning of grain ripening probably change the allocation of n in grain and n which cannot be used for higher yield formation under wd is stored in grain as protein gooding et al 2003 conversely n deficiency also affects water use efficiency the overall level of transpiration and water uptake from the soil reviewed by gonzalez dugo et al 2010 4 4 spectral reflectance and infrared thermography measurements relationships with physiological and production parameters distinct manifestations of wd and n nutrition impacts on plant growth and physiology are also reflected in possibilities for using remote sensing methods decline of leaf area and aboveground biomass under wd results in the decrease of vegetation indices based on the difference between red and nir bands such as ndvi aparicio et al 2002 but due to the early saturation of ndvi already at relatively low leaf area index it has been demonstrated more reliable to use indices based on reflectance in green or red edge spectral bands gitelson et al 2003 within this study the estimation of aboveground biomass and grain yield by ndvi and indices based on red edge e g nreri zm anmb650 720 and green e g ndgi bands provided similar results indicating no saturation of spectral indices at higher biomass or grain yield despite limitations due to the early saturation of ndvi at larger amounts of aboveground biomass the good estimation of the responses to wd has been confirmed by a number of studies in wheat stands e g aparicio et al 2002 gutiérrez rodríguez et al 2004 comparable estimation of wd effect on biomass and grain yield was also achieved by water index wi peñuelas et al 1997 based on reflectance at 970 nm on the contrary leaf n content protein content in grain and n uptake in grain are best estimated by red edge index nreri indicating early saturation of other indices direct estimation of the n content in leaves was nevertheless rather problematic particularly due to the large annual variability of these relationships on the other hand n uptake per unit area was reliably estimated using the nreri even when comparing results from different years diagnostics of n status in plants using spectral reflectance is usually based on very close correlation between the n and chlorophyll contents and thus on the absorption properties of chlorophylls e g yoder and pettigrew crosby 1995 within this study the npci index was proven to be the most reliable indicator of the wd effect on stomatal conductance the npci is calculated from reflectance at wavelengths 430 and 680 nm peñuelas et al 1994 and reflects primarily changes in the carotenoids chlorophylls ratio but it can also be affected by changes in the chlorophyll a b ratio due to distinct absorption of chlorophyll a and b at these two wavelengths under wd plants usually increase carotenoid levels to cope with oxidative stress munné bosch and alegre 2002 although the decrease of the chlorophyll a b ratio under wd has been demonstrated e g loggini et al 1999 in other studies an increase in the chlorophyll a b ratio has been shown alberte et al 1977 in the present study relatively high correlation coefficients for relationship to gsmax were also found for the indices pri and srpi the index pri is related particularly to the conversion of carotenoids within the xanthophyll cycle gamon et al 1992 which is crucial for protecting against the excessive light demmig adams and adams 1996 but it can be influenced too by wd thenot et al 2002 while significant progress has been made in developing spectral reflectance methods for independent detection of n nutrition and water status and these have become commercially available for agricultural practice jasper et al 2009 the interactions between n nutrition and water availability from the perspective of remote sensing remain little explored from the correlation analysis carried out for spectral reflectance and infrared thermography indices it is evident that the best vegetation indices for estimating the impact of wd on stomatal conductance e g npci are also influenced by n status moreover the best indices for estimating n status e g nreri are affected by wd thus a number of indices show significant correlation with both g smax and n uptake combined effects of wd and n nutrition on spectral reflectance were studied by schlemmer et al 2005 significant relationships with chlorophyll content at a number of reflectance wavelengths and conversely less close relationships with relative water content imply a better ability of reflectance measurements to estimate the n status our results show that the use of infrared thermal imaging index cwsi can improve the separation of wd and n nutrition effects as cwsi is less affected by n content however thermal imaging data are considerably affected by year as the canopy temperature is besides water status subjected to effects of irradiance wind speed and vapor pressure deficit jones et al 2009 5 conclusions the main objective of our study was to show perspective ways for simultaneous evaluation of wd and n status in winter wheat by spectral reflectance and infrared thermal imaging and to examine interactive effects of wd and n nutrition on relationships with plant physiology morphology grain yield and quality we can conclude that 1 among all physiological production and qualitative parameters studied the significant interactive effect of wd and n nutrition was found in grain protein content so that the effect of wd on grain protein content was more pronounced under higher n dose 2 n fertilization does not alleviate negative effects of wd and for some parameters was the effect of wd even amplified 3 using specific vegetation and thermal indices it was feasible to separate prediction of physiological effects of wd and n nutrition and also to resolve the interactive effects of these two factors 4 the spectral and thermal indices can provide a reliable estimation of grain yield aboveground biomass and n uptake irrespective of interactions between wd and n status however when estimating the grain protein content the interactive effect of water availability should be considered acknowledgments this work was supported by nazv grant no qj1220007 and by the ministry of education youth and

11318,irrigation return flow is an important and hard to estimate component of the groundwater balance equation in this study irrigation return flow from a triticale farm under sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems was investigated in arid region for the sake of accuracy high resolution both temporally and spatially datasets were provided through ten monitoring wells eight two meter deep and two six meter deep monitoring wells equipped with totally 76 soil moisture sensors moreover dual crop coefficient approach was used for estimation of evapotranspiration in each experimental field due to its adaptability with short interval data the datasets were used for calibration and validation of hydrus 1d software over about six months of triticale growth period the results showed an acceptable agreement between measured and simulated water content in each soil layer of furrow with rmse and mae equal to 0 035 and 0 031 cm3 cm3 respectively and sprinkler irrigated with rmse and mae equal to 0 024 and 0 020 cm3 cm3 respectively fields hydrus simulations were also used for estimation of irrigation return flow results showed that in furrow irrigated field about 13 3 percent of inflows including irrigation and precipitation returns back to groundwater aquifer as irrigation return flow however that was negligible in sprinkler irrigated field the rationale behind different irrigation flows obtained for each experimental field was investigated using water balance components obtained by hydrus software it was revealed that total water application depth and evapotranspiration was almost the same for both experimental fields however the intrinsic difference between the application intervals and in turn application depths in each interval provoked more irrigation return flow in furrow irrigated field eventually sensitivity assessment was done to quantify the impact of soil hydraulic parameters on return flow the results showed that the parameters which have the most impact on total amount of return flow are θ s and n for furrow irrigated field whereas in the case of sprinkler irrigated field parameters showed inconsiderable impact on return flow the fact which has root in different initial water content of each experimental field keywords irrigation return flow neishabour deep vadose zone hydrus 1d 1 introduction groundwater is usually the only source of water in arid and semi arid regions due to low amount of precipitation and lack of surface water resources therefore groundwater management in such regions is highly recommended the water balance estimation is one of the most sensitive steps in groundwater management whose critical component is commonly known as recharge rate estimation vázquez suñé et al 2005 as frequently stated in literature spelman et al 2013 irrigation is the supreme source of groundwater withdrawal in arid and semi arid regions the variable and mostly unknown percentage of applied water that flows back to the surface water resources or infiltrates into the groundwater in form of deep percolation intensifies the complexity of the problem on the other hand extending the farm areas irrigated by pressurized systems is mostly prescribed to alleviate the lack of water resources in most parts of arid zones such as iran this paradigm necessitates the study of irrigation return flow of different irrigation systems the irrigation return flow is typically defined as the excess of irrigation water that is not evapotranspirated or evacuated by direct surface drainage and which returns to an aquifer or surface water body such as lake or a stream dewandel et al 2008 jafari et al 2012a b in this paper irrigation return flow is considered as the fraction of irrigation water that infiltrates into the soil and finally reaches the groundwater although a number of studies have been conducted to optimally quantify the irrigation recharge scanlon et al 2002 the quantification of return flow under several irrigation practices still needs to be studied jiménez martínez et al 2013 however the appropriate recharge measurement methods are highly dependent of temporal and spatial scales jiménez martínez et al 2013 scanlon et al 2002 the irrigation return flow of many different crops have been investigated such as vegetables dewandel et al 2008 kim et al 2009 maréchal et al 2006 poch massegú et al 2014 especially rotation of lettuce and melon jiménez martínez et al 2009 poch massegú et al 2014 flowers dewandel et al 2008 maréchal et al 2006 grains jafari et al 2012a b and number of experiments has been conducted in paddy fields and lawns dewandel et al 2008 kang and park 2014 maréchal et al 2006 oad et al 1997 overall it is roughly limited between 50 percent for rice cultivation and about zero for micro irrigation systems e g drip irrigation and buried clay pots dewandel et al 2008 naik et al 2008 accurate determination of irrigation return flow can help hydrologists utilize the water resources efficiently and leads to optimum crop production and minimum pollution from agricultural chemicals and it in turn leads to sustainable groundwater management in arid and semi arid regions jiménez martínez et al 2013 jury and horton 2004 most of the water and soil related processes in agricultural fields occur while the soil is in unsaturated condition hillel 1998 the unsaturated soil is well known as a complicated porous media due to its temporally and spatially variable parameters consequently the unsaturated water flow in such condition is hard to measure or simulate especially when hysteresis i e the dependence of soil water content pressure head curve on whether soil is wetting or draining and root water uptake are taken into account hillel 1998 lipiec 1990 the unsaturated flow modeling has become one of the most active topics of research in hydrology and soil physics recently šimůnek et al 2008 zha et al 2017 among variety of proposed methodologies an et al 2010 an and yu 2014 mansell et al 2002 weill et al 2009 numerical simulation of transient water flow in saturated unsaturated porous media using hydrus software has been widely used in many different branches such as drip and pitcher irrigation modeling ebrahimian et al 2013 mohammad et al 2014 siyal and skaggs 2009 siyal et al 2009 skaggs et al 2004 root zone and deep vadose zone modeling jiménez martínez et al 2009 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 min et al 2015 groundwater modeling assefa and woodbury 2013 and hydrology hilten et al 2008 jandl et al 2002 twarakavi et al 2008 the objective of this paper is the investigation of irrigation return flow occurred in sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems as a representative of pressurized and surface irrigation systems respectively pressurized irrigation systems such as sprinkler and drip irrigation systems are characterized for shorter irrigation intervals and lighter irrigation applications comparing to the surface irrigation systems with long intervals and heavy application depths the substantial difference between sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems would cause different percentage of irrigation return flow this fact is going to be discussed in this paper therefore the irrigation return flow under sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems is investigated in a triticale farm a well known wheat rye hybrid guedes pinto et al 1996 in arid region through both in situ measurement and numerical modeling the rationale behind choosing triticale is its long growth period along with its adaptability to the both sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and data collection the experimental site is located at 58 39 2 e and 36 11 3 n 10 km from neishabour an irrigated agricultural area in north east of iran comprises an area of 24 ha which divided into two fields with areas of 17 and 7 ha under sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems fig 1 triticale was cultivated in both fields the annual average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are 247 4 and 2335 mm respectively the highest and lowest monthly averaged precipitations fall in march and august whose values are 51 and 0 16 mm respectively in order to monitor daily soil moisture at different depths one six meter deep to monitor deep vadose zone data for irrigation return flow and four two meter deep wells to provide additional data within the root zone and surface layer were dug in each field and equipped with water content sensors the vertical spacing of the sensors was 0 5 m and two additional sensors were installed in 15 and 30 cm beneath the soil surface to achieve more information about superficial soil and crop root zone layer the same order was used for the sensors of two meter deep wells fig 2 2 2 soil properties and sensor calibration to characterize the soil physical properties undisturbed soil clods and soil samples were taken on each experimental field up to 6 m beneath the soil surface with 0 5 m vertical intervals the samples were analyzed in the laboratory to determine bulk density paraffin coated clod method soil texture and saturated volumetric water content the experiments were done in water soil and plant laboratory of water science and engineering department agriculture faculty ferdowsi university of mashhad fum table 1 summarizes the results of the soil properties sensor calibration was performed to evaluate the sensors performance and obtain regression equations following the procedure outlined by cobos and chambers 2010 the soil samples of each soil layer obtained from ten monitoring wells were mixed together to achieve an average soil texture of experimental field subsequently mixed soil samples spread on a thin layer of a plastic sheet to make air drying faster the large clods were broken up and soil samples were passed through a standard no 10 sieve with 2 mm nominal sieve opening to prevent heterogeneous soil particles some drainable containers were perforated to make the respiration drying and saturation process uniform the soil samples were oven dried at 105 ºc for 24 h kirkham 2004 then they were removed and weighed precisely in the laboratory the rec rotubat 1 1 rotubat is a persian word which means moisture electrical conductivity sensors were inserted vertically into the center of soil containers so that they were surrounded by soil for a radius of about 7 5 cm the depth of soil beneath the sensor probes was about 10 cm then soil containers were saturated weighed and the saturated moisture content was recorded the sensor readings were recorded daily and soil container were weighed simultaneously up to the time that the difference between soil container weights which is corresponding to the soil moisture of some consecutive days 7 days became negligible then the volumetric soil moisture content calculated and compared with the sensor readings for each soil layer the regression equations of calibrated soil water content for translation of sensor readings to water content for each soil layer were obtained separately fig 3 compares the soil moisture values obtained by regression functions with the data measured in the laboratory for the whole soil layers the triticale seeds were sown on november 1 2012 and coincident daily soil moisture measurement continued to april 22 2013 harvest day for biomass of triticale in both sprinkler and furrow irrigated fields the installation of moisture sensors had been completed about 30 days before sowing date the daily meteorological data were collected from a synoptic weather station located 10 km far from the experimental site a volumetric water meter installed for each irrigation system separately to measure the applied water to each of the experimental fields 2 3 numerical modeling in this paper hydrus 1d is used for simulation of saturated unsaturated water flow within the soil šimůnek et al 2013 the governing equation for 1d saturated unsaturated water flow in porous media is known as richards equation richards 1931 in this study the mixed form of richards equation is adopted assuming negligible hysteresis effect and thermal gradients jury and horton 2004 1 θ t z k h z 1 s where θ denotes volumetric water content l 3 l 3 h is soil water pressure head l k represents unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 t is time t z vertical space coordinate l and s is indicative of sink term l 3 l 3 t 1 the soil water content pressure head curve θ h and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h are described with van genuchten van genuchten 1980 model as follows 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 3 k h k s s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 w h e r e m 1 1 n n 1 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where s e is effective saturation l 3 l 3 θ s and θ r are saturated and residual water contents l 3 l 3 α l 1 m and n are empirical fitting parameters whose values depend on the soil properties k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 the constant parameters of van genuchten s model were estimated using rosetta schaap et al 2001 and retc leij et al 1989 van genuchten et al 1991 codes stands for retention curve rosetta is a well known neural network based software used for estimating soil hydraulic parameters schaap et al 2001 the retc software iteratively fits a number of analytical functions to find the optimum values of van genuchten parameters using least squares objective function radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 the sink term s was specified by a macroscopic approach of root water uptake proposed by šimůnek and hopmans 2009 in which the 1d non compensated actual root water uptake is obtained from the potential root water uptake s p l 3 l 3 t 1 through multiplication with a stress response function α as follows 5 s h o h z t α h o h z t s p t where s is proposed as a function of soil water h and osmotic h o pressure heads l non compensated root water uptake is used herein critical water stress index equals to 1 as triticale is not a phreatophyte and whose maximum rooting depth is about 1 m the stress response function is commonly described as a piecewise defined function in terms of soil water pressure head feddes et al 1978 jiménez martínez et al 2009 jiménez martínez et al 2013 poch massegú et al 2014 6 α h h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 0 h h 4 o r h h 1 where h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are pressure head threshold parameters l the stress response function is maximum between h 2 and h 3 pressure heads and falls down linearly to zero above h 1 anaerobiosis point and below h 4 due to oxygen deficiency and wilting point suction respectively in this study the root water uptake parameters proposed by wesseling et al 1991 are used for triticale table 2 the effect of soil salinity is assumed to be negligible in this study as soil and water quality samples showed an average of 2 83 and 2 24 d s m on the region respectively non uniform distribution of the potential root water uptake can be described as follows 7 s p t b z t t p t where b is the 1d normalized water uptake distribution function l 1 and t p is the potential transpiration rate l t 1 in this study the normalized water uptake distribution function proposed by hoffman and van genuchten 1983 is used 8 b z 1 6667 l r z l 0 2 l r 2 0833 l r 1 l z l r l l r z l 0 2 l r 0 z l 0 2 l r where l is equal to the total depth of soil which is intended to be simulated l and l r is maximum root depth l as seen eq 8 describes a time independent water distribution over root zone the value of l r is assumed to be 1 m allen et al 1998 about calibration of the model it should be stated that as water content was only measured during one year of cultivation we could not allocate a part of our data to calibration and another to validation this is widespread approach observed in the literature such as min et al 2015 although there were five monitoring wells in each of the experimental fields none of them could be chosen as a representative of the whole field because of the situation of the monitoring wells some different variations of water content during the experiment was observed in each soil layer of the five monitoring wells this fact would result in unsatisfactory calibrated soil hydraulic parameters the other option was using inverse solution in the 6 m deep monitoring well this option was also doomed to failure as the number of parameters were too many at least 4 parameters for 12 soil layers at table 4 that made it an extremely hard if not impossible approach hydrus allows users to optimize only up to 15 parameters finally since authors directly used the parameters obtained by rosetta and retc as input for hydrus software but they led to unsatisfactory results but not poor consequently these parameters were used as an initial guess for the calibration process as mentioned above we failed to use some of the available calibration methods therefore we decided to calibrate the constant parameters of van genuchten functions manually by means of changing the parameters obtained by retc and rosetta softwares saturated hydraulic conductivity k s could only be determined by rosetta up to when we reached a satisfactory accuracy the rmse and mae errors less than or equal to 0 035 for the water content of 6 m deep soil block during the experiment was chosen as a satisfactory accuracy threshold the value 0 035 was chosen considering rmse and mae of the simulations of similar papers in the literature such as naylor et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 among others if the van genuchten parameters led the rmse and mae indexes to meet the threshold those parameters were chosen as calibrated parameters 2 4 initial and boundary conditions eq 1 is a second order nonlinear partial differential equation that necessitates the knowledge of initial and two boundary conditions in this study the upper and lower boundary conditions were specified as atmospheric and free drainage boundaries respectively the rationale behind setting free drainage condition for lower boundary is that the depth of groundwater table during the growing season was more than 60 m atmospheric boundary condition is a system dependent boundary condition šimůnek et al 2013 meaning an air soil interface whose flow through is controlled by surrounding phenomenon e g precipitation and evaporation radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 the hydrus software uses a specified flux boundary condition in which the absolute value of prescribed flux is constrained from exceeding the maximum potential rate of evaporation or infiltration e ˆ moreover the pressure head at soil air interface h i n t must lie between two threshold values h a and h s which are constant or variable minimum and maximum pressure heads if one of the limits which are mathematically formulated as eqs 9 and 10 is exceeded the boundary condition will result in constant head boundary type using a limiting pressure head at the surface that is equal to the atmospheric pressure head edlefsen and anderson 1943 9 k h h z 1 e ˆ 10 h a h i n t h s free drainage describes a boundary condition along which hydraulic gradient is considered as zero eq 11 11 h x 0 initial condition was set equal to the arithmetic mean of five measured water content values at each soil layer recorded on november 1 2012 by soil moisture sensors in each of the sprinkler or furrow irrigated fields note that arithmetic mean was only calculated for the sensors installed less deep than 2 m 2 5 evapotranspiration dual crop coefficient approach atmospheric boundary condition necessitates specifying the daily irrigation and precipitation rates as well as potential evapotranspiration jiménez martínez et al 2009 herein potential evapotranspiration rate is calculated using dual crop coefficient approach proposed by allen et al 1998 12 e t p t k c e t o t k c b t k e t e t o t where k c b is basal crop coefficient k e is soil evaporation coefficient and e t o is reference evapotranspiration rate e t o the reference evapotranspiration rate was calculated using fao penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 the rationale behind employing dual crop coefficient procedure is its strength over single crop coefficient approach for calculation of e t p on daily basis tolk and howell 2001 that is mainly because dual crop coefficient approach employs a dynamic soil evaporation coefficient rather than an average value as is used in single crop coefficient approach therefore dual crop coefficient approach results in improved predictions of evapotranspiration after specific wetting events the fact that some models fail to capture in their simulations e g ziaei and sepaskhah 2003 in this study the data provided by allen et al 1998 and field observations are used to specify crop coefficient values and length of four growth stages i e initial crop development mid season and late season stages the basal crop coefficient values of mid season and late season were then adjusted for local climatic conditions and the mean plant height at each stage the variation of plant height was estimated using richards function richards 1959 which is a well known s shaped function commonly used for modeling plant growth gregorczyk 1998 the initial value of plant height at sowing time november 1 2012 is set to zero the function asymptotically approaches to the maximum plant height which is assumed to be 1 m herein for triticale table 3 shows the adjusted crop coefficients and the length of each growth stage used in this study the dynamic variations of soil evaporation coefficient was also obtained considering the fraction of the soil that is both exposed and wetted maximum expected value for crop coefficient and soil water content at the surficial soil layer 0 1 m following the instructions of allen et al 1998 hydrus software is able to calculate potential evaporation and transpiration rates separately according to ritchie 1972 the potential evaporation rate can be calculated through given potential evapotranspiration rate and leaf area index lai as 13 e p t e t p t e x p β l a i t where β is known as radiation extinction coefficient which is commonly assumed to be 0 39 e g jiménez martínez et al 2009 and lai was measured during the experiment fig 4 eventually the potential transpiration rate is easy to compute by subtracting potential evaporation rate from potential evapotranspiration rate eq 14 14 t p t e t p t e p t 2 6 soil hydraulic parameters in order to obtain soil water retention curve soil water content at five suction values for each soil texture was measured using a pressure plate extractor i e the suction values at which water content was determined differed for each sample depending on the soil type subsequently the parameters of van genuchten s model were predicted by rosetta and retc softwares using percentage of soil texture particles bulk density and soil water content at aforementioned pressure heads as input data in most cases the retc software was not able to calculate the value of θ r on the other hand using water retention data saturated hydraulic conductivity is not obtained therefore combined results of retc and rosetta used table 4 shows the predicted parameters of van genuchten s model for the soil layers 2 7 water balance computation and water use efficiency the water balance equation can be expressed as 15 r i p e a c t a c s r u w e n d w s t a r t where i is the water applied through irrigation system l p is precipitation l e a c and t a c are actual evaporation and transpiration respectively l ru is runoff l s denotes lateral seepage flow l w e n d w s t a r t is variation of soil water content from the beginning to the end of experiment l and r is the amount of recharge l herein the runoff and lateral seepage flow parameters were assumed to be negligible due to nature of experimental area and vertical water movement water use efficiency wue could gain information about performance of irrigation system on the two experimental fields the focus in this paper is not on agronomical aspects and this is why wue was only estimated using hydrus simulations and following formulae wue kg m 3 can be calculated using following equation proposed by andarzian et al 2011 as follows 16 w u e y a c e t a c and actual yield y a c can be calculated using a well known equation introduced in the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 66 steduto et al 2012 as follows 17 1 y a c y m a x k y 1 e t a c e t p where y a c is the actual yield corresponding to actual evapotranspiration e t a c y m a x is the maximum possible yield corresponding to potential evapotranspiration e t p and k y is the yield response factor the value of k y was assumed to be 0 94 for both experimental fields this value is the average of the values proposed by fao irrigation and drainage paper no 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and iaea international atomic energy agency austria fao 2002 that suggested k y 1 and k y 0 87 respectively e t a c and e t p values were obtained using calculations of evapotranspiration and hydrus simulations respectively for determining y m a x we considered measured data presented in andarzian et al 2011 haghverdi et al 2014 mohammadi et al 2013 and mohammadi et al 2015 and finally we chose y m a x 6500 k g h a 3 results and discussion with the above mentioned parameters section 2 7 actual yield came out to be 5492 and 5287 k g h a and using eq 16 wue resulted in 1 30 and 1 28 k g m 3 grain yield for furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields respectively consequently wue shows almost the same yield for each of the experimental fields andarzian et al 2011 made a comprehensive study on spring wheat chamran cultivar sown in november in ahvaz khuzestan province of iran and obtained wue for different scenarios of deficit irrigation since the cultivation in this study is under deficit irrigation wues of the second scenario of andarzian et al 2011 was chosen this scenario shows medium deficit irrigation wue values ranged between 1 37 to 1 62 k g m 3 moreover mohammadi et al 2015 calculated wue using measured and simulated data with aquacrop for spring wheat in mashhad khorasan razavi province iran they had different salinity and drought stress scenarios we chose results obtained for the scenario with 35 percent drought stress the percentage of applied water to the full irrigation was 65 and water electrical conductivity of 0 5 ds m for irrigation water as it was the closest scenario to our study wue in this case was 0 9 k g m 3 finally mohammadi et al 2013 investigated the optimization of crop yield of winter wheat under different scenarios of salinity and drought stress in barkhar region isfahan province iran using limited measured data and comprehensive simulations with swap software their simulations with swap software consisted of different irrigation depths ranging from 80 to 120 mm and different maximum allowable depletion mad coefficients 0 3 0 8 and water salinity levels 2 6 ds m they also simulated wue under current irrigation and cultivation conditions maximum wue obtained for the scenario with 80 mm irrigation depth 2 ds m water salinity and mad equal to 0 7 which came out to be about 0 61 k g m 3 for the scenario describing current situation wue was about 0 45 k g m 3 fig 5 a shows precipitation and irrigation events for each experimental field irrigation depths and intervals are based on common irrigation scheduling in the region total precipitation from november 1 2012 to april 22 2013 was 200 3 mm and total irrigation depth for furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems were 114 9 and 102 1 mm carried out through three and five irrigation applications respectively fig 5 b shows the variation of potential evapotranspiration of each experimental field total potential evapotranspiration for furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems was 505 3 and 514 0 mm respectively the slight difference between the evapotranspiration of the fields stems from the dissimilar wetted soil surface fraction of each irrigation system that may affect the water balance of the topsoil layer wetted soil surface fraction of furrow and sprinkler irrigation system is considered to be 0 6 and 1 0 respectively allen et al 1998 3 1 deep vadose zone water content monitoring the comparison of soil water content data recorded daily during the growth period of triticale under each irrigation system by soil moisture sensors with hydrus simulated values is shown in figs 6 and 7 for furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems respectively at typical soil depths the simulated and measured data shown in figs 6 and 7 start from the beginning of the on field measurements the day seeds were sown on each experimental fields on november 1 2012 up to the end of the experiment when the triticale was harvested on april 22 2013 as the soil samples by which moisture sensors calibrated were the mixture of soil obtained from digging ten monitoring wells for the validation of simulation results of the soil layers upper than two meters in figs 6 and 7 the soil water content measurements are the arithmetic average of the values obtained from the five monitoring wells lied in furrow or sprinkler irrigated fields an acceptable agreement is generally observed between simulated and measured data under both irrigation systems figs 6 and 7 not surprisingly the soil moisture fluctuations are relatively extreme within topsoil layers especially after precipitation or irrigation events increasing soil depth the amplitude of peaks dampened and reached a monotonous trend in deep soil layers furthermore it can be observed that deep layers of the sprinkler irrigated field are dryer than those of furrow irrigated field this fact can result in more irrigation return flow in furrow irrigated field eventually figs 6 and 7 show that hydrus software can simulate the whole process in the different soil layers with an acceptable accuracy 3 2 goodness of fit measures calculated goodness of fit measures namely root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae is shown in table 5 the measures are categorized into two soil zones namely root zone soil layers shallower than 2 ms and deep zone soil layers deeper than 2 to highlight the effect of number of monitoring wells on the concision of results the overall error of 0 033 and 0 022 for simulated water content during experiment for furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields respectively expresses an acceptable accuracy in both measurements and determination of constant parameters in comparison to the literature e g wang et al 2016 the error measures of furrow irrigated field show an adverse change by stepping from root zone into the deep zone this fact may have root in decreasing the number of monitoring wells from five to one on the other hand in sprinkler irrigated field a converse trend is observed this contrast can be justified by referring to the fluctuations of water content in each field 3 3 soil water balance and calculation of irrigation return flow the soil water balance components during the experiment is investigated in this section using eq 15 the amount of water passed across the 6 m deep soil layer is considered as groundwater recharge or irrigation return flow table 6 shows the water components of 6 m deep soil block for both furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields as shown about 13 of water input including precipitation and irrigation passes across the 6 m deep soil layer in furrow irrigated filed whereas in the sprinkler irrigated area the amount of irrigation return flow is negligible considering table 6 applied water to the furrow irrigated field was 13 mm more than sprinkler irrigated field however the actual evapotranspiration of sprinkler irrigated field was 10 mm less than furrow irrigated field therefore we concluded that the more water applied in the furrow irrigated field was compensated by more actual evapotranspiration on the other hand this fact should be considered that the two experimental fields were under cultivation before the start of the experiment with the same irrigation system at spring and summer the experimental fields owned by a farmer mr mohammadi and it did not belong to ferdowsi university of mashhad fum and authors had no measurement of the water applied on the field in the previous cultivations therefore the factor justifying the difference between recharge from the two fields is the initial water content w s t a r t in table 6 as can be seen in table 6 total amount of water in the furrow irrigated field at the beginning and at the end of the experiment is more than that of sprinkler irrigated field and it can result in a different recharge rate in the fields however authors believe that the impact of the initial water content in this study was temporary as shown in fig 8 a the comprehensive discussion about fig 8 a is mentioned below recharge rate is decreasing at the beginning of the experiment this part of the recharge rate can be attributed to the antecedent water inputs but it starts increasing the part of the recharge rate which can be attributed to the water inputs applied during the experiment after 80th day finally it should be mentioned that the impact of initial water content was not quantified in this study and it remains ongoing for further investigations in the future authors believe that an experiment consisting of double cropping agro system including winter and spring cultivations could be informative as it reveals the missing data of the current study fig 8 a devoted to variations of soil water balance components in furrow irrigated filed at the beginning of the growing season there is scarce crop cover on the field fig 4 and transpiration is negligible and evaporation is the dominant mechanism at the soil surface at this period of the growing season precipitation and irrigation is negligible therefore decreasing recharge rate can be observed at the beginning of the experiment in the subsequent days between 40 and 80 considerable irrigation and precipitation events occur on the experimental field and make the recharge rate to stop decreasing at this period of time since 80th day onward transpiration rate starts playing an important role and even after 120th day transpiration rate outweigh evaporation rate as crop cover is increasing dramatically with time fig 4 recharge rate starts increasing after 80th day regarding several water inputs applied on the field the same process can be observed for evaporation and transpiration rates in sprinkler irrigated field fig 8 b however considering less water content at the soil layers of this field comparing to furrow irrigated field figs 6 and 7 recharge rate is almost zero at the beginning of the growing season onward an analysis of water balance components in table 6 along with the detail of irrigation applications depicted in figs 5 and 8 clarifies the difference between the amount of irrigation return flow in each experimental field at the first look the difference between water input and evapotranspiration of each field may sound the determining factor for dissimilar recharge as mentioned above the more water input applied through furrow irrigation system comparing to sprinkler irrigation system is roughly compensated by more actual evapotranspiration in furrow irrigated field therefore considerable difference irrigation return flow lies in the depth and intervals of irrigation applications the same total depth of irrigation is applied on each experimental field however it is spread over five events on sprinkler irrigated field whereas in the case of furrow irrigation there are just three applications as shown in fig 5 on december 28 2012 58th day after start the two experimental fields irrigated simultaneously it was the first irrigation event for furrow irrigated field in contrast to sprinkler irrigated which had been irrigated once more on december 18 2012 48th day after start however application depth of furrow irrigated field was 28 5 mm comparing to that of sprinkler irrigated field whose sum for the first and second irrigation events was 31 3 mm nevertheless the variations of irrigation return flow starts to increase after january 11 2013 72nd day after start but no change can be seen in that of sprinkler irrigated field to wrap up longer irrigation intervals with heavier applications in furrow irrigated field led to more irrigation return flow comparing to when short irrigation intervals applied with lighter depth at the first days of the experiment recharge rate in the furrow irrigated field expresses a decreasing rate fig 8 a this fact can be attributed to the lack of irrigation and shallow precipitation less than 7 mm during this period there were just two rainfalls on december 12 2012 and december 17 2012 whose depth were 17 and 18 mm respectively 3 4 sensitivity assessment of soil hydraulic parameters in this part the sensitivity of the simulated total irrigation return flow to the hydraulic parameters of soil layers is assessed by making a perturbation of 5 10 15 a n d 20 in each of the parameters for all soil layers at the same time the starting values baseline of the van genuchten function parameters were calibrated parameters shown in table 4 this approach has been employed in preceding papers about estimation of groundwater recharge due to the lack of knowledge about parameter variability and correlation structure jiménez martínez et al 2009 lu et al 2011 min et al 2015 the rationale behind sensitivity assessment of the parameters is to disclose which parameter s have more impact on the recharge and how large is this impact within each of the experimental fields fig 9 shows the percentage of enhancement or reduction in total irrigation return flow for both furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields due to incremental decremental perturbation in input parameters in fig 9 a the sensitivity assessment of furrow irrigated field is illustrated perturbation on parameters θ r α and k s shows low impact on total irrigation return flow as perturbation of 20 in each of the parameters resulted in about 13 change in total irrigation return flow however high sensitivity obtained for θ s and n as 20 change in θ s and 20 change in n caused a perturbation of 387 and 357 in total irrigation return flow the maximum reduction in total irrigation return flow is also caused by n and θ s with a change of about 90 for 10 perturbation in n and 20 perturbation in θ s higher sensitivity of model to θ s and n shown herein is consistent with findings by min et al 2015 lu et al 2011 and szymkiewicz et al 2018 it shall be mentioned that for decremental perturbations of 15 and 20 in no acceptable result was obtained due to model divergence caused by a well known problem for n 1 regarding the intensive change in θ s and n whose justification is mentioned in the next paragraphs it sounds difficult to make a certain prediction further investigation and more comprehensive data sounds necessary to reveal more facts in this concept in fig 9 b the sensitivity assessment of sprinkler irrigated field is illustrated in the contrary of what observed for furrow irrigated field total irrigation return flow do not show any systematic dependence on the soil hydraulic parameters although some dramatic changes occurred in total irrigation return flow for perturbations of θ r and n they are not large enough to make a considerable change in the negligible amount of recharge flow calculated from sprinkler irrigated field in all cases for the sprinkler irrigation absolute values of recharge were in the order of 10 6 10 8 therefore in all cases recharge value is still negligible the large difference between the values for the two fields can be attributed to the initial condition furrow irrigated field had more water content at the beginning because both fields were under cultivation before the experiment at spring and summer with the same irrigation systems and consequently they had different initial water contents in almost all layers therefore when θ s is perturbed negatively i e θ s is reduced by a particular percentage soil layers approach to saturation point and there would be no capacity for additional influxes irrigation and precipitation to be retained in the soil and consequently recharge increases dramatically on the contrary soil layers in the sprinkler irrigated field are much drier than the field under furrow irrigation and this fact resulted in more capacity for water to be retained and in turn less change in recharge an investigation among some of the papers published in the same concept as the current study showed that the change obtained for recharge as result of perturbation in k s sounds acceptable jiménez martínez et al 2009 reported a change of 7 15 in recharge when considering 10 perturbation for k s θ s α and n they did not mention any specific change in recharge for each of the mentioned constant parameters and only stated the interval 7 15 min et al 2015 performed the same approach as jiménez martínez et al 2009 for sensitivity assessment of the van genuchten parameters and their results showed less than 4 change in recharge for 10 perturbation of k s lu et al 2011 reported 18 and 15 change in recharged as result of 50 and 50 perturbation of k s respectively in this study 10 perturbation of k s caused about 6 change in recharge in order to consider the effect of n on recharge it is useful to see its effect on water retention curve fig 10 shows the variations of water retention curve with respect to perturbation of n in van genuchten s model for the first layer of soil i e 0 50 centimeters the percentages are the same as what used in sensitivity assessment section as seen with increasing n water retention curve drops more dramatically at low suction heads in other words with a slight change in pressure head much more amount of water would be drained from the soil pores therefore with an enhancement in n recharge will be increase 4 conclusions the irrigation return flow from a triticale farm under 17 ha of sprinkler and 7 ha of furrow irrigation systems in an arid region was investigated measured data within deep vadose zone 6 m is provided for about six month using one six meter deep and four two meter deep monitoring wells in each field hydrus 1d package is employed for the simulation of water flow and root water uptake in this paper agronomical factors such as estimated actual yield and wue showed almost the same values for the two irrigation systems the estimated values found to be consistent with the data in the literature the comparison of the results obtained for water content in both furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields for different soil layers showed an encouraging agreement between measured and simulated values the investigation of water balance components within six meter deep soil block illuminated that using the same total amount of water input including precipitation and irrigation and evapotranspiration in each field about 13 percent of water in furrow irrigated field returns back to the groundwater resources whereas it is negligible for the field under sprinkler irrigation system the key factor for the difference between two fields can be attributed to the depth and intervals of irrigation applications shorter intervals with lighter irrigation depth did not make infiltrated water to pass across 6 meter deep layer which is assumed as irrigation return flow herein on the contrary long irrigation intervals of furrow irrigation system imposed water to flow within the deep zone layer and return back to the groundwater table these results show that extending areas under pressurized irrigation systems without limiting the groundwater exploitation amount will intensify the groundwater drawdown finally sensitivity assessment of the parameters showed that there is a need for further investigation about recharge with more comprehensive data including spring and winter cultivation seasons as total recharge was sensitive about θ s and n that were shown to be affected by initial water content 
11318,irrigation return flow is an important and hard to estimate component of the groundwater balance equation in this study irrigation return flow from a triticale farm under sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems was investigated in arid region for the sake of accuracy high resolution both temporally and spatially datasets were provided through ten monitoring wells eight two meter deep and two six meter deep monitoring wells equipped with totally 76 soil moisture sensors moreover dual crop coefficient approach was used for estimation of evapotranspiration in each experimental field due to its adaptability with short interval data the datasets were used for calibration and validation of hydrus 1d software over about six months of triticale growth period the results showed an acceptable agreement between measured and simulated water content in each soil layer of furrow with rmse and mae equal to 0 035 and 0 031 cm3 cm3 respectively and sprinkler irrigated with rmse and mae equal to 0 024 and 0 020 cm3 cm3 respectively fields hydrus simulations were also used for estimation of irrigation return flow results showed that in furrow irrigated field about 13 3 percent of inflows including irrigation and precipitation returns back to groundwater aquifer as irrigation return flow however that was negligible in sprinkler irrigated field the rationale behind different irrigation flows obtained for each experimental field was investigated using water balance components obtained by hydrus software it was revealed that total water application depth and evapotranspiration was almost the same for both experimental fields however the intrinsic difference between the application intervals and in turn application depths in each interval provoked more irrigation return flow in furrow irrigated field eventually sensitivity assessment was done to quantify the impact of soil hydraulic parameters on return flow the results showed that the parameters which have the most impact on total amount of return flow are θ s and n for furrow irrigated field whereas in the case of sprinkler irrigated field parameters showed inconsiderable impact on return flow the fact which has root in different initial water content of each experimental field keywords irrigation return flow neishabour deep vadose zone hydrus 1d 1 introduction groundwater is usually the only source of water in arid and semi arid regions due to low amount of precipitation and lack of surface water resources therefore groundwater management in such regions is highly recommended the water balance estimation is one of the most sensitive steps in groundwater management whose critical component is commonly known as recharge rate estimation vázquez suñé et al 2005 as frequently stated in literature spelman et al 2013 irrigation is the supreme source of groundwater withdrawal in arid and semi arid regions the variable and mostly unknown percentage of applied water that flows back to the surface water resources or infiltrates into the groundwater in form of deep percolation intensifies the complexity of the problem on the other hand extending the farm areas irrigated by pressurized systems is mostly prescribed to alleviate the lack of water resources in most parts of arid zones such as iran this paradigm necessitates the study of irrigation return flow of different irrigation systems the irrigation return flow is typically defined as the excess of irrigation water that is not evapotranspirated or evacuated by direct surface drainage and which returns to an aquifer or surface water body such as lake or a stream dewandel et al 2008 jafari et al 2012a b in this paper irrigation return flow is considered as the fraction of irrigation water that infiltrates into the soil and finally reaches the groundwater although a number of studies have been conducted to optimally quantify the irrigation recharge scanlon et al 2002 the quantification of return flow under several irrigation practices still needs to be studied jiménez martínez et al 2013 however the appropriate recharge measurement methods are highly dependent of temporal and spatial scales jiménez martínez et al 2013 scanlon et al 2002 the irrigation return flow of many different crops have been investigated such as vegetables dewandel et al 2008 kim et al 2009 maréchal et al 2006 poch massegú et al 2014 especially rotation of lettuce and melon jiménez martínez et al 2009 poch massegú et al 2014 flowers dewandel et al 2008 maréchal et al 2006 grains jafari et al 2012a b and number of experiments has been conducted in paddy fields and lawns dewandel et al 2008 kang and park 2014 maréchal et al 2006 oad et al 1997 overall it is roughly limited between 50 percent for rice cultivation and about zero for micro irrigation systems e g drip irrigation and buried clay pots dewandel et al 2008 naik et al 2008 accurate determination of irrigation return flow can help hydrologists utilize the water resources efficiently and leads to optimum crop production and minimum pollution from agricultural chemicals and it in turn leads to sustainable groundwater management in arid and semi arid regions jiménez martínez et al 2013 jury and horton 2004 most of the water and soil related processes in agricultural fields occur while the soil is in unsaturated condition hillel 1998 the unsaturated soil is well known as a complicated porous media due to its temporally and spatially variable parameters consequently the unsaturated water flow in such condition is hard to measure or simulate especially when hysteresis i e the dependence of soil water content pressure head curve on whether soil is wetting or draining and root water uptake are taken into account hillel 1998 lipiec 1990 the unsaturated flow modeling has become one of the most active topics of research in hydrology and soil physics recently šimůnek et al 2008 zha et al 2017 among variety of proposed methodologies an et al 2010 an and yu 2014 mansell et al 2002 weill et al 2009 numerical simulation of transient water flow in saturated unsaturated porous media using hydrus software has been widely used in many different branches such as drip and pitcher irrigation modeling ebrahimian et al 2013 mohammad et al 2014 siyal and skaggs 2009 siyal et al 2009 skaggs et al 2004 root zone and deep vadose zone modeling jiménez martínez et al 2009 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 min et al 2015 groundwater modeling assefa and woodbury 2013 and hydrology hilten et al 2008 jandl et al 2002 twarakavi et al 2008 the objective of this paper is the investigation of irrigation return flow occurred in sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems as a representative of pressurized and surface irrigation systems respectively pressurized irrigation systems such as sprinkler and drip irrigation systems are characterized for shorter irrigation intervals and lighter irrigation applications comparing to the surface irrigation systems with long intervals and heavy application depths the substantial difference between sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems would cause different percentage of irrigation return flow this fact is going to be discussed in this paper therefore the irrigation return flow under sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems is investigated in a triticale farm a well known wheat rye hybrid guedes pinto et al 1996 in arid region through both in situ measurement and numerical modeling the rationale behind choosing triticale is its long growth period along with its adaptability to the both sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and data collection the experimental site is located at 58 39 2 e and 36 11 3 n 10 km from neishabour an irrigated agricultural area in north east of iran comprises an area of 24 ha which divided into two fields with areas of 17 and 7 ha under sprinkler and furrow irrigation systems fig 1 triticale was cultivated in both fields the annual average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are 247 4 and 2335 mm respectively the highest and lowest monthly averaged precipitations fall in march and august whose values are 51 and 0 16 mm respectively in order to monitor daily soil moisture at different depths one six meter deep to monitor deep vadose zone data for irrigation return flow and four two meter deep wells to provide additional data within the root zone and surface layer were dug in each field and equipped with water content sensors the vertical spacing of the sensors was 0 5 m and two additional sensors were installed in 15 and 30 cm beneath the soil surface to achieve more information about superficial soil and crop root zone layer the same order was used for the sensors of two meter deep wells fig 2 2 2 soil properties and sensor calibration to characterize the soil physical properties undisturbed soil clods and soil samples were taken on each experimental field up to 6 m beneath the soil surface with 0 5 m vertical intervals the samples were analyzed in the laboratory to determine bulk density paraffin coated clod method soil texture and saturated volumetric water content the experiments were done in water soil and plant laboratory of water science and engineering department agriculture faculty ferdowsi university of mashhad fum table 1 summarizes the results of the soil properties sensor calibration was performed to evaluate the sensors performance and obtain regression equations following the procedure outlined by cobos and chambers 2010 the soil samples of each soil layer obtained from ten monitoring wells were mixed together to achieve an average soil texture of experimental field subsequently mixed soil samples spread on a thin layer of a plastic sheet to make air drying faster the large clods were broken up and soil samples were passed through a standard no 10 sieve with 2 mm nominal sieve opening to prevent heterogeneous soil particles some drainable containers were perforated to make the respiration drying and saturation process uniform the soil samples were oven dried at 105 ºc for 24 h kirkham 2004 then they were removed and weighed precisely in the laboratory the rec rotubat 1 1 rotubat is a persian word which means moisture electrical conductivity sensors were inserted vertically into the center of soil containers so that they were surrounded by soil for a radius of about 7 5 cm the depth of soil beneath the sensor probes was about 10 cm then soil containers were saturated weighed and the saturated moisture content was recorded the sensor readings were recorded daily and soil container were weighed simultaneously up to the time that the difference between soil container weights which is corresponding to the soil moisture of some consecutive days 7 days became negligible then the volumetric soil moisture content calculated and compared with the sensor readings for each soil layer the regression equations of calibrated soil water content for translation of sensor readings to water content for each soil layer were obtained separately fig 3 compares the soil moisture values obtained by regression functions with the data measured in the laboratory for the whole soil layers the triticale seeds were sown on november 1 2012 and coincident daily soil moisture measurement continued to april 22 2013 harvest day for biomass of triticale in both sprinkler and furrow irrigated fields the installation of moisture sensors had been completed about 30 days before sowing date the daily meteorological data were collected from a synoptic weather station located 10 km far from the experimental site a volumetric water meter installed for each irrigation system separately to measure the applied water to each of the experimental fields 2 3 numerical modeling in this paper hydrus 1d is used for simulation of saturated unsaturated water flow within the soil šimůnek et al 2013 the governing equation for 1d saturated unsaturated water flow in porous media is known as richards equation richards 1931 in this study the mixed form of richards equation is adopted assuming negligible hysteresis effect and thermal gradients jury and horton 2004 1 θ t z k h z 1 s where θ denotes volumetric water content l 3 l 3 h is soil water pressure head l k represents unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 t is time t z vertical space coordinate l and s is indicative of sink term l 3 l 3 t 1 the soil water content pressure head curve θ h and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h are described with van genuchten van genuchten 1980 model as follows 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 3 k h k s s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 w h e r e m 1 1 n n 1 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where s e is effective saturation l 3 l 3 θ s and θ r are saturated and residual water contents l 3 l 3 α l 1 m and n are empirical fitting parameters whose values depend on the soil properties k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 the constant parameters of van genuchten s model were estimated using rosetta schaap et al 2001 and retc leij et al 1989 van genuchten et al 1991 codes stands for retention curve rosetta is a well known neural network based software used for estimating soil hydraulic parameters schaap et al 2001 the retc software iteratively fits a number of analytical functions to find the optimum values of van genuchten parameters using least squares objective function radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 the sink term s was specified by a macroscopic approach of root water uptake proposed by šimůnek and hopmans 2009 in which the 1d non compensated actual root water uptake is obtained from the potential root water uptake s p l 3 l 3 t 1 through multiplication with a stress response function α as follows 5 s h o h z t α h o h z t s p t where s is proposed as a function of soil water h and osmotic h o pressure heads l non compensated root water uptake is used herein critical water stress index equals to 1 as triticale is not a phreatophyte and whose maximum rooting depth is about 1 m the stress response function is commonly described as a piecewise defined function in terms of soil water pressure head feddes et al 1978 jiménez martínez et al 2009 jiménez martínez et al 2013 poch massegú et al 2014 6 α h h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 0 h h 4 o r h h 1 where h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are pressure head threshold parameters l the stress response function is maximum between h 2 and h 3 pressure heads and falls down linearly to zero above h 1 anaerobiosis point and below h 4 due to oxygen deficiency and wilting point suction respectively in this study the root water uptake parameters proposed by wesseling et al 1991 are used for triticale table 2 the effect of soil salinity is assumed to be negligible in this study as soil and water quality samples showed an average of 2 83 and 2 24 d s m on the region respectively non uniform distribution of the potential root water uptake can be described as follows 7 s p t b z t t p t where b is the 1d normalized water uptake distribution function l 1 and t p is the potential transpiration rate l t 1 in this study the normalized water uptake distribution function proposed by hoffman and van genuchten 1983 is used 8 b z 1 6667 l r z l 0 2 l r 2 0833 l r 1 l z l r l l r z l 0 2 l r 0 z l 0 2 l r where l is equal to the total depth of soil which is intended to be simulated l and l r is maximum root depth l as seen eq 8 describes a time independent water distribution over root zone the value of l r is assumed to be 1 m allen et al 1998 about calibration of the model it should be stated that as water content was only measured during one year of cultivation we could not allocate a part of our data to calibration and another to validation this is widespread approach observed in the literature such as min et al 2015 although there were five monitoring wells in each of the experimental fields none of them could be chosen as a representative of the whole field because of the situation of the monitoring wells some different variations of water content during the experiment was observed in each soil layer of the five monitoring wells this fact would result in unsatisfactory calibrated soil hydraulic parameters the other option was using inverse solution in the 6 m deep monitoring well this option was also doomed to failure as the number of parameters were too many at least 4 parameters for 12 soil layers at table 4 that made it an extremely hard if not impossible approach hydrus allows users to optimize only up to 15 parameters finally since authors directly used the parameters obtained by rosetta and retc as input for hydrus software but they led to unsatisfactory results but not poor consequently these parameters were used as an initial guess for the calibration process as mentioned above we failed to use some of the available calibration methods therefore we decided to calibrate the constant parameters of van genuchten functions manually by means of changing the parameters obtained by retc and rosetta softwares saturated hydraulic conductivity k s could only be determined by rosetta up to when we reached a satisfactory accuracy the rmse and mae errors less than or equal to 0 035 for the water content of 6 m deep soil block during the experiment was chosen as a satisfactory accuracy threshold the value 0 035 was chosen considering rmse and mae of the simulations of similar papers in the literature such as naylor et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 among others if the van genuchten parameters led the rmse and mae indexes to meet the threshold those parameters were chosen as calibrated parameters 2 4 initial and boundary conditions eq 1 is a second order nonlinear partial differential equation that necessitates the knowledge of initial and two boundary conditions in this study the upper and lower boundary conditions were specified as atmospheric and free drainage boundaries respectively the rationale behind setting free drainage condition for lower boundary is that the depth of groundwater table during the growing season was more than 60 m atmospheric boundary condition is a system dependent boundary condition šimůnek et al 2013 meaning an air soil interface whose flow through is controlled by surrounding phenomenon e g precipitation and evaporation radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 the hydrus software uses a specified flux boundary condition in which the absolute value of prescribed flux is constrained from exceeding the maximum potential rate of evaporation or infiltration e ˆ moreover the pressure head at soil air interface h i n t must lie between two threshold values h a and h s which are constant or variable minimum and maximum pressure heads if one of the limits which are mathematically formulated as eqs 9 and 10 is exceeded the boundary condition will result in constant head boundary type using a limiting pressure head at the surface that is equal to the atmospheric pressure head edlefsen and anderson 1943 9 k h h z 1 e ˆ 10 h a h i n t h s free drainage describes a boundary condition along which hydraulic gradient is considered as zero eq 11 11 h x 0 initial condition was set equal to the arithmetic mean of five measured water content values at each soil layer recorded on november 1 2012 by soil moisture sensors in each of the sprinkler or furrow irrigated fields note that arithmetic mean was only calculated for the sensors installed less deep than 2 m 2 5 evapotranspiration dual crop coefficient approach atmospheric boundary condition necessitates specifying the daily irrigation and precipitation rates as well as potential evapotranspiration jiménez martínez et al 2009 herein potential evapotranspiration rate is calculated using dual crop coefficient approach proposed by allen et al 1998 12 e t p t k c e t o t k c b t k e t e t o t where k c b is basal crop coefficient k e is soil evaporation coefficient and e t o is reference evapotranspiration rate e t o the reference evapotranspiration rate was calculated using fao penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 the rationale behind employing dual crop coefficient procedure is its strength over single crop coefficient approach for calculation of e t p on daily basis tolk and howell 2001 that is mainly because dual crop coefficient approach employs a dynamic soil evaporation coefficient rather than an average value as is used in single crop coefficient approach therefore dual crop coefficient approach results in improved predictions of evapotranspiration after specific wetting events the fact that some models fail to capture in their simulations e g ziaei and sepaskhah 2003 in this study the data provided by allen et al 1998 and field observations are used to specify crop coefficient values and length of four growth stages i e initial crop development mid season and late season stages the basal crop coefficient values of mid season and late season were then adjusted for local climatic conditions and the mean plant height at each stage the variation of plant height was estimated using richards function richards 1959 which is a well known s shaped function commonly used for modeling plant growth gregorczyk 1998 the initial value of plant height at sowing time november 1 2012 is set to zero the function asymptotically approaches to the maximum plant height which is assumed to be 1 m herein for triticale table 3 shows the adjusted crop coefficients and the length of each growth stage used in this study the dynamic variations of soil evaporation coefficient was also obtained considering the fraction of the soil that is both exposed and wetted maximum expected value for crop coefficient and soil water content at the surficial soil layer 0 1 m following the instructions of allen et al 1998 hydrus software is able to calculate potential evaporation and transpiration rates separately according to ritchie 1972 the potential evaporation rate can be calculated through given potential evapotranspiration rate and leaf area index lai as 13 e p t e t p t e x p β l a i t where β is known as radiation extinction coefficient which is commonly assumed to be 0 39 e g jiménez martínez et al 2009 and lai was measured during the experiment fig 4 eventually the potential transpiration rate is easy to compute by subtracting potential evaporation rate from potential evapotranspiration rate eq 14 14 t p t e t p t e p t 2 6 soil hydraulic parameters in order to obtain soil water retention curve soil water content at five suction values for each soil texture was measured using a pressure plate extractor i e the suction values at which water content was determined differed for each sample depending on the soil type subsequently the parameters of van genuchten s model were predicted by rosetta and retc softwares using percentage of soil texture particles bulk density and soil water content at aforementioned pressure heads as input data in most cases the retc software was not able to calculate the value of θ r on the other hand using water retention data saturated hydraulic conductivity is not obtained therefore combined results of retc and rosetta used table 4 shows the predicted parameters of van genuchten s model for the soil layers 2 7 water balance computation and water use efficiency the water balance equation can be expressed as 15 r i p e a c t a c s r u w e n d w s t a r t where i is the water applied through irrigation system l p is precipitation l e a c and t a c are actual evaporation and transpiration respectively l ru is runoff l s denotes lateral seepage flow l w e n d w s t a r t is variation of soil water content from the beginning to the end of experiment l and r is the amount of recharge l herein the runoff and lateral seepage flow parameters were assumed to be negligible due to nature of experimental area and vertical water movement water use efficiency wue could gain information about performance of irrigation system on the two experimental fields the focus in this paper is not on agronomical aspects and this is why wue was only estimated using hydrus simulations and following formulae wue kg m 3 can be calculated using following equation proposed by andarzian et al 2011 as follows 16 w u e y a c e t a c and actual yield y a c can be calculated using a well known equation introduced in the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 66 steduto et al 2012 as follows 17 1 y a c y m a x k y 1 e t a c e t p where y a c is the actual yield corresponding to actual evapotranspiration e t a c y m a x is the maximum possible yield corresponding to potential evapotranspiration e t p and k y is the yield response factor the value of k y was assumed to be 0 94 for both experimental fields this value is the average of the values proposed by fao irrigation and drainage paper no 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and iaea international atomic energy agency austria fao 2002 that suggested k y 1 and k y 0 87 respectively e t a c and e t p values were obtained using calculations of evapotranspiration and hydrus simulations respectively for determining y m a x we considered measured data presented in andarzian et al 2011 haghverdi et al 2014 mohammadi et al 2013 and mohammadi et al 2015 and finally we chose y m a x 6500 k g h a 3 results and discussion with the above mentioned parameters section 2 7 actual yield came out to be 5492 and 5287 k g h a and using eq 16 wue resulted in 1 30 and 1 28 k g m 3 grain yield for furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields respectively consequently wue shows almost the same yield for each of the experimental fields andarzian et al 2011 made a comprehensive study on spring wheat chamran cultivar sown in november in ahvaz khuzestan province of iran and obtained wue for different scenarios of deficit irrigation since the cultivation in this study is under deficit irrigation wues of the second scenario of andarzian et al 2011 was chosen this scenario shows medium deficit irrigation wue values ranged between 1 37 to 1 62 k g m 3 moreover mohammadi et al 2015 calculated wue using measured and simulated data with aquacrop for spring wheat in mashhad khorasan razavi province iran they had different salinity and drought stress scenarios we chose results obtained for the scenario with 35 percent drought stress the percentage of applied water to the full irrigation was 65 and water electrical conductivity of 0 5 ds m for irrigation water as it was the closest scenario to our study wue in this case was 0 9 k g m 3 finally mohammadi et al 2013 investigated the optimization of crop yield of winter wheat under different scenarios of salinity and drought stress in barkhar region isfahan province iran using limited measured data and comprehensive simulations with swap software their simulations with swap software consisted of different irrigation depths ranging from 80 to 120 mm and different maximum allowable depletion mad coefficients 0 3 0 8 and water salinity levels 2 6 ds m they also simulated wue under current irrigation and cultivation conditions maximum wue obtained for the scenario with 80 mm irrigation depth 2 ds m water salinity and mad equal to 0 7 which came out to be about 0 61 k g m 3 for the scenario describing current situation wue was about 0 45 k g m 3 fig 5 a shows precipitation and irrigation events for each experimental field irrigation depths and intervals are based on common irrigation scheduling in the region total precipitation from november 1 2012 to april 22 2013 was 200 3 mm and total irrigation depth for furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems were 114 9 and 102 1 mm carried out through three and five irrigation applications respectively fig 5 b shows the variation of potential evapotranspiration of each experimental field total potential evapotranspiration for furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems was 505 3 and 514 0 mm respectively the slight difference between the evapotranspiration of the fields stems from the dissimilar wetted soil surface fraction of each irrigation system that may affect the water balance of the topsoil layer wetted soil surface fraction of furrow and sprinkler irrigation system is considered to be 0 6 and 1 0 respectively allen et al 1998 3 1 deep vadose zone water content monitoring the comparison of soil water content data recorded daily during the growth period of triticale under each irrigation system by soil moisture sensors with hydrus simulated values is shown in figs 6 and 7 for furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems respectively at typical soil depths the simulated and measured data shown in figs 6 and 7 start from the beginning of the on field measurements the day seeds were sown on each experimental fields on november 1 2012 up to the end of the experiment when the triticale was harvested on april 22 2013 as the soil samples by which moisture sensors calibrated were the mixture of soil obtained from digging ten monitoring wells for the validation of simulation results of the soil layers upper than two meters in figs 6 and 7 the soil water content measurements are the arithmetic average of the values obtained from the five monitoring wells lied in furrow or sprinkler irrigated fields an acceptable agreement is generally observed between simulated and measured data under both irrigation systems figs 6 and 7 not surprisingly the soil moisture fluctuations are relatively extreme within topsoil layers especially after precipitation or irrigation events increasing soil depth the amplitude of peaks dampened and reached a monotonous trend in deep soil layers furthermore it can be observed that deep layers of the sprinkler irrigated field are dryer than those of furrow irrigated field this fact can result in more irrigation return flow in furrow irrigated field eventually figs 6 and 7 show that hydrus software can simulate the whole process in the different soil layers with an acceptable accuracy 3 2 goodness of fit measures calculated goodness of fit measures namely root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae is shown in table 5 the measures are categorized into two soil zones namely root zone soil layers shallower than 2 ms and deep zone soil layers deeper than 2 to highlight the effect of number of monitoring wells on the concision of results the overall error of 0 033 and 0 022 for simulated water content during experiment for furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields respectively expresses an acceptable accuracy in both measurements and determination of constant parameters in comparison to the literature e g wang et al 2016 the error measures of furrow irrigated field show an adverse change by stepping from root zone into the deep zone this fact may have root in decreasing the number of monitoring wells from five to one on the other hand in sprinkler irrigated field a converse trend is observed this contrast can be justified by referring to the fluctuations of water content in each field 3 3 soil water balance and calculation of irrigation return flow the soil water balance components during the experiment is investigated in this section using eq 15 the amount of water passed across the 6 m deep soil layer is considered as groundwater recharge or irrigation return flow table 6 shows the water components of 6 m deep soil block for both furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields as shown about 13 of water input including precipitation and irrigation passes across the 6 m deep soil layer in furrow irrigated filed whereas in the sprinkler irrigated area the amount of irrigation return flow is negligible considering table 6 applied water to the furrow irrigated field was 13 mm more than sprinkler irrigated field however the actual evapotranspiration of sprinkler irrigated field was 10 mm less than furrow irrigated field therefore we concluded that the more water applied in the furrow irrigated field was compensated by more actual evapotranspiration on the other hand this fact should be considered that the two experimental fields were under cultivation before the start of the experiment with the same irrigation system at spring and summer the experimental fields owned by a farmer mr mohammadi and it did not belong to ferdowsi university of mashhad fum and authors had no measurement of the water applied on the field in the previous cultivations therefore the factor justifying the difference between recharge from the two fields is the initial water content w s t a r t in table 6 as can be seen in table 6 total amount of water in the furrow irrigated field at the beginning and at the end of the experiment is more than that of sprinkler irrigated field and it can result in a different recharge rate in the fields however authors believe that the impact of the initial water content in this study was temporary as shown in fig 8 a the comprehensive discussion about fig 8 a is mentioned below recharge rate is decreasing at the beginning of the experiment this part of the recharge rate can be attributed to the antecedent water inputs but it starts increasing the part of the recharge rate which can be attributed to the water inputs applied during the experiment after 80th day finally it should be mentioned that the impact of initial water content was not quantified in this study and it remains ongoing for further investigations in the future authors believe that an experiment consisting of double cropping agro system including winter and spring cultivations could be informative as it reveals the missing data of the current study fig 8 a devoted to variations of soil water balance components in furrow irrigated filed at the beginning of the growing season there is scarce crop cover on the field fig 4 and transpiration is negligible and evaporation is the dominant mechanism at the soil surface at this period of the growing season precipitation and irrigation is negligible therefore decreasing recharge rate can be observed at the beginning of the experiment in the subsequent days between 40 and 80 considerable irrigation and precipitation events occur on the experimental field and make the recharge rate to stop decreasing at this period of time since 80th day onward transpiration rate starts playing an important role and even after 120th day transpiration rate outweigh evaporation rate as crop cover is increasing dramatically with time fig 4 recharge rate starts increasing after 80th day regarding several water inputs applied on the field the same process can be observed for evaporation and transpiration rates in sprinkler irrigated field fig 8 b however considering less water content at the soil layers of this field comparing to furrow irrigated field figs 6 and 7 recharge rate is almost zero at the beginning of the growing season onward an analysis of water balance components in table 6 along with the detail of irrigation applications depicted in figs 5 and 8 clarifies the difference between the amount of irrigation return flow in each experimental field at the first look the difference between water input and evapotranspiration of each field may sound the determining factor for dissimilar recharge as mentioned above the more water input applied through furrow irrigation system comparing to sprinkler irrigation system is roughly compensated by more actual evapotranspiration in furrow irrigated field therefore considerable difference irrigation return flow lies in the depth and intervals of irrigation applications the same total depth of irrigation is applied on each experimental field however it is spread over five events on sprinkler irrigated field whereas in the case of furrow irrigation there are just three applications as shown in fig 5 on december 28 2012 58th day after start the two experimental fields irrigated simultaneously it was the first irrigation event for furrow irrigated field in contrast to sprinkler irrigated which had been irrigated once more on december 18 2012 48th day after start however application depth of furrow irrigated field was 28 5 mm comparing to that of sprinkler irrigated field whose sum for the first and second irrigation events was 31 3 mm nevertheless the variations of irrigation return flow starts to increase after january 11 2013 72nd day after start but no change can be seen in that of sprinkler irrigated field to wrap up longer irrigation intervals with heavier applications in furrow irrigated field led to more irrigation return flow comparing to when short irrigation intervals applied with lighter depth at the first days of the experiment recharge rate in the furrow irrigated field expresses a decreasing rate fig 8 a this fact can be attributed to the lack of irrigation and shallow precipitation less than 7 mm during this period there were just two rainfalls on december 12 2012 and december 17 2012 whose depth were 17 and 18 mm respectively 3 4 sensitivity assessment of soil hydraulic parameters in this part the sensitivity of the simulated total irrigation return flow to the hydraulic parameters of soil layers is assessed by making a perturbation of 5 10 15 a n d 20 in each of the parameters for all soil layers at the same time the starting values baseline of the van genuchten function parameters were calibrated parameters shown in table 4 this approach has been employed in preceding papers about estimation of groundwater recharge due to the lack of knowledge about parameter variability and correlation structure jiménez martínez et al 2009 lu et al 2011 min et al 2015 the rationale behind sensitivity assessment of the parameters is to disclose which parameter s have more impact on the recharge and how large is this impact within each of the experimental fields fig 9 shows the percentage of enhancement or reduction in total irrigation return flow for both furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields due to incremental decremental perturbation in input parameters in fig 9 a the sensitivity assessment of furrow irrigated field is illustrated perturbation on parameters θ r α and k s shows low impact on total irrigation return flow as perturbation of 20 in each of the parameters resulted in about 13 change in total irrigation return flow however high sensitivity obtained for θ s and n as 20 change in θ s and 20 change in n caused a perturbation of 387 and 357 in total irrigation return flow the maximum reduction in total irrigation return flow is also caused by n and θ s with a change of about 90 for 10 perturbation in n and 20 perturbation in θ s higher sensitivity of model to θ s and n shown herein is consistent with findings by min et al 2015 lu et al 2011 and szymkiewicz et al 2018 it shall be mentioned that for decremental perturbations of 15 and 20 in no acceptable result was obtained due to model divergence caused by a well known problem for n 1 regarding the intensive change in θ s and n whose justification is mentioned in the next paragraphs it sounds difficult to make a certain prediction further investigation and more comprehensive data sounds necessary to reveal more facts in this concept in fig 9 b the sensitivity assessment of sprinkler irrigated field is illustrated in the contrary of what observed for furrow irrigated field total irrigation return flow do not show any systematic dependence on the soil hydraulic parameters although some dramatic changes occurred in total irrigation return flow for perturbations of θ r and n they are not large enough to make a considerable change in the negligible amount of recharge flow calculated from sprinkler irrigated field in all cases for the sprinkler irrigation absolute values of recharge were in the order of 10 6 10 8 therefore in all cases recharge value is still negligible the large difference between the values for the two fields can be attributed to the initial condition furrow irrigated field had more water content at the beginning because both fields were under cultivation before the experiment at spring and summer with the same irrigation systems and consequently they had different initial water contents in almost all layers therefore when θ s is perturbed negatively i e θ s is reduced by a particular percentage soil layers approach to saturation point and there would be no capacity for additional influxes irrigation and precipitation to be retained in the soil and consequently recharge increases dramatically on the contrary soil layers in the sprinkler irrigated field are much drier than the field under furrow irrigation and this fact resulted in more capacity for water to be retained and in turn less change in recharge an investigation among some of the papers published in the same concept as the current study showed that the change obtained for recharge as result of perturbation in k s sounds acceptable jiménez martínez et al 2009 reported a change of 7 15 in recharge when considering 10 perturbation for k s θ s α and n they did not mention any specific change in recharge for each of the mentioned constant parameters and only stated the interval 7 15 min et al 2015 performed the same approach as jiménez martínez et al 2009 for sensitivity assessment of the van genuchten parameters and their results showed less than 4 change in recharge for 10 perturbation of k s lu et al 2011 reported 18 and 15 change in recharged as result of 50 and 50 perturbation of k s respectively in this study 10 perturbation of k s caused about 6 change in recharge in order to consider the effect of n on recharge it is useful to see its effect on water retention curve fig 10 shows the variations of water retention curve with respect to perturbation of n in van genuchten s model for the first layer of soil i e 0 50 centimeters the percentages are the same as what used in sensitivity assessment section as seen with increasing n water retention curve drops more dramatically at low suction heads in other words with a slight change in pressure head much more amount of water would be drained from the soil pores therefore with an enhancement in n recharge will be increase 4 conclusions the irrigation return flow from a triticale farm under 17 ha of sprinkler and 7 ha of furrow irrigation systems in an arid region was investigated measured data within deep vadose zone 6 m is provided for about six month using one six meter deep and four two meter deep monitoring wells in each field hydrus 1d package is employed for the simulation of water flow and root water uptake in this paper agronomical factors such as estimated actual yield and wue showed almost the same values for the two irrigation systems the estimated values found to be consistent with the data in the literature the comparison of the results obtained for water content in both furrow and sprinkler irrigated fields for different soil layers showed an encouraging agreement between measured and simulated values the investigation of water balance components within six meter deep soil block illuminated that using the same total amount of water input including precipitation and irrigation and evapotranspiration in each field about 13 percent of water in furrow irrigated field returns back to the groundwater resources whereas it is negligible for the field under sprinkler irrigation system the key factor for the difference between two fields can be attributed to the depth and intervals of irrigation applications shorter intervals with lighter irrigation depth did not make infiltrated water to pass across 6 meter deep layer which is assumed as irrigation return flow herein on the contrary long irrigation intervals of furrow irrigation system imposed water to flow within the deep zone layer and return back to the groundwater table these results show that extending areas under pressurized irrigation systems without limiting the groundwater exploitation amount will intensify the groundwater drawdown finally sensitivity assessment of the parameters showed that there is a need for further investigation about recharge with more comprehensive data including spring and winter cultivation seasons as total recharge was sensitive about θ s and n that were shown to be affected by initial water content 
11319,an accurate estimation of grain protein concentration gpc based on the nitrogen to protein conversion factor fp and grain nitrogen concentration is crucial for scientific research and human nutrition the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen and water stresses on fp field experiments consisting of 16 treatments that included the coupled stresses of nitrogen and water

frequently used approach to determine the total organic nitrogen concentration of wheat and gpc is the product of the total nitrogen concentration and the nitrogen to protein conversion factor fp however the selection of an appropriate fp has been a point of controversy the classical assumption was that protein contains 16 nitrogen therefore an fp value of 6 25 100 6 25 was applied to estimate gpc over the years kjeldahl 1883 this assumption was incorrect and a more accurate fp for different foods varies from 5 18 to 6 25 jones 1941 the fp of different plants animals and foods has been fully researched and accurate results have been obtained however whether fp changes under water and nitrogen stresses remains unknown an fp value of 5 70 for wheat has been used to calculate gpc in all situations fernández and laird 1959 pan et al 2006 however the accuracy of this value requires further verification tkachuk 1969 estimated fp based on the total amino acid concentration and gnc the resultant fp ranged from 5 58 to 5 62 among different cultivars the sources of controversy for fp include the existence of different amino acid concentrations and non protein nitrogen npn a change in the amino acid composition can change the fp value estrella 2008 the amino acid concentration is decisively determined by genetic type tanács et al 1997 but can be radically modified by nitrogen fertilization németh 1985 the application of appropriate nitrogen fertilization affects the quality and quantity of wheat grain protein lv et al 2017 in addition irrigation can lengthen the grain filling period resulting in a decline in lysine tyrosine valine threonine and methionine daniel and triboi 2000 significant interactions between nitrogen fertilization and irrigation have also been presented zheng et al 2011 theoretically the fp value of wheat will change under irrigation and nitrogen application foods contain many types of npn including nucleic acids vitamins nitrate nitrite alkaloids nitrogenous glycosides amines polyamines and free amino acids ezeagu et al 2002 the npn component does not contribute to the functional properties of vegetable protein flours or gpc fan and sosulski 1974 fp based on the amino acid composition of total protein is considered the most accurate morr 2010 sosulski and holt 1980 therefore fluctuations in fp are relatively high and fp does not have a fixed value irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates have significant effects on fp but the existence of regional features cultivar precipitation temperature and soil nutrients makes it difficult to determine general trends in addition gpc is more of an individual characteristic which reflects growth status of a single tiller while yield and grain nitrogen yield are population characteristics wang et al 2015 sn nitrogen stress and sw water stress can be used to indicate the response of a single tiller to nitrogen and water consequently sn and sw were used to reflect the wheat growth situation in this study coupled relationships minimum additive and multiplicative of sn and sw were used to explore the coupling effects on fp estimation of fp and its determination methods have been studied extensively however there is limited information on the variation in fp of wheat in response to sn and sw in this study we estimated gpc based on two hypotheses 1 fp is

b 9 g p c f p g n c where a is the slope of the regression equation and b is the intercept of the regression equation all the treatments from 2014 to 2015 were used to calibrate the eq 8 and eq 9 data

sw which were 0 24 0 10 and 0 00 respectively were greater than those of sn but the coefficient of variation cv of sn was greater than that of sw table 1 the minimum min values of sn and sw were the same i e 0 00 the min of these values was observed in the treatment with sufficient water and nitrogen i3n3 the max mean and min smin were lower than those of spro and sadd the cv of yield was 33 20 which was greater than that of gpc and gnc different from the theory the cv of gpc and gnc was not consistent although the values were similar fp ranged from 5 14 to 5 86 the mean of fp was 5 51 amino acids increased with increasing gpc but the rate differed among different amino acids fig 2 consequently the nitrogen concentration of total amino acids was not constant the nitrogen concentration of total amino acid increased linearly with increasing smin fig 3 the stress factors of two extreme treatments i0n0 and i3n3 in 2015 2016 were shown in table 2 and the stress factors of other treatments were between these two treatments for different phenology phases there were large differences in stress factors the stresses of i0n0 were much larger than those of i3n3 the stresses mainly existed in elongation stage and filling stage 3 2 general linear model significant correlations showed that sn smin sadd and spro significantly contributed to fp table 3 however the absolute value of correlation coefficient r between smin and fp was the highest among them therefore smin was the best index for predicting fp fig 4 fp was not constant and decreased linearly with increasing smin the slope of the regression equation p 0 001 was 5 46 and the intercept was 5 72 however the correlation between gpc and sn was the strongest of all stress factors sn was significantly related to yield gpc gnc and fp while sw was insignificantly related to gpc gnc and fp all variables yield gpc gnc and fp were significantly related to smin 3 3 validation 3 3 1 validation of fp a comparison of the simulated and observed fp values fig 5 showed that the data were distributed around the 1 1 line indicating little bias in the regression relationship the simulated results tended to be less accurate at lower levels of fp in 2014 2015 fp ranged from 5 14 to 5 75 compared with 5 18 to 5 86 in 2015 2016 most fp values were underestimated slightly in 2015 2016 overall the difference between estimated and measured fp was low i e rmse 0 141 rrmse 0 024 less than 0 1 and mae 0 121 this suggests that fp can be predicted using smin by actual growing conditions rather than assuming a constant value 3 3 2 validation of gpc a comparison between observed and simulated gpc values using fp value of 5 70 and fp indicated that the data lie along the 1 1 line fig 6 gpc values simulated using fp were closer to the observed gpc than those estimated assuming fp value of 5 70 the rmse rrmse and mae of gpc which was estimated by fp value of 5 70 were 1 013 0 098 and 1 026 respectively compared to the respective values of 0 430 0 072 and 0 731 for fp table 4 this suggests that assuming a constant fp value for all growing conditions results in greater errors of estimated gpc by contrast fp affected by stresses can better estimate gpc however at low gpc values the simulated results were relatively poor 4 discussion the use of different fp values to estimate the protein concentration of different plants is a heated topic however few researchers have revealed whether or how fp changes with different environments or management practices in comparison to the et and nitrogen fertilization rate sn and sw can reflect changes in fp more accurately and have extensive applicability weiner et al 2017 sw is affected by the soil solute concentration temperature and root and leaf growth similarly the major variables affecting sn are nitrogen concentration at which maximum growth occurs nitrogen concentration at which growth stops the actual tissue nitrogen concentration and they essentially reflect the sn associated with crop nitrogen concentration eq 3 crop nitrogen concentration is estimated based on the soil nitrogen supply and crop nitrogen uptake li et al 2015 all of the above factors caused the changes in sw and sn and further affected the value of smin sw mainly affects expansive growth leaf senescence and plant development eitzinger et al 2016 sn mainly affects leaf expansion and the grain nitrogen concentration sw mainly has a negative effect on yield but a positive effect on gpc by contrast sn has a negative effect on yield and gpc eitzinger et al 2016 it is well known that sn and sw influence the total amino acid concentration and the amino acid composition of wheat grain the objectives of the current study were to explore the potential change in fp with sn and sw further the coupled effects of sn and sw that contributed to the change in fp were determined and the different coupled forms were used to predict fp the stress in vegetative phases were mild for i0n0 the dry matter and nitrogen in aboveground biomass decreased zhang and oweis 1999 the serious stresses in grain filling phase decreased the grain filling rate and duration and the yield and gpc all decreased shah and paulsen 2003 the stress of i3n3 in grain filling phase was slight and its gpc and fp were larger than those of other treatments according to the correlation analysis result the coupled stress smin was more suitable to fit fp fp ranged from 5 14 to 5 86 and these values are similar to those presented by mosse mosse 1990 the intercept 5 72 is similar to the common nitrogen to protein conversion factor used for wheat i e 5 70 mckenzie et al 2006 and the value 5 70 is the average value of different cultivars under conditions without stress however the fp could change if wheat is grown in an environment with stress the slope of the general linear model eq 8 was negative which was an effect of the variation in the amino acid composition the amino acid composition varies when gpc changes and the nitrogen concentration differs among amino acids mossé et al 1985 tanács et al 1997 fp is calculated as the ratio of 100 to the nitrogen concentration in protein when npn is ignored the above research results indicated that all the amino acid concentration increased with increasing gpc which caused the nitrogen concentration of total amino acid to increase when smin increased mosse et al 1990 presented a similar result i e the nitrogen concentration of total amino acid decreased with increasing gnc donovan 1979 recognized that the concentration of nitrogenous organic compounds would increase with decreasing gpc but the proportion of npn and the rate of increase would be low npn also resulted in the decreasing of fp with the increasing of smin but the effect was weak however some problems still exist the verified fp was slightly underestimated when the stress was serious in 2015 2016 these results may be caused by interannual variations in meteorological conditions the precipitation during growing season of 2014 2015 was 83 mm larger than that of 2015 2016 the stress in 2015 2016 was more serious than the stress in 2014 2015 and the range of fp in 2015 2016 was larger than that in 2014 2015 the linear fitting formula by the data of 2014 2015 may mismatch slightly that of 2015 2016 yet when gpc was little the amino acid composition also changed the change trend of fp may have been different from the fp when gpc was low but the rrmse was 0 024 which was less than 0 1 the simulation results of fp were still excellent at low gpc values the simulated results of gpc were relatively poor the gpc was calculated with fp and the fp values were underestimated slightly when the fp was large most crop models could also not simulate gpc very well when the stress was serious i e dssat jones et al 2003 apsim holzworth et al 2014 and siriusquality2 martre et al 2006 there were also significant differences between simulated results and actual growth environment in serious stress brisson et al 2003 therefore the change law of fp with serious water and nitrogen stress needs to be continuely explored by field experiment 5 conclusions a dynamic fp fitted by the factor of coupling stresses rather than a specific amount makes it possible to calculate gpc more accurately stresses resulted in the decline of fp fp was not constant and ranged from 5 14 to 5 86 because of sn and sw in addition fp decreased linearly with increasing smin the simulated results of fp were excellent gpc estimated accounting for water and nitrogen stresses was more precise than gpc estimated using a constant fp value of 5 70 overall the new general linear model provides an improved method to calculate gpc more accurately in different

fully researched and accurate results have been obtained however whether fp changes under water and nitrogen stresses remains unknown an fp value of 5 70 for wheat has been used to calculate gpc in all situations fernández and laird 1959 pan et al 2006 however the accuracy of this value requires further verification tkachuk 1969 estimated fp based on the total amino acid concentration and gnc the resultant fp ranged from 5 58 to 5 62 among different cultivars the sources of controversy for fp include the existence of different amino acid concentrations and non protein nitrogen npn a change in the amino acid composition can change the fp value estrella 2008 the amino acid concentration is decisively determined by genetic type tanács et al 1997 but can be radically modified by nitrogen fertilization németh 1985 the application of appropriate nitrogen fertilization affects the quality and quantity of wheat grain protein lv et al 2017 in addition irrigation can lengthen the grain filling period resulting in a decline in lysine tyrosine valine threonine and methionine daniel and triboi 2000 significant interactions between nitrogen fertilization and irrigation have also been presented zheng et al 2011 theoretically the fp value of wheat will change under irrigation and nitrogen application foods contain many types of npn including nucleic acids vitamins nitrate nitrite alkaloids nitrogenous glycosides amines polyamines and free amino acids ezeagu et al 2002 the npn component does not contribute to the functional properties of vegetable protein flours or gpc fan and sosulski 1974 fp based on the amino acid composition of total protein is considered the most accurate morr 2010 sosulski and holt 1980 therefore fluctuations in fp are relatively high and fp does not have a fixed value irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates have significant effects on fp but the existence of regional features cultivar precipitation temperature and soil nutrients makes it difficult to determine general trends in addition gpc is more of an individual characteristic which reflects growth status of a single tiller while yield and grain nitrogen yield are population characteristics wang et al 2015 sn nitrogen stress and sw water stress can be used to indicate the response of a single tiller to nitrogen and water consequently sn and sw were used to reflect the wheat growth situation in this study coupled relationships minimum additive and multiplicative of sn and sw were used to explore the coupling effects on fp estimation of fp and its determination methods have been studied extensively however there is limited information on the variation in fp of wheat in response to sn and sw in this study we estimated gpc based on two hypotheses 1 fp is affected by sn and sw and 2 the coupling effects of sn and sw have a significant linear negative correlation with fp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment conducted from

except zc 00 sowing because no plant samples could be collected in zc 00 sowing to keep pace with sw or soil volumetric water content the sn of in zc 00 sowing was set as 0 00 because the nitrogen in zc 00 sowing was provided by the grain itself these plant samples were dried to a constant weight at 75 c ground by a steel grinder and stored in a refrigerator subsamples ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 g accurate to 0 0001 g were digested in a microwave and alkali distilled in kjeldahl apparatus jeltec 2300 sweden foss sweden for the determination of nitrogen concentration the total amino acid concentration was estimated as gpc according to the iso 13 903 2005 method l 8900 amino acid analysis meter hitachi high technologies corporation nitrogen concentration of total aminoacids eq 1 is estimated as 1 n c sum a a c i a a n c i where nc is the nitrogen concentration of grain dry matter g n g 1 dry matter 1 aac is a single amino acid concentration g amino acid g 1 dry matter 1 aanc is the nitrogen concentration of a single amino acid g n g 1 amino acid 1 i is 17 different amino acids contained in wheat e g asparticacid threonine serine the values of aanc are obtained from the study

grain dry matter g total amino acid g 1 dry matter 1 2 3 stress factors the estimation of stress factors was based on the entire growth period all the stresses at different phenology would result in the change of fp the average nitrogen or water stress factors of nine phenology phases were used to represent the total nitrogen and water stress factors respectively 2 3 1 water stress the water stress factor eq 3 reflects expansive growth leaf senescence and plant development which is determined by the soil available water capacity and crop growth rate hanks 1974 3 s w i 1 9 1 θ a i θ w p θ

nitrogen stress factor is estimated as 4 s n i 1 9 n c i n a i n c i n m i 9 where sn is the nitrogen stress factor dimensionless nc is nitrogen concentration at which maximum growth occurs nm is

and sw were estimated to represent the different coupling effects of sn and sw 5 s m i n m i n s w s n 6 s a d d s w s n 7 s p r o 1 1 s w 1 s n where smin is the minimum value of sn and sw sadd is the sum of sn and sw and spro is the product of sn and sw 2 4 general linear model the variations of s with fp eq 8 and gpc eq 9 were linear and could be described by the following equations 8 f p a s b 9 g p c f p g n c where a is the slope of the regression equation and b is the intercept of the regression equation all the treatments from 2014 to 2015 were used to calibrate the eq 8 and eq 9 data analyses were performed using spss software v20 analysis of variance anova was performed using a general linear model duncan s multiple range test was used to determine the significant difference between treatments p 0 05 regression analysis was conducted to quantify the relationships between stress and fp 2 5 validation of fp and gpc the general linear model was validated by comparing observed eq 2 and simulated fp eq 8 of 2015 2016 the verification of gpc was through the comparison between observed taac and simulated gpc values using fp value of 5 70 and fp three evaluation indicators were used to test the accuracy of general linear model rmse eq 10 is the root mean squared error and it is a frequently used measure of the differences between simulated and observed values rrmse eq 11 is the relative root mean square error and it is a homogenization error that is independent of units the smaller the rrmse the smaller the difference between measured and simulated values 0 0 1 excellent 0 1 0 2 good 0 2 0 3 fair and 0 3 poor mae eq 12 is the mean absolute error which is based on the absolute value of the deviations 10 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 11 r r m s e r m s e i 1

sw which were 0 24 0 10 and 0 00 respectively were greater than those of sn but the coefficient of variation cv of sn was greater than that of sw table 1 the minimum min values of sn and sw were the same i e 0 00 the min of these values was observed in the treatment with sufficient water and nitrogen i3n3 the max mean and min smin were lower than those of spro and sadd the cv of yield was 33 20 which was greater than that of gpc and gnc different from the theory the cv of gpc and gnc was not consistent although the values were similar fp ranged from 5 14 to 5 86 the mean of fp was 5 51 amino acids increased with increasing gpc but the rate differed among different amino acids fig 2 consequently the nitrogen concentration of total amino acids was not constant the nitrogen concentration of total amino acid increased linearly with increasing smin fig 3 the stress factors of two extreme treatments i0n0 and i3n3 in 2015 2016 were shown in table 2 and the stress factors of other treatments were between these two treatments for different phenology phases there were large differences in stress factors the stresses of i0n0 were much larger than those of i3n3 the stresses mainly existed in elongation stage and filling stage 3 2 general linear model significant correlations showed that sn smin sadd and spro significantly contributed to fp table 3 however the absolute value of correlation coefficient r between smin and fp was the highest among them therefore smin was the best index for predicting fp fig 4 fp was not constant and decreased linearly with increasing smin the slope of the regression equation p 0 001 was 5 46 and the intercept was 5 72 however the correlation between gpc and sn was the strongest of all stress factors sn was significantly related to yield gpc gnc and fp while sw was insignificantly related to gpc gnc and fp all variables yield gpc gnc and fp were significantly related to smin 3 3 validation 3 3 1 validation of fp a comparison of the simulated and observed fp values fig 5 showed that the data were distributed around the 1 1 line indicating little bias in the regression relationship the simulated results tended to be less accurate at lower levels of fp in 2014 2015 fp ranged from 5 14 to 5 75 compared with 5 18 to 5 86 in 2015 2016 most fp values were underestimated slightly in 2015 2016 overall the difference between estimated and measured fp was low i e rmse 0 141 rrmse 0 024 less than 0 1 and mae 0 121 this suggests that fp can be predicted using smin by actual growing conditions rather than assuming a constant value 3 3 2 validation of gpc a comparison between observed and simulated gpc values using fp value of 5 70 and fp indicated that the data lie along the 1 1 line fig 6 gpc values simulated using fp were closer to the observed gpc than those estimated assuming fp value of 5 70 the rmse rrmse and mae of gpc which was estimated by fp value of 5 70 were 1 013 0 098 and 1 026 respectively compared to the respective values of 0 430 0 072 and 0 731 for fp table 4 this suggests that assuming a constant fp value for all growing conditions results in greater errors of estimated gpc by contrast fp affected by stresses can better estimate gpc however at low gpc values the simulated results were relatively poor 4 discussion the use of different fp values to estimate the protein concentration of different plants is a heated topic however few researchers have revealed whether or how fp changes with different environments or management practices in comparison to the et and nitrogen fertilization rate sn and sw can reflect changes in fp more accurately and have extensive applicability weiner et al 2017 sw is affected by the soil solute concentration temperature and root and leaf growth similarly the major variables affecting sn are nitrogen concentration at which maximum growth occurs nitrogen concentration at which growth stops the actual tissue nitrogen concentration and they essentially reflect the sn associated with crop nitrogen concentration eq 3 crop nitrogen concentration is estimated based on the soil nitrogen supply and crop nitrogen uptake li et al 2015 all of the above factors caused the changes in sw and sn and further affected the value of smin sw mainly affects expansive growth leaf senescence and plant development eitzinger et al 2016 sn mainly affects leaf expansion and the grain nitrogen concentration sw mainly has a negative effect on yield but a positive effect on gpc by contrast sn has a negative effect on yield and gpc eitzinger et al 2016 it is well known that sn and sw influence the total amino acid concentration and the amino acid composition of wheat grain the objectives of the current study were to explore the potential change in fp with sn and sw further the coupled effects of sn and sw that contributed to the change in fp were determined and the different coupled forms were used to predict fp the stress in vegetative phases were mild for i0n0 the dry matter and nitrogen in aboveground biomass decreased zhang and oweis 1999 the serious stresses in grain filling phase decreased the grain filling rate and duration and the yield and gpc all decreased shah and paulsen 2003 the stress of i3n3 in grain filling phase was slight and its gpc and fp were larger than those of other treatments according to the correlation analysis result the coupled stress smin was more suitable to fit fp fp ranged from 5 14 to 5 86 and these values are similar to those presented by mosse mosse 1990 the intercept 5 72 is similar to the common nitrogen to protein conversion factor used for wheat i e 5 70 mckenzie et al 2006 and the value 5 70 is the average value of different cultivars under conditions without stress however the fp could change if wheat is grown in an environment with stress the slope of the general linear model eq 8 was negative which was an effect of the variation in the amino acid composition the amino acid composition varies when gpc changes and the nitrogen concentration differs among amino acids mossé et al 1985 tanács et al 1997 fp is calculated as the ratio of 100 to the nitrogen concentration in protein when npn is ignored the above research results indicated that all the amino acid concentration increased with increasing gpc which caused the nitrogen concentration of total amino acid to increase when smin increased mosse et al 1990 presented a similar result i e the nitrogen concentration of total amino acid decreased with increasing gnc donovan 1979 recognized that the concentration of nitrogenous organic compounds would increase with decreasing gpc but the proportion of npn and the rate of increase would be low npn also resulted in the decreasing of fp with the increasing of smin but the effect was weak however some problems still exist the verified fp was slightly underestimated when the stress was serious in 2015 2016 these results may be caused by interannual variations in meteorological conditions the precipitation during growing season of 2014 2015 was 83 mm larger than that of 2015 2016 the stress in 2015 2016 was more serious than the stress in 2014 2015 and the range of fp in 2015 2016 was larger than that in 2014 2015 the linear fitting formula by the data of 2014 2015 may mismatch slightly that of 2015 2016 yet when gpc was little the amino acid composition also changed the change trend of fp may have been different from the fp when gpc was low but the rrmse was 0 024 which was less than 0 1 the simulation results of fp were still excellent at low gpc values the simulated results of gpc were relatively poor the gpc was calculated with fp and the fp values were underestimated slightly when the fp was large most crop models could also not simulate gpc very well when the stress was serious i e dssat jones et al 2003 apsim holzworth et al 2014 and siriusquality2 martre et al 2006 there were also significant differences between simulated results and actual growth environment in serious stress brisson et al 2003 therefore the change law of fp with serious water and nitrogen stress needs to be continuely explored by field experiment 5 conclusions a dynamic fp fitted by the factor of coupling stresses rather than a specific amount makes it possible to calculate gpc more accurately stresses resulted in the decline of fp fp was not constant and ranged from 5 14 to 5 86 because of sn and sw in addition fp decreased linearly with increasing smin the simulated results of fp were excellent gpc estimated accounting for water and nitrogen stresses was more precise than gpc estimated using a constant fp value of 5 70 overall the new general linear model provides an improved method to calculate gpc more accurately in different
