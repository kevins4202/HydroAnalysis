23780,a reduced order semi analytic model of multiple zonal jets in the southern ocean is proposed based on the statistical approach and scale decomposition by introducing two dominant scales in the vorticity equation the model describes the large scale and mesoscale dynamics using the explicit momentum dissipation in the horizontal and vertical directions for validation and physical insights the results of the reduced order model are compared with solutions of two eddy resolving ocean models i a realistic primitive equation hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model simulation of the southern ocean and ii an idealized quasi geostrophic model of a shear driven channel flow keywords zonal jets southern ocean scale separation semi analytical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction multiple zonal jets oriented in the east west direction while alternating in the latitudinal direction are observed in different regions of the global oceans as reported from velocity observations and satellite altimetry data cravatte et al 2012 maximenko et al 2005 huang et al 2007 maximenko et al 2008 the emergence of zonal jets is similarly confirmed by numerical ocean models run in eddy resolving regimes richards et al 2006 sinha and richards 1999 berloff et al 2009b kamenkovich et al 2009 berloff et al 2011 a similar persistent pattern of zonal jets is also observed in atmospheres of giant planets such as jupiter and saturn galperin et al 2004 condie and rhines 1994 in addition to visual resemblance the analysis on energy spectra in these cases indicates the same underlying dynamics sukoriansky et al 2002 development of physically insightful mathematical models of the structure and dynamics of zonal jets remains one of the active research directions in planetary sciences among other techniques linear stability and nonlinear perturbation methods are popular tools in the literature to analyze the dynamics of zonal jets in the literature for example kaspi and flierl 2007 considered baroclinic instability and nonlinear interactions between eddies as the formation mechanism of jets in the atmosphere of gaseous planets using a nonlinear analytical model kaspi and flierl 2007 farrell and ioannou 2008 used the stochastic structural stability theory to study the interaction of jets with turbulence for a two layer baroclinic model and explain the physical mechanism behind the formation and maintenance of baroclinic jets farrell and ioannou 2008 along a similar line of thought berloff et al 2009a considered a two stage development process of the formation of zonal jets berloff et al 2009a first the energy of the background flow is released to long meridional and short zonal length scales via a linear mechanism then a secondary instability occurs which sets the meridional scale of the zonal jets berloff et al 2009a furthermore connaughton et al 2010 studied modulational instability of geophysical rossby and plasma drift waves as a formation mechanism of zonal jets both theoretically and numerically using charney hasegawa mima model connaughton et al 2010 at the other end of the spectrum there are statistical models of zonal jets such as those considering the inverse energy cascade in beta plane turbulence the focus of these models tends to be in the zonal jet structure and their maintenance mechanism at an advanced stage once the jets reach the state of statistical stationarity the key concept here pioneered by rhines 1975 is the so called halting length scale which emerges from the analysis of the wavenumber spectrum for turbulence energy this scale divides the beta plane turbulence into isotropic small scales and highly anisotropic large scales that form the zonal jets the rhines scale depends on r m s velocity and the gradient of the coriolis parameter in a further study scott and dritschel 2012 the rhines scale together with a second length scale which describes the forcing strength with respect to the background potential vorticity gradient were reported to determine the structure of zonal jets in the work by danilov and gurarie 2002 rhines theory was further extended to account for bottom friction effects in addition nadiga 2006 related the development of zonal jets to a detention of the turbulent inverse cascade of energy by free rossby waves which are subsequently redirected into zonal modes nadiga 2006 a different approach was considered by huang and robinson 1998 who showed that the persistent jets are mainly maintained by the shear straining between small scale eddies and large scale zonal jets this work demonstrated an evident scale separation between the small eddy scale and the large jet scale it was also shown that despite a similarity between the rhines scale and the jet scale they are not obviously linked statistically huang and robinson 1998 the current work exploits the separation between the long scale of the background flow and the short jet scale to develop a close form semi analytical model which is amenable to fast turn around solution ideally suitable for parametric studies the goal of the model is to explicitly capture interactions between spatial scales in a realistic flow regime with strong vertical shear and mixing and non negligible vertical velocities the balance at each scale is preserved due to viscosity thereby explicitly illustrating the importance of momentum dissipation the balance serves as an equilibration mechanism for turbulence generated by large scale forcing which maintains zonal jets in a statistically stationary regime section 2 shows how the assumed scale separation allows to reduce the governing equations into two separate sets of equations one for the large scale background flow and the other for the small scale zonal jets each of which is solved semi analytically it is shown that the wind stress forcing and the bottom friction dissipation mainly govern the large scale vorticity dynamics which can be solved separately from the zonal jets equation the parameters of the semi analytical statistical model are derived from the time and zonally averaged dynamics of the southern ocean as simulated by general circulation hycom model in section 3 the developed model is first validated in comparison with the hycom solution to examine how robustly the semi analytical model captures the fundamental underlying physics the same calibration process is then further applied to the quasi geostrophic solution of the zonal channel 2 methodology 2 1 primitive equation model the governing equations for ocean dynamics in z level coordinates can be described by the conservation laws for momentum temperature salinity and mass as well as the equation of state 1 v t v v 2 ω v g p ρ τ ρ t t t v κ t f t s t s v

general ocean circulation hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model the model simulation results were downloaded from the hycom data portal hycom org where they had been interpolated to z level coordinates the hybrid coordinates in the original simulation are isopycnal in the open stratified ocean and smoothly transition to terrain following sigma coordinates in shallow coastal regions and to z level coordinates in the mixed layer and unstratified seas wallcraft et al 2009 the advection of heat and salt was computed using the improved advection scheme mpdata smolarkiewicz and clark 1986 smolarkiewicz and grabowski 1990 following brydon et al 1999 an approximation of the unesco equation of state was used the mellor yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure algorithm was utilized to account for mixing from surface to bottom mellor 1998 mellor and yamada 1982 the horizontal grid resolution was 1 12 degree in the longitude and latitude and there were 41 vertical layers used of particular interest in this work is the hycom solution in a sector of the southern ocean between latitudes of 37 s to 60 s θ 1 2 2162 and θ 2 2 6182 rad in spherical coordinates r θ ϕ used in the reduced order model and in the longitudes approximately between montagu island to tasmania 20 w to 140 e i e ϕ 1 0 3491 and ϕ 2 2 4435 rad this sector is carefully selected to avoid the continental boundaries the effect of which would be difficult to include in low fidelity models typical velocity solutions of hycom extracted over one year period january december 2014 using five day snapshots are shown in fig 1 according to our analysis of hycom solution in a 5 year period january 2013 december 2018 main spatial characteristics of zonal jets which are the focus of this study do not change with longer averaging period it can be noted that the hycom simulated currents in the selected region of interest are nearly zonal and can be approximated by a zonally re entrant flow in a channel which is discussed next 2 2 quasi geostrophic model a quasi geostrophic model was configured for a flow in a mid latitude zonally re entrant channel with solid southern and northern walls and periodic conditions at west and east the size of the computational domain corresponded to 3000 km 12 000 km in latitudinal and longitudinal directions respectively the governing equations were the conservation

and second rossby deformation radii would be r d 1 20 km and r d 2 12 km respectively the depths of the layers were h 1 300 h 2 1100 and h 3 2600 m numbered from the top and background velocities were u 1 6 u 2 3 u 3 0 c m s 1 respectively on the zonal walls no slip boundary conditions were applied the equations were numerically solved using the high resolution cabaret scheme on a uniform cartesian grid of 512 2048 cells karabasov and goloviznin 2009 karabasov et al 2009 the results were obtained for a 10 year simulation after 4000 days of spinout time and stored every 10 days for the subsequent analysis for illustration the computed instantaneous vorticity distribution in the top layer is shown in fig 2 2 3 reduced order model 2 3 1 governing equations and assumptions in this section the reduced order model is derived from primitive equations by first averaging the vorticity equation in time and in the zonal direction the derivation process is then completed by formulating a closure model for the eddy viscosity and replacing the top and bottom boundary conditions with the equivalent body forces following pedlosky 2013 let us take the curl of the momentum equation in eq 1 this leads to elimination of pressure gradients and conservative body forces and results in the equation for the relative vorticity vector ζ 4 ζ t v ζ 2 v ω τ ρ ζ v 2 ω v here spherical coordinates r θ ϕ are used where r is the radial distance from the earth s center and θ and ϕ are respectively co latitudinal north to south and azimuthal west to east angles as shown in fig 1 the velocity vector

observed in high reynolds eddy resolving simulations berloff et al 2011 this coefficient is approximated using the classical smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 14 a h t c s δ 2 s c s δ 2 2 s i j s i j in the above c s is the standard dimensionless calibration parameter of the smagorinsky model s i j is the rate of deformation tensor which is an explicit function of velocity gradients and s i j is its time and zonally averaged value the dynamic length scale δ is used as the cut off scale of the smagorinsky model which corresponds to the smallest scale explicitly resolved the cut off scale has been specifically adjusted for the considered ocean model for example if the velocity spectrum is dominated by a single meridional wavenumber k θ i e v ϕ a k θ e i k θ r θ θ 1 the largest dominant length scale is equal to the corresponding wavelength λ θ which sets up the cut off scale equal to λ θ 2 lilly 1967 15 δ λ θ 2 π k θ π v ϕ 1 r v ϕ θ where r 6371 k m is the earth s mean radius additionally because the meridional geostrophic velocity is zero when averaged zonally above the topography and is generally much smaller than the zonal velocity in a channel configuration fig 3 the former can be subsequently neglected given this and eqs 10 the nonlinear convection term i conv v θ v ϕ is approximately zero hence using the eddy viscosity model of eq 14 the mean vorticity equation eq 8 reduces to 16 2 ω r sin θ v θ cos θ r r 2 v r r a h l a h t r 2 sin θ θ sin θ ζ θ a v r 3 r r 2 r r ζ 0 or in an expanded form 17 2 ω r sin θ v θ cos θ r r 2 v r r a h r 2 2 ζ θ 2 cot θ ζ θ a v 2 ζ r 2 4 r ζ r 2 ζ r 2 0 where bars are dropped for simplicity in presentation and a h a h l a h t since the ocean depth is much smaller than the average radius of the earth h max r 1 eq 17 is

spatial structure of zonal and time mean relative vorticity subject to wind forcing and bottom friction the cartesian equivalent of eq 18 on a beta plane is derived in appendix a highlighting the key differences of our model with the classical quasi geostrophic equations the above equation needs to be simplified further to make it amenable to fast turn around time and physically insightful semi analytical solution methods as the first step the top and bottom boundary conditions are incorporated thereby simplifying the original boundary value problem the velocity strain term is approximated by the wind stress assuming that in the top oceanic surface the momentum stress is determined by the zonal wind stress τ ϕ 19 a v v ϕ r r r τ ϕ which corresponds to the surface sink source of vorticity as follows 20 a v ζ r r r 1 r 1 sin θ θ sin θ τ ϕ in the above equation a v is taken to be 5 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 following the vertical diffusivity nominal value in hycom description wallcraft et al 2009 and τ ϕ τ ϕ max cos 2 π θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 1 with τ ϕ max 1 1 0 4 m 2 s 2 derived from the navgem navy global environmental model 0 5 degree simulations fig 4 confirms that the balance is well preserved for the hycom solution for the period january december 2014 notably the transfer of momentum from the wind acting on the surface to the ocean depth is governed by ekman boundary layer however following dijkstra et al 2001 and similar low resolution ocean models the surface forcing is represented here by a body force q τ distributed over a depth of h w in the upper ocean 21 q τ f r r h w 1 sin θ θ sin θ τ ϕ r w r r where the top vertical profile function f r h r w h r is equal to unity in the interval r w r r with r w r h w and h w 7 5 m and h denotes the heaviside step function similarly the effect of the bottom friction boundary condition is approximated by a distributed bottom friction body force with a coefficient γ non zero in a certain depth range r min r r b with incorporating the boundary conditions as the source terms eq 18 becomes 22 2 ω r sin θ v θ cos θ r r 2 v r r a h r 2 2 ζ θ 2 cot θ ζ θ a v 2 ζ r 2 q τ γ g r ζ 0 here the bottom vertical profile function g r h r min h r b is non zero in the interval r min r r b r min r h max r b r h b h max 5000 h b 2500 m and h is the heaviside function 2 3 2 scale separation the hycom solution is further analyzed next with the goal to extract most significant features which will be amenable to reduced order modeling the scaling of parameters is derived directly from the hycom simulation first as illustrated in fig 5 the time vertically layer and zonally averaged zonal velocity component of the hycom solution reveals a structure with two leading meridional wavenumbers by defining a normalized meridional wave number k θ k θ k min λ max λ θ r θ 2 θ 1 λ θ where r is the earth s mean radius λ θ is the corresponding wavelength in the meridional direction k min 2 π λ max and λ max r θ 2 θ 1 the two leading wavenumbers of the velocity distribution correspond to a large scale component k θ 1 and a small scale component k θ 10 it can be remarked that the emergence of such a distinct structure with low leading wavenumbers is due the fact the fourier transform is performed after averaging the flow in the time and zonal direction instantaneous snapshots of the wavenumber spectrum do not show the same leading wavenumbers since the instantaneous flow field is noisier than the time averaged one a longer time averaging of the instantaneous wavenumber spectra would be required to obtain the same spectrum as by first applying the time averaging and then the spatial fourier transform operation a further detailed analysis of the vorticity and its meridional gradient shows the same two length scales in the meridional wavenumber spectra the amplitude of the vorticity spectra of the small and the large scale peaks are of the same order of magnitude fig 6 top panel however the peak in the vorticity gradient spectra corresponding to the small scale is an order of magnitude larger than that of the large scale fig 6 bottom panel this is expected since small scale vorticity varies more rapidly with respect to the meridional coordinate and hence has a larger derivative k θ 10 vs k θ 1 in small scale and large scale components respectively denoting the small scale vorticity component by ζ l and the large scale component by ζ l fig 6 results can be summarized as 23 ζ l ζ l ζ l θ ɛ ζ l θ where ɛ is 10 1 and reflects the ratio of wavenumbers k θ in the two vorticity components in addition the vertical layer structure of the hycom solution reveals that the peak amplitude associated with the large scale vorticity strongly depends on the layer depth while the peak associated with the small scale is nearly independent of the depth fig 7 this suggests that the bottom friction is mostly affecting the large scale component of the vorticity solution in comparison with its small scale counterpart the latter effect is a consequence of the linear bottom friction used in the hycom simulation wallcraft et al 2009 as extracted from the numerical hycom solution the difference between the values of the second order vertical derivative in the small scale and large scale vorticity components is approximately one order of magnitude 24 2 ζ l r 2 ɛ 2 ζ l r 2 where ɛ is 10 1 inspired by hycom simulations shown in figs 5 7 we decompose the vorticity solution into a small scale and a large scale component 25 ζ ζ l ζ l and substitute eq 25 in eq 22 eq 22 is then rendered dimensionless as follows 26 2 ω h 2 v θ a v r z 1 r sin θ v θ 2 ω h v r a v z cos θ r 2 r 2 v r z a h a v h 2 l 2 1 r 2 2 ζ l θ 2 l r cot θ ζ l θ 2 ζ l θ 2 l r cot θ ζ l θ 2 ζ l z 2 2 ζ l z 2 τ ϕ max

radial vertical velocity respectively h is a length scale in the vertical direction and l is the meridional length scale of the zonal jets k θ 10 here we assume a v 5 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 a h l 118 m 2 s 1 γ 1 0 7 s 1 as provided by the hycom description wallcraft et al 2009 the magnitudes of meridional velocity v θ and vorticity z v ϕ l eq 11 are derived from the hycom solution the magnitude of zonal velocity v ϕ is also linked to wind forcing amplitude in navgem solution by τ ϕ max a v v ϕ top surface h w eq 19 where v ϕ top surface v ϕ h h w and we have τ ϕ θ 1 k θ in addition the vertical velocity magnitude is related to the meridional velocity magnitude through v r h v θ r θ 2 θ 1 according to the continuity equation in a periodic channel configuration eq 5 it should be that v θ ɛ v ϕ as previously shown in fig 3 using the above definitions the order of magnitude analysis of the coefficients in the governing vorticity equation 26 based on the maximum velocity vorticity and dissipation values delineates two groups of terms 28 τ ϕ max h a v z l 1 k θ γ h h b a v o 1 0 0 a h a v h 2 l 2 2 ω h v r a v z 2 ω h 2 v θ a v r z o 1 0 1 the first group includes the dissipative term involving the second order vorticity derivative in the vertical direction the wind stress and the bottom friction the second group includes the coriolis and meridional derivative terms by combining all the above arguments and following the multiscale approach of naghibi et al 2019 and naghibi et al 2017 the governing vorticity equation 22 is decomposed into two parts the large scale and the small scale vorticity equations 29 2 ζ l z 2 τ ϕ max a v h z l 1 r 1 sin θ θ sin θ τ ϕ r w r r 0 r b r r w γ h h b a v ζ l r min r r b 30 2 ω h 2 v θ a v r z 1 r sin θ v θ 2 ω h v r a v z cos

vertical dissipation of the relative vorticity is balanced by the vorticity input from surface winds and bottom friction the equation is solved by integration in the vertical direction for integration a factorization ζ l r θ r l r θ l θ is applied where the meridional function θ l θ is assumed to be the same as in the wind stress curl and is thus derived from the navgem solution see eqs 20 21 and fig 4 this substitution reduces the governing problem to an ordinary differential equation in the vertical direction which can be integrated numerically using the boundary conditions in accordance with the navgem model the small scale vorticity equation 32 involves advection of planetary vorticity vertical stretching and small scale vorticity dissipation from a technical point of view the solution of 32 is more complicated than the solution of the large scale balance it requires solving the non homogeneous partial differential equation 33 a h r 2 2 ζ l θ 2 cot θ ζ l θ a v 2 ζ l r 2 f representing a traditional linear vorticity balance where the term 33a f f 1 f 2 includes the advection of planetary vorticity beta term f 1 2 ωsin θ v θ r and the vertical stretching term f 2 2 ωcos θ r 2 r 2 v r r it should be noted that the latter source term includes important non quasi geostrophic effects which result in additional fine scale mixing the effects of mixing will be balanced by viscous dissipation as will be discussed in the numerical results section to eliminate the radial velocity component from the equation the latter term can be rewritten in terms of the meridional velocity v θ f 2 2 ωcot θ r sin θ v θ θ using the continuity equation 5 in a zonally averaged periodic channel first to find a solution to the homogeneous part of eq 33 we use separation of variables ζ l r θ r l r θ l θ to obtain 34 a h r 2 r l θ l cot θ r l θ l a v r l θ l 0 after a rearrangement 34 reduces to 35 a h a v r 2 θ l cot θ θ l θ l r l r l 1 λ 2 the resulting solution components r l r and θ l θ satisfy the ordinary differential equations as follows 36 a h r 2 θ l cot θ θ l a v λ 2 θ l 0 37 r l 1 λ 2 r l 0 where the constant parameter λ is computed by fitting the exponential function to the vertical distribution obtained from the small scale vorticity component in the hycom simulations 38 r l r l e λ r r by substituting 38 into the small scale equation 33 the latter is rearranged to an ordinary differential form 39 a h r 2 2 ζ l θ 2 cot θ ζ l θ a v λ 2 ζ l f since a h is a non linear function of the zonal velocity gradient using eq 11 the vorticity equation 39 is

is known from hycom data the resulting ordinary differential equation 40 is solved numerically as an initial value problem using the 5th order runge kutta scheme in the solution process the northern boundary condition corresponds to an inflection point where 2 v ϕ l θ 2 θ θ 1 v ϕ l θ θ 1 0 and the first order derivative v ϕ l θ θ θ 1 is evaluated from the small scale vorticity component of the hycom solution notably eq 40 permits harmonic type solutions similar to the meridionally distributed alternating jets shown in fig 5b such alternating zonal jets were observed in shear driven channel flows in the previous literature berloff et al 2009b kamenkovich et al 2009 berloff et al 2011 the solutions to eqs 31 and 40 are obtained by multiplying corresponding r and θ functions following separation of variables ζ l r θ r l r θ l θ and ζ l r θ r l r θ l θ and finally need to be superposed to obtain the total vorticity eq 25 to summarize guided by the scale separation observed in the spectral analysis of hycom solution and using scale analysis we derived eqs 31 and 40 from the vorticity equation 18 for large and small scale vorticity components to complete the two scale model coupling of the large and the small scale components is achieved through the nonlinear eddy viscosity closure for a h t which involves the total velocity eq 14 s i j s i j l s i j l and s i j l s i j l hence the small scale zonal jets described by 40 are coupled to the background large scale flow through eddy viscosity 3 numerical results 3 1 comparison with hycom simulations first the semi analytical solution for the large scale vorticity component 31 is compared with the distribution of the first peak in the vorticity wavenumber spectrum as a function of depth extracted from hycom simulations fig 8 shows in all three depth regions the reduced order model is in good agreement with the hycom data next eq 40 is solved where the source terms f 1 2 ωsin θ v θ r and f 2 2 ωcot θ r sin θ v θ θ are computed from the time and zonally averaged meridional velocity v θ of the hycom solution fig 3 notably the direct computation of v θ θ in the f 2 term involves numerical differentiation of a small amplitude quantity v θ v ϕ which is a noisy operation due to the fine scales involved the noise occurs due to the insufficient vertical resolution of the hycom solution which was interpolated into z level coordinates while varying locally in the zonal and meridional directions depending on the bottom topography to counteract the fine scale vertical stretching term f 2 in the framework of the reduced order model the coefficients a v and a h are adjusted so that the viscous balance is explicitly preserved specifically we represent the source term f by a random noise forcing with the variance extracted from the meridional velocity distribution in the hycom data and this reduces eq 40 to a langevin model the latter model was originally developed to describe the brownian motion of particles in viscous liquids where the balance of deterministic dissipation and random fluctuation due to particle particle collisions fully determines how the variance of the particle coordinate evolves in time van kampen 1992 in the present case the meridional ocean coordinate is used as the homogeneous evolution variable of the langevin equation instead of time and the small scale vorticity is used instead of the particle coordinate then the values of dissipation coefficients a v and a h which are required to preserve the desired meridional variance of vorticity in accordance with the hycom data are evaluated following the langevin theory see details in the appendix after this the computed dissipation coefficients a v and a h are substituted in eq 40 which is integrated numerically with the runge kutta method as outlined in section 2 3 2 figs 9 and 10 compare results of the two scale model 31 and 40 using the turbulence eddy viscosity coefficient c s 0 2 with the hycom solution fig 9a shows the time vertically and zonally averaged zonal velocity profiles and fig 9b shows the wavenumber spectra of the velocity fluctuations for the reduced order model

present time and zonally averaged profiles and wavenumber spectra for the zonal velocity and vorticity in the top layer in comparison with the corresponding solution components of the hycom dataset it can be noted that the velocity and vorticity profiles predicted by the reduced order model are in good agreement with the hycom simulations furthermore the first peak corresponding to the large scale solution component and the 10th peak corresponding to the small scale solution component wavelength of 256 km in the velocity and vorticity spectra of the reduced order model are in excellent agreement with reference hycom data good agreement for the velocity and vorticity distributions in the top layer between the model predictions and the hycom data also confirms that the dissipation coefficients a h and a v and boundary conditions in eq 40 have been defined consistently 3 2 comparison with the quasi geostrophic model of the zonal channel to test the robustness of the suggested reduced order model as well as obtain further insights into the importance of non quasi geostrophic effects such as those included in the large vertical stretching term extracted from the hycom simulation the same model is also applied to reconstruct the solution of an idealized quasi geostrophic model in contrast to the hycom model the quasi geostrophic model considers an idealized flow domain corresponding to a shear driven zonal re entrant channel as outlined in section 2 2 the quasi geostrophic model includes three vertical layers and a flat bottom topography and is designed to represent main features of the flow in the hycom simulations specifically large scale forcing in the quasi geostrophic model was imposed by a background shear rather than wind stress this background flow corresponds to the large scale zonal velocity in the reduced order model v ϕ l constant and hence eq 31 is not required in this case in addition the quasi geostrophic model simulates zonal jets fig 2 that are similar to their counterparts in the more complex hycom model with a suitable recalibration of parameters the small scale equation in the reduced order model eq 40 can describe the zonal jet structure in the quasi geostrophic model as well as hycom to solve eq 40 a h l is directly replaced by the lateral viscosity parameter v 10 m 2 s 1 in eq 2 and the turbulence eddy viscosity coefficient is adjusted to c s 0 75 similar to the hycom case the eddy viscosity term couples the small scale equation to the background constant flow the advection of planetary vorticity f 1 and the vertical stretching term f 2 are computed from the time and zonally averaged meridional velocity v θ and its meridional gradient as well as the constant β 1 3 1 0 11 m 1 s 1 in the quasi geostrophic model consistent with the flat bottom topography in the quasi geostrophic model the zonal mean meridional velocity and the f 1 term are almost zero the magnitude of the vertical velocity is also less than ro v ϕ h l where ro is the rossby number and hence the zonal mean vertical stretching term f 2 is much smaller than in the hycom solution as a result no fine scale langevin adjustment of the effective viscosity parameters is applied to the viscous balance of the quasi geostrophic effects similar to the procedure used for the analysis of the hycom simulations the vertical distribution parameter λ is computed by matching the solution of the quasi geostrophic model as shown in fig 13 from which the effective length scale λ 400 m is obtained in the quasi geostrophic model the dependence of zonal jets on parameters such as bottom friction and background velocity berloff et al 2011 is agglomerated in the parameter λ furthermore since the vertical dissipation term does not enter the quasi geostrophic governing equation the corresponding coefficient is assumed to have the same value as in hycom a v 5 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 notably the same value of the coefficient was also reported in other primitive equation models dijkstra et al 2001 after the recalibration of the parameters of the semi analytical model eq 40 for the quasi geostrophic zonal channel case it is solved numerically using runge kutta method as for the hycom model previously results of the semi analytical model for the quasi geostrophic zonal channel are shown in figs 14 and 15 it can be noted that the solution of the reduced order model captures the meridional structure of zonal jets of the quasi geostrophic model very well in particular the reduced order model accurately predicts the dominant peaks of the velocity and vorticity spectra 4 conclusion time and zonally averaged properties of multiple zonal jets in the southern ocean are examined through developing a semi analytical model that is based on the two scale flow decomposition approach the development of the model is informed by a high fidelity hycom numerical simulation of the southern ocean region the results of the semi analytic model are further compared with an idealized quasi geostrophic model configured for the same ocean region the semi analytical quasi linear model captures the main two features of the flow the large scale zonal current and multiple alternating zonal jets to implicitly represent nonlinear effects in the hycom model the suggested two scale model uses a combination of suitably calibrated smagorinsky eddy viscosity and langevin dissipation model the latter is especially important for capturing non quasi geostrophic effects such as those due to the vertical stretching term this framework allows preserving important features of the simulated flow such as the spatial distribution of zonal jets and their wavenumber spectra in a semi analytical model ideally suitable for parametric studies to probe the robustness of the suggested semi analytical model and obtain physical insights on the importance of non quasi geostrophic effects the reduced order model is further applied to a quasi geostrophic model of the same oceanic region despite significant differences between assumptions and numerical approximations used in hycom and the quasi geostrophic channel model the current reduced order model can capture pertinent features of the zonal jets and elucidate the viscous balance in each case in contrast to several existing dynamical models of zonal jets based on idealized linear and nonlinear dynamics kaspi and flierl 2007 farrell and ioannou 2008 berloff et al 2009a rhines 1979 the suggested semi analytical model is derived from full solutions it combines correlated large scale and uncorrelated small scale forcing to explicitly consider the viscous balance at each scale which is required to maintain zonal jets in a statistically stationary regime following this approach it is shown that despite complexity of the underlying physics zonal jets effectively exhibit a quasi linear harmonic behavior where the advection of planetary vorticity and the vertical stretching term are balanced by horizontal and vertical viscous mixing this results in a viscous balance driven by both quasi geostrophic effects such as those induced by the large scale wind forcing and non quasi geostrophic effects due to the vertical motions and dissipation in future work the suggested reduced order model may be extended to elucidate the importance of viscous effects at different spatial scales in closed or semi closed ocean basins such as the pacific ocean where zonal jets coexist with gyre circulations credit authorship contribution statement s elnaz naghibi

23780,a reduced order semi analytic model of multiple zonal jets in the southern ocean is proposed based on the statistical approach and scale decomposition by introducing two dominant scales in the vorticity equation the model describes the large scale and mesoscale dynamics using the explicit momentum dissipation in the horizontal and vertical directions for validation and physical insights the results of the reduced order model are compared with solutions of two eddy resolving ocean models i a realistic primitive equation hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model simulation of the southern ocean and ii an idealized quasi geostrophic model of a shear driven channel flow keywords zonal jets southern ocean scale separation semi analytical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction multiple zonal jets oriented in the east west direction while alternating in the latitudinal direction are observed in different regions of the global oceans as reported from velocity observations and satellite altimetry data cravatte et al 2012 maximenko et al 2005 huang et al 2007 maximenko et al 2008 the emergence of zonal jets is similarly confirmed by numerical ocean models run in eddy resolving regimes richards et al 2006 sinha and richards 1999 berloff et al 2009b kamenkovich et al 2009 berloff et al 2011 a similar persistent pattern of zonal jets is also observed in atmospheres of giant planets such as jupiter and saturn galperin et al 2004 condie and rhines 1994 in addition to visual resemblance the analysis on energy spectra in these cases indicates the same underlying dynamics sukoriansky et al 2002 development of physically insightful mathematical models of the structure and dynamics of zonal jets remains one of the active research directions in planetary sciences among other techniques linear stability and nonlinear perturbation methods are popular tools in the literature to analyze the dynamics of zonal jets in the literature for example kaspi and flierl 2007 considered baroclinic instability and nonlinear interactions between eddies as the formation mechanism of jets in the atmosphere of gaseous planets using a nonlinear analytical model kaspi and flierl 2007 farrell and ioannou 2008 used the stochastic structural stability theory to study the interaction of jets with turbulence for a two layer baroclinic model and explain the physical mechanism behind the formation and maintenance of baroclinic jets farrell and ioannou 2008 along a similar line of thought berloff et al 2009a considered a two stage development process of the formation of zonal jets berloff et al 2009a first the energy of the background flow is released to long meridional and short zonal length scales via a linear mechanism then a secondary instability occurs which sets the meridional scale of the zonal jets berloff et al 2009a furthermore connaughton et al 2010 studied modulational instability of geophysical rossby and plasma drift waves as a formation mechanism of zonal jets both theoretically and numerically using charney hasegawa mima model connaughton et al 2010 at the other end of the spectrum there are statistical models of zonal jets such as those considering the inverse energy cascade in beta plane turbulence the focus of these models tends to be in the zonal jet structure and their maintenance mechanism at an advanced stage once the jets reach the state of statistical stationarity the key concept here pioneered by rhines 1975 is the so called halting length scale which emerges from the analysis of the wavenumber spectrum for turbulence energy this scale divides the beta plane turbulence into isotropic small scales and highly anisotropic large scales that form the zonal jets the rhines scale depends on r m s velocity and the gradient of the coriolis parameter in a further study scott and dritschel 2012 the rhines scale together with a second length scale which describes the forcing strength with respect to the background potential vorticity gradient were reported to determine the structure of zonal jets in the work by danilov and gurarie 2002 rhines theory was further extended to account for bottom friction effects in addition nadiga 2006 related the development of zonal jets to a detention of the turbulent inverse cascade of energy by free rossby waves which are subsequently redirected into zonal modes nadiga 2006 a different approach was considered by huang and robinson 1998 who showed that the persistent jets are mainly maintained by the shear straining between small scale eddies and large scale zonal jets this work demonstrated an evident scale separation between the small eddy scale and the large jet scale it was also shown that despite a similarity between the rhines scale and the jet scale they are not obviously linked statistically huang and robinson 1998 the current work exploits the separation between the long scale of the background flow and the short jet scale to develop a close form semi analytical model which is amenable to fast turn around solution ideally suitable for parametric studies the goal of the model is to explicitly capture interactions between spatial scales in a realistic flow regime with strong vertical shear and mixing and non negligible vertical velocities the balance at each scale is preserved due to viscosity thereby explicitly illustrating the importance of momentum dissipation the balance serves as an equilibration mechanism for turbulence generated by large scale forcing which maintains zonal jets in a statistically stationary regime section 2 shows how the assumed scale separation allows to reduce the governing equations into two separate sets of equations one for the large scale background flow and the other for the small scale zonal jets each of which is solved semi analytically it is shown that the wind stress forcing and the bottom friction dissipation mainly govern the large scale vorticity dynamics which can be solved separately from the zonal jets equation the parameters of the semi analytical statistical model are derived from the time and zonally averaged dynamics of the southern ocean as simulated by general circulation hycom model in section 3 the developed model is first validated in comparison with the hycom solution to examine how robustly the semi analytical model captures the fundamental underlying physics the same calibration process is then further applied to the quasi geostrophic solution of the zonal channel 2 methodology 2 1 primitive equation model the governing equations for ocean

general ocean circulation hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model the model simulation results were downloaded from the hycom data portal hycom org where they had been interpolated to z level coordinates the hybrid coordinates in the original simulation are isopycnal in the open stratified ocean and smoothly transition to terrain following sigma coordinates in shallow coastal regions and to z level

smolarkiewicz and grabowski 1990 following brydon et al 1999 an approximation of the unesco equation of state was used the mellor yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure algorithm was utilized to account for mixing from surface to bottom mellor 1998 mellor and yamada 1982 the horizontal grid resolution was 1 12 degree in the longitude and latitude and there were 41 vertical layers used of particular interest in this work is the hycom solution in a sector of the southern ocean between latitudes of 37 s to 60 s θ 1 2 2162 and θ 2 2 6182 rad in spherical coordinates r θ ϕ used in the reduced order model and in the longitudes approximately between montagu island to tasmania 20 w to 140 e i e ϕ 1 0 3491 and ϕ 2 2 4435 rad this sector is carefully selected to avoid the continental boundaries the effect of which would be difficult to include in low fidelity models typical velocity solutions of hycom extracted over one year period january december 2014 using five day snapshots are shown in fig 1 according to our analysis of hycom solution in a 5 year period january 2013 december 2018 main spatial characteristics of zonal jets which are the focus of this study do not change with longer averaging period it can be noted that the hycom simulated currents in the selected region of interest are nearly zonal and can be approximated by a zonally re entrant flow in a channel which is discussed next 2 2 quasi geostrophic model a quasi geostrophic model was configured for a flow in a mid latitude zonally re entrant channel with solid southern and northern walls and periodic conditions at west and east the size of the computational domain corresponded to 3000 km 12 000 km in latitudinal and longitudinal directions respectively the governing equations were the conservation

and second rossby deformation radii would be r d 1 20 km and r d 2 12 km respectively the depths of the layers were h 1 300 h 2 1100 and h 3 2600 m numbered from the top and background velocities were u 1 6 u 2 3 u 3 0 c m s 1 respectively on the zonal walls no slip boundary conditions were applied the equations were numerically solved using the high resolution cabaret scheme on a uniform cartesian grid of 512 2048 cells karabasov and goloviznin 2009 karabasov et al 2009 the results were obtained for a 10 year simulation after 4000 days of spinout time and stored every 10 days for the subsequent analysis for illustration the computed instantaneous vorticity distribution in the top layer is shown in fig 2 2 3 reduced order model 2 3 1 governing equations and assumptions in this section the reduced order model is derived from primitive equations by first averaging the vorticity equation in time and in the zonal direction the derivation process is then completed by formulating a closure model for the eddy viscosity and replacing the top and bottom boundary conditions with the equivalent body forces following pedlosky 2013 let us take the curl of the momentum equation in eq 1 this

in the above c s is the standard dimensionless calibration parameter of the smagorinsky model s i j is the rate of deformation tensor which is an explicit function of velocity gradients and s i j is its time and zonally averaged value the dynamic length scale δ is used as the cut off scale of the smagorinsky model which corresponds to the smallest scale explicitly resolved the cut off scale has been specifically adjusted for the considered ocean model for example if the velocity spectrum is dominated by a single meridional wavenumber k θ i e v ϕ a k θ e i k θ r θ θ 1 the largest dominant

additionally because the meridional geostrophic velocity is zero when averaged zonally above the topography and is generally much smaller than the zonal velocity in a channel configuration fig 3 the former can be subsequently neglected given this and eqs 10 the nonlinear convection term i conv v θ v ϕ is approximately zero hence using the eddy viscosity model of eq 14 the mean vorticity equation

preserved for the hycom solution for the period january december 2014 notably the transfer of momentum from the wind acting on the surface to the ocean depth is governed by ekman boundary layer however following dijkstra et al 2001 and similar low resolution ocean models the surface forcing is represented here by a body force q τ distributed over a depth of h w in the upper ocean 21 q τ f r

function g r h r min h r b is non zero in the interval r min r r b r min r h max r b r h b h max 5000 h b 2500 m and h is the heaviside function 2 3 2 scale separation the hycom solution is further analyzed next with the goal to extract most significant features which will be amenable to reduced order modeling the scaling of parameters is derived directly from the hycom simulation first as illustrated in fig 5 the time vertically layer and zonally averaged zonal velocity component of the hycom solution reveals a structure with two leading meridional wavenumbers by defining a normalized meridional wave number k θ k θ k min λ max λ θ r θ 2 θ 1 λ θ where r is the earth s mean radius λ θ is the corresponding wavelength in the meridional direction k min 2 π λ max and λ max r θ 2 θ 1 the two leading wavenumbers of the velocity distribution correspond to a large scale component k θ 1 and a small scale component k θ 10 it can be remarked that the emergence of such a distinct structure with low leading wavenumbers is due the fact the fourier transform is performed after averaging the flow in the time and zonal direction instantaneous snapshots of the wavenumber spectrum do not show the same leading wavenumbers since the instantaneous flow field is noisier than the time averaged one a longer time averaging of the instantaneous wavenumber spectra would be required to obtain the same spectrum as by first applying the time averaging and then the spatial fourier transform operation a further detailed analysis of the vorticity and its meridional gradient shows the same two length scales in the meridional wavenumber spectra the amplitude of the vorticity spectra of the small and the large scale peaks are of the same order of magnitude fig 6 top panel however the peak in the vorticity gradient spectra corresponding to the small scale is an order of magnitude larger than that of the large scale fig 6 bottom panel this is expected since small scale vorticity varies more rapidly with respect to the meridional coordinate and hence has a larger derivative k θ 10 vs k θ 1 in small scale and large scale components respectively denoting the small scale vorticity component by ζ l and the large scale component by ζ l fig 6 results can be summarized as 23 ζ l ζ l ζ l θ ɛ ζ l θ where ɛ is 10 1 and reflects the ratio of wavenumbers k θ in the two vorticity components in addition the vertical layer structure of the hycom solution reveals that the peak amplitude associated with the large scale vorticity strongly depends on the layer depth while the peak associated with the small scale is nearly independent of the depth fig 7 this suggests that the bottom friction is mostly affecting the large scale component of the vorticity solution in comparison with its small scale counterpart the latter effect is a consequence of the linear bottom friction used in the hycom simulation wallcraft et al 2009 as extracted from the numerical hycom solution the difference between the values of the second order vertical derivative in the small scale and large scale vorticity components is approximately one order of magnitude 24 2 ζ l r 2 ɛ 2 ζ l r 2 where ɛ is 10 1 inspired by hycom simulations shown in figs 5 7 we decompose the vorticity solution into a small scale and a large scale component 25 ζ ζ l ζ l and substitute eq 25 in eq 22 eq 22 is then rendered dimensionless as follows 26 2 ω h 2 v θ a v r z 1 r sin θ v θ 2 ω h v r a v z cos θ r 2 r 2 v r z a h a v h 2 l 2 1 r 2 2 ζ l θ 2 l r cot θ ζ l θ 2 ζ l θ 2 l r cot θ ζ l θ 2 ζ l z 2 2 ζ l z 2 τ ϕ max

1 0 7 s 1 as provided by the hycom description wallcraft et al 2009 the magnitudes of meridional velocity v θ and vorticity z v ϕ l eq 11 are derived from the hycom solution the magnitude of zonal

as previously shown in fig 3 using the above definitions the order of magnitude analysis of the coefficients in the governing vorticity equation 26 based on the maximum velocity vorticity and

term involving the second order vorticity derivative in the vertical direction the wind stress and the bottom friction the second group includes the coriolis and meridional derivative terms by combining all the above arguments and following the multiscale approach of naghibi et al 2019 and naghibi et al 2017 the governing vorticity equation 22 is decomposed into two parts the large scale

vertical dissipation of the relative vorticity is balanced by the vorticity input from surface winds and bottom friction the equation is solved by integration in the vertical direction for integration a factorization ζ l r θ r l r θ l θ is applied where the meridional function θ l θ is assumed to be the same as in the wind stress curl and is thus derived from the navgem solution see eqs 20 21 and fig 4 this substitution reduces the governing problem to an ordinary differential equation in the vertical direction which can be integrated numerically using the boundary conditions in accordance with the navgem model the small scale vorticity equation 32 involves advection of planetary vorticity vertical stretching and small scale vorticity dissipation from a technical point of view the solution of 32 is more complicated than the solution of the large scale balance it requires solving the non homogeneous partial differential equation 33 a h r 2 2 ζ l θ 2 cot θ ζ l θ a v 2 ζ l r 2 f representing a traditional linear vorticity balance where the term 33a f f 1 f 2 includes the advection of planetary vorticity beta term f 1 2 ωsin θ v θ r and the vertical stretching term f 2 2 ωcos θ r 2 r 2 v r r it should be noted that the latter source term includes important non quasi geostrophic effects which result in additional fine scale mixing the effects of mixing will be balanced by viscous dissipation as will be discussed in the numerical results section to eliminate the radial velocity component from the equation the latter term can be rewritten in terms of the meridional velocity v θ f 2 2 ωcot θ r sin θ v θ θ using the continuity equation 5 in a zonally averaged periodic channel first to find a solution to the homogeneous part of eq 33 we use separation of variables ζ l r θ r l r θ l θ to obtain 34 a h r 2 r l θ l cot θ r l θ l a v r l θ l 0 after a rearrangement 34 reduces to 35 a h a v r 2 θ l cot θ θ l θ l r l r l 1 λ 2 the resulting solution components r l r and θ l θ satisfy the ordinary differential equations as follows 36 a h r 2 θ l cot θ θ l a v λ 2 θ l 0 37 r l 1 λ 2 r l 0 where the constant parameter λ is computed by fitting the exponential function to the vertical distribution obtained from the small scale vorticity component in the hycom simulations 38 r l r l e λ r r by substituting 38 into the small scale equation 33 the latter is rearranged to an ordinary differential form 39 a h r 2 2 ζ l θ 2 cot θ ζ l θ a v λ 2 ζ l f since a h is a non linear function of the zonal velocity gradient using eq 11 the vorticity equation 39 is rearranged in terms of the single dependent variable v ϕ l for solution 40 a h r 3 3 v ϕ l θ 3 2 cot θ 2 v ϕ l θ 2 2 cot 2 θ v ϕ l θ cos θ sin 3 θ v ϕ l a v λ 2 r v ϕ l θ v ϕ l cot θ f once the term f is known from hycom data the resulting ordinary differential equation 40 is solved numerically as an initial value problem using the 5th order runge kutta scheme in the solution process the northern boundary condition corresponds to an inflection point where 2 v ϕ l θ 2 θ θ 1 v ϕ l θ θ 1 0 and the first order derivative v ϕ l θ θ θ 1 is evaluated from the small scale vorticity component of the hycom solution notably eq 40 permits harmonic type solutions similar to the meridionally distributed alternating jets shown in fig 5b such alternating zonal jets were observed in shear driven channel flows in the previous literature berloff et al 2009b kamenkovich et al 2009 berloff et al 2011 the solutions to eqs 31 and 40 are obtained by multiplying corresponding r and θ functions following separation of variables ζ l r θ r l r θ l θ and ζ l r θ r l r θ l θ and finally need to be superposed to obtain the total vorticity eq 25 to summarize guided by the scale separation observed in the spectral analysis of hycom solution and using scale analysis we derived eqs 31 and 40 from the vorticity equation 18 for large and small scale vorticity components to complete the two scale model coupling of the large and the small scale components is achieved through the nonlinear eddy viscosity closure for a h t which involves the total velocity eq 14 s i j s i j l s i j l and s i j l s i j l hence the small scale zonal jets described by 40 are coupled to the background large scale flow through eddy viscosity 3 numerical results 3 1 comparison with hycom simulations first the semi analytical solution for the large scale vorticity component 31 is compared with the distribution of the first peak in the vorticity wavenumber spectrum as a function of depth extracted from hycom simulations fig 8 shows in all three depth regions the reduced order model is in good agreement with the hycom data next eq 40 is solved where the source terms f 1 2 ωsin θ v θ r and f 2 2 ωcot θ r sin θ v θ θ are computed from the time and zonally averaged meridional velocity v θ of the hycom solution fig 3 notably the direct computation of v θ θ in the f 2 term involves numerical differentiation of a small amplitude quantity v θ v ϕ which is a noisy operation due to the fine scales involved the noise occurs due to the insufficient vertical resolution of the hycom solution which was interpolated into z level coordinates while varying locally in the zonal and meridional directions depending on the bottom topography to counteract the fine scale vertical stretching term f 2 in the framework of the reduced order model the coefficients a v and a h are adjusted so that the viscous balance is explicitly preserved specifically we represent the source term f by a random noise forcing with the variance extracted from the meridional velocity distribution in the hycom data and this reduces eq 40 to a langevin model the latter model was originally developed to describe the brownian motion of particles in viscous liquids where the balance of deterministic dissipation and random fluctuation due to particle particle collisions fully determines how the variance of the particle coordinate evolves in time van kampen 1992 in the present case the meridional ocean coordinate is used as the homogeneous evolution variable of the langevin equation instead of time and the small scale vorticity is used instead of the particle coordinate then the values of dissipation coefficients a v and a h which are required to preserve the desired meridional variance of vorticity in accordance with the hycom data are evaluated following the langevin theory see details in the appendix after this the computed dissipation coefficients a v and a h are substituted in eq 40 which is integrated numerically with the runge kutta method as outlined in section 2 3 2 figs 9 and 10 compare results of the two scale model 31 and 40 using the turbulence eddy viscosity coefficient c s 0 2 with the hycom solution fig 9a shows the time vertically and zonally averaged zonal velocity profiles and fig 9b shows the wavenumber spectra of the velocity fluctuations for the reduced order model and the reference hycom solution the fluctuations are calculated with respect to the mean flow i e the meridional average fig 10 show the same comparisons as fig 9 but for the vorticity figs 11 and 12 present time and zonally averaged profiles and wavenumber spectra for the zonal velocity and vorticity in the top layer in comparison with the corresponding solution components of the hycom dataset it can be noted that the velocity and vorticity profiles predicted by the reduced order model are in good agreement with the hycom simulations furthermore the first peak corresponding to the large scale solution component and the 10th peak corresponding to the small scale solution component wavelength of 256 km in the velocity and vorticity spectra of the reduced order model are in excellent agreement with reference hycom data good agreement for the velocity and vorticity distributions in the top layer between the model predictions and the hycom data also confirms that the dissipation coefficients a h and a v and boundary conditions in eq 40 have been defined consistently 3 2 comparison with the quasi geostrophic model of the zonal channel to test the robustness of the suggested reduced order model as well as obtain further insights into the importance of non quasi geostrophic effects such as those included in the large vertical stretching term extracted from the hycom simulation the same model is also applied to reconstruct the solution of an idealized quasi geostrophic model in contrast to the hycom model the quasi geostrophic model considers an idealized flow domain corresponding to a shear driven zonal re entrant channel as outlined in section 2 2 the quasi geostrophic model includes three vertical layers and a flat bottom topography and is designed to represent main features of the flow in the hycom simulations specifically large scale forcing in the quasi geostrophic model was imposed by a background shear rather than wind stress this background flow corresponds to the large scale zonal velocity in the reduced order model v ϕ l constant and hence eq 31 is not required in this case in addition the quasi geostrophic model simulates zonal jets fig 2 that are similar to their counterparts in the more complex hycom model with a suitable recalibration of parameters the small scale equation in the reduced order model eq 40 can describe the zonal jet structure in the quasi geostrophic model as well as hycom to solve eq 40 a h l is directly replaced by the lateral viscosity parameter v 10 m 2 s 1 in eq 2 and the turbulence eddy viscosity coefficient is adjusted to c s 0 75 similar to the hycom case the eddy viscosity term couples the small scale equation to the background constant flow the advection of planetary vorticity f 1 and the vertical stretching term f 2 are computed from the time and zonally averaged meridional velocity v θ and its meridional gradient as well as the constant β 1 3 1 0 11 m 1 s 1 in the quasi geostrophic model consistent with the flat bottom topography in the quasi geostrophic model the zonal mean meridional velocity and the f 1 term are almost zero the magnitude of the vertical velocity is also less than ro v ϕ h l where ro is the rossby number and hence the zonal mean vertical stretching term f 2 is much smaller than in the hycom solution as a result no fine scale langevin adjustment of the effective viscosity parameters is applied to the viscous balance of the quasi geostrophic effects similar to the procedure used for the analysis of the hycom simulations the vertical distribution parameter λ is computed by matching the solution of the quasi geostrophic model as shown in fig 13 from which the effective length scale λ 400 m is obtained in the quasi geostrophic model the dependence of zonal jets on parameters such as bottom friction and background velocity berloff et al 2011 is agglomerated in the parameter λ furthermore since the vertical dissipation term does not enter the quasi geostrophic governing equation the corresponding coefficient is assumed to have the same value as in hycom a v 5 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 notably the same value of the coefficient was also reported in other primitive equation models dijkstra et al 2001 after the recalibration of the parameters of the semi analytical model eq 40 for the quasi geostrophic zonal channel case it is solved numerically using runge kutta method as for the hycom model previously results of the semi analytical model for the quasi geostrophic zonal channel are shown in figs 14 and 15 it can be noted that the solution of the reduced order model captures the meridional structure of zonal jets of the quasi geostrophic model very well in particular the reduced order model accurately predicts the dominant peaks of the velocity and vorticity spectra 4 conclusion time and zonally averaged properties of multiple zonal jets in the southern ocean are examined through developing a semi analytical model that is based on the two scale flow decomposition approach the development of the model is informed by a high fidelity hycom numerical simulation of the southern ocean region the results of the semi analytic model are further compared with an idealized quasi geostrophic model configured for the same ocean region the semi analytical quasi linear model captures the main two features of the flow the large scale zonal current and multiple alternating zonal jets to implicitly represent nonlinear effects in the hycom model the suggested two scale model uses a combination of suitably calibrated smagorinsky eddy viscosity and langevin dissipation model the latter is especially important for capturing non quasi geostrophic effects such as those due to the vertical stretching term this framework allows preserving important features of the simulated flow such as the spatial distribution of zonal jets and their wavenumber spectra in a semi analytical model ideally suitable for parametric studies to probe the robustness of the suggested semi analytical model and obtain physical insights on the importance of non quasi geostrophic effects the reduced order model is further applied to a quasi geostrophic model of the same oceanic region despite significant differences between assumptions and numerical approximations used in hycom and the quasi geostrophic channel model the current reduced order model can capture pertinent features of the zonal jets and elucidate the viscous balance in each case in contrast to several existing dynamical models of zonal jets based on idealized linear and nonlinear dynamics kaspi and flierl 2007 farrell and ioannou 2008 berloff et al 2009a rhines 1979 the suggested semi analytical model is derived from full solutions it combines correlated large scale and uncorrelated small scale forcing to explicitly consider the viscous balance at each scale which is required to maintain zonal jets in a statistically stationary regime following this approach it is shown that despite complexity of the underlying physics zonal jets effectively exhibit a quasi linear harmonic behavior where the advection of planetary vorticity and the vertical stretching term are balanced by horizontal and vertical viscous mixing this results in a viscous balance driven by both quasi geostrophic effects such as those induced by the large scale wind forcing and non quasi geostrophic effects due to the vertical motions and dissipation in future work the suggested reduced order model may be extended to elucidate the importance of viscous effects at different spatial scales in closed or semi closed ocean basins such as the pacific ocean where zonal jets coexist with gyre circulations credit authorship contribution statement s elnaz naghibi

23781,in this paper we explored the optimization process in adjoint method an optimization method based on the cumulative gradient is proposed to minimize the cost function on the basis of the gradient descent method the cumulative gradient is added and the information of first order gradient is further utilized to update the control variable instead of focusing on the gradient in the current iteration only the method combines the gradient information in the previous iterations by weighting and cumulating the previous gradients it can provide constructive guidance for the update direction and update stride of the control variable to test the optimization performance in the practical problem the method is applied to the correction of the bottom friction coefficient in the tidal wave model with adjoint method and the gradient descent method is set as the control the results show that the method based on the cumulative gradient can optimize the cost function to a lower level than the gradient descent method under the same number of iterations with our method the model had more accurate simulation results the simulation effect in areas without assimilation data is also tested and the results prove that the method has great stability and can work for the entire simulation area moreover the optimization efficiency of the method is much higher than that of the gradient descent method it can reach the same effect while the optimization time is greatly shortened in further experiments we compare some other optimization methods with the method in the paper and the optimization results of the cost function show that our method is still competitive our method is effective and simply implemented it requires few computation and storage resources which is of great significance for large scale optimization problems the method has shown satisfactory performance for optimization of the cost function in adjoint method it can enhance the assimilation effect and improve optimization efficiency to a certain extent the method has certain engineering significance for solving the optimization problems in the actual assimilation system as a general method it

ensemble variational assimilation 4denvar he et al 2017 the adjoint method is a typical four dimensional variational data assimilation method and has been widely used to estimate the bottom friction coefficient in numerical models wang et al 2021 as an advanced data assimilation technique the advantage of adjoint method is that time and space varying observations can be directly assimilated into a numerical model while maintaining consistency with the model in terms of its dynamics and physics gao et al 2010 wu et al 2022 given the unique advantage of combining observation data and ocean dynamic models adjoint method has a wide range of applications in ocean numerical simulations taking the ocean dynamic model as the constraint condition adjoint method can optimize the parameters or

inversion of initial conditions or boundary conditions zhang and lv 2010 deeply studied the inversion of open boundary conditions by a three dimensional nonlinear tidal current model with adjoint

al 2017 inversed open boundary conditions of the m 2 tide in the bohai sea and the yellow sea by assimilating altimeter data the uniqueness of adjoint method is to solve the problem under physical constraints it regards the assimilation process as a conditional minimum problem adjoint method attempts to minimize the cost function designed according to the simulations and observations the hydrodynamic equations initial conditions and boundary conditions are taken as constraints in the optimization problem in the process of solving the adjoint method constructs the lagrange function and transforms the conditional minimum problem into an unconstrained problem on this basis the control variables are adjusted by some optimization methods to reduce the value of the cost function as much as possible two important aspects for the optimization of unconstrained problems are the update direction and the update stride of control variables there are many classical methods for the adjustment of the update direction such as the gradient descent method newton method quasi newton method l bfgs method and so on chen et al 2009 liu and nocedal 1989 for the optimization of adjoint method in practical problems the gradient descent method is widely used gunzburger 2000 zhang and lv 2010 zhang et al 2015 many high order gradient methods are complex and require many storage resources sometimes they are difficult to apply to adjoint method when the dimension of the control variable is large moreover their optimization effect in practical problems is sometimes not as good as that of the gradient descent method zhang et al 2015 there are also some one dimensional search methods for adjustment of the update stride such as the bisection method and the golden section method mascarenhas 2004 however they need to calculate the cost function and the gradient repeatedly and the computational cost of this process is very large for numerical models shi and shen 2005 zhou 2009 the update stride is often set to a constant in practical problems however the gradient descent method with a fixed update stride sometimes has difficulty optimizing the cost function to the global optimum and its optimization speed is relatively slow therefore it is of great research value to explore more effective and simply implemented optimization methods to minimize cost function in assimilation process in recent years with the continuous development of deep learning technology the solution method of optimization problems has attracted extensive attention in the process of neural network training the loss function reflects the difference between the network output and the true value and it is necessary to minimize the loss function to optimize the parameters in the neural networks to improve the training efficiency of neural networks and speed up the decline of the loss function many optimization methods have been put forward the adaptive gradient method proposed by duchi et al 2011 uses the accumulated gradients to adjust the update stride of optimization parameters and can significantly improve the optimization speed the momentum method guides the current update of parameters by combining the previous gradient information and the method can improve the optimization effect and suppress the oscillation sutskever et al 2013 taking advantage of estimations of the first and second moments of the gradient the adaptive moment estimation method designs adaptive adjustments for different parameters and it improves the global optimization ability while guaranteeing efficiency kingma and ba 2015 dozat 2016 incorporated nesterov momentum into the adaptive moment estimation method and obtained more ideal optimization results the rectified adaptive moment estimation method reduces the variance of the adjustments based on the adaptive moment estimation method and it greatly enhances the robustness and stability of the method liu et al 2020 the above methods are widely used in the field of deep learning and greatly improve the training efficiency of neural networks unlike the optimization methods with high order gradient they use the accumulated gradient information to update parameters generally speaking the parameter dimension to be optimized in the deep learning model is very large these methods does not need to calculate the hessian matrix and they can greatly save memory and shorten optimization time although the methods are proposed for the specific field of neural network training we think that the strategy of using the cumulative gradient provides a new way to further utilize the information of the first order gradient to guide the update of parameters and this may have reference value for large scale parameter optimization problems in other fields for tidal wave models the bottom friction coefficient is an essential parameter and plays an important role in the performance of numerical models in shallow seas yao et al 2013 qian et al 2021 and a reasonable bottom friction coefficient can greatly improve the simulation effect of the tidal wave model however in the process of assimilation the high dimension of the bottom friction coefficient makes the optimization of cost function complex inspired by the above strategies in this paper we add cumulative gradient to improve the traditional gradient descent method and propose an optimization method based on the cumulative gradient the method is applied to the correction of the bottom friction coefficient in the tidal wave model and a series of experiments are set to test the performance of the method the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the method in detail and give the calculation steps and equations in section 3 we describe the numerical model and the associated model configuration in section 4 we introduce the experiments and analyze the experimental results in section 5 we make further discussions about the method in section 6 we show the summary and the expectation of our work 2 methods for an optimization problem with the parameter θ we set its dimension is i θ i is defined as the i th dimension i 1 2 i of θ θ i can be updated by the following equation 1 θ i k θ i k 1 λ i k d i k where θ i k is the value of θ i at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 d i k and λ i k are the update direction and the update stride at the k th iteration respectively actually it is not easy to determine d i k and λ i k in the conventional gradient descent method d i k is set as the negative gradient and λ i k i 1 2 i is the same constant gunzburger 2000 many other methods take some actions to design d i k and λ i k to obtain a better optimization effect mascarenhas 2004 chen et al 2009 however these methods are complex and consume many resources in large scale optimization problems in our method we design them based on the cumulative gradient during the iterative process it is simple to operate and will not cause huge resource occupation due to high dimensional parameters 2 1 the update direction updating the parameter in the opposite direction of the current gradient can often achieve a good convergence effect however in some cases relying only on the current gradient is easy to fall into the local extremum or the update stops when the gradient is too small this often leads to premature stagnation of update in the actual assimilation system to overcome these problems we guide the update direction d based on the combined action of the cumulative gradient and current gradient the form of the cumulative gradient refers to the momentum method sutskever et al 2013 we set j as the cost function j θ is defined as the gradient of j to θ c as the cumulative gradient for the i th dimension the calculation equation of c i k is shown in eq 2 2 c i k μ c i k 1 1 μ j θ i k 1 where c i k is the value of c i at the k th iteration and the initial value c i 0 0 j θ i k 1 is the gradient value of j to θ i k 1 μ is the weight coefficient and its range is 0 1 by eq 2 the gradients of previous states were weighted to obtain the cumulative gradient c i k and another expression of it is as follows 3 c i k 1 μ i n 1 k μ k i n j θ i k 1 we do not want all the previous gradient information to be included because gradients that are too remote will not make much sense to the current update in eq 3 it can be seen that the gradient is exponentially weighted the gradient information of the adjacent states is of great value to the current update their gradients account for large proportions while the influence of the gradient information in the previous far states is continuously weakened with exponential weighting the proportion of gradients in c i k is shown in fig 1 the update direction d i k is defined as follows 4 d i k c i k 1 j θ i k 1 compared with the traditional gradient descent method we combine the cumulative gradient with the current gradient as the direction of parameter update the vector relation of d c and j θ for two dimensional parameter is shown in fig 2 at the k th iteration the update direction d k of the parameter no longer follows the current gradient j θ k 1 but is affected by the joint action of the cumulative gradient c k 1 and c k 1 contains the gradient information in the previous iterations in this way even if the current gradient is small or even disappears the parameter can continue to be updated for d k after adding c k 1 the method usually has a better optimization effect than just j θ k 1 in most instances when the direction of j θ k 1 is the same as the direction of c k 1 d k can play a positive role in accelerating the search if the direction of j θ k 1 and c k 1 is opposite d k will slow down the update to suppress oscillation from the perspective of dynamics it seems that inertia is given to the update process and the previous gradients add power to the current parameter update ruder 2017 in eq 2 the weight coefficient μ has an important influence on the optimization process if μ is large more previous gradient information is contained in c i k and the parameter can be updated more smoothly however an excessively large μ will also weaken the timeliness of the update direction by trying we find that the method can achieve satisfactory results when μ 0 9 and this value is also used in all experiments it is worth noting that the cumulative gradient c adopts the iterative form and consists of the gradients calculated during the iteration for the calculation of c we just need use eq 2 to update it to a new value by the gradient at current iteration the amount of calculation for c is very small and the dimension of c is equal to the parameter therefore addition of the cumulative gradient will not increase too much computation and memory occupation compared with the gradient descent method 2 2 the update stride the update stride of the parameter is important in the optimization problem in the optimization process the state of the parameter relative to the optimization function is constantly changing and we hope that the stride can be continuously adjusted as well when the parameter is far from the extreme point the stride should be large to speed up the update when the parameter is close to the extreme point the stride should be cautious to prevent missing the optimal solution however because we do not know the distance between the parameter and the extreme point it is difficult to make an accurate adjustment for the update stride in the training of neural networks many adaptive stride adjustment methods use the cumulative gradient to make effective guidance for adjustment of the update stride duchi et al 2011 zeiler 2012 kingma and ba 2015 in our work the update stride of the parameter is also designed based on the cumulative gradient we use the form of the adaptive moment estimation method kingma and ba 2015 to set an adjustment coefficient for the fixed stride in the gradient descent method the cumulative gradient m and the quadratic cumulative gradient n are set at the k th iteration for the i th dimension m i k is calculated using eq 5 and n i k is calculated using eq 6 5 m i k η 1 m i k 1 1 η 1 j θ i k 1 6 n i k η 2 n i k 1 1 η 2 j θ i k 1 2 where m i k and n i k are the values of m i and n i at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 respectively and the initial values are m i 0 0 and n i 0 0 η 1 and η 2 are the weight coefficients whose ranges are 0 1 then we make modifications for m i k and n i k by eqs 7 and 8 the modified cumulative gradient m ˆ i k and the modified quadratic cumulative gradient n ˆ i k can be obtained 7 m ˆ i k m i k 1 η 1 k 8 n ˆ i k n i k 1 η 2 k the update stride λ i k is defined as follows 9 λ i k α m ˆ i k n ˆ i k ò where λ i k is the value of λ i at the k th iteration α is the stride factor and ò is a very small number to prevent the denominator from going to zero actually eqs 5 and 6 use the exponentially weighted operation on the gradient and its square value respectively since the initial value of m i k is set to zero there is a large deviation between it and the actual gradient in the initial states specifically the weight of the gradient is not normalized which results in an order of magnitude inconsistency between the gradient and m i k to obtain a better effect it need to make corrections it is not difficult to get the sum of all weights is 1 η 1 i n 1 k η 1 k i n 1 η 1 k therefore the modified cumulative gradient m ˆ i k is calculated by eq 7 similarly n i k is also modified by eq 8 similar to μ η 1 and η 2 will affect the adjustment of the update stride and we set η 1 to 0 9 and η 2 to 0 999 in the experiments which are recommended by kingma and ba ideally the update stride in the k th iteration is α m ˆ i k n ˆ i k formally m ˆ i k is similar to the mathematical expectation of j θ i k 1 and the same is true for n ˆ i k and j θ i k 1 2 so m ˆ i k n ˆ i k is dimensionless this can eliminate the influence of the gradient itself generally we want the update stride of each parameter to be controllable because a stride that is too large usually does not have a good convergence effect actually when η 1 η 2 m ˆ i k n ˆ i k will not exceed 1 and when η 1 η 2 m ˆ i k n ˆ i k is less than 1 or slightly greater than 1 kingma and ba 2015 compared with the gradient itself m ˆ i k n ˆ i k pays more attention to the change in gradient stability and it can indeed provide constructive guidance on the adjustment of the update stride let us consider the following situations 1 the gradient direction is constant and the gradient value is stable in this case the parameter is usually in a long downhill zone and the gradient will not change sharply as shown in fig 3 a the values of m ˆ i k and n ˆ i k are close and the update stride is large which is exactly what we expect if the gradient is stable there is usually no extreme point and the large update stride can speed up the optimization process 2 the gradient direction is constant but the gradient value is unstable instability of the gradient always indicates that the zone where the parameter is located is complex although the gradient direction does not change it should still be beware of the possibility of extreme points nearby fig 3 b shows the values of m ˆ i k n ˆ i k and m ˆ i k n ˆ i k in this situation m ˆ i k n ˆ i k will decrease with the aggravation of gradient instability when the gradient changes sharply the update becomes conservative 3 the gradient direction changes when the gradient direction changes frequently it is often close to the extreme point at this time the update should be cautious if the update stride is too large the parameter will always oscillate near the extreme point in this case as shown in fig 3 c m ˆ i k tends to be relatively small while n ˆ i k is still large since n i k is composed of the square of the gradient therefore m ˆ i k n ˆ i k will be reduced to promote the parameter to approach the extreme point 3 numerical model 3 1 forward model the 2d depth averaged multi constituent tidal wave model is used the governing

method is shown in fig 4 j is the value of the cost function and j c d represent j c d 3 3 model configuration to test the optimization effect of our method in practical problems the computational domain is set in the bohai sea the bohai sea is a semi enclosed inland sea and it is connected with the yellow sea through the bohai strait in the east the specific location is 117 35 e 121 10 e 37 07 n 41 00 n it is approximately 480 km long from north to south and 300 km wide from east to west and the average water depth is 18 m chen et al 2013 the regional range of the model is 117 5 e 122 5 e 37 n 41 n the horizontal resolution is 1 24 1 24 and the number of grid points is 121 97 the topography of the bohai sea and the positions of the tidal gauge stations are shown in fig 5 in the model we set an independent value of the bottom friction coefficient at each grid point of sea area the number of grid points in the sea area is 5944 which is also the dimension of the bottom friction coefficient the initial bottom friction coefficient at each grid point is set to the same value based on the observation data of tidal gauge stations they are corrected with the adjoint method the initial condition is ζ u v 0 and the normal velocity is zero in the closed boundary condition the open boundary is located at 122 5 e and the given water level is shown in eq 18 18 ζ obc h obc cos ω t φ obc where h obc and φ obc are the amplitude and phase lag of the tidal component at the open boundary respectively and ω is the angular frequency of the tidal component 4 experiments in the experiments the cost function is optimized by the method based on the cumulative gradient and the gradient descent method respectively c d i is defined as the value of the i th dimension i 1 2 3 5944 of the bottom friction coefficient c d for the gradient descent method c d i is adjusted by eq 19 19 c d i k c d i k 1 α j c d i k 1 where c d i k is the value of c d i at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 j c d i k 1 is the gradient of j to c d i k α is the stride factor and the value is fixed for the method based on the cumulative gradient the steps are as follows step1 initial c i 0 0 m i 0 0 and n i 0 0 step2 at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 take c d i k as the optimization parameter calculate c i k using eq 2 and calculate d i k using eq 4 calculate m i k and n i k by eqs 5 and 6 calculate m ˆ i k

iterations is consistent with the adjoint method and the gradient j c d i k 1 is calculated by the adjoint model at the k th iteration for brevity we use cg to represent the method based on the cumulative gradient and use gd to represent the gradient descent method in the following sections all experiments run in the same computing environment 4 1 experiment setup and results m 2 tide and s 2 tide are two important tidal components in the bohai sea we simulate the m 2 tide the tidal cycle is 12 4206 h and the s 2 tide the tidal cycle is 12 0000 h by the assimilated model all data of tidal gauge stations are used for assimilation the bottom friction coefficient in the model is corrected with gd and cg respectively to minimize the cost function for the m 2 tide the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient at each grid point is set to 1 5 10 3 the number of iterations is set to 500 each method sets its own appropriate stride factor during the optimization process the change curves of the cost function are shown in fig 6 after the assimilation process is completed the deviations between the simulation results and the observations of tidal gauge stations of the two methods are calculated and the results are listed in table 1 in table 1 δ h is the mean absolute deviation of the amplitude and δ φ is the mean absolute deviation of the phase lag the calculation formulas are as follows 21 δ h 1 n n 1 n δ h n 22 δ φ 1 n n 1 n δ φ n where n is the number of tidal gauge stations δ h and δ φ are absolute deviations δ h n h sim n h obs n and δ φ n φ sim n φ obs n h sim n and h obs n are the simulated and observed values of the amplitude φ sim n and φ obs n are the simulated and observed values of the phase lag σ is the root mean square deviation represents the

also be regarded as the distance between simulations and observations δ is the relative deviation and its formula is shown in eq 24 24 δ σ s where s is calculated by eq 25 25 s 1 n n 1 n a obs n a obs

and observed values 26 γ 2 1 δ 2 the absolute deviations of the amplitude and phase lag of the two methods in tidal gauge stations are shown in fig 7 for the m 2 tide the distributions of the corrected bottom friction coefficient are shown in fig 8 for simulation of the s 2 tide the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient at each grid point is set to 3 10 3 the number of iterations is set to 2000 the change curves of the cost function are shown in fig 9 the deviations for the s 2 tide are listed in table 2 the absolute deviations of the amplitude and phase lag of the two methods for the s 2 tide at tidal gauge stations are shown in fig 10 distributions of the corrected bottom friction coefficient for the s 2 tide are shown in fig 11 according to various indicators in tables 1 and 2 the model optimized by cg obtains more accurate simulation results than gd and it has smaller deviations and higher fitting degrees from figs 7 and 10 the simulated amplitude and phase lag of the model optimized by cg are closer to the observations than those optimized by gd for both the m 2 tide and s 2 tide at most tidal gauge stations the cost function is defined as the total deviation between simulation results and observation data and the objective of optimization is to minimize the total deviation so the deviation at some tide gauge stations for cg is slightly larger than gd in general cg is more satisfactory in terms of accuracy the corrected bottom friction coefficient of the two methods for the m 2 tide and s 2 tide shown in figs 8 and 11 roughly conform to the topographic conditions of the bohai sea and the results of previous scholars qian et al 2021 wang et al 2021 compared with gd cg makes the bottom friction coefficient update faster and the results is more hierarchical 4 2 effectiveness analysis of the method from the above experiments it can be observed that the cost function curves will prematurely stagnate when optimized with gd and cg can optimize the cost functions to lower values in the experiments the scale of the bottom friction coefficient is large and the optimization environment is complex when the gradient is small it is difficult to continue to update for gd based on the cumulative gradient cg will not stop updating when the current gradient is close to zero in addition the optimization speed of cg is also competitive in the initial stage of optimization the gradient is large and stable and the update stride of the bottom friction coefficient is at a high level for cg this makes the cost function decline rapidly and the parameters approach the extreme point quickly in the later stages of optimization the update stride can adjust adaptively although the value of the cost function for cg declines faster than that for gd it does not oscillate throughout the optimization process it is worth noting that the optimization time of the two methods is almost the same in the experiments for m 2 tide the time of gd is 9841 78 s the time of cg is 10097 03 s for s 2 tide the time of gd is 41453 61 s the time of cg is 41503 28 s because cg only makes use of the cumulative gradient during the iterations and does not require too many complex calculations the running time of the method will not increase obviously all variables of the method are in iterative form and it need not to calculate the hessian matrix although the dimension of bottom friction coefficient is large cg will not occupy too many storage resources 5 discussions 5 1 the simulation effect in areas without assimilation data the optimization should not be local and the optimization method must be stable and can work for the entire simulation area in the tidal wave model although the cost function is constructed from observation data of tidal gauge stations we hope the corrected bottom friction coefficient can improve the simulation effect of the model on the whole area in this part three experiments are carried out for the m 2 tide to test the simulation effect in areas without assimilation data the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient of each grid point is set to 1 5 10 3 and the numbers of iterations of gd in all three experiments are set to 2000 and we use cg to optimize the cost function to the same values correspondingly the specific setups are as follows exp00 assimilate the model with the data of numbers 1 3 5 19 tidal gauge stations and verify the assimilation results by the data of numbers 2 4 6 20 tidal gauge stations exp01 assimilate the model with the data of numbers 1 10 tidal gauge stations and verify the assimilation results by the data of numbers 11 20 tidal gauge stations exp02 assimilate the model with the satellite altimeter data and verify the assimilation results with the data from all tidal gauge stations in exp00 and exp01 the observations from half of the tidal gauge stations are used to assimilate the model with gd and cg respectively the tide gauge stations are distributed in the nearshore area to verify the adaptability of the method to the data distribution satellite altimeter data are used for assimilation in exp02 the satellite altimeter data are from ctoh along track tidal constants regional products and the data locations are shown in fig 12 after the assimilation process is completed the simulation effect of the model are verified by corresponding validation data for the three experiments comparisons of the simulated and observed amplitude and phase lag are shown in figs 13 14 and 15 respectively with cg the tidal wave model can relatively accurately simulate the amplitude and phase lag in validation areas although the amount of assimilation data is small in exp00 and exp01 the bottom friction coefficient corrected by cg provides accurate simulation results for the model fig 16 shows the simulated m 2 cotidal charts of the model optimized by cg in exp00 exp01 and exp02 we observe that the cotidal charts in the three experiments well reflect the tidal conditions of the bohai sea the distribution of the equal amplitude line and equal phase lag line is also almost consistent with previous results wang et al 2004 2014 although the distributions of assimilation data are different in the three experiments the assimilated model has a fine simulation performance over the entire sea area the comparison results of gd are also shown in the figures generally as the most commonly used optimization method gd has good stability for the optimization of adjoint method it can be seen that there is no obvious difference between the simulated results when the cost function is optimized to the same value by gd and cg cg also shows stable optimization performance in the experiments the number of iterations and optimization time optimization time is defined as the running time of the assimilation process of the optimization methods are also recorded and are shown in fig 17 when the cost function is optimized to the same value corresponding to gd the number of iterations for cg is 131 163 119 in exp00 exp01 exp02 respectively the optimization efficiency of cg is much higher than that of gd cg can optimize the cost function to a low level with a few iterations which greatly shortens the optimization time naturally the time taken for the assimilation process is also significantly shortened cg will not reduce the performance of the numerical model while improving the assimilation efficiency actually it is meaningful for the numerical simulation due to the timeliness of prediction the assimilation efficiency is important for the actual numerical prediction system and it determines whether the model can make a rapid prediction of environmental elements 5 2 comparison of the optimization effect for different methods in this section experiments are set to compare the optimization effect of cg and some other strategies experiments are carried out for correction of the bottom friction coefficient of m 2 and s 2 tidal models respectively all data of tidal gauge stations are used for assimilation for gradient descent method relevant stride adjustment strategies zhang et al 2015 are tried for optimization of the cost function gd1 on the basis of the gradient descent method the update stride for all dimensions at the k th iteration is set as 27 λ k α j c d k 1 2 j c d 0 2 where α is the stride factor j c d 0 is the gradient of j to initial bottom friction coefficient c d 0 gd2 on the basis of the gradient descent method set a different stride for each dimension and for c d i the update stride is defined as 28 λ i k α j c d i k 1 2 j c d k 1 for the m 2 tidal model the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient of each grid point is set to 1 5 10 3 and the number of iterations is 500 for the s 2 tidal model the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient of each grid point is set to 3 10 3 and the number of iterations is 2000 each method sets its own appropriate stride factor to make the cost function as small as possible the cost function curves of the methods for the m 2 tide and s 2 tide are shown in figs 18 and 19 respectively for gd1 the cost function decreases rapidly in the initial stage of optimization as the number of iterations increases the optimization efficiency of gd1 decreases gradually compared with gd in addition there is an oscillation for gd1 in fig 18 gd2 can make the cost function descend stably but the conservative stride adjustment reduces the optimization efficiency to a certain extent for cg the decline rate of the cost function is not as fast as gd1 and gd2 in the initial stage but after several iterations cg shows higher optimization efficiency and does not vibrate throughout the optimization process as a popular large scale parameter optimization method l bfgs algorithm liu and nocedal 1989 is also applied to our problems figs 20 and 21 show the cost function curves of l bfgs and cg for the m 2 tide and s 2 tide respectively in our problems l bfgs can quickly optimize the cost function to a smaller value but there is a very violent oscillation in the optimization process this instability also appears in the experiments of other scholars zhang et al 2015 yi et al 2018 it can be seen that under the appropriate stride factor the optimization effect of cg is satisfactory more importantly the cost function decreases continuously during the optimization process for cg 6 summary in this paper we proposed an optimization method of cost function in adjoint method based on the cumulative gradient on the basis of the gradient descent method the gradient information of the previous iterations is added to update the control variable taking advantage of the cumulative gradient it can provide constructive guidance for update of the control variable the method is applied to the correction of the bottom friction coefficient in the tidal wave model with adjoint method the gradient descent method is set as the control to compare the optimization effects with our method under the same number of iterations the method based on the cumulative gradient can optimize the cost function to a lower level than the gradient descent method with our method the assimilated model had more accurate simulation results on this basis part of observations are used for assimilation and the others for verification the results show that the assimilated model optimized with our method can accurately simulate the amplitude and phase lag in the validation areas meanwhile the optimization efficiency of the method is much higher than that of the gradient descent method it can reach the same effect as the gradient descent method while the optimization time is greatly shortened finally the optimization effect on the cost function of several optimization methods are further compared the results show that the method based on the cumulative gradient is still competitive relative to optimization methods based on high order gradients the cumulative gradient may be valuable to make full use of the first order gradient to guide the parameter update because the calculation cost of high order gradients the complexity of related methods and the resource occupation are sometimes high the method in the paper requires few computation and storage resources and does not need to

23781,in this paper we explored the optimization process in adjoint method an optimization method based on the cumulative gradient is proposed to minimize the cost function on the basis of the gradient descent method the cumulative gradient is added and the information of first order gradient is further utilized to update the control variable instead of focusing on the gradient in the current iteration only the method combines the gradient information in the previous iterations by weighting and cumulating the previous gradients it can provide constructive guidance for the update direction and update stride of the control variable to test the optimization performance in the practical problem the method is applied to the correction of the bottom friction coefficient in the tidal wave model with adjoint method and the gradient descent method is set as the control the results show that the method based on the cumulative gradient can optimize the cost function to a lower level than the gradient descent method under the same number of iterations with our method the model had more accurate simulation results the simulation effect in areas without assimilation data is also tested and the results prove that the method has great stability and can work for the entire simulation area moreover the optimization efficiency of the method is much higher than that of the gradient descent method it can reach the same effect while the optimization time is greatly shortened in further experiments we compare some other optimization methods with the method in the paper and the optimization results of the cost function show that our method is still competitive our method is effective and simply implemented it requires few computation and storage resources which is of great significance for large scale optimization problems the method has shown satisfactory performance for optimization of the cost function in adjoint method it can enhance the assimilation effect and improve optimization efficiency to a certain extent the method has certain engineering significance for solving the optimization problems in the actual assimilation system as a general method it may provide a reference for the selection and innovation of optimization methods in data assimilation process keywords adjoint method optimization method tidal wave model bottom friction coefficient cost function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an effective means to combine observation data with ocean numerical models data assimilation technology is widely used in ocean numerical prediction it encompasses a broad set of mathematical and computational tools and aims to provide the best description of the time varying ocean environment stammer et al 2016 data assimilation seeks to minimize the residual between model predictions and observations it mathematically estimates the optimal value of control variables in the model to reduce the numerical prediction error edwards et al 2015 the common assimilation methods include nudging method anthes 1974 kalman filtering kalman 1960 ensemble kalman filtering enkf evensen 1994 three dimensional variational assimilation 3dvar saha et al 2010 four dimensional variational assimilation 4dvar mochizuki et al 2016 ensemble of 4dvars en4dvar hamill and snyder 2000 and four dimensional ensemble variational assimilation 4denvar he et al 2017 the adjoint method is a typical four dimensional variational data assimilation method and has been widely used to estimate the bottom friction coefficient in numerical models wang et al 2021 as an advanced data assimilation technique the advantage of adjoint method is that time and space varying observations can be directly assimilated into a numerical model while maintaining consistency with the model in terms of its dynamics and physics gao et al 2010 wu et al 2022 given the unique advantage of combining observation data and ocean dynamic models adjoint method has a wide range of applications in ocean numerical simulations taking the ocean dynamic model as the constraint condition adjoint method can optimize the parameters or variables in the model with observation data adjoint method can be applied to solve many different types of practical problems including correction of parameters in the hydrodynamic equations and inversion of initial conditions or boundary conditions zhang and lv 2010 deeply studied the inversion of open boundary conditions by a three dimensional nonlinear tidal current model with adjoint method and obtained the simulation results of tidal currents in the bohai sea and the yellow sea by assimilating altimeter data based on a two dimensional tidal wave model zhang et al 2011 used the adjoint method to correct the bottom friction coefficients of the bohai sea and the yellow sea chen et al 2011 studied the inversion of open boundary conditions through ideal experiments based on a tidal numerical model with adjoint method cao et al 2017 explored the inversion process of open boundary conditions by a two dimensional tidal wave model with adjoint method and simulated the m 2 tide of the bohai sea and the yellow sea by assimilating altimeter data altaf et al 2012 used the adjoint method to estimate the water depth and bottom friction coefficient based on a large scale shallow water model of the european continental shelf gao et al 2015 optimized the bottom friction coefficient and the internal tide dissipation coefficient in the south china sea by the adjoint method pan et al 2017 inversed open boundary conditions of the m 2 tide in the bohai sea and the yellow sea by assimilating altimeter data the uniqueness of adjoint method is to solve the problem under physical constraints it regards the assimilation process as a conditional minimum problem adjoint method attempts to minimize the cost function designed according to the simulations and observations the hydrodynamic equations initial conditions and boundary conditions are taken as constraints in the optimization problem in the process of solving the adjoint method constructs the lagrange function and transforms the conditional minimum problem into an unconstrained problem on this basis the control variables are adjusted by some optimization methods to reduce the value of the cost function as much as possible two important aspects for the optimization of unconstrained problems are the update direction and the update stride of control variables there are many classical methods for the adjustment of the update direction such as the gradient descent method newton method quasi newton method l bfgs method and so on chen et al 2009 liu and nocedal 1989 for the optimization of adjoint method in practical problems the gradient descent method is widely used gunzburger 2000 zhang and lv 2010 zhang et al 2015 many high order gradient methods are complex and require many storage resources sometimes they are difficult to apply to adjoint method when the dimension of the control variable is large moreover their optimization effect in practical problems is sometimes not as good as that of the gradient descent method zhang et al 2015 there are also some one dimensional search methods for adjustment of the update stride such as the bisection method and the golden section method mascarenhas 2004 however they need to calculate the cost function and the gradient repeatedly and the computational cost of this process is very large for numerical models shi and shen 2005 zhou 2009 the update stride is often set to a constant in practical problems however the gradient descent method with a fixed update stride sometimes has difficulty optimizing the cost function to the global optimum and its optimization speed is relatively slow therefore it is of great research value to explore more effective and simply implemented optimization methods to minimize cost function in assimilation process in recent years with the continuous development of deep learning technology the solution method of optimization problems has attracted extensive attention in the process of neural network training the loss function reflects the difference between the network output and the true value and it is necessary to minimize the loss function to optimize the parameters in the neural networks to improve the training efficiency of neural networks and speed up the decline of the loss function many optimization methods have been put forward the adaptive gradient method proposed by duchi et al 2011 uses the accumulated gradients to adjust the update stride of optimization parameters and can significantly improve the optimization speed the momentum method guides the current update of parameters by combining the previous gradient information and the method can improve the optimization effect and suppress the oscillation sutskever et al 2013 taking advantage of estimations of the first and second moments of the gradient the adaptive moment estimation method designs adaptive adjustments for different parameters and it improves the global optimization ability while guaranteeing efficiency kingma and ba 2015 dozat 2016 incorporated nesterov momentum into the adaptive moment estimation method and obtained more ideal optimization results the rectified adaptive moment estimation method reduces the variance of the adjustments based on the adaptive moment estimation method and it greatly enhances the robustness and stability of the method liu et al 2020 the above methods are widely used in the field of deep learning and greatly improve the training efficiency of neural networks unlike the optimization methods with high order gradient they use the accumulated gradient information to update parameters generally speaking the parameter dimension to be optimized in the deep learning model is very large these methods does not need to calculate the hessian matrix and they can greatly save memory and shorten optimization time although the methods are proposed for the specific field of neural network training we think that the strategy of using the cumulative gradient provides a new way to further utilize the information of the first order gradient to guide the update of parameters and this may have reference value for large scale parameter optimization problems in other fields for tidal wave models the bottom friction coefficient is an essential parameter and plays an important role in the performance of numerical models in shallow seas yao et al 2013 qian et al 2021 and a reasonable bottom friction coefficient can greatly improve the simulation effect of the tidal wave model however in the process of assimilation the high dimension of the bottom friction coefficient makes the optimization of cost function complex inspired by the above strategies in this paper we add cumulative gradient to improve the traditional gradient descent method and propose an optimization method based on the cumulative gradient the method is applied to the correction of the bottom friction coefficient in the tidal wave model and a series of experiments are set to test the performance of the method the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the method in detail and give the calculation steps and equations in section 3 we describe the numerical model and the associated model configuration in section 4 we introduce the experiments and analyze the experimental results in section 5 we make further discussions about the method in section 6 we show the summary and the expectation of our work 2 methods for an optimization problem with the parameter θ we set its dimension is i θ i is defined as the i th dimension i 1 2 i of θ θ i can be updated by the following equation 1 θ i k θ i k 1 λ i k d i k where θ i k is the value of θ i at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 d i k and λ i k are the update direction and the update stride at the k th iteration respectively actually it is not easy to determine d i k and λ i k in the conventional gradient descent method d i k is set as the negative gradient and λ i k i 1 2 i is the same constant gunzburger 2000 many other methods take some actions to design d i k and λ i k to obtain a better optimization effect mascarenhas 2004 chen et al 2009 however these methods are complex and consume many resources in large scale optimization problems in our method we design them based on the cumulative gradient during the iterative process it is simple to operate and will not cause huge resource occupation due to high dimensional parameters 2 1 the update direction updating the parameter in the opposite direction of the current gradient can often achieve a good convergence effect however in some cases relying only on the current gradient is easy to fall into the local extremum or the update stops when the gradient is too small this often leads to premature stagnation of update in the actual assimilation system to overcome these problems we guide the update direction d based on the combined action of the cumulative gradient and current gradient the form of the cumulative gradient refers to the momentum method sutskever et al 2013 we set j as the cost function j θ is defined as the gradient of j to θ c as the cumulative gradient for the i th dimension the calculation equation of c i k is shown in eq 2 2 c i k μ c i k 1 1 μ j θ i k 1 where c i k is the value of c i at the k th iteration and the initial value c i 0 0 j θ i k 1 is the gradient value of j to θ i k 1 μ is the weight coefficient and its range is 0 1 by eq 2 the gradients of previous states were weighted to obtain the cumulative gradient c i k and another expression of it is as follows 3 c i k 1 μ i n 1 k μ k i n j θ i k 1 we do not want all the previous gradient information to be included because gradients that are too remote will not make much sense to the current update in eq 3 it can be seen that the gradient is exponentially weighted the gradient information of the adjacent states is of great value to the current update their gradients account for large proportions while the influence of the gradient information in the previous far states is continuously weakened with exponential weighting the proportion of gradients in c i k is shown in fig 1 the update direction d i k is defined as follows 4 d i k c i k 1 j θ i k 1 compared with the traditional gradient descent method we combine the cumulative gradient with the current gradient as the direction of parameter update the vector relation of d c and j θ for two dimensional parameter is shown in fig 2 at the k th iteration the update direction d k of the parameter no longer follows the current gradient j θ k 1 but is affected by the joint action of the cumulative gradient c k 1 and c k 1 contains the gradient information in the previous iterations in this way even if the current gradient is small or even disappears the parameter can continue to be updated for d k after adding c k 1 the method usually has a better optimization effect than just j θ k 1 in most instances when the direction of j θ k 1 is the same as the direction of c k 1 d k can play a positive role in accelerating the search if the direction of j θ k 1 and c k 1 is opposite d k will slow down the update to suppress oscillation from the perspective of dynamics it seems that inertia is given to the update process and the previous gradients add power to the current parameter update ruder 2017 in eq 2 the weight coefficient μ has an important influence on the optimization process if μ is large more previous gradient information is contained in c i k and the parameter can be updated more smoothly however an excessively large μ will also weaken the timeliness of the update direction by trying we find that the method can achieve satisfactory results when μ 0 9 and this value is also used in all experiments it is worth noting that the cumulative gradient c adopts the iterative form and consists of the gradients calculated during the iteration for the calculation of c we just need use eq 2 to update it to a new value by the gradient at current iteration the amount of calculation for c is very small and the dimension of c is equal to the parameter therefore addition of the cumulative gradient will not increase too much computation and memory occupation compared with the gradient descent method 2 2 the update stride the update stride of the parameter is important in the optimization problem in the optimization process the state of the parameter relative to the optimization function is constantly changing and we hope that the stride can be continuously adjusted as well when the parameter is far from the extreme point the stride should be large to speed up the update when the parameter is close to the extreme point the stride should be cautious to prevent missing the optimal solution however because we do not know the distance between the parameter and the extreme point it is difficult to make an accurate adjustment for the update stride in the training of neural networks many adaptive stride adjustment methods use the cumulative gradient to make effective guidance for adjustment of the update stride duchi et al 2011 zeiler 2012 kingma and ba 2015 in our work the update stride of the parameter is also designed based on the cumulative gradient we use the form of the adaptive moment estimation method kingma and ba 2015 to set an adjustment coefficient for the fixed stride in the gradient descent method the cumulative gradient m and the quadratic cumulative gradient n are set at the k th iteration for the i th dimension m i k is calculated using eq 5 and n i k is calculated using eq 6 5 m i k η 1 m i k 1 1 η 1 j θ i k 1 6 n i k η 2 n i k 1 1 η 2 j θ i k 1 2 where m i k and n i k are the values of m i and n i at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 respectively and the initial values are m i 0 0 and n i 0 0 η 1 and η 2 are the weight coefficients whose ranges are 0 1 then we make modifications for m i k and n i k by eqs 7 and 8 the modified cumulative gradient m ˆ i k and the modified quadratic cumulative gradient n ˆ i k can be obtained 7 m ˆ i k m i k 1 η 1 k 8 n ˆ i k n i k 1 η 2 k the update stride λ i k is defined as follows 9 λ i k α m ˆ i k n ˆ i k ò where λ i k is the value of λ i at the k th iteration α is the stride factor and ò is a very small number to prevent the denominator from going to zero actually eqs 5 and 6 use the exponentially weighted operation on the gradient and its square value respectively since the initial value of m i k is set to zero there is a large deviation between it and the actual gradient in the initial states specifically the weight of the gradient is not normalized which results in an order of magnitude inconsistency between the gradient and m i k to obtain a better effect it need to make corrections it is not difficult to get the sum of all weights is 1 η 1 i n 1 k η 1 k i n 1 η 1 k therefore the modified cumulative gradient m ˆ i k is calculated by eq 7 similarly n i k is also modified by eq 8 similar to μ η 1 and η 2 will affect the adjustment of the update stride and we set η 1 to 0 9 and η 2 to 0 999 in the experiments which are recommended by kingma and ba ideally the update stride in the k th iteration is α m ˆ i k n ˆ i k formally m ˆ i k is similar to the mathematical expectation of j θ i k 1 and the same is true for n ˆ i k and j θ i k 1 2 so m ˆ i k n ˆ i k is dimensionless this can eliminate the influence of the gradient itself generally we want the update stride of each parameter to be controllable because a stride that is too large usually does not have a good convergence effect actually when η 1 η 2 m ˆ i k n ˆ i k will not exceed 1 and when η 1 η 2 m ˆ i k n ˆ i k is less than 1 or slightly greater than 1 kingma and ba 2015 compared with the gradient itself m ˆ i k n ˆ i k pays more attention to the change in gradient stability and it can indeed provide constructive guidance on the adjustment of the update stride let us consider the following situations 1 the gradient direction is constant and the gradient value is stable in this case the parameter is usually in a long downhill zone and the gradient will not change sharply as shown in fig 3 a the values of m ˆ i k and n ˆ i k are close and the update stride is large which is exactly what we expect if the gradient is stable there is usually no extreme point and the large update stride can speed up the optimization process 2 the gradient direction is constant but the gradient value is unstable instability of the gradient always indicates that the zone where the parameter is located is complex although the gradient direction does not change it should still be beware of the possibility of extreme points nearby fig 3 b shows the values of m ˆ i k n ˆ i k and m ˆ i k n ˆ i k in this situation m ˆ i k n ˆ i k will decrease with the aggravation of gradient instability when the gradient changes sharply the update becomes conservative 3 the gradient direction changes when the gradient direction changes frequently it is often close to the extreme point at this time the update should be cautious if the update stride is too large the parameter will always oscillate near the extreme point in this case as shown in fig 3 c m ˆ i k tends to be relatively small while n ˆ i k is still large since n i k is composed of the square of the gradient therefore m ˆ i k n ˆ i k will be reduced to promote the parameter to approach the extreme point 3 numerical model 3 1 forward model the 2d depth averaged multi constituent tidal wave model is used the governing

method is shown in fig 4 j is the value of the cost function and j c d represent j c d 3 3 model configuration to test the optimization effect of our method in practical problems the computational domain is set in the bohai sea the bohai sea is a semi enclosed inland sea and it is connected with the yellow sea through the bohai strait in the east the specific location is 117 35 e 121 10 e 37 07 n 41 00 n it is approximately 480 km long from north to south and 300 km wide from east to west and the average water depth is 18 m chen et al 2013 the regional range of the model is 117 5 e 122 5 e 37 n 41 n the horizontal resolution is 1 24 1 24 and the number of grid points is 121 97 the topography of the bohai sea and the positions of the tidal gauge stations are shown in fig 5 in the model we set an independent value of the bottom friction coefficient at each grid point of sea area the number of grid points in the sea area is 5944 which is also the dimension of the bottom friction coefficient the initial bottom friction coefficient at each grid point is set to the same value based on the observation data of tidal gauge stations they are corrected with the adjoint method the initial condition is ζ u v 0 and the normal velocity is zero in the closed boundary condition the open boundary is located at 122 5 e and the given water level is shown in eq 18 18 ζ obc h obc cos ω t φ obc where h obc and φ obc are the amplitude and phase lag of the tidal component at the open boundary respectively and ω is the angular frequency of the tidal component 4 experiments in the experiments the cost function is optimized by the method based on the cumulative gradient and the gradient descent method respectively c d i is defined as the value of the i th dimension i 1 2 3 5944 of the bottom friction coefficient c d for the gradient descent method c d i is adjusted by eq 19 19 c d i k c d i k 1 α j c d i k 1 where c d i k is the value of c d i at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 j c d i k 1 is the gradient of j to c d i k α is the stride factor and the value is fixed for the method based on the cumulative gradient the steps are as follows step1 initial c i 0 0 m i 0 0 and n i 0 0 step2 at the k th iteration k 1 2 3 take c d i k as the optimization parameter calculate c i k using eq 2 and calculate d i k using eq 4 calculate m i k and n i k by eqs 5 and 6 calculate m ˆ i k

iterations is consistent with the adjoint method and the gradient j c d i k 1 is calculated by the adjoint model at the k th iteration for brevity we use cg to represent the method based on the cumulative gradient and use gd to represent the gradient descent method in the following sections all experiments run in the same computing environment 4 1 experiment setup and results m 2 tide and s 2 tide are two important tidal components in the bohai sea we simulate the m 2 tide the tidal cycle is 12 4206 h and the s 2 tide the tidal cycle is 12 0000 h by the assimilated model all data of tidal gauge stations are used for assimilation the bottom friction coefficient in the model is corrected with gd and cg respectively to minimize the cost function for the m 2 tide the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient at each grid point is set to 1 5 10 3 the number of iterations is set to 500 each method sets its own appropriate stride factor during the optimization process the change curves of the cost function are shown in fig 6 after the assimilation process is completed the deviations between the simulation results and the observations of tidal gauge stations of the two methods are calculated and the results are listed in table 1 in table 1 δ h is the mean absolute deviation of the amplitude and δ φ is the mean absolute deviation of the phase lag the calculation formulas are as follows 21 δ h 1 n n 1 n δ h n 22 δ φ 1 n n 1 n δ φ n where n is the number of tidal gauge stations δ h and δ φ are absolute deviations δ h n h sim n h obs n and δ φ n φ sim n φ obs n h sim n and h obs n are the simulated and observed values of the amplitude φ sim n and φ obs n are the simulated and observed values of the phase lag σ is the root mean square deviation represents the

also be regarded as the distance between simulations and observations δ is the relative deviation and its formula is shown in eq 24 24 δ σ s where s is calculated by eq 25 25 s 1 n n 1 n a obs n a obs

and observed values 26 γ 2 1 δ 2 the absolute deviations of the amplitude and phase lag of the two methods in tidal gauge stations are shown in fig 7 for the m 2 tide the distributions of the corrected bottom friction coefficient are shown in fig 8 for simulation of the s 2 tide the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient at each grid point is set to 3 10 3 the number of iterations is set to 2000 the change curves of the cost function are shown in fig 9 the deviations for the s 2 tide are listed in table 2 the absolute deviations of the amplitude and phase lag of the two methods for the s 2 tide at tidal gauge stations are shown in fig 10 distributions of the corrected bottom friction coefficient for the s 2 tide are shown in fig 11 according to various indicators in tables 1 and 2 the model optimized by cg obtains more accurate simulation results than gd and it has smaller deviations and higher fitting degrees from figs 7 and 10 the simulated amplitude and phase lag of the model optimized by cg are closer to the observations than those optimized by gd for both the m 2 tide and s 2 tide at most tidal gauge stations the cost function is defined as the total deviation between simulation results and observation data and the objective of optimization is to minimize the total deviation so the deviation at some tide gauge stations for cg is slightly larger than gd in general cg is more satisfactory in terms of accuracy the corrected bottom friction coefficient of the two methods for the m 2 tide and s 2 tide shown in figs 8 and 11 roughly conform to the topographic conditions of the bohai sea and the results of previous scholars qian et al 2021 wang et al 2021 compared with gd cg makes the bottom friction coefficient update faster and the results is more hierarchical 4 2 effectiveness analysis of the method from the above experiments it can be observed that the cost function curves will prematurely stagnate when optimized with gd and cg can optimize the cost functions to lower values in the experiments the scale of the bottom friction coefficient is large and the optimization environment is complex when the gradient is small it is difficult to continue to update for gd based on the cumulative gradient cg will not stop updating when the current gradient is close to zero in addition the optimization speed of cg is also competitive in the initial stage of optimization the gradient is large and stable and the update stride of the bottom friction coefficient is at a high level for cg this makes the cost function decline rapidly and the parameters approach the extreme point quickly in the later stages of optimization the update stride can adjust adaptively although the value of the cost function for cg declines faster than that for gd it does not oscillate throughout the optimization process it is worth noting that the optimization time of the two methods is almost the same in the experiments for m 2 tide the time of gd is 9841 78 s the time of cg is 10097 03 s for s 2 tide the time of gd is 41453 61 s the time of cg is 41503 28 s because cg only makes use of the cumulative gradient during the iterations and does not require too many complex calculations the running time of the method will not increase obviously all variables of the method are in iterative form and it need not to calculate the hessian matrix although the dimension of bottom friction coefficient is large cg will not occupy too many storage resources 5 discussions 5 1 the simulation effect in areas without assimilation data the optimization should not be local and the optimization method must be stable and can work for the entire simulation area in the tidal wave model although the cost function is constructed from observation data of tidal gauge stations we hope the corrected bottom friction coefficient can improve the simulation effect of the model on the whole area in this part three experiments are carried out for the m 2 tide to test the simulation effect in areas without assimilation data the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient of each grid point is set to 1 5 10 3 and the numbers of iterations of gd in all three experiments are set to 2000 and we use cg to optimize the cost function to the same values correspondingly the specific setups are as follows exp00 assimilate the model with the data of numbers 1 3 5 19 tidal gauge stations and verify the assimilation results by the data of numbers 2 4 6 20 tidal gauge stations exp01 assimilate the model with the data of numbers 1 10 tidal gauge stations and verify the assimilation results by the data of numbers 11 20 tidal gauge stations exp02 assimilate the model with the satellite altimeter data and verify the assimilation results with the data from all tidal gauge stations in exp00 and exp01 the observations from half of the tidal gauge stations are used to assimilate the model with gd and cg respectively the tide gauge stations are distributed in the nearshore area to verify the adaptability of the method to the data distribution satellite altimeter data are used for assimilation in exp02 the satellite altimeter data are from ctoh along track tidal constants regional products and the data locations are shown in fig 12 after the assimilation process is completed the simulation effect of the model are verified by corresponding validation data for the three experiments comparisons of the simulated and observed amplitude and phase lag are shown in figs 13 14 and 15 respectively with cg the tidal wave model can relatively accurately simulate the amplitude and phase lag in validation areas although the amount of assimilation data is small in exp00 and exp01 the bottom friction coefficient corrected by cg provides accurate simulation results for the model fig 16 shows the simulated m 2 cotidal charts of the model optimized by cg in exp00 exp01 and exp02 we observe that the cotidal charts in the three experiments well reflect the tidal conditions of the bohai sea the distribution of the equal amplitude line and equal phase lag line is also almost consistent with previous results wang et al 2004 2014 although the distributions of assimilation data are different in the three experiments the assimilated model has a fine simulation performance over the entire sea area the comparison results of gd are also shown in the figures generally as the most commonly used optimization method gd has good stability for the optimization of adjoint method it can be seen that there is no obvious difference between the simulated results when the cost function is optimized to the same value by gd and cg cg also shows stable optimization performance in the experiments the number of iterations and optimization time optimization time is defined as the running time of the assimilation process of the optimization methods are also recorded and are shown in fig 17 when the cost function is optimized to the same value corresponding to gd the number of iterations for cg is 131 163 119 in exp00 exp01 exp02 respectively the optimization efficiency of cg is much higher than that of gd cg can optimize the cost function to a low level with a few iterations which greatly shortens the optimization time naturally the time taken for the assimilation process is also significantly shortened cg will not reduce the performance of the numerical model while improving the assimilation efficiency actually it is meaningful for the numerical simulation due to the timeliness of prediction the assimilation efficiency is important for the actual numerical prediction system and it determines whether the model can make a rapid prediction of environmental elements 5 2 comparison of the optimization effect for different methods in this section experiments are set to compare the optimization effect of cg and some other strategies experiments are carried out for correction of the bottom friction coefficient of m 2 and s 2 tidal models respectively all data of tidal gauge stations are used for assimilation for gradient descent method relevant stride adjustment strategies zhang et al 2015 are tried for optimization of the cost function gd1 on the basis of the gradient descent method the update stride for all dimensions at the k th iteration is set as 27 λ k α j c d k 1 2 j c d 0 2 where α is the stride factor j c d 0 is the gradient of j to initial bottom friction coefficient c d 0 gd2 on the basis of the gradient descent method set a different stride for each dimension and for c d i the update stride is defined as 28 λ i k α j c d i k 1 2 j c d k 1 for the m 2 tidal model the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient of each grid point is set to 1 5 10 3 and the number of iterations is 500 for the s 2 tidal model the initial value of the bottom friction coefficient of each grid point is set to 3 10 3 and the number of iterations is 2000 each method sets its own appropriate stride factor to make the cost function as small as possible the cost function curves of the methods for the m 2 tide and s 2 tide are shown in figs 18 and 19 respectively for gd1 the cost function decreases rapidly in the initial stage of optimization as the number of iterations increases the optimization efficiency of gd1 decreases gradually compared with gd in addition there is an oscillation for gd1 in fig 18 gd2 can make the cost function descend stably but the conservative stride adjustment reduces the optimization efficiency to a certain extent for cg the decline rate of the cost function is not as fast as gd1 and gd2 in the initial stage but after several iterations cg shows higher optimization efficiency and does not vibrate throughout the optimization process as a popular large scale parameter optimization method l bfgs algorithm liu and nocedal 1989 is also applied to our problems figs 20 and 21 show the cost function curves of l bfgs and cg for the m 2 tide and s 2 tide respectively in our problems l bfgs can quickly optimize the cost function to a smaller value but there is a very violent oscillation in the optimization process this instability also appears in the experiments of other scholars zhang et al 2015 yi et al 2018 it can be seen that under the appropriate stride factor the optimization effect of cg is satisfactory more importantly the cost function decreases continuously during the optimization process for cg 6 summary in this paper we proposed an optimization method of cost function in adjoint method based on the cumulative gradient on the basis of the gradient descent method the gradient information of the previous iterations is added to update the control variable taking advantage of the cumulative gradient it can provide constructive guidance for update of the control variable the method is applied to the correction of the bottom friction coefficient in the tidal wave model with adjoint method the gradient descent method is set as the control to compare the optimization effects with our method under the same number of iterations the method based on the cumulative gradient can optimize the cost function to a lower level than the gradient descent method with our method the assimilated model had more accurate simulation results on this basis part of observations are used for assimilation and the others for verification the results show that the assimilated model optimized with our method can accurately simulate the amplitude and phase lag in the validation areas meanwhile the optimization efficiency of the method is much higher than that of the gradient descent method it can reach the same effect as the gradient descent method while the optimization time is greatly shortened finally the optimization effect on the cost function of several optimization methods are further compared the results show that the method based on the cumulative gradient is still competitive relative to optimization methods based on high order gradients the cumulative gradient may be valuable to make full use of the first order gradient to guide the parameter update because the calculation cost of high order gradients the complexity of related methods and the resource occupation are sometimes high the method in the paper requires few computation and storage resources and does not need to calculate the hessian matrix which is of great significance for large scale optimization problems the method has some weight coefficients and the values used in this paper have made the method achieve satisfactory results for various experiments they are applicable to most scenarios however in a few cases the weight coefficients may need to be fine tuned to get better results the optimization process has a great impact on the output results and running time of the numerical model with adjoint method the method based on the cumulative gradient has shown satisfactory performance for the optimization of adjoint assimilation method in tidal wave models in face of high dimensional parameters it can enhance the assimilation effect and improve the optimization efficiency to a certain extent our work may provide a reference for the selection and innovation of optimization methods in the assimilation system credit authorship contribution statement jian wang conceptualization

23782,ocean components of earth system models employed for climate projections do not routinely resolve mesoscale eddies for computational cost reasons and the associated subgrid processes are still parameterised while the performance of physics parameterisations in a numerical ocean model is normally assessed by examining the associated physical responses biogeochemical responses are also important but often treated separately given recent advances in mesoscale eddy parameterisations specifically for the eddy induced advection this work systematically explores the joint consequences for physical as well as biogeochemical responses brought about by a more updated proposal for the eddy induced velocity coefficient in the context of an idealised ocean relevant model relative to a high resolution mesoscale eddy resolving model the more updated mesoscale eddy parameterisation is able to capture aspects of the model truth in the physical responses the biogeochemical response is however rather more subtle where a better response with the conventional eddy parameterisation with a constant coefficient could arise from a physically inconsistent response while a parameterisation that improves the bulk physical response may still fall short in its biogeochemical response the present work highlights a need to assess both physical and biogeochemical aspects when judging the performance of eddy parameterisations and additionally provides some important baseline model sensitivities that future assessments employing other parameterisations or in more complex settings could compare against keywords mesoscale eddy parameterisation numerical modelling climate change biophysical interactions data availability processed and sample data for this work is made available on a

carbon and nutrient cycles and affects the global climate and the marine ecosystem e g rahmstorf 2002 doney et al 2012 over the decadal to centennial time scales more heat is expected to reside in the upper part of the ocean under climate projection exercises e g ipcc 2019 strengthening the upper ocean stratification and changing the ocean ventilation pathways e g bindoff and mcdougall 1994 li et al 2020 the ocean meridional overturning circulation is projected to slow down partly via the shoaling of the pycnocline though uncertainties still exist e g bellomo et al 2021 changes in the ocean overturning circulation can affect the bulk transport of nutrients which can then have large scale impacts on the phytoplankton populations as primary producers phytoplankton play an important role in the global carbon cycle and impact issues of food security via their position at the base of most oceanic food webs while there is large uncertainty in the physiological responses of various marine biomass to the changing marine environment in terms of heat stress nutrient abundance acidity and others e g kwiatkowski et al 2020 tagliabue et al 2021 martiny et al 2022 it is not controversial to say that the physical circulation can impact the broad regional and global biogeochemical response one such link is the impact of the circulation on nutrient supply though such projections often come with large uncertainties given the nonlinear interactions present in the complex earth system e g lotze et al 2019 earth system models are invaluable tools for probing and constraining the physical and biogeochemical responses in the marine system to the changing environment these numerical models simulate the evolution of the earth system components and their interactions e g bonan and doney 2018 séférian et al 2019 lee et al 2022 with the assumption that the processes implemented into the numerical models are correct however even with the increasing computational power available present state of the art earth system models still mostly utilise ocean components at approximately 1 horizontal resolution that do not explicitly permit geostrophic mesoscale eddies e g hewitt et al 2020 2022 geostrophic mesoscale eddies play a crucial role in regulating the ocean circulation responses which not only have local effects but also impact the larger scale regional and global mean state e g lévy et al 2012 although there is an increasing push for ocean models to be mesoscale eddy resolving fox kemper et al 2019 kwiatkowski et al 2020 hewitt et al 2022 or at least eddy rich at around 1 12 horizontal resolutions hallberg 2013 models at such resolutions remain computationally prohibitive and global earth system models with an ocean component at the mesoscale eddy permitting regime at around 1 4 horizontal resolution is a more realistic target hewitt et al 2017 2020 2022 roberts et al 2020 given the physical influence on the biogeochemical response and the anticipated developments of ocean models over the next decade there is a need to probe constrain and understand the sensitivities of the physical and biogeochemical responses in ocean models at the non eddy resolving eddy permitting as well as the eddy rich resolving resolutions for those models that do not explicitly permit mesoscale eddies parameterisations are often employed to mimic the feedback of geostrophic mesoscale eddies often employed are what we would term here as diffusive closures such as isoneutral diffusion e g redi 1982 griffies 1998 and the gent mcwilliams gm scheme gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 isoneutral diffusion leads to tracer diffusion along the isoneutral directions while the gm scheme leads to an eddy induced advection of tracers that flattens isoneutral slopes and both are consistent with the adiabatic nature of mesoscale eddies generated by baroclinic instabilities e g vallis 2006 such diffusive closures were designed for coarse resolution models with no explicitly resolved eddies considered more standard and variants of such schemes exist in most numerical ocean models e g mitgcm marshall et al 1997a b nemo madec 2008 fesom wang et al 2014 mom adcroft et al 2019 on the other hand mesoscale eddies can also lead to sharpening of large scale jets via inverse cascades eddy induced momentum convergence or otherwise e g waterman and jayne 2012 waterman and hoskins 2013 which is increasingly modelled by backscatter based parameterisations e g bachman 2019 jansen et al 2019 recent advances in both classes of parameterisations have led to lower resolution models that are more in line with the eddy rich resolving models at least in the physical response advances in diffusive schemes tend to focus more on coarse resolution models some of which have led to improvements in sensitivities of the circulation to changing forcing scenarios e g farneti et al 2015 mak et al 2018 2022b backscatter schemes have received more attention in eddy permitting models because of their ability to strengthen the represented eddy energy levels and ocean currents e g bachman 2019 jansen et al 2019 the biogeochemical response to such recent updates in physics parameterisations have been on the other hand lacking when it is known that model represented physics can have a substantial impact on the resulting physical and or biogeochemical metrics of interest modifying the represented eddy mean feedbacks can have a significant effect on the ventilation rate and pathways affecting the represented ocean heat content e g de boer et al 2007 zhang and vallis 2013 zanna et al 2019b mak et al 2022b newsom et al 2022 carbon england and rahmstorf 1999 gnanadesikan et al 2015 khwatiwala et al 2018 oxygen matear et al 2000 helm et al 2011 bopp et al 2017 takano et al 2018 and nutrient distributions lévy et al 1999 tschumi et al 2011 bopp et al 2013 couespel et al 2021 with the prevalent use of numerical ocean general circulation models for probing and predicting biophysical interactions e g bopp et al 2013 berthet et al 2019 swearer et al 2019 séférian et al 2019 it is important to investigate how the physics parameterisations i modify the modelled physical states and i i affect the biogeochemical responses such an investigation is required since there is no guarantee that improvements in physical processes necessarily lead to a better biogeochemical response given the nonlinear interactions inherent in a complex system global and or realistic models while useful for making predictions and informing policies e g ipbes 2019 are computationally expensive and possess a large number of degrees of freedom making it difficult to attribute the various causalities while ultimately these realistic and complex earth system models should be used when quantitatively assessing the impacts of eddy parameterisations for delineating the causality and interactions between the physical parameterisations and the resulting physical and biogeochemical responses we consider here a complementary approach by utilising idealised numerical models focusing on the qualitative differences arising from the choice of eddy parameterisations we focus on a systematic assessment of mesoscale eddy parameterisations and their qualitative impact on the nutrient stream or relay and their subsequent impact on net primary production npp e g williams et al 2017 2011 whitt and jansen 2020 gupta et al 2022 we employ a double gyre setting with a simple biogeochemistry model with prescribed atmospheric forcing and an idealised climate change scenario couespel et al 2021 the double gyre setting has the benefit that the model behaviours and limitations are relatively well known e g jackson et al 2006 lévy et al 2010 2012 2014 stewart et al 2021 and the high resolution eddy resolving model truths are more computationally accessible because of the limited spatial extent even with the reduced complexity afforded by the choice of numerical model there are multiple parameterisations for mesoscale turbulence here we focus on diffusive eddy closures specifically on the gm based parameterisations for the eddy induced advection an analogous investigation into the effects of isoneutral diffusion backscatter type eddy parameterisations and extensions into the eddy permitting models will be reported in subsequent publications the models to be investigated here are non eddy resolving differing by the gm type closures they employ and the qualitative performance of these will be judged against a high resolution eddy resolving model truth the gm parameterisation variants and the numerical model set up are described in section 2 in section 3 we report the qualitative differences in both the physical and biogeochemical responses arising from the choice of closures in section 4 we subject the models to an idealised climate change scenario to investigate analogous model sensitivities the article concludes in section 5 critically evaluating the advantages and shortfalls provided by the choices of gm based closures 2 mesoscale eddy parameterisations and numerical set up two canonical types of diffusive closures associated with geostrophic turbulence are those based on isoneutral diffusion e g redi 1982 and the gent mcwilliams scheme gm gent and mcwilliams 1990 the former refers to diffusion of tracers along the isoneutral direction while the latter is an eddy induced advection e g gent et al 1995 treguier et al 1997 griffies 1998 although it resembles a horizontal buoyancy diffusion in the quasi geostrophic limit e g treguier et al 1997 or a layer thickness diffusion e g gent and mcwilliams 1990 the isoneutral diffusion and gm schemes are both known to affect the physical and biogeochemical response isoneutral diffusion modifies the rate of tracer ventilation and the gm schemes affect the structure of the tracer ventilation through its impact on the density stratification relatively speaking there are more studies on assessing gm based schemes e g visbeck et al 1997 eden and greatbatch 2008 cessi 2008 hofman and morales maqueda 2011 munday et al 2013 zhang and vallis 2013 bates et al 2014 farneti et al 2015 mak et al 2018 2022b although there have also been increasing interest in isoneutral diffusion assessing its impact as well as improving on the standard implementation with constant diffusivity e g ferrari and nikurashin 2010 pradal and gnanadesikan 2014 jones and abernathey 2019 2021 groeskamp et al 2021 holmes et al 2022 chouksey et al 2022 while both processes are related to mesoscale turbulence and there are works that suggest relationships between the two e g smith and marshall 2009 abernathey et al 2013 owing to the larger interest in gm based closures in this work we focus primarily on the consequences afforded by different gm based schemes and consider a prescribed constant isoneutral diffusivity κ iso the model sensitivity to κ iso by itself was found to be rather mild in the present model although nonlinear feedback loops can be present suggesting that further investigation is required in this area see appendix for details 2 1 gm based parameterisations the gm scheme introduces an eddy induced velocity u to the tracer equations e g griffies 1998 ferreira et al 2005 1 u κ gm s here s h ρ n 2 denotes the isopycnal slope in the horizontal directions h the horizontal gradient operator n 2 ρ z the vertical buoyancy gradients associated with the resolved state ρ the dynamically relevant density and κ gm will be termed the gm coefficient in this work the gm scheme is widely used because of its inherent properties such as adiabatic advection leading to slumping of isopycnals positive definite generation of eddy energy and layer wise conservation of moments e g gent et al 1995 as well as numerical advantages numerical stability due to the slumping action reduction of unrealistic deep convection e g danabasoglu et al 1994 a choice often utilised in idealised models takes the simple prescription of 2 κ gm κ 0 constant 2 1 1 geometric as it is desirable to maintain the properties afforded by the gm scheme even if one does not believe a simple prescription of κ gm constant will suffice a prevalent research focus has been on improving the functional form of κ gm e g visbeck et al 1997 treguier et al 1997 ferreira et al 2005 cessi 2008 eden and greatbatch 2008 hofman and morales maqueda 2011 marshall et al 2012 jansen et al 2015 2019 we consider here on a form of the gm scheme arising from the geometric framework for analysing eddy mean flow interactions see marshall et al 2012 maddison and marshall 2013 in the present form analysis within the geometric framework suggests scaling κ gm as mak et al 2018 2022b 3 κ gm α e d z m 2 n d z where m 2 h ρ denotes the horizontal buoyancy gradients associated with the resolved state α is a non dimensional tuning parameter bounded in magnitude by one e is the total potential and kinetic eddy energy and the resulting κ gm varies in time and in the horizontal but is depth independent with the present specification unlike most other existing proposals for the κ gm that utilise mixing length type arguments with dependence on the eddy kinetic energy the gm version of geometric arises from a mathematically rigorous bound that results from analysing the eliassen palm flux tensor that encodes the eddy mean feedbacks marshall et al 2012 maddison and marshall 2013 the bound results in a linear dependence on the total eddy energy e compared to mixing length based parameterisations with a square root scaling e g eden and greatbatch 2008 jansen et al 2015 2019 which leads to a more significant state dependent response notably out of the gm based parameterisations the gm version of geometric has more evidence in support of its use from a diagnostic point of view bachman et al 2017 wang and stewart 2020 wei et al 2022 and prognostic calculations in idealised models mak et al 2017 2018 as well as in realistic models mak et al 2022b in particular the gm version of geometric in the aforementioned prognostic calculations have been shown to lead to improved sensitivities of the modelled ocean circulation to changes in forcing over the standard prescription of κ gm notably in the antarctic circumpolar current transport and the global meridional overturning circulation strength in a prognostic calculation with a coarse resolution model e is provided using a depth integrated eddy energy budget denoting x y to be the zonal and meridional directions respectively following mak et al 2022b the eddy energy budget used with geometric is given by 4 d d t e d z h u z c e x e d z advection κ gm m 4 n 2 d z source λ e e 0 d z dissipation η e h 2 e d z diffusion where the depth integrated eddy energy is advected by the depth average flow u z with westward propagation at the long rossby wave phase speed c e g chelton et al 2011 klocker and marshall 2014 the growth of eddy energy comes from the slumping of mean density surfaces and diffused in the horizontal grooms 2015 ni et al 2020a b with η e denoting the associated eddy energy diffusivity a linear dissipation of eddy energy at rate λ but maintaining a minimum eddy energy level e 0 is utilised so λ 1 is an eddy energy dissipation time scale which is a bulk parameterisation of energy fluxes out of the mesoscales resulting from numerous dynamical processes e g mak et al 2022a in this work we focus on a comparison between calculations employing the gm version of the geometric parameterisation denoted geom and the calculations employing a prescribed constant κ gm denoted const we have also performed calculations with simpler proposals of κ gm that are state dependent treguier et al 1997 cf visbeck et al 1997 and will comment on the results from those calculations where appropriate although we have not performed calculations employing other existing energetically constrained proposals e g κ gm k of jansen et al 2019 where k is the eddy kinetic energy we speculate in the discussion section the expected responses given the results from the present work 2 2 model set up our main focus here is to systematically assess the qualitative differences arising from different eddy parameterisation variants and for this purpose an idealised numerical ocean model is employed a double gyre model based on the set up of couespel et al 2021 using the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo madec 2008 was used the gyre model here is a straightened version of the standard gyre configuration test case in nemo the model is already coupled to an idealised biogeochemistry model within nemo cf lévy et al 2010 2012 and has been used to study both physical and biogeochemical responses in couespel et al 2021 to recap the domain is square with sides of length 3180 km and depth 4 km formulated on a β plane with the southern boundary at 20 n extending to the northern boundary at 50 n the domain has no bathymetry and is bounded by vertical walls that are aligned with longitudes and latitudes on all sides while the presence of bathymetry is known to have impacts on the large scale circulation e g jackson et al 2006 gula et al 2015 stewart et al 2021 there is the added subtlety on how one should parameterise eddy feedbacks over slope regions e g wang and stewart 2020 wei et al 2022 for simplicity and to reduce the degrees of freedom in the problem we opted for the flat bottom case we employ a non linear bottom drag and impose free slip conditions on the lateral boundaries the model utilises a linear equation of state with temperature and salinity and vertical mixing is via a turbulent kinetic energy scheme gaspar et al 1990 atmospheric forcing is through the flux formulation and the forcings wind stress penetrative solar radiation pseudo atmospheric temperature θ for computing sea surface temperature restoring freshwater flux are all zonally symmetric with a prescribed repeating seasonal cycle with no period beyond a year and there is no net salinity flux see lévy et al 2010 fig 1 the model employs an idealised biogeochemistry model lobster see e g lévy et al 2012 with standard reference settings and with eddy induced advective and diffusive contributions from the gm based and redi schemes respectively the lobster model uses nitrogen as the currency and the six biogeochemical variables are concentrations of detritus zooplankton phytoplankton nitrate ammonium and dissolved organic matter variables of particular interest to the work here are phytoplankton and nitrate for their links to net primary production npp as lobster does not represent physiological changes with changes in temperature changes observed are solely due to changes in the transport of the biogeochemical tracers providing a better focus on the large scale links between physics and biogeochemistry the differences between the model employed in this work to that of couespel et al 2021 are the following version of nemo nemo v4 0 5 r14538 instead of v3 4 r4826 a slightly different initialisation of nitrate concentration at the start of the perturbation experiments no averaging of the deep ocean nitrate concentration the model truth is taken here to have a horizontal resolution of 1 12 instead of 1 9 the updated version of nemo already has the gm version of geometric implemented from the work of mak et al 2022b and it was easier to adapt the model configuration to the newer nemo than to write the geometric parameterisation into an older version of nemo sample calculations show that the different initialisation of the nitrate concentration at the deeper ocean have no impact on the conclusions in this article the horizontal resolution of the model truth was increased to 1 12 partly as a balance to resolve mesoscale processes but without resolving too much of the submesoscale processes so that there is a more suitable comparison between the model truth and the coarse resolution models employing the gm based schemes since the gm based schemes are not designed to capture submesoscale processes the model truth horizontal resolution of 1 12 was also chosen for the suggestive analogy with the global nemo orca0083 also known as orca12 configuration that is at a nominal horizontal resolution of 1 12 and provides a benchmark reference for our future investigations into eddy permitting models all the major conclusions of couespel et al 2021 are found to hold even with the present changes a summary of key model parameters is given in table 1 partly informed by previous works couespel et al 2021 mak et al 2022b a a brief description of model sensitivities to some of these choices are given in appendix 2 3 experimental set up following the strategy of couespel et al 2021 the physical and biogeochemical model at the 1 resolution starts from model year 2300 spun up over 2000 model years to model year 300 using the const variant with constant κ gm at model year 300 perturbation experiments were carried out for another 300 years to model year 0 which is longer than the 100 years considered in couespel et al 2021 for the 1 models the perturbation experiments are with const and geom for the 1 12 model r12 the fields are simply interpolated from the 1 model onto the analogous 1 12 grid two sets of experiments are performed in this work a control pre industrial setting tagged with a suffix ctl integrates the aforementioned calculations for another 70 years from model year 0 subject to the same idealised atmospheric forcing an idealised climate change scenario tagged with a suffix cc has the models exposed to the aforementioned idealised seasonal cycle from model year 0 but the atmospheric temperature is given an increasing linear trend of 0 04 c yr 1 over 70 model years following couespel et al 2021 to mimic the ssp5 8 5 scenario e g tokarska et al 2020 fig 1 shows some of the summary statistics of the spinup and the adjustment under the control and idealised climate change scenario indicating that a quasi equilibrium has been reached at least in the upper parts of the ocean depths less than 700 m in the perturbation calculations during the spinup stage under the idealised climate change scenario the ocean temperature increases leading to a stronger stratification primarily in the upper ocean not shown that inhibits nutrient supply and a decrease in npp across the set of calculations consistent with the results of couespel et al 2021 see their fig 1 d and a1 in each of the two sets of experiments we evaluate the performance of the eddy parameterisations by examining both the physical and biogeochemical responses critically comparing the similarities and differences between geom const and the r12 model truth under the ctl and cc scenario a working hypothesis is that the physical and biogeochemical responses are improved in the geom calculations when compared to the const calculations for evaluating the performance we consider diagnostics calculated from data time averaged over the analysis period taken to be the last five years of the calculations between the start of model year 66 and the end of model year 70 time averaged quantities are denoted by an overbar 5 1 t 1 t 0 t 0 t 1 d t with t 0 1 being start and end of model years 66 and 70 respectively following the work of couespel et al 2021 our focus is on the responses particularly within the subpolar gyre region which is the area that is most bioactive in the present setup we employ the same pre defined box utilised in couespel et al 2021 for our analysis defined as the area bounded between y 35 n 45 n and z 700 m with the boundaries marked on by the black dashed lines in the subsequent figures where appropriate the eventual supporting evidence suggests the hypothesis is largely true see table 2 in section 5 but there are important subtle details to be elaborated on models can display multiple equilibria and or be affected by internal modes of variability e g sérazin et al 2017 zanna et al 2019a where diagnostics would vary depending on the period of analysis in the present model we considered ensemble experiments perturbing the initial conditions and we found no significant internal variability beyond inter annual periods this could be because of the idealised model as well as the choice of forcing which has a repeating seasonal cycle and no mode of variability longer than a year while there is seasonable variability particularly in the eddy resolving calculations cf lévy et al 2014 we are interested in broad scale and long time changes and the inter annual variability is averaged out with a multi year average from our diagnostics as such the conclusions drawn from our diagnostics here should thus be regarded as statistically significant however we should stress again that we focus on the qualitative rather than the quantitative differences the primary interest is to see if one parameterisation scheme performs better and less on how much better the latter is more sensitive to context and should be quantified using more realistic models 3 comparison of pre

calculation the const one has been omitted since visually it is indistinguishable from the geom one both models display the familiar northern hemisphere double gyre pattern with a subtropical gyre to the south and a subpolar gyre to the north in the r12 calculation because of eddy rectification effects the modelled western boundary current is more variable and stronger through eddies converging momentum into the jet extension e g lévy et al 2010 waterman et al 2011 waterman and lilly 2015 the western boundary current is also slightly south of the latitudinal centre line even though the zonal wind stress is symmetric about the same centre line cf lévy et al 2010 in addition relatively strong re circulation regions exist near the northern and southern boundaries as fofonoff gyres e g berloff 2005 marshall and adcroft 2010 all such features are absent in the coarse resolution non eddying models relying on the standard diffusive mesoscale parameterisations in fig 2 c we show the resulting κ gm x y from geom note that κ gm is large on the order of a few thousand m 2 s 1 on the western boundary current in the subtropical gyre the much smaller values of κ gm within the subpolar gyre and particularly its values near the northern boundary will be discussed later the resulting domain averaged value of κ gm is about 300 m 2 s 1 and we note the gyre models studied here using such a small value of κ gm everywhere leads to un physical deep convection particularly along the western boundary current not shown cf danabasoglu et al 1994 one benefit then with parameterisation schemes that allow spatial variations of κ gm is that κ gm can be large only where it needs to be large and this point will be revisited throughout the article the concentrated signal of κ gm on the western boundary observed in fig 2 c is also consistent with the fact that the represented western boundary current in a coarse resolution model is rather weak which suggests that the resulting meridional overturning circulation in the system is also rather weak in fig 3 we show metrics relating to the overturning circulation namely the diagnosed meridional overturning circulation streamfunction 7 ψ moc y z h z 0 l x v x y z d x d z some sample isopycnals using potential density referenced to sea level as well as the diagnosed depth integrated and zonal mean northward heat transport v θ x between different calculations as shown in fig 3 the coarse resolution models const and geom in general have a weaker overturning strength partially because of a weaker modelled western boundary current arising from the more diffuse nature of the model the particularly weak overturning in the subtropical region of the coarse resolution models compared to the r12 model truth is consistent with a weak western boundary current related to the structure of the displayed isopycnals via thermal wind shear relation the weaker overturning is reflected in the reduced northward transport of heat the use of geometric provides mild improvements to the represented overturning strength particularly in the subpolar gyre where the diagnosed ψ moc in geom is stronger than that in const and closer to r12 area weighted average root mean square mismatch to r12 of 1 99 sv in geom compared to 2 29 sv in const within the subpolar gyre box the stronger moc coincides with a larger heat transport area weighted average heat transport of 0 094 pw in geom compared to 0 078 pw in const calculated from north of 35 n this increased overturning strength is expected to have a positive effect on the modelled biogeochemical response in the geom calculation as we can expect increased nutrient transport into the subpolar gyre by the nutrient stream or relay e g williams et al 2017 2011 whitt and jansen 2020 gupta et al 2022 the double gyre model here is configured such that the downwelling is most prominent in the northern part of the domain since this region is exposed to the coolest atmospheric temperatures as seen in the maximum mixed layer depths shown in fig 4 a c diagnosed as the first depth below which σ θ z σ θ z 10 m 0 01 where σ θ is the potential density referenced to sea level the biggest differences between the calculations are at the northern part of the domain particularly in the northwestern corner of the domain fig 4 d f shows the histogram of the diagnosed mixed layer north of the subpolar region where we see const has a notable skew towards shallower mixed layer depths relative to geom and r12 in terms of median and distribution the more shallow mixed layer depths observed in the const calculation are consistent with the decrease in the overturning strength since the mixed layer is correlated to the depths of deep water extent and overturning circulation one rationalisation is that the gm scheme flattens isopycnals and works against the steepening of isopycnals associated with deep water formation and subsequent convective events the const calculation employs a higher κ gm value in the northern boundary region compared with the resulting κ gm in the geom calculation see fig 2 c leading to a shallow bias compared to geom the causality highlights the importance of the magnitude and distribution of κ gm in the modelled physical mean state of coarse resolution models where the mean transport pathways and strengths are being influenced by the explicit or parameterised small scale feedbacks 3 2 biogeochemical responses since the const calculation is expected to have a weaker circulation fig 3 and shallower mixed layer depths fig 4 relative to the geom case we can expect that geom offers some improvements over const in the biogeochemical response via changes in the nutrient transport fig 5 shows the horizontal distribution of vertically integrated npp for the integrated npp averaged over the subpolar gyre region units of mmol n m 2 day 1 where n is the nitrogen currency r12 has the largest npp at 3 67 compared to const at 2 76 and geom at 2 91 respectively a decrease of 24 8 and 20 6 relative to r12 the geom calculation results in npp values closer to the model truth r12 compared to the const calculation which is consistent with our expectations although the improvements are somewhat modest as noted in section 2 the biogeochemistry model takes no explicit account of temperature variations on the biogeochemical activities themselves so the changes observed are a result of the changes in the nutrient distributions while npp has contributions from nitrate and ammonium we focus our attention on nitrate as it is the dominant form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen except in oxygen poor regions in the marine system e g oxygen minimum zones or coastal hypoxia zones the f ratio the ratio between primary production arising from nitrate and total primary production e g sarmiento and gruber 2006 4 is relatively constant over the set of calculations at around 0 43 cf couespel et al 2021 we show in fig 6 the zonally averaged vertical distribution of nitrate and we see a suppression and elevation of nitrate concentration in the subtropical and subpolar gyres respectively across all models consistent with the ekman downwelling and upwelling from the choice of zonal wind forcing e g 4 of williams and follows 2011 in both the const and geom calculations there is a strong decrease in nitrate concentration in the subtropical gyre compared with r12 possibly in line with the damped western boundary current associated with the large κ gm values in the region there is also an overall decrease over the whole subpolar gyre in the coarse resolution calculations fig 6 d however there is an increase in nitrate concentration in the northern parts of the subpolar gyre for geom compared to const examined via the differences not shown which collectively leads to a mildly elevated npp in the same subpolar gyre region in geom compared to const to analyse the transport properties of nitrate we note that the advective contribution arises as u n where n denotes the nitrate concentration focusing on the subpolar gyre box area enclosed by the black dashed lines in figs 5 and 6 noting that the box boundaries at longitudinal lines coincide with the model domain boundaries by the divergence theorem and invoking no normal flow boundary conditions we have 8 box u n d x d y d z south north v n d x d z bottom w n d x d y we can further consider the reynolds decomposition 9 n n n n 0 where the overbar is still the time average which leads to 10 u n u n u n respectively the total the mean and the eddy advective flux of nitrate and u is from the explicit velocity fluctuations in the case of explicit eddies supplemented by parameterised eddy induced velocity u when a gm based parameterisation is active we compute the vertical distribution of the vertical nitrate supply i e 11 y l s y l n 0 l x w n w n d x d y where no vertical integration is implied as well as the vertical cumulative integral of the horizontal nitrate supply at the southern and northern boundaries i e 12 0 z 0 l x v n v n d x d z fig 7 shows the total advective supply of nitrate into the subpolar gyre box in the vertical at the southern boundary and northern boundary the dominant contribution to the total supply is in the mean component although the eddy component is somewhat significant in the const case not shown here but see e g couespel et al 2021 fig a5 the vertical nitrate supply rate is dominant over the top 150 m or so in all calculations magnitude of positive values fig 7 a the vertical mixing contribution dominates over the advective contribution over the top 50 m but is otherwise similar for the set of calculations not shown here cf couespel et al 2021 fig 4 however the meridional nitrate supply becomes important with depth the model truth r12 has the largest vertical gain fig 7 a throughout the depths considered and the supply from the south and loss from the north fig 7 b c are both large consistent with r12 having the strongest overturning circulation out of the set of calculations considered here cf fig 3 for the coarse resolution calculations while the const case leads to a meridional gain of nitrate at depths below 200 m via consideration of the residual of the gain from the south and loss from the north the geom case has a larger vertical supply throughout the depths considered which is more consistent with the r12 calculation and leads to a larger overall total nitrate supply resulting in the larger diagnosed npp values found in geom relative to const one important point to emphasise here is that while the local eddy contributions are small it is the eddy feedback onto the mean state and the changes to the mean state that lead to the overall observed response cf couespel et al 2021 sample experiments not shown show that the npp increases with decreasing κ gm so one might naïvely argue that we should take κ gm even smaller or even switch it off to improve the eddy component of nitrate supply and increase the npp however this is at the expense of introducing un physical deep convection particularly along the western boundary current and the mean and eddy components are not isolated components that one can tune separately the spatially varying nature of κ gm afforded by geom allows the gm scheme to adjust according to the physically modelled state and suppressing its effects in the subpolar gyre where it is potentially detrimental to the biogeochemical response a calculation with a simpler prescription of κ gm based on treguier et al 1997 as implemented into nemo which requires a specification of a maximum κ gm and varies in space according to the baroclinic growth rate was performed here and gives similar conclusions in the control calculation to geom not shown the resulting κ gm is not unlike that shown in fig 2 c but with a much more gradual spatial variation limited by the choice of the maximum κ gm taken here to be 1000 m 2 s 1 the resulting diagnostics are largely similar and certainly improve upon the const case for reasons detailed already in that regard it is the spatially varying nature of κ gm afforded by the more updated schemes that results in a modelled state that is closer to the model truth in the selected diagnostics however it is known that schemes based on a prescribed maximum κ gm limit how the models can react to climate change scenarios e g fox kemper et al 2019 the geom scheme and other energetically constrained parameterisations have no such limitations and we expect such schemes to behave in a favourable way under the climate change scenarios 4 sensitivities under idealised climate change 4 1 physical responses fig 8 shows the κ gm distribution from geom under the climate change scenario and the raw differences compared to the control scenario the notable feature here is the increase in κ gm towards the northern boundary in fig 8 b where the model deep water is formed given the discussion in the previous section we would expect the geom calculation in this case to have an over weakened overturning circulation leading to a decrease in the nitrate supply and the npp details turn out to matter as will be seen shortly fig 9 a b c shows the raw differences between the overturning streamfunction under climate change and the control case cf fig 3 a b c while both r12 and geom show a significant decrease in the very northern part of the domain this feature seems to be absent in the const case this lack of decrease in the overturning strength in const and even a mild increase shown at the bottom right half of fig 9 b might have contributed to the observed sensitivity in the diagnosed northward heat transport not shown the r12 and geom calculations both show only small increases in the heat transport relative to the respective control scenario north of 35 n 2 0 and 5 7 increase in the area weighted average respectively but the const calculation shows a rather significant increase in the heat transport in the same region 23 5 increase in the area weighted average the response seen in r12 and geom are likely because of the increase in temperature offsetting the decrease in the advective velocity on the other hand the magnitude of the response in const is quite significant and unlikely to result solely from increases in water temperature suggesting that the overturning response under climate change scenario in const is inconsistent with the actual dynamics in the model truth with explicit eddies fig 10 shows the changes in the diagnosed maximum mixed layer and all panels show that the mixed layer depth has generally shoaled across all calculations under the climate change scenario particularly in the region near the northern boundary this is consistent with the warming of the atmosphere and the associated decrease in the ocean buoyancy loss the shoaling is reflected in the shift of the median values as well as a decrease in the quartile ranges however note that the coarse resolution models appear to have a noticeably shallower mixed layer as seen in the histograms and the median values in fig 10 e f compared to the r12 calculations with explicit eddies in fig 10 d from the preceding discussion we might expect that the decrease of the maximum mixed layer depth is more significant in geom given the increase in κ gm in the region cf fig 8 b leading to a stronger flattening of isopycnals that acts against the formation of deep mixed layers impacting the overturning circulation we can quantify the magnitude of the overall shoaling by numerically computing the 1 wasserstein distance w 1 μ ν sometimes known as the earth mover s distance e g villani 2008 which measures the distance between two discrete probability distributions μ and ν i e a measure of the difference between two histograms doing so leads to w 1 geom ctl geom cc 216 while w 1 const ctl const cc 170 in the present mixed layer depth diagnostic thus supporting the conclusion that the geom calculation changes more within the climate change scenario for completeness w 1 r12 ctl r12 cc 217 so in this metric geom has a sensitivity that is more in line with r12 than const 4 2 biogeochemical responses fig 11 shows the horizontal distribution of the raw differences in the vertically integrated npp between the climate change and control scenarios there is a decrease in npp across all models under climate change particularly in the subpolar gyre although there are isolated spots in the r12 calculation where npp has marginally increased south of the western boundary current separation and at the northern boundary where downwelling occurs the decrease in npp in the coarse resolution models are concentrated particularly in the east of the subpolar gyre region and a small patch towards the western boundary in the geom calculation the integrated npp value averaged over the subpolar gyre box declines under climate change for all calculations with r12 at 3 16 13 8 const at 2 13 22 9 and geom at 2 22 23 6 where the raw numbers are in units of mmol n m 2 day 1 n being the nitrogen currency and the percentage difference is relative to the respective calculations in the control scenario the r12 model simulates the largest npp overall with the smallest decline under the climate change scenario the coarse resolution models significantly under predict the raw value of the npp and also predict a more dramatic decline in line with the previous results of couespel et al 2021 while it is true that the geom calculation still predicts a higher npp than the const calculation in both the control and climate change scenario the geom calculation displays more sensitivity to the change in forcing under the climate change scenario with a marginally larger npp decline compared to const although the relative decrease in npp in const is smaller in magnitude than geom we should also bear in mind that there is evidence indicating that const possesses a sensitivity in the physical response that is inconsistent with the eddy resolving calculation r12 e g fig 9 i e the const calculation might be better in the integrated npp diagnostic but not necessarily for the right reasons the observed decline in npp can again be attributed to the changes in the nutrient supply we focus our attention again on nitrate there is a decrease in the f ratio to around 0 40 from around 0 43 in the control scenario uniformly across the set of calculations fig 12 shows the differences in vertical distribution of zonally averaged nitrate between the climate change and control scenario see also fig 6 there is a decline of nitrate in the upper portions of the subpolar gyre across all models with a mild increase at depths indicating a decline in upwelling which is consistent with the strengthened stratification as indicated for example by the buoyancy frequency n 2 ρ z not shown cf fig a10 of couespel et al 2021 fig 12 d shows the vertical distribution of the nitrate concentration averaged over the subpolar gyre box and it is noteworthy that the geom calculation has a vertical distribution change that is closer to the model truth r12 than the const case the differences in the total advective fluxes of nitrate into the subpolar gyre box relative to the diagnosed supplies in fig 7 are shown in fig 13 the dominant contribution to the total change was again found to be in the mean although the eddy component is somewhat sizeable for the const case note that negative values in fig 13 largely mean a decrease in the supply into the subpolar gyre while positive values mostly mean a decrease in the loss out of the subpolar gyre the changes in the diffusive contributions are largely similar across the set of calculations and have been omitted the r12 case has a decreased vertical nutrient supply fig 13 a southern boundary gain fig 13 b and northern boundary loss fig 13 c under idealised climate change broadly consistent with a decrease in the overturning strength cf fig 9 for the coarse resolution calculations we note that while const suffers a large decrease in the vertical supply over the top 300 m fig 13 a it seems to be compensated by an equally large decrease in the northern boundary loss over the same depths fig 13 c this is particularly interesting given neither of these sensitivities are nearly as dramatic in the r12 calculation and suggests that this is a case where two wrongs happen to cancel out resulting in a reasonable integrated response in the npp on the other hand the geom calculation over most panels capture the shape of the r12 responses somewhat and arguably substantially improve on the sensitivities displayed by the const calculation except at the northern boundary below 200 m and there is a notable decrease in the vertical supply in the upper 50 m of the ocean while the geom calculation seems to respond in a way that is more consistent with the model truth it seems to i not have the benefit of two wrongs cancelling out as in the const case and i i do things wrong perhaps where it matters the most in the vertical nutrient supply upper part of the ocean where light availability and npp are the largest 5 conclusions and discussions numerical ocean models at non eddy resolving to partially eddy permitting resolutions requiring sub grid physics parameterisation of the mesoscale processes are going to remain the norm for the foreseeable future assessment of related parameterisations to highlight the possible benefits and deficiencies are required to constrain our uncertainties in the relevant conclusions and projections to be drawn from such models to that end this work presents an investigation of the joint physical and biogeochemical sensitivity to the choice of mesoscale eddy parameterisation in light of the recent developments in eddy parameterisation and its improvements into the modelled physical processes the focus here is the more conventional diffusive closures utilised in coarse resolution non eddy permitting ocean models principally on the eddy induced advection represented by the gm scheme e g gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 and the gm version of the geometric scheme marshall et al 2012 mak et al 2018 2022b the latter takes a κ gm that scales linearly with eddy energy eq 3 and constrained by a parameterised eddy energy budget eq 4 the present work highlights a need to evaluate the performance and tuning of eddy parameterisations on both the physical and biogeochemical response and documents the performance of diffusive closures in coarse resolution models and the eddy resolving model truth as a precursor to an assessment into the eddy permitting models as well as backscatter type parameterisations to comprehensively assess the impacts afforded by the choice of mesoscale eddy parameterisation this investigation employs a simplified and well understood physical model a double gyre configuration with a prescribed seasonal pattern leading to deep water formation near the northern boundary further a simplified biogeochemistry model was chosen to focus on the chain of causality relating sensitivities afforded by the eddy parameterisation its impact on the modelled state its consequences for nutrient supply e g williams et al 2017 2011 whitt and jansen 2020 gupta et al 2022 and in turn net primary production npp the choice of an idealised model with limited spatial extent allows for an eddy resolving model truth for coarse resolution models to compare against the general model behaviours are entirely consistent with those reported in couespel et al 2021 where npp decreases under the climate change scenario this was attributed to the strengthening of upper ocean stratification leading to a weakened overturning circulation and thus weakening of nutrient supply into the subpolar gyre region where the npp is strongest the coarse resolution models display a more significant decrease in the npp attributed to a weaker overturning circulation in the coarse resolution models the previous work was performed with the standard prescription of the gm scheme with a constant gm coefficient and this work extends it in the first instance by considering a more updated gm based eddy parameterisation as well as critically assessing the model sensitivities as a result of the parameterisations and in anticipation of assessing model performance in eddy permitting models a summary of the key diagnostics in this work and a comparison of the more updated gm based eddy parameterisation with the constant case is given in table 2 we have not found evidence for significant internal variability beyond the annual forcing period which may be because of the choice of model and forcing set up which only has a repeating seasonal cycle while the reported diagnostics and conclusions should be considered statistically significant we emphasise again that the main focus here is on the qualitative relative differences e g differences in modelled state and or sensitivities and less on the quantitative absolute values e g magnitude of differences in modelled state and or sensitivities the latter will be somewhat context dependent so should be performed with a more realistic model for constraining climate projections the first main finding here is that the gm version of the geometric scheme marshall et al 2012 which was found previously to lead to improved sensitivities in the modelled ocean mean state particularly when the domain includes a representation of the southern ocean mak et al 2018 2022b leads to an improvement over the case where the gm coefficient κ gm is set to be uniform over space largely because the resulting κ gm varies in space and is somewhat state aware the benefits afforded by a spatially varying κ gm with reasonable properties are not entirely surprising and are somewhat known in the physical oceanography modelling community though perhaps not so widely reported in this particular model the overall model response seems to be particularly sensitive to the value of κ gm in the region with deep water formation which is consistent with theoretical considerations through the impact on the overturning circulation e g williams and follows 2011 extra calculations reported in appendix with prescribed spatially varying κ gm further support the reported model responses the observed model effect is rationalised here as the eddy induced advection acting against deep water formation and associated convective events and a smaller κ gm is conducive to deeper mixed layers and a stronger overturning circulation the resulting state from using geometric with κ gm e where e is the total eddy energy under the control scenario has a marginally stronger overturning circulation fig 3 and more consistent statistics in the mixed layer depths fig 4 this leads to a higher nutrient supply rate and npp table 2 with modelled nutrient transport properties fig 7 that are more consistent with the model truth over the const case it was verified in the extra calculations with the treguier et al 1997 prescription of κ gm choosing maximum κ gm value to be 1000 m 2 s 1 leads to qualitatively similar results as geom in the control calculation not shown we would expect similar eddy parameterisation schemes employing mixing length arguments with κ gm k where k is the eddy kinetic energy such as parts of meke jansen et al 2019 to lead to qualitative similar results as geom here although this has not been verified the second finding one that is more subtle is that a better physical response does not guarantee a better biogeochemical response and a better biogeochemical response could arise from physically inconsistent physical responses so there is a need to evaluate eddy parameterisations based on responses in both the gm version of the geometric scheme does worse in the integrated npp metric to idealised climate change compared to the standard implementation even though the model using the geometric scheme actually seems to mostly improve on the bulk sensitivities as displayed by the model truth e g nitrate concentration in fig 12 nutrient supply profiles in fig 13 and certainly more convincing and consistent than the const case which was found to have a significant increase in the heat transport and different advective nutrient supply profiles the observation here seems to stem from i the standard prescription of gm while producing inconsistent sensitivities happens to lead to cancellations e g strong decrease in supply of nitrate at southern boundary fig 13 b offset by an even stronger decrease in loss of nitrate at northern boundary fig 13 c and i i the geometric scheme happens to lead to a change in regions that are particularly important to the model response increase in the κ gm towards the northern boundary fig 8 b and decrease in the vertical nitrate supply near the top of the ocean fig 13 a extra calculations with the treguier et al 1997 prescription of κ gm with no re tuning lead to diagnostics that are qualitatively close to the geom calculations but at a lesser magnitude so that the integrated results are somewhat better than geom not shown the better performance in npp diagnostics however is likely because the resulting κ gm is still artificially capped at the same value so that the influence of κ gm over the northern boundary region is muted compared with geom we would expect similar eddy parameterisation schemes employing mixing length arguments with κ gm k would do slightly better in the integrated npp diagnostics than geom because of the more muted increase in κ gm over the northern boundary region although this has not been verified here one key point we make here is that care needs to be taken in the choice of metric to judge on the performance and a combination of metrics might be required to highlight the intricacies of the model behaviour that are potentially masked behind a single metric particularly when an average or integrated quantity is used a case in hand here is that while the standard prescription of the gm scheme seems to lead to a better response in integrated npp it is masking the fact that the contributing sensitivities are largely inconsistent with the model truth i e two wrongs can result in something that appears to look right ultimately the requirement should be that the biogeochemistry response is better because the underlying ocean physics is better and this work highlights a cautionary example where ocean models investigating biogeochemical responses should evaluate the modelled physical responses where possible the present use of an idealised model in addition to providing a clean investigation into the strengths and deficiencies in the parameterisation schemes also highlights lessons that we can learn from when extending our investigation to more complex but realistic models if a gm based parameterisation scheme is to be used in more realistic models some form of tapering of κ gm might be required as the regions of deep water formation are approached cf hallberg 2013 since this can have knock on effects for the overturning circulation and affect biogeochemical responses in a non local fashion more complex biogeochemistry models are required to assess and highlight the impact of eddy parameterisations on the modelled biogeochemistry for example carbon and oxygen budgets e g friedlingstein et al 2014 berthet et al 2019 séférian et al 2019 kwiatkowski et al 2020 our focus here is more process oriented and to set out a framework for evaluating the qualitative model responses and sensitivities to parameterisation but the use of more complex and realistic models are required for quantifying uncertainties in projections and will be a future focus another choice made here is to focus on the eddy induced advection as represented by the gm scheme sidelining the isoneutral diffusion as represented by the redi scheme e g redi 1982 griffies 1998 it is somewhat considered in the modelling community that the gm coefficient impacts the ventilation pathways via changes to the stratification profile and in turn the rate of ventilation while the isoneutral diffusion affects mostly the rate of ventilation e g england and rahmstorf 1999 matear 2001 gnanadesikan et al 2015 jones and abernathey 2019 without significantly affecting the modelled state but see chouksey et al 2022 theoretical developments as well as numerical assessment of the gm based schemes are somewhat more active and mature e g eden and greatbatch 2008 hofman and morales maqueda 2011 mak et al 2018 jansen et al 2019 bachman 2019 compared to that of isoneutral diffusion e g smith and marshall 2009 ferrari and nikurashin 2010 abernathey et al 2013 groeskamp et al 2021 with that in mind prior to our investigation we have mostly focused on the gm based schemes but we considered simulations varying the spatially constant isoneutral diffusion coefficient κ iso our sample simulations varying the spatially constant κ iso by itself seems to have very minor to negligible impacts for this model but there are feedback loops present if κ gm is state aware see appendix a systematic and comprehensive assessment of the isoneutral diffusion parameterisation schemes is a major undertaking and we opted to postpone the related investigation while we would like to make use of mesoscale resolving models generally these are still computationally prohibitive and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future as a compromise there is an increasing focus on eddy permitting models to broadly refer to ocean models around 1 2 to 1 9 horizontal resolution where mesoscale eddies have an explicit but incomplete representation e g the explicit eddy field is substantially less energetic from measures such as the explicit eddy kinetic energy as noted at the beginning of this work existing geostrophic mesoscale eddy parameterisations largely split into diffusive closures which was the subject of this present work and backscatter approaches e g bachman 2019 jansen et al 2019 the former is more targeted towards coarse resolution model without an explicit representation of eddies e g models with around 1 horizontal resolution such as the nemo orca1 model the latter in principle should work across models at different resolutions but the working consensus at the time of writing seems to be that backscatter approaches work better in eddy permitting models energising the eddies that are explicitly represented by the model itself given the increase in available computational power for performing global ocean models and earth system models at eddy permitting resolutions normally around 1 4 horizontal resolution and the benefits that result once ocean models start to become eddy permitting e g hewitt et al 2017 2020 an assessment into backscatter parameterisations analogous to the one carried out here is a priority and is currently the subject of

scientific and presentation of the present article appendix model dependence on other parameters here we provide some further evidence for our assertion that the model mostly depends on κ gm particularly its values around the northern boundary where deep water formation occurs and a brief description of model dependence on other key uncertain parameters within the system namely the geometric parameters α and λ see eqs 3 and 4 and the isoneutral diffusion parameter κ iso the dynamical argument here is that the presence of κ gm leads to the flattening of isopycnals at the base of the mixed layer which inhibits the deepening of mixed layers such an effect leads to a shallow bias of the mixed layer depths a weakening of the overturning circulation a reduction in nitrate supply and a reduction in npp the argument is in line with the previous results in the appendix of couespel et al 2021 as well as our const experiments where it is generally observed that the smaller the κ gm the higher the npp for precisely the aforementioned dynamical reasons with signatures in the mixed layer depths and other physical metrics not shown the highest npp occurs for the case when the gm scheme is completely switched off but of course at the expense of introducing un physical deep convection around the domain as mentioned in the text it follows that varying the geom parameters α and λ affect the resulting model results in ways that are consistent with varying κ gm varying the energy diffusion coefficient η e leads to fairly weak responses in κ gm e via modifying the sharpness of the modelled total eddy energy signature e increasing α and decreasing λ or increasing the dissipation time scale λ 1 both lead to increased κ gm consistent with mak et al 2017 see marshall et al 2017 for physical rationalisation leading to decreases in npp again for the aforementioned reasons while the resulting modelled states under the control scenario differ depending on the choice of geom parameters the resulting sensitivities under climate change for fixed choices of α and λ are largely similar in magnitude with a similar decrease in npp again because of the resulting increase in the κ gm value over the northern boundary region although there are no strong constraints on the choice of α and λ but see attempts in poulsen et al 2019 and mak et al 2022a it is at least reassuring that the conclusions regarding the sensitivity under climate change scenarios are robust the sensitivity of the modelled state to the κ gm value at the northern boundary was further supported by results from experiments where κ gm was artificially enhanced suppressed under the climate change scenario via manually modifying the const or geom κ gm profiles in various regions not shown all results are consistent with the fact that increased κ gm at the northern boundary lead to decreased npp for the physical chain of causality detailed above further the results support the notion that geom produces better results in the control scenario because of the spatially varying κ gm but is perhaps over responding under the climate change scenario as suggested in text regarding sensitivity to the isoneutral diffusion for lack of strong evidence to suggest which prescription functions the best we opted to study the simple case of varying the constant diffusion coefficient κ iso table a 3 documents the diagnosed npp in the various scenarios for both the const which are results implicitly reported in the appendix of couespel et al 2021 and geom calculations the general conclusions here are that increasing κ iso leads to increased npp which is consistent with the increased transport of nutrients at least in the lateral direction in the present gyre setting certainly in the control scenario and is suggestive in the climate change scenario the observed sensitivity to κ iso are stronger in the geom case which arises from the nonlinear state dependence of κ gm in the const case κ gm and κ iso are independently prescribed and the resulting modelled states at different κ iso are not so different between the experiments at least from a qualitative point of view and consistent with the conclusions of couespel et al 2021 on the other hand in the geom case increases in κ iso leads to minor differences in the modelled state which leads to changes in the calculated κ gm in this case a decreasing κ gm over the northern boundary region but with only very minor changes elsewhere in terms of the spatial pattern modifying the modelled state leading to an evolving κ gm the claim here is that the changes in the npp we are seeing in geom from changing κ iso arise from a positive feedback loop through its impact on κ gm and resulting changes in the modelled stratification the present nonlinear feedback loop between κ iso the modelled state and κ gm arising from geom should be studied further but is beyond the scope of the present work 
23782,ocean components of earth system models employed for climate projections do not routinely resolve mesoscale eddies for computational cost reasons and the associated subgrid processes are still parameterised while the performance of physics parameterisations in a numerical ocean model is normally assessed by examining the associated physical responses biogeochemical responses are also important but often treated separately given recent advances in mesoscale eddy parameterisations specifically for the eddy induced advection this work systematically explores the joint consequences for physical as well as biogeochemical responses brought about by a more updated proposal for the eddy induced velocity coefficient in the context of an idealised ocean relevant model relative to a high resolution mesoscale eddy resolving model the more updated mesoscale eddy parameterisation is able to capture aspects of the model truth in the physical responses the biogeochemical response is however rather more subtle where a better response with the conventional eddy parameterisation with a constant coefficient could arise from a physically inconsistent response while a parameterisation that improves the bulk physical response may still fall short in its biogeochemical response the present work highlights a need to assess both physical and biogeochemical aspects when judging the performance of eddy parameterisations and additionally provides some important baseline model sensitivities that future assessments employing other parameterisations or in more complex settings could

carbon and nutrient cycles and affects the global climate and the marine ecosystem e g rahmstorf 2002 doney et al 2012 over the decadal to centennial time scales more heat is expected to reside in the upper part of the ocean under climate projection exercises e g ipcc 2019 strengthening the upper ocean stratification and changing the ocean ventilation pathways e g bindoff and mcdougall 1994 li et al 2020 the ocean meridional overturning circulation is projected to slow down partly via the shoaling of the pycnocline though uncertainties still exist e g bellomo et al 2021 changes in the ocean overturning circulation can affect the bulk transport of nutrients which can then have large scale impacts on the phytoplankton populations as primary producers phytoplankton play an important role in the global carbon cycle and impact issues of food security via their position at the base of most oceanic food webs while there is large uncertainty in the physiological responses of various marine biomass to the changing marine environment in terms of heat stress nutrient abundance acidity and others e g kwiatkowski et al 2020 tagliabue et al 2021 martiny et al 2022 it is not controversial to say that the physical circulation can impact the broad regional and global biogeochemical response one such link is the impact of the circulation on nutrient supply though such projections often come with large uncertainties given the nonlinear interactions present in the complex earth system e g lotze et al 2019 earth system models are invaluable tools for probing and constraining the physical and biogeochemical responses in the marine system to the changing environment these numerical models simulate the evolution of the earth system components and their interactions e g bonan and doney 2018 séférian et al 2019 lee et al 2022 with the assumption that the processes implemented into the numerical models are correct however even with the increasing computational power available present state of the art earth system models still mostly utilise ocean components at approximately 1 horizontal resolution that do not explicitly permit geostrophic mesoscale eddies e g hewitt et al 2020 2022 geostrophic mesoscale eddies play a crucial role in regulating the ocean circulation responses which not only have local effects but also impact the larger scale regional and global mean state e g lévy et al 2012 although there is an increasing push for ocean models to be mesoscale eddy resolving fox kemper et al 2019 kwiatkowski et al 2020 hewitt et al 2022 or at least eddy rich at around 1 12 horizontal resolutions hallberg 2013 models at such resolutions remain computationally prohibitive and global earth system models with an ocean component at the mesoscale eddy permitting regime at around 1 4 horizontal resolution is a more realistic target hewitt et al 2017 2020 2022 roberts et al 2020 given the physical influence on the biogeochemical response and the anticipated developments of ocean models over the next decade there is a need to probe constrain and understand the sensitivities of the physical and biogeochemical responses in ocean models at the non eddy resolving eddy permitting as well as the eddy rich resolving resolutions for those models that do not explicitly permit mesoscale eddies parameterisations are often employed to mimic the feedback of geostrophic mesoscale eddies often employed are what we would term here as diffusive closures such as isoneutral diffusion e g redi 1982 griffies 1998 and the gent mcwilliams gm scheme gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 isoneutral diffusion leads to tracer diffusion along the isoneutral directions while the gm scheme leads to an eddy induced advection of tracers that flattens isoneutral slopes and both are consistent with the adiabatic nature of mesoscale eddies generated by baroclinic instabilities e g vallis 2006 such diffusive closures were designed for coarse resolution models with no explicitly resolved eddies considered more standard and variants of such schemes exist in most numerical ocean models e g mitgcm marshall et al 1997a b nemo madec 2008 fesom wang et al 2014 mom adcroft et al 2019 on the other hand mesoscale eddies can also lead to sharpening of large scale jets via inverse cascades eddy induced momentum convergence or otherwise e g waterman and jayne 2012 waterman and hoskins 2013 which is increasingly modelled by backscatter based parameterisations e g bachman 2019 jansen et al 2019 recent advances in both classes of parameterisations have led to lower resolution models that are more in line with the eddy rich resolving models at least in the physical response advances in diffusive schemes tend to focus more on coarse resolution models some of which have led to improvements in sensitivities of the circulation to changing forcing scenarios e g farneti et al 2015 mak et al 2018 2022b backscatter schemes have received more attention in eddy permitting models because of their ability to strengthen the represented eddy energy levels and ocean currents e g bachman 2019 jansen et al 2019 the biogeochemical response to such recent updates in physics parameterisations have been on the other hand lacking when it is known that model represented physics can have a substantial impact on the resulting physical and or biogeochemical metrics of interest modifying the represented eddy mean feedbacks can have a significant effect on the ventilation rate and pathways affecting the represented ocean heat content e g de boer et al 2007 zhang and vallis 2013 zanna et al 2019b mak et al 2022b newsom et al 2022 carbon england and rahmstorf 1999 gnanadesikan et al 2015 khwatiwala et al 2018 oxygen matear et al 2000 helm et al 2011 bopp et al 2017 takano et al 2018 and nutrient distributions lévy et al 1999 tschumi et al 2011 bopp et al 2013 couespel et al 2021 with the prevalent use of numerical ocean general circulation models for probing and predicting biophysical interactions e g bopp et al 2013 berthet et al 2019 swearer et al 2019 séférian et al 2019 it is important to investigate how the physics parameterisations i modify the modelled physical states and i i affect the biogeochemical responses such an investigation is required since there is no guarantee that improvements in physical processes necessarily lead to a better biogeochemical response given the nonlinear interactions inherent in a complex system global and or realistic models while useful for making predictions and informing policies e g ipbes 2019 are computationally expensive and possess a large number of degrees of freedom making it difficult to attribute the various causalities while ultimately these realistic and complex earth system models should be used when quantitatively assessing the impacts of eddy parameterisations for delineating the causality and interactions between the physical parameterisations and the resulting physical and biogeochemical responses we consider here a complementary approach by utilising idealised numerical models focusing on the qualitative differences arising from the choice of eddy parameterisations we focus on a systematic assessment of mesoscale eddy parameterisations and their qualitative impact on the nutrient stream or relay and their subsequent impact on net primary production npp e g williams et al 2017 2011 whitt and jansen 2020 gupta et al 2022 we employ a double gyre setting with a simple biogeochemistry model with prescribed atmospheric forcing and an idealised climate change scenario couespel et al 2021 the double gyre setting has the benefit that the model behaviours and limitations are relatively well known e g jackson et al 2006 lévy et al 2010 2012 2014 stewart et al 2021 and the high resolution eddy resolving model truths are more computationally accessible because of the limited spatial extent even with the reduced complexity afforded by the choice of numerical model there are multiple parameterisations for mesoscale turbulence here we focus on diffusive eddy closures specifically on the gm based parameterisations for the eddy induced advection an analogous investigation into the effects of isoneutral diffusion backscatter type eddy parameterisations and extensions into the eddy permitting models will be reported in subsequent publications the models to be investigated here are non eddy resolving differing by the gm type closures they employ and the qualitative performance of these will be judged against a high resolution eddy resolving model truth the gm parameterisation variants and the numerical model set up are described in section 2 in section 3 we report the qualitative differences in both the physical and biogeochemical responses arising from the choice of closures in section 4 we subject the models to an idealised climate change scenario to investigate analogous model sensitivities the article concludes in section 5 critically evaluating the advantages and shortfalls provided by the choices of gm based closures 2 mesoscale eddy parameterisations and numerical set up two canonical types of diffusive closures associated with geostrophic turbulence are those based on isoneutral diffusion e g redi 1982 and the gent mcwilliams scheme gm gent and mcwilliams 1990 the former refers to diffusion of tracers along the isoneutral direction while the latter is an eddy induced advection e g gent et al 1995 treguier et al 1997 griffies 1998 although it resembles a horizontal buoyancy diffusion in the quasi geostrophic limit e g treguier et al 1997 or a layer thickness diffusion e g gent and mcwilliams 1990 the isoneutral diffusion and gm schemes are both known to affect the physical and biogeochemical response isoneutral diffusion modifies the rate of tracer ventilation and the gm schemes affect the structure of the tracer ventilation through its impact on the density stratification relatively speaking there are more studies on assessing gm based schemes e g visbeck et al 1997 eden and greatbatch 2008 cessi 2008 hofman and morales maqueda 2011 munday et al 2013 zhang and vallis 2013 bates et al 2014 farneti et al 2015 mak et al 2018 2022b although there have also been increasing interest in isoneutral diffusion assessing its impact as well as improving on the standard implementation with constant diffusivity e g ferrari and nikurashin 2010 pradal and gnanadesikan 2014 jones and abernathey 2019 2021 groeskamp et al 2021 holmes et al 2022 chouksey et al 2022 while both processes are related to mesoscale turbulence and there are works that suggest relationships between the two e g smith and marshall 2009 abernathey et al 2013 owing to the larger interest in gm based closures in this work we focus primarily on the consequences afforded by different gm based schemes and consider a prescribed constant isoneutral diffusivity κ iso the model sensitivity to κ iso by itself was found to be rather mild in the present model although nonlinear feedback loops can be present suggesting that further investigation is required in this area see appendix for details 2 1 gm based parameterisations the gm scheme introduces an eddy induced velocity u to the tracer equations e g griffies 1998 ferreira et al 2005 1 u κ gm s here s h ρ n 2 denotes the isopycnal slope in the horizontal directions h the horizontal gradient operator n 2 ρ z the vertical buoyancy gradients associated with the resolved state ρ the dynamically relevant density and κ gm will be termed the gm coefficient in this work the gm scheme is widely used because of its inherent properties such as adiabatic advection leading to slumping of isopycnals positive definite generation of eddy energy and layer wise conservation of moments e g gent et al 1995 as well as numerical advantages numerical stability due to the slumping action reduction of unrealistic deep convection e g danabasoglu et al 1994 a choice often utilised in idealised models takes the simple prescription of 2 κ gm κ 0 constant 2 1 1 geometric as it is desirable to maintain the properties afforded by the gm scheme even if one does not believe a simple prescription of κ gm constant will suffice a prevalent research focus has been on improving the functional form of κ gm e g visbeck et al 1997 treguier et al 1997 ferreira et al 2005 cessi 2008 eden and greatbatch 2008 hofman and morales maqueda 2011 marshall et al 2012 jansen et al 2015 2019 we consider here on a form of the gm scheme arising from the geometric framework for analysing eddy mean flow interactions see marshall et al 2012 maddison and marshall 2013 in the present form analysis within the geometric framework suggests scaling κ gm as mak et al 2018 2022b 3 κ gm α e d z m 2 n d z where m 2 h ρ denotes the horizontal buoyancy gradients associated with the resolved state α is a non dimensional tuning parameter bounded in magnitude by one e is the total potential and kinetic eddy energy and the resulting κ gm varies in time and in the horizontal but is depth independent with the present specification unlike most other existing proposals for the κ gm that utilise mixing length type arguments with dependence on the eddy kinetic energy the gm version of geometric arises from a mathematically rigorous bound that results from analysing the eliassen palm flux tensor that encodes the eddy mean feedbacks marshall et al 2012 maddison and marshall 2013 the bound results in a linear dependence on the total eddy energy e compared to mixing length based parameterisations with a square root scaling e g eden and greatbatch 2008 jansen et al 2015 2019 which leads to a more significant state dependent response notably out of the gm based parameterisations the gm version of geometric has more evidence in support of its use from a diagnostic point of view bachman et al 2017 wang and stewart 2020 wei et al 2022 and prognostic calculations in idealised models mak et al 2017 2018 as well as in realistic models mak et al 2022b in particular the gm version of geometric in the aforementioned prognostic calculations have been shown to lead to improved sensitivities of the modelled ocean circulation to changes in forcing over the standard prescription of κ gm notably in the antarctic circumpolar current transport and the global meridional overturning circulation strength in a prognostic calculation with a coarse resolution model e is provided using a depth integrated eddy energy budget denoting x y to be the zonal and meridional directions respectively following mak et al 2022b the eddy energy budget used with geometric is given by 4 d d t e d z h u z c e x e d z advection κ gm m 4 n 2 d z source λ e e 0 d z dissipation η e h 2 e d z diffusion where the depth integrated eddy energy is advected by the depth average flow u z with westward propagation at the long rossby wave phase speed c e g chelton et al 2011 klocker and marshall 2014 the growth of eddy energy comes from the slumping of mean density surfaces and diffused in the horizontal grooms 2015 ni et al 2020a b with η e denoting the associated eddy energy diffusivity a linear dissipation of eddy energy at rate λ but maintaining a minimum eddy energy level e 0 is utilised so λ 1 is an eddy energy dissipation time scale which is a bulk parameterisation of energy fluxes out of the mesoscales resulting from numerous dynamical processes e g mak et al 2022a in this work we focus on a comparison between calculations employing the gm version of the geometric parameterisation denoted geom and the calculations employing a prescribed constant κ gm denoted const we have also performed calculations with simpler proposals of κ gm that are state dependent treguier et al 1997 cf visbeck et al 1997 and will comment on the results from those calculations where appropriate although we have not performed calculations employing other existing energetically constrained proposals e g κ gm k of jansen et al 2019 where k is the eddy kinetic energy we speculate in the discussion section the expected responses given the results from the present work 2 2 model set up our main focus here is to systematically assess the qualitative differences arising from different eddy parameterisation variants and for this purpose an idealised numerical ocean model is employed a double gyre model based on the set up of couespel et al 2021 using the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo madec 2008 was used the gyre model here is a straightened version of the standard gyre configuration test case in nemo the model is already coupled to an idealised biogeochemistry model within nemo cf lévy et al 2010 2012 and has been used to study both physical and biogeochemical responses in couespel et al 2021 to recap the domain is square with sides of length 3180 km and depth 4 km formulated on a β plane with the southern boundary at 20 n extending to the northern boundary at 50 n the domain has no bathymetry and is bounded by vertical walls that are aligned with longitudes and latitudes on all sides while the presence of bathymetry is known to have impacts on the large scale circulation e g jackson et al 2006 gula et al 2015 stewart et al 2021 there is the added subtlety on how one should parameterise eddy feedbacks over slope regions e g wang and stewart 2020 wei et al 2022 for simplicity and to reduce the degrees of freedom in the problem we opted for the flat bottom case we employ a non linear bottom drag and impose free slip conditions on the lateral boundaries the model utilises a linear equation of state with temperature and salinity and vertical mixing is via a turbulent kinetic energy scheme gaspar et al 1990 atmospheric forcing is through the flux formulation and the forcings wind stress penetrative solar radiation pseudo atmospheric temperature θ for computing sea surface temperature restoring freshwater flux are all zonally symmetric with a prescribed repeating seasonal cycle with no period beyond a year and there is no net salinity flux see lévy et al 2010 fig 1 the model employs an idealised biogeochemistry model lobster see e g lévy et al 2012 with standard reference settings and with eddy induced advective and diffusive contributions from the gm based and redi schemes respectively the lobster model uses nitrogen as the currency and the six biogeochemical variables are concentrations of detritus zooplankton phytoplankton nitrate ammonium and dissolved organic matter variables of particular interest to the work here are phytoplankton and nitrate for their links to net primary production npp as lobster does not represent physiological changes with changes in temperature changes observed are solely due to changes in the transport of the biogeochemical tracers providing a better focus on the large scale links between physics and biogeochemistry the differences between the model employed in this work to that of couespel et al 2021 are the following version of nemo nemo v4 0 5 r14538 instead of v3 4 r4826 a slightly different initialisation of nitrate concentration at the start of the perturbation experiments no averaging of the deep ocean nitrate concentration the model truth is taken here to have a horizontal resolution of 1 12 instead of 1 9 the updated version of nemo already has the gm version of geometric implemented from the work of mak et al 2022b and it was easier to adapt the model configuration to the newer nemo than to write the geometric parameterisation into an older version of nemo sample calculations show that the different initialisation of the nitrate concentration at the deeper ocean have no impact on the conclusions in this article the horizontal resolution of the model truth was increased to 1 12 partly as a balance to resolve mesoscale processes but without resolving too much of the submesoscale processes so that there is a more suitable comparison between the model truth and the coarse resolution models employing the gm based schemes since the gm based schemes are not designed to capture submesoscale processes the model truth horizontal resolution of 1 12 was also chosen for the suggestive analogy with the global nemo orca0083 also known as orca12 configuration that is at a nominal horizontal resolution of 1 12 and provides a benchmark reference for our future investigations into eddy permitting models all the major conclusions of couespel et al 2021 are found to hold even with the present changes a summary of key model parameters is given in table 1 partly informed by previous works couespel et al 2021 mak et al 2022b a a brief description of model sensitivities to some of these choices are given in appendix 2 3 experimental set up following the strategy of couespel et al 2021 the physical and biogeochemical model at the 1 resolution starts from model year 2300 spun up over 2000 model years to model year 300 using the const variant with constant κ gm at model year 300 perturbation experiments were carried out for another 300 years to model year 0 which is longer than the 100 years considered in couespel et al 2021 for the 1 models the perturbation experiments are with const and geom for the 1 12 model r12 the fields are simply interpolated from the 1 model onto the analogous 1 12 grid two sets of experiments are performed in this work a control pre industrial setting tagged with a suffix ctl integrates the aforementioned calculations for another 70 years from model year 0 subject to the same idealised atmospheric forcing an idealised climate change scenario tagged with a suffix cc has the models exposed to the aforementioned idealised seasonal cycle from model year 0 but the atmospheric temperature is given an increasing linear trend of 0 04 c yr 1 over 70 model years following couespel et al 2021 to mimic the ssp5 8 5 scenario e g tokarska et al 2020 fig 1 shows some of the summary statistics of the spinup and the adjustment under the control and idealised climate change scenario indicating that a quasi equilibrium has been reached at least in the upper parts of the ocean depths less than 700 m in the perturbation calculations during the spinup stage under the idealised climate change scenario the ocean temperature increases leading to a stronger stratification primarily in the upper ocean not shown that inhibits nutrient supply and a decrease in npp across the set of calculations consistent with the results of couespel et al 2021 see their fig 1 d and a1 in each of the two sets of experiments we evaluate the performance of the eddy parameterisations by examining both the physical and biogeochemical responses critically comparing the similarities and differences between geom const and the r12 model truth under the ctl and cc scenario a working hypothesis is that the physical and biogeochemical responses are improved in the geom calculations when compared to the const calculations for evaluating the performance we consider diagnostics calculated from data time averaged over the analysis period taken to be the last five years of the calculations between the start of model year 66 and the end of model year 70 time averaged quantities are denoted by an overbar 5 1 t 1 t 0 t 0 t 1 d t with t 0 1 being start and end of model years 66 and 70 respectively following the work of couespel et al 2021 our focus is on the responses particularly within the subpolar gyre region which is the area that is most bioactive in the present setup we employ the same pre defined box utilised in couespel et al 2021 for our analysis defined as the area bounded between y 35 n 45 n and z 700 m with the boundaries marked on by the black dashed lines in the subsequent figures where appropriate the eventual supporting evidence suggests the hypothesis is largely true see table 2 in section 5 but there are important subtle details to be elaborated on models can display multiple equilibria and or be affected by internal modes of variability e g sérazin et al 2017 zanna et al 2019a where diagnostics would vary depending on the period of analysis in the present model we considered ensemble experiments perturbing the initial conditions and we found no significant internal variability beyond inter annual periods this could be because of the idealised model as well as the choice of forcing which has a repeating seasonal cycle and no mode of variability longer than a year while there is seasonable variability particularly in the eddy resolving calculations cf lévy et al 2014 we are interested in broad scale and long time changes and the inter annual variability is averaged out with a multi year average from our diagnostics as such the conclusions drawn from our diagnostics here should thus be regarded as statistically significant however we should stress again that we focus on the qualitative rather than the quantitative differences the primary interest is to see if one parameterisation scheme performs better and less on how much better the latter is more sensitive to context and should be quantified using more realistic models 3 comparison of pre industrial controls 3 1 physical responses fig 2 a b shows the barotropic streamfunction tilde denoting a dummy integration variable 6 ψ baro x y h 0 0 x v x y z d x d z for the r12 and geom calculation the const one has been omitted since visually it is indistinguishable from the geom one both models display the familiar northern hemisphere double gyre pattern with a subtropical gyre to the south and a subpolar gyre to the north in the r12 calculation because of eddy rectification effects the modelled western boundary current is more variable and stronger through eddies converging momentum into the jet extension e g lévy et al 2010 waterman et al 2011 waterman and lilly 2015 the western boundary current is also slightly south of the latitudinal centre line even though the zonal wind stress is symmetric about the same centre line cf lévy et al 2010 in addition relatively strong re circulation regions exist near the northern and southern boundaries as fofonoff gyres e g berloff 2005 marshall and adcroft 2010 all such features are absent in the coarse resolution non eddying models relying on the standard diffusive mesoscale parameterisations in fig 2 c we show the resulting κ gm x y from geom note that κ gm is large on the order of a few thousand m 2 s 1 on the western boundary current in the subtropical gyre the much smaller values of κ gm within the subpolar gyre and particularly its values near the northern boundary will be discussed later the resulting domain averaged value of κ gm is about 300 m 2 s 1 and we note the gyre models studied here using such a small value of κ gm everywhere leads to un physical deep convection particularly along the western boundary current not shown cf danabasoglu et al 1994 one benefit then with parameterisation schemes that allow spatial variations of κ gm is that κ gm can be large only where it needs to be large and this point will be revisited throughout the article the concentrated signal of κ gm on the western boundary observed in fig 2 c is also consistent with the fact that the represented western boundary current in a coarse resolution model is rather weak which suggests that the resulting meridional overturning circulation in the system is also rather weak in fig 3 we show metrics relating to the overturning circulation namely the diagnosed meridional overturning circulation streamfunction 7 ψ moc y z h z 0 l x v x y z d x d z some sample isopycnals using potential density referenced to sea level as well as the diagnosed depth integrated and zonal mean northward heat transport v θ x between different calculations as shown in fig 3 the coarse resolution models const and geom in general have a weaker overturning strength partially because of a weaker modelled western boundary current arising from the more diffuse nature of the model the particularly weak overturning in the subtropical region of the coarse resolution models compared to the r12 model truth is consistent with a weak western boundary current related to the structure of the displayed isopycnals via thermal wind shear relation the weaker overturning is reflected in the reduced northward transport of heat the use of geometric provides mild improvements to the represented overturning strength particularly in the subpolar gyre where the diagnosed ψ moc in geom is stronger than that in const and closer to r12 area weighted average root mean square mismatch to r12 of 1 99 sv in geom compared to 2 29 sv in const within the subpolar gyre box the stronger moc coincides with a larger heat transport area weighted average heat transport of 0 094 pw in geom compared to 0 078 pw in const calculated from north of 35 n this increased overturning strength is expected to have a positive effect on the modelled biogeochemical response in the geom calculation as we can expect increased nutrient transport into the subpolar gyre by the nutrient stream or relay e g williams et al 2017 2011 whitt and jansen 2020 gupta et al 2022 the double gyre model here is configured such that the downwelling is most prominent in the northern part of the domain since this region is exposed to the coolest atmospheric temperatures as seen in the maximum mixed layer depths shown in fig 4 a c diagnosed as the first depth below which σ θ z σ θ z 10 m 0 01 where σ θ is the potential density referenced to sea level the biggest differences between the calculations are at the northern part of the domain particularly in the northwestern corner of the domain fig 4 d f shows the histogram of the diagnosed mixed layer north of the subpolar region where we see const has a notable skew towards shallower mixed layer depths relative to geom and r12 in terms of median and distribution the more shallow mixed layer depths observed in the const calculation are consistent with the decrease in the overturning strength since the mixed layer is correlated to the depths of deep water extent and overturning circulation one rationalisation is that the gm scheme flattens isopycnals and works against the steepening of isopycnals associated with deep water formation and subsequent convective events the const calculation employs a higher κ gm value in the northern boundary region compared with the resulting κ gm in the geom calculation see fig 2 c leading to a shallow bias compared to geom the causality highlights the importance of the magnitude and distribution of κ gm in the modelled physical mean state of coarse resolution models where the mean transport pathways and strengths are being influenced by the explicit or parameterised small scale feedbacks 3 2 biogeochemical responses since the const calculation is expected to have a weaker circulation fig 3 and shallower mixed layer depths fig 4 relative to the geom case we can expect that geom offers some improvements over const in the biogeochemical response via changes in the nutrient transport fig 5 shows the horizontal distribution of vertically integrated npp for the integrated npp averaged over the subpolar gyre region units of mmol n m 2 day 1 where n is the nitrogen currency r12 has the largest npp at 3 67 compared to const at 2 76 and geom at 2 91 respectively a decrease of 24 8 and 20 6 relative to r12 the geom calculation results in npp values closer to the model truth r12 compared to the const calculation which is consistent with our expectations although the improvements are somewhat modest as noted in section 2 the biogeochemistry model takes no explicit account of temperature variations on the biogeochemical activities themselves so the changes observed are a result of the changes in the nutrient distributions while npp has contributions from nitrate and ammonium we focus our attention on nitrate as it is the dominant form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen except in oxygen poor regions in the marine system e g oxygen minimum zones or coastal hypoxia zones the f ratio the ratio between primary production arising from nitrate and total primary production e g sarmiento and gruber 2006 4 is relatively constant over the set of calculations at around 0 43 cf couespel et al 2021 we show in fig 6 the zonally averaged vertical distribution of nitrate and we see a suppression and elevation of nitrate concentration in the subtropical and subpolar gyres respectively across all models consistent with the ekman downwelling and upwelling from the choice of zonal wind forcing e g 4 of williams and follows 2011 in both the const and geom calculations there is a strong decrease in nitrate concentration in the subtropical gyre compared with r12 possibly in line with the damped western boundary current associated with the large κ gm values in the region there is also an overall decrease over the whole subpolar gyre in the coarse resolution calculations fig 6 d however there is an increase in nitrate concentration in the northern parts of the subpolar gyre for geom compared to const examined via the differences not shown which collectively leads to a mildly elevated npp in the same subpolar gyre region in geom compared to const to analyse the transport properties of nitrate we note that the advective contribution arises as u n where n denotes the nitrate concentration focusing on the subpolar gyre box area enclosed by the black dashed lines in figs 5 and 6 noting that the box boundaries at longitudinal lines coincide with the model domain boundaries by the divergence theorem and invoking no normal flow boundary conditions we have 8 box u n d x d y d z south north v n d x d z bottom w n d x d y we can further consider the reynolds decomposition 9 n n n n 0 where the overbar is still the time average which leads to 10 u n u n u n respectively the total the mean and the eddy advective flux of nitrate and u is from the explicit velocity fluctuations in the case of explicit eddies supplemented by parameterised eddy induced velocity u when a gm based parameterisation is active we compute the vertical distribution of the vertical nitrate supply i e 11 y l s y l n 0 l x w n w n d x d y where no vertical integration is implied as well as the vertical cumulative integral of the horizontal nitrate supply at the southern and northern boundaries i e 12 0 z 0 l x v n v n d x d z fig 7 shows the total advective supply of nitrate into the subpolar gyre box in the vertical at the southern boundary and northern boundary the dominant contribution to the total supply is in the mean component although the eddy component is somewhat significant in the const case not shown here but see e g couespel et al 2021 fig a5 the vertical nitrate supply rate is dominant over the top 150 m or so in all calculations magnitude of positive values fig 7 a the vertical mixing contribution dominates over the advective contribution over the top 50 m but is otherwise similar for the set of calculations not shown here cf couespel et al 2021 fig 4 however the meridional nitrate supply becomes important with depth the model truth r12 has the largest vertical gain fig 7 a throughout the depths considered and the supply from the south and loss from the north fig 7 b c are both large consistent with r12 having the strongest overturning circulation out of the set of calculations considered here cf fig 3 for the coarse resolution calculations while the const case leads to a meridional gain of nitrate at depths below 200 m via consideration of the residual of the gain from the south and loss from the north the geom case has a larger vertical supply throughout the depths considered which is more consistent with the r12 calculation and leads to a larger overall total nitrate supply resulting in the larger diagnosed npp values found in geom relative to const one important point to emphasise here is that while the local eddy contributions are small it is the eddy feedback onto the mean state and the changes to the mean state that lead to the overall observed response cf couespel et al 2021 sample experiments not shown show that the npp increases with decreasing κ gm so one might naïvely argue that we should take κ gm even smaller or even switch it off to improve the eddy component of nitrate supply and increase the npp however this is at the expense of introducing un physical deep convection particularly along the western boundary current and the mean and eddy components are not isolated components that one can tune separately the spatially varying nature of κ gm afforded by geom allows the gm scheme to adjust according to the physically modelled state and suppressing its effects in the subpolar gyre where it is potentially detrimental to the biogeochemical response a calculation with a simpler prescription of κ gm based on treguier et al 1997 as implemented into nemo which requires a specification of a maximum κ gm and varies in space according to the baroclinic growth rate was performed here and gives similar conclusions in the control calculation to geom not shown the resulting κ gm is not unlike that shown in fig 2 c but with a much more gradual spatial variation limited by the choice of the maximum κ gm taken here to be 1000 m 2 s 1 the resulting diagnostics are largely similar and certainly improve upon the const case for reasons detailed already in that regard it is the spatially varying nature of κ gm afforded by the more updated schemes that results in a modelled state that is closer to the model truth in the selected diagnostics however it is known that schemes based on a prescribed maximum κ gm limit how the models can react to climate change scenarios e g fox kemper et al 2019 the geom scheme and other energetically constrained parameterisations have no such limitations and we expect such schemes to behave in a favourable way under the climate change scenarios 4 sensitivities under idealised climate change 4 1 physical responses fig 8 shows the κ gm distribution from geom under the climate change scenario and the raw differences compared to the control scenario the notable feature here is the increase in κ gm towards the northern boundary in fig 8 b where the model deep water is formed given the discussion in the previous section we would expect the geom calculation in this case to have an over weakened overturning circulation leading to a decrease in the nitrate supply and the npp details turn out to matter as will be seen shortly fig 9 a b c shows the raw differences between the overturning streamfunction under climate change and the control case cf fig 3 a b c while both r12 and geom show a significant decrease in the very northern part of the domain this feature seems to be absent in the const case this lack of decrease in the overturning strength in const and even a mild increase shown at the bottom right half of fig 9 b might have contributed to the observed sensitivity in the diagnosed northward heat transport not shown the r12 and geom calculations both show only small increases in the heat transport relative to the respective control scenario north of 35 n 2 0 and 5 7 increase in the area weighted average respectively but the const calculation shows a rather significant increase in the heat transport in the same region 23 5 increase in the area weighted average the response seen in r12 and geom are likely because of the increase in temperature offsetting the decrease in the advective velocity on the other hand the magnitude of the response in const is quite significant and unlikely to result solely from increases in water temperature suggesting that the overturning response under climate change scenario in const is inconsistent with the actual dynamics in the model truth with explicit eddies fig 10 shows the changes in the diagnosed maximum mixed layer and all panels show that the mixed layer depth has generally shoaled across all calculations under the climate change scenario particularly in the region near the northern boundary this is consistent with the warming of the atmosphere and the associated decrease in the ocean buoyancy loss the shoaling is reflected in the shift of the median values as well as a decrease in the quartile ranges however note that the coarse resolution models appear to have a noticeably shallower mixed layer as seen in the histograms and the median values in fig 10 e f compared to the r12 calculations with explicit eddies in fig 10 d from the preceding discussion we might expect that the decrease of the maximum mixed layer depth is more significant in geom given the increase in κ gm in the region cf fig 8 b leading to a stronger flattening of isopycnals that acts against the formation of deep mixed layers impacting the overturning circulation we can quantify the magnitude of the overall shoaling by numerically computing the 1 wasserstein distance w 1 μ ν sometimes known as the earth mover s distance e g villani 2008 which measures the distance between two discrete probability distributions μ and ν i e a measure of the difference between two histograms doing so leads to w 1 geom ctl geom cc 216 while w 1 const ctl const cc 170 in the present mixed layer depth diagnostic thus supporting the conclusion that the geom calculation changes more within the climate change scenario for completeness w 1 r12 ctl r12 cc 217 so in this metric geom has a sensitivity that is more in line with r12 than const 4 2 biogeochemical responses fig 11 shows the horizontal distribution of the raw differences in the vertically integrated npp between the climate change and control scenarios there is a decrease in npp across all models under climate change particularly in the subpolar gyre although there are isolated spots in the r12 calculation where npp has marginally increased south of the western boundary current separation and at the northern boundary where downwelling occurs the decrease in npp in the coarse resolution models are concentrated particularly in the east of the subpolar gyre region and a small patch towards the western boundary in the geom calculation the integrated npp value averaged over the subpolar gyre box declines under climate change for all calculations with r12 at 3 16 13 8 const at 2 13 22 9 and geom at 2 22 23 6 where the raw numbers are in units of mmol n m 2 day 1 n being the nitrogen currency and the percentage difference is relative to the respective calculations in the control scenario the r12 model simulates the largest npp overall with the smallest decline under the climate change scenario the coarse resolution models significantly under predict the raw value of the npp and also predict a more dramatic decline in line with the previous results of couespel et al 2021 while it is true that the geom calculation still predicts a higher npp than the const calculation in both the control and climate change scenario the geom calculation displays more sensitivity to the change in forcing under the climate change scenario with a marginally larger npp decline compared to const although the relative decrease in npp in const is smaller in magnitude than geom we should also bear in mind that there is evidence indicating that const possesses a sensitivity in the physical response that is inconsistent with the eddy resolving calculation r12 e g fig 9 i e the const calculation might be better in the integrated npp diagnostic but not necessarily for the right reasons the observed decline in npp can again be attributed to the changes in the nutrient supply we focus our attention again on nitrate there is a decrease in the f ratio to around 0 40 from around 0 43 in the control scenario uniformly across the set of calculations fig 12 shows the differences in vertical distribution of zonally averaged nitrate between the climate change and control scenario see also fig 6 there is a decline of nitrate in the upper portions of the subpolar gyre across all models with a mild increase at depths indicating a decline in upwelling which is consistent with the strengthened stratification as indicated for example by the buoyancy frequency n 2 ρ z not shown cf fig a10 of couespel et al 2021 fig 12 d shows the vertical distribution of the nitrate concentration averaged over the subpolar gyre box and it is noteworthy that the geom calculation has a vertical distribution change that is closer to the model truth r12 than the const case the differences in the total advective fluxes of nitrate into the subpolar gyre box relative to the diagnosed supplies in fig 7 are shown in fig 13 the dominant contribution to the total change was again found to be in the mean although the eddy component is somewhat sizeable for the const case note that negative values in fig 13 largely mean a decrease in the supply into the subpolar gyre while positive values mostly mean a decrease in the loss out of the subpolar gyre the changes in the diffusive contributions are largely similar across the set of calculations and have been omitted the r12 case has a decreased vertical nutrient supply fig 13 a southern boundary gain fig 13 b and northern boundary loss fig 13 c under idealised climate change broadly consistent with a decrease in the overturning strength cf fig 9 for the coarse resolution calculations we note that while const suffers a large decrease in the vertical supply over the top 300 m fig 13 a it seems to be compensated by an equally large decrease in the northern boundary loss over the same depths fig 13 c this is particularly interesting given neither of these sensitivities are nearly as dramatic in the r12 calculation and suggests that this is a case where two wrongs happen to cancel out resulting in a reasonable integrated response in the npp on the other hand the geom calculation over most panels capture the shape of the r12 responses somewhat and arguably substantially improve on the sensitivities displayed by the const calculation except at the northern boundary below 200 m and there is a notable decrease in the vertical supply in the upper 50 m of the ocean while the geom calculation seems to respond in a way that is more consistent with the model truth it seems to i not have the benefit of two wrongs cancelling out as in the const case and i i do things wrong perhaps where it matters the most in the vertical nutrient supply upper part of the ocean where light availability and npp are the largest 5 conclusions and discussions numerical ocean models at non eddy resolving to partially eddy permitting resolutions requiring sub grid physics parameterisation of the mesoscale processes are going to remain the norm for the foreseeable future assessment of related parameterisations to highlight the possible benefits and deficiencies are required to constrain our uncertainties in the relevant conclusions and projections to be drawn from such models to that end this work presents an investigation of the joint physical and biogeochemical sensitivity to the choice of mesoscale eddy parameterisation in light of the recent developments in eddy parameterisation and its improvements into the modelled physical processes the focus here is the more conventional diffusive closures utilised in coarse resolution non eddy permitting ocean models principally on the eddy induced advection represented by the gm scheme e g gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 and the gm version of the geometric scheme marshall et al 2012 mak et al 2018 2022b the latter takes a κ gm that scales linearly with eddy energy eq 3 and constrained by a parameterised eddy energy budget eq 4 the present work highlights a need to evaluate the performance and tuning of eddy parameterisations on both the physical and biogeochemical response and documents the performance of diffusive closures in coarse resolution models and the eddy resolving model truth as a precursor to an assessment into the eddy permitting models as well as backscatter type parameterisations to comprehensively assess the impacts afforded by the choice of mesoscale eddy parameterisation this investigation employs a simplified and well understood physical model a double gyre configuration with a prescribed seasonal pattern leading to deep water formation near the northern boundary further a simplified biogeochemistry model was chosen to focus on the chain of causality relating sensitivities afforded by the eddy parameterisation its impact on the modelled state its consequences for nutrient supply e g williams et al 2017 2011 whitt and jansen 2020 gupta et al 2022 and in turn net primary production npp the choice of an idealised model with limited spatial extent allows for an eddy resolving model truth for coarse resolution models to compare against the general model behaviours are entirely consistent with those reported in couespel et al 2021 where npp decreases under the climate change scenario this was attributed to the strengthening of upper ocean stratification leading to a weakened overturning circulation and thus weakening of nutrient supply into the subpolar gyre region where the npp is strongest the coarse resolution models display a more significant decrease in the npp attributed to a weaker overturning circulation in the coarse resolution models the previous work was performed with the standard prescription of the gm scheme with a constant gm coefficient and this work extends it in the first instance by considering a more updated gm based eddy parameterisation as well as critically assessing the model sensitivities as a result of the parameterisations and in anticipation of assessing model performance in eddy permitting models a summary of the key diagnostics in this work and a comparison of the more updated gm based eddy parameterisation with the constant case is given in table 2 we have not found evidence for significant internal variability beyond the annual forcing period which may be because of the choice of model and forcing set up which only has a repeating seasonal cycle while the reported diagnostics and conclusions should be considered statistically significant we emphasise again that the main focus here is on the qualitative relative differences e g differences in modelled state and or sensitivities and less on the quantitative absolute values e g magnitude of differences in modelled state and or sensitivities the latter will be somewhat context dependent so should be performed with a more realistic model for constraining climate projections the first main finding here is that the gm version of the geometric scheme marshall et al 2012 which was found previously to lead to improved sensitivities in the modelled ocean mean state particularly when the domain includes a representation of the southern ocean mak et al 2018 2022b leads to an improvement over the case where the gm coefficient κ gm is set to be uniform over space largely because the resulting κ gm varies in space and is somewhat state aware the benefits afforded by a spatially varying κ gm with reasonable properties are not entirely surprising and are somewhat known in the physical oceanography modelling community though perhaps not so widely reported in this particular model the overall model response seems to be particularly sensitive to the value of κ gm in the region with deep water formation which is consistent with theoretical considerations through the impact on the overturning circulation e g williams and follows 2011 extra calculations reported in appendix with prescribed spatially varying κ gm further support the reported model responses the observed model effect is rationalised here as the eddy induced advection acting against deep water formation and associated convective events and a smaller κ gm is conducive to deeper mixed layers and a stronger overturning circulation the resulting state from using geometric with κ gm e where e is the total eddy energy under the control scenario has a marginally stronger overturning circulation fig 3 and more consistent statistics in the mixed layer depths fig 4 this leads to a higher nutrient supply rate and npp table 2 with modelled nutrient transport properties fig 7 that are more consistent with the model truth over the const case it was verified in the extra calculations with the treguier et al 1997 prescription of κ gm choosing maximum κ gm value to be 1000 m 2 s 1 leads to qualitatively similar results as geom in the control calculation not shown we would expect similar eddy parameterisation schemes employing mixing length arguments with κ gm k where k is the eddy kinetic energy such as parts of meke jansen et al 2019 to lead to qualitative similar results as geom here although this has not been verified the second finding one that is more subtle is that a better physical response does not guarantee a better biogeochemical response and a better biogeochemical response could arise from physically inconsistent physical responses so there is a need to evaluate eddy parameterisations based on responses in both the gm version of the geometric scheme does worse in the integrated npp metric to idealised climate change compared to the standard implementation even though the model using the geometric scheme actually seems to mostly improve on the bulk sensitivities as displayed by the model truth e g nitrate concentration in fig 12 nutrient supply profiles in fig 13 and certainly more convincing and consistent than the const case which was found to have a significant increase in the heat transport and different advective nutrient supply profiles the observation here seems to stem from i the standard prescription of gm while producing inconsistent sensitivities happens to lead to cancellations e g strong decrease in supply of nitrate at southern boundary fig 13 b offset by an even stronger decrease in loss of nitrate at northern boundary fig 13 c and i i the geometric scheme happens to lead to a change in regions that are particularly important to the model response increase in the κ gm towards the northern boundary fig 8 b and decrease in the vertical nitrate supply near the top of the ocean fig 13 a extra calculations with the treguier et al 1997 prescription of κ gm with no re tuning lead to diagnostics that are qualitatively close to the geom calculations but at a lesser magnitude so that the integrated results are somewhat better than geom not shown the better performance in npp diagnostics however is likely because the resulting κ gm is still artificially capped at the same value so that the influence of κ gm over the northern boundary region is muted compared with geom we would expect similar eddy parameterisation schemes employing mixing length arguments with κ gm k would do slightly better in the integrated npp diagnostics than geom because of the more muted increase in κ gm over the northern boundary region although this has not been verified here one key point we make here is that care needs to be taken in the choice of metric to judge on the performance and a combination of metrics might be required to highlight the intricacies of the model behaviour that are potentially masked behind a single metric particularly when an average or integrated quantity is used a case in hand here is that while the standard prescription of the gm scheme seems to lead to a better response in integrated npp it is masking the fact that the contributing sensitivities are largely inconsistent with the model truth i e two wrongs can result in something that appears to look right ultimately the requirement should be that the biogeochemistry response is better because the underlying ocean physics is better and this work highlights a cautionary example where ocean models investigating biogeochemical responses should evaluate the modelled physical responses where possible the present use of an idealised model in addition to providing a clean investigation into the strengths and deficiencies in the parameterisation schemes also highlights lessons that we can learn from when extending our investigation to more complex but realistic models if a gm based parameterisation scheme is to be used in more realistic models some form of tapering of κ gm might be required as the regions of deep water formation are approached cf hallberg 2013 since this can have knock on effects for the overturning circulation and affect biogeochemical responses in a non local fashion more complex biogeochemistry models are required to assess and highlight the impact of eddy parameterisations on the modelled biogeochemistry for example carbon and oxygen budgets e g friedlingstein et al 2014 berthet et al 2019 séférian et al 2019 kwiatkowski et al 2020 our focus here is more process oriented and to set out a framework for evaluating the qualitative model responses and sensitivities to parameterisation but the use of more complex and realistic models are required for quantifying uncertainties in projections and will be a future focus another choice made here is to focus on the eddy induced advection as represented by the gm scheme sidelining the isoneutral diffusion as represented by the redi scheme e g redi 1982 griffies 1998 it is somewhat considered in the modelling community that the gm coefficient impacts the ventilation pathways via changes to the stratification profile and in turn the rate of ventilation while the isoneutral diffusion affects mostly the rate of ventilation e g england and rahmstorf 1999 matear 2001 gnanadesikan et al 2015 jones and abernathey 2019 without significantly affecting the modelled state but see chouksey et al 2022 theoretical developments as well as numerical assessment of the gm based schemes are somewhat more active and mature e g eden and greatbatch 2008 hofman and morales maqueda 2011 mak et al 2018 jansen et al 2019 bachman 2019 compared to that of isoneutral diffusion e g smith and marshall 2009 ferrari and nikurashin 2010 abernathey et al 2013 groeskamp et al 2021 with that in mind prior to our investigation we have mostly focused on the gm based schemes but we considered simulations varying the spatially constant isoneutral diffusion coefficient κ iso our sample simulations varying the spatially constant κ iso by itself seems to have very minor to negligible impacts for this model but there are feedback loops present if κ gm is state aware see appendix a systematic and comprehensive assessment of the isoneutral diffusion parameterisation schemes is a major undertaking and we opted to postpone the related investigation while we would like to make use of mesoscale resolving models generally these are still computationally prohibitive and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future as a compromise there is an increasing focus on eddy permitting models to broadly refer to ocean models around 1 2 to 1 9 horizontal resolution where mesoscale eddies have an explicit but incomplete representation e g the explicit eddy field is substantially less energetic from measures such as the explicit eddy kinetic energy as noted at the beginning of this work existing geostrophic mesoscale eddy parameterisations largely split into diffusive closures which was the subject of this present work and backscatter approaches e g bachman 2019 jansen et al 2019 the former is more targeted towards coarse resolution model without an explicit representation of eddies e g models with around 1 horizontal resolution such as the nemo orca1 model the latter in principle should work across models at different resolutions but the working consensus at the time of writing seems to be that backscatter approaches work better in eddy permitting models energising the eddies that are explicitly represented by the model itself given the increase in available computational power for performing global ocean models and earth system models at eddy permitting resolutions normally around 1 4 horizontal resolution and the benefits that result once ocean models start to become eddy permitting e g hewitt et al 2017 2020 an assessment into backscatter parameterisations analogous to the one carried out here is a priority and is currently the subject of

acknowledges financial support from the chanel research chair of ens psl the authors would like to thank the two anonymous referees and spencer jones for their comments that helped improve the scientific and presentation of the present article appendix model dependence on other parameters here we provide some further evidence for our assertion that the model mostly depends on κ gm particularly its values around the northern boundary where deep water formation occurs and a brief description of model dependence on other key uncertain parameters within the system namely the geometric parameters α and λ see eqs 3 and 4 and the isoneutral diffusion parameter κ iso the dynamical argument here is that the presence of κ gm leads to the flattening of isopycnals at the base of the mixed layer which inhibits the deepening of mixed layers such an effect leads to a shallow bias of the mixed layer depths a weakening of the overturning circulation a reduction in nitrate supply and a reduction in npp the argument is in line with the previous results in the appendix of couespel et al 2021 as well as our const experiments where it is generally observed that the smaller the κ gm the higher the npp for precisely the aforementioned dynamical reasons with signatures in the mixed layer depths and other physical metrics not shown the highest npp occurs for the case when the gm scheme is completely switched off but of course at the expense of introducing un physical deep convection around the domain as mentioned in the text it follows that varying the geom parameters α and λ affect the resulting model results in ways that are consistent with varying κ gm varying the energy diffusion coefficient η e leads to fairly weak responses in κ gm e via modifying the sharpness of the modelled total eddy energy signature e increasing α and decreasing λ or increasing the dissipation time scale λ 1 both lead to increased κ gm consistent with mak et al 2017 see marshall et al 2017 for physical rationalisation leading to decreases in npp again for the aforementioned reasons while the resulting modelled states under the control scenario differ depending on the choice of geom parameters the resulting sensitivities under climate change for fixed choices of α and λ are largely similar in magnitude with a similar decrease in npp again because of the resulting increase in the κ gm value over the northern boundary region although there are no strong constraints on the choice of α and λ but see attempts in poulsen et al 2019 and mak et al 2022a it is at least reassuring that the conclusions regarding the sensitivity under climate change scenarios are robust the sensitivity of the modelled state to the κ gm value at the northern boundary was further supported by results from experiments where κ gm was artificially enhanced suppressed under the climate change scenario via manually modifying the const or geom κ gm profiles in various regions not shown all results are consistent with the fact that increased κ gm at the northern boundary lead to decreased npp for the physical chain of causality detailed above further the results support the notion that geom produces better results in the control scenario because of the spatially varying κ gm but is perhaps over responding under the climate change scenario as suggested in text regarding sensitivity to the isoneutral diffusion for lack of strong evidence to suggest which prescription functions the best we opted to study the simple case of varying the constant diffusion coefficient κ iso table a 3 documents the diagnosed npp in the various scenarios for both the const which are results implicitly reported in the appendix of couespel et al 2021 and geom calculations the general conclusions here are that increasing κ iso leads to increased npp which is consistent with the increased transport of nutrients at least in the lateral direction in the present gyre setting certainly in the control scenario and is suggestive in the climate change scenario the observed sensitivity to κ iso are stronger in the geom case which arises from the nonlinear state dependence of κ gm in the const case κ gm and κ iso are independently prescribed and the resulting modelled states at different κ iso are not so different between the experiments at least from a qualitative point of view and consistent with the conclusions of couespel et al 2021 on the other hand in the geom case increases in κ iso leads to minor differences in the modelled state which leads to changes in the calculated κ gm in this case a decreasing κ gm over the northern boundary region but with only very minor changes elsewhere in terms of the spatial pattern modifying the modelled state leading to an evolving κ gm the claim here is that the changes in the npp we are seeing in geom from changing κ iso arise from a positive feedback loop through its impact on κ gm and resulting changes in the modelled stratification the present nonlinear feedback loop between κ iso the modelled state and κ gm arising from geom should be studied further but is beyond the scope of the present work 
23783,the interannual variability of chlorophyll chl in the tropical pacific ocean is influenced by el niño when el niño occurs insufficient nutrients suppressed upwelling reduced shortwave radiation reaching the surface increased precipitation and eastward zonal current u anomalies which transport low chl from western pacific warm pool water to the east can cause a reduction in tropical pacific chl the el niño induced chl anomaly is asymmetrically distributed across the equator between 10 s and 10 n and is particularly significant in extreme el niño events this asymmetric phenomenon is mainly caused by asymmetrical anomalies of the eastward u and precipitation during el niño events u and precipitation anomalies are much stronger north of the equator which can cause a greater reduction in chl which is asymmetrical models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 are used to evaluate the simulation of the south north asymmetry of chl under extreme el niño events it finds that the simulation of u and precipitation anomalies is the key parameter to the simulation of this asymmetry among 15 cmip6 models that provided chl data only 5 of them miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm can be used to investigate the asymmetrical distribution of chl during extreme el niño after comparison with observational chl among the 5

noresm2 mm 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr show symmetrical distributions from the composite distribution of u and precipitation for these five models it can be seen that the key reasons for whether a model can simulate the asymmetry lies in the simulation of u and precipitation keywords chlorophyll el niño cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the major primary producers of marine ecosystems phytoplankton can influence the global carbon cycle and oxygen production via photosynthesis as well as the cycling of other nutrients behrenfeld et al 2001 chl a proxy for phytoplankton biomass has been widely used to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of biological processes mcclain 2009 primary production and phytoplankton concentration is high in equatorial pacific playing an important role in regulating carbon dioxide in climate system murray et al 1995 by using satellite derived chl data the interannual variability of chl in the tropical pacific ocean is found to be influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso activity which is the strongest interannual variability in the tropical pacific borgne et al 2002 chavez et al 1999 yoder and kennelly 2003 the mechanisms inducing variations in chl concentrations during enso are connected to the parameters that could change the growth of phytoplankton such as light and nutrients during neutral phase of enso stable eastly trade wind keep pushing water to western pacific inducing strong upwelling in eastern pacific strong upwelling can transport nutrient rich deeper water into euphotic zone favoring high primary production in eastern pacific during el niño phases anomalous warming sea surface temperature sst and reduced sea level pressure in central and eastern pacific decrease eastly trade wind and then suppressing upwelling in central and eastern pacific reduction in upwelling decrease upward nutrient transport and therefore reduction in primary productivity in central and eastern pacific chavez et al 2002 turk et al 2011 radenac et al 2013 conversely trade wind enhanced during cold phase of enso la niña leading to stronger upwelling and higher productivity in central and eastern pacific it is well known that chl concentrations are different between the western and eastern pacific therefore anomalies in zonal currents u can also cause chlorophyll changes in the tropical pacific radenac et al 2005 ryan et al 2006 during el niño the eastward u anomaly can transport nutrient and phytoplankton poor water from the western pacific to the east therefore causing a decrease in chl concentration in the central and eastern pacific in addition solar radiation is a key parameter for the growth of phytoplankton park et al 2011 proposed that el niño can enhance the convective instability in the equator and make less radiation down to the sea surface therefore contributing to a decrease in chl however some studies have suggested that the reduction in shortwave radiation caused by el niño does not affect chl concentrations in the tropical pacific because these photosynthetically available light variations are relatively weak they can only have a weak impact on phytoplankton growth radenac et al 2012 therefore it remains uncertain whether the variation in sunlight can have an effect on chl in the tropical pacific el niño events can be classified into different types based on different characteristic based on different intensities of sst warming in the central eastern tropical pacific extreme and moderate el niño have different effect on floods ecosystems and other climatic events chen et al 2018 2020 brainard et al 2018 tong et al 2023 recently it has been demonstrated that el niño events can be classified into two or three types according to the location of the sst warming maximum which show different climatic ashok et al 2007 wang and wang 2013 chen et al 2019 and ecological turk et al 2011 radenac et al 2012 racault et al 2017 impacts therefore the impacts of diversity el niño events on chl need to be further studied the current studies of chl variability were mostly analyzed by satellite data which helps broaden our understanding of the phytoplankton enso relationship however the satellite data can only observe the surface chl and the observational time is relatively short approximately two decades i e 1997 to present few el niño events especially extreme events have been recorded since continuous ocean color measurements via satellites to understand the long term variability in chl there is a need for continuous data at multiple levels over a much longer time the models are able to provide data at longer time scales and subsurface layers therefore allowing the analyses of the variability of chl at different spatial and temporal scales bopp et al 2013 laufkotter et al 2015 stock et al 2014 especially enso wang et al 2005 park et al 2018 the earth system models esms that participate in the

grid by bilinear interpolation the statistical significance of the correlation coefficients regression analysis and composite analysis is estimated according to student s t test an empirical orthogonal function eof is carried out in the study to determine the main variability of some variable fields 3 observed chl variations during el niño events and possible mechanism the mean chl distribution in the tropical pacific and its interannual variation are shown first to illustrate the context fig 1 the mean value was calculated by averaging october november december ond for the period 1997 2020 and all variables used after are calculated by the ond average high values of chl concentration along the central and south american coasts and equatorial upwelling system fig 1a are due to coastal and equatorial strong upwelling bringing cool and nutrient rich subsurface water to the surface despite the especially high nutrient concentration in the equatorial upwelling regions the phytoplankton biomass 1 2 mg m 3 natural log value is less than other nutrient rich region which is constrained by iron limitation and grazing maintenance radenac et al 2012 and is defined as mesotrophic water the mesotrophic water is surrounded by the oligotrophic waters surface chl lower than 0 1 mg m 3 of the western warm pool and the subtropical gyre 3 1 the relationship between chl and enso the interannual chl variability defined as the standard deviation std of chl anomalies is high between 10 s and 10 n showing a maximum value between 160 e 180 e and the eastern pacific region fig 1b empirical orthogonal function eof analysis is conducted for chl in the tropical pacific fig 2 and the spatial distribution of the first mode of eof is similar to the std distribution the first principal component pc1 is closely negatively correlated with the niño 3 4 index sst averaged over 170 w 120 w 5 s 5 n indicating that chl changes in the tropical pacific are mainly caused by enso fig 3 to investigate the mechanisms how el niño events could cause the chl negative anomalies regressions of chl precipitation surface zonal current u and thermocline depth assumed to be the 20 c isotherm depth d20 against pc1 are shown in fig 4 the regression pattern of chl is almost identical to the std distribution representing the main variation in chl fig 4a the regressed sst field suggests el niño like sst warming at the equator fig 4b the warming of sst implies a weakening of upwelling which makes the upward nutrient flux less and therefore causes a decrease in chl additionally d20 deepens in the east pacific caused by the eastward downwelling kelvin wave in the tropical pacific which does not allow much nutrients into the euphotic layer fig 4c both sst and d20 variations reflect a decrease in the upward nutrient flux into the euphotic region causing a reduction in chl during el niño according to previous studies the deepening of d20 covaries with the equatorial undercurrent euc which brings biologically needed iron from the western pacific to the eastern pacific radenac et al 2012 the eastern pacific is an iron limited region and the iron provided by the euc plays an important role in the growth of phytoplankton in this region ryan et al 2006 it can be inferred from the variation in d20 that the euc is deepened in the eastern pacific during el niño events the depression of euc leads to the reduction of iron flux to the surface and therefore affects phytoplankton growth the regressed u field suggests the advection effect of zonal currents in changing the distribution of chl fig 4d during el niño events stronger eastward anomalies are shown in the regressed field as a consequence of westerly wind anomalies that weaken the easterly trade winds from fig 1a chl concentrations in the tropical pacific show significant east west differences from the mean distribution of chl oligotrophic water in the west and mesotrophic water in the east eastward u anomalies can bring nutrient depleted water from the western pacific to the east leading to chl decreases in the central and eastern pacific the regression field of precipitation shows positive anomalies suggesting intensified convection during el niño fig 4e intensified convection can produce more cloudiness shielding the incoming solar radiation down to the sea surface less solar radiation is unfavorable for phytoplankton growth therefore causing a decrease in chl all the factors mentioned above work together to induce a decrease in chl during el niño events 3 2 asymmetrical distribution of chl across the equator in extreme el niño events and possible mechanisms from the time series of pc1 it can be seen that its amplitude is large in the two extreme el niño events 1997 1998 2015 2016 while the other relatively weaker el niño events correspond to a relatively small amplitude of pc1 therefore the different intensities of el niño can significantly affect the magnitude of the chl anomaly in the following studies an el niño event is defined if the 3 month running average sst anomalies in the niño 3 4 region exceed 0 5 c for 5 consecutive months these el niño events are classified into extreme events sst anomaly peak above 2 0 c and moderate sst anomaly peak between 1 and 2 0 c we classified el niño into extreme events 1997 1998 2015 2016 and moderate events 2002 2003 2006 2007 2009 2010 2018 2019 and then compared the spatial distribution of chlorophyll to determine whether there is a difference in spatial distribution there are significant differences in the negative anomaly locations between moderate and extreme events fig 5 in extreme events chl is significantly decreasing within 0 10 n which can reach 120 w while negative anomalies are not as evident within 10 degrees south of the equator fig 5a and e this south north asymmetrical feature is not significant in moderate events only with a narrow band zonal band of negative chl anomalies appearing between 5 n and 10 n and west of 160 w fig 5i the south north asymmetry of chlorophyll anomalies is present in the regression field of chlorophyll in fig 4a to investigate the mechanism that contribute to this south north equatorial asymmetry several parameters sst zonal current precipitation and d20 that can induce chl anomalies are checked the spatial distribution of sst is relatively symmetrical off the equator to the pole from previous regression fields fig 4b indicating depression of upwelling reduced upward nutrient flux is not the main reason for the asymmetry of chl distribution furthermore the composited sst of different el niño intensities shows a symmetrical distribution except for the difference in the intensity of positive anomalies the positive anomalies of sst in both moderate and extreme events are symmetric along the equator south north fig 5b f and j the distribution of d20 is shallowing west of 180 e contributing to the increasement of chl here the deepening of d20 is confined to east of 150 w and is distributed symmetrically cross equator during different intensities of el niño therefore asymmetrical distribution of chl is not caused by d20 anomalies different from sst and d20 the regression fields of zonal currents show significant south north asymmetry fig 4c d the eastward zonal current anomaly is more pronounced north of the equator and is capable of transporting more low chl western pacific warm pool water to the central and eastern pacific fig 4c these results are consistent with studies of radenac et al 2012 which attributed the narrow zonal band of negative chlorophyll anomalies between 5 n and 10 n to the eastward current anomaly radenac et al 2012 present that this feature occurs in cp el niño events while our work suggests that this phenomenon is more relevant to the intensity of el niño the eastward current anomaly is affected by the position of north equatorial current bifurcation which varies during different warming types of el niño wang et al 2020 similar to zonal currents precipitation regression is stronger north of the equator fig 4d and unfavorable for phytoplankton growth and decreases chlorophyll it is indicated that the contribution of shortwave radiation reduction is not negligible which is different from previous studies the regression analysis shows that the asymmetrical anomalies of zonal current and precipitation could work together to induce the asymmetrical distribution of chl the composite zonal current and precipitation anomalies further show that although the south north asymmetry of both parameters exists during el niño events of different intensities the asymmetry is stronger in extreme events which is more unfavorable to chl production fig 5c d g h k l indeed during moderate events zonal current and precipitation anomalies are restricted to the western pacific fig 5k l this is also consistent with the fact that in the moderate event chl has a south north asymmetrical distribution but the asymmetry is relatively weak and only appears in the western pacific zonal current and precipitation anomalies are the two key parameters that cause the asymmetry of chl anomalies in the following section we assess how the chl data provided by 15 cmip6 models behave during el niño events and discuss whether they can simulate the feature of equatorial south north asymmetry of chl anomalies during extreme el niño events 4 evaluations of cmip6 models in simulating the response of chl to el niño events the climatological distribution of chl from cmip6 models and the response of chl to el niño are first evaluated to see if these patterns can depict the most fundamental features of chl variability fig 6 plots the oc cci satellite measured chl during 1997 2020 and the individual model mean values of chl over 1850 2014 all 15 cmip6 models are able to characterize the distribution of chl in the tropical pacific with high chl concentrations in the upwelling zone and low chl concentrations in the subtropical gyre and the western pacific warm pool fig 6 however most of these models largely overestimate the chl concentration over the basin especially over equatorial and coastal upwelling regions biases in biochemistry such as excessive nutrient may contribute to overestimation in chl yool et al 2021 indeed biases also exist in simulating characteristic of the observed el niño events in esms with significant bias in sst simulation zheng et al 2015 jiang et al 2021 the overestimation of chl may result from both physical and biogeochemical biases in the models the eof analyses are carried out for chl averaged over ond in the tropical pacific ocean from 15 cmip6 models fig 7 the spatial distribution of eof1 of each model is compared with that of the observation and it is found that only 7 of them miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr mri esm2 0 noresm2 lm noresm2 mm could capture the main spatial distribution features with significant spatial correlation coefficients among these 7 models gfdl esm4 is not considered in the following study due to the absence of the u variable in the model in addition the 7 preselective models some models have significant spatial correlation coefficients with observational data however the main variation centers of their corresponding eof1 significantly differ from the observations for example the spatial distribution of their eof1 in cesm2 and cesm2 waccm shows an anomaly center in the eastern pacific which distinctly differs from the observational data fig 7d e therefore these models are not considered according to previous study fig 3 pc1 of chl is significantly negatively correlated with the niño 3 4 index in the observational data the correlation coefficients between the pc1 of the models and their corresponding niño 3 4 index are analyzed fig 8 the correlation coefficient between the pc1 of mri esm2 0 and its niño 3 4 index is not significant and thus this model is not considered in the subsequent analysis the following analyses on the simulation of the south north asymmetry of chl during extreme el niño events are carried out by 5 models miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm the average sst in the niño 3 4 region of the five models is calculated and the extreme el niño events corresponding to each of these modes are selected composite analyses of sst chl u and precipitation are carried out based on selected extreme el niño events the distribution of sst composites in the models is the same as that in the observed extreme el niño events with anomalous warming of sst in the eastern pacific and cooling sst in the western pacific fig 9 it is suggested that these five models are able to portray the sst anomalies during extreme el niño events fig 10 shows the composites of chl anomalies of these five models in extreme el niño years the observed analysis shows that the chl in the tropical pacific is lower in the central eastern pacific and that its negative anomaly is asymmetrically distributed south north across the equator in extreme years although all five models can portray the reduction in chl in the tropical pacific during extreme events their spatial distribution still slightly differs from that of the observation fig 10 especially the center of the negative anomalies for example noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm both show negative anomaly centers between 120 90 w south of the equator fig 10d e this negative character is displayed in the eof analyses of these two models fig 7n o however this region is much more stable in the observations the reasons for these differences might be much more complicated to focus our aim on the study the details are not going to be discussed in this study among these 5 models only the chl anomalies of noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm are asymmetrically distributed across the south and north of the equator fig 10d e similar to the observation while the chl anomalies of the other three models miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr are symmetrically distributed fig 10a c based on the observed results fig 4c d the south north asymmetry of chl across the equator during extreme el niño is mainly caused by u and precipitation therefore the distributions of u and precipitation during extreme el niño are composited respectively figs 11 and 12 the composite distributions of the zonal current and precipitation anomalies of noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm during extreme el niño events are more similar to the distribution of these two variables in the observations which can simulate stronger eastward u and positive precipitation north of the equator figs 11d e and 12d e however the simulated oceanic currents and precipitation in the other three models are different from the observational data the eastward u and precipitation anomalies of miroc es2l are symmetrically distributed along the equator figs 11a 12a contributing to the symmetrical distribution of chl the chl values in mpi esm1 2 hr and mpi esm1 2 lr show symmetrical distributions while the reason for this symmetry is different from that in miroc es2l u in mpi esm1 2 hr and mpi esm1 2 lr show equatorial symmetrical eastward anomalies while they are less significant in mpi esm1 2 lr in addition the precipitation anomalies in these two models are confined to the western pacific and do not show anomalies along the equator to the eastern pacific the asymmetry in these two models might be mainly caused by u with less contribution from precipitation however it can be found that the simulation of u and precipitation of the model can both have an important role in simulating the variability of chl indicating that improving the simulation of environmental variable fields is important to improve the simulation of ecological variables 5 summary and discussion the objective of this research is to investigate the response of chl to el niño events in the tropical pacific the interannual variability in chl is found to be affected by el niño chl is significantly decreased in the central and eastern pacific during el niño events the reduction is mainly caused by the suppressed upwelling reduced solar radiation and zonal advection when el niño occurs insufficient nutrients suppressed upwelling reduced shortwave radiation reaching the surface increased precipitation and eastward u anomalies which transport low chl western pacific warm pool water to the east can cause a reduction in tropical pacific chl the low chl concentrations in western pacific warm pool are associated barrier layers that can inhibit the nutrient rich waters from below the thermocline into the surface messié and chavez 2013 the thickness of barrier layers in this region is modulated by enso wang and liu 2016 and how the changes of thickness affect chl need further study the el niño induced chl anomaly is asymmetrically distributed across the equator within 10 degrees of the pole and is particularly significant in extreme el niño events possible mechanisms to explain the asymmetry have been investigated by checking the previous parameters that can induce chl anomalies it is found that this asymmetric phenomenon is mainly caused by asymmetrical anomalies of the eastward u and precipitation sst does not contribute to it because of its symmetrical distribution during el niño events eastward u is stronger north of the equator which can transport more low chl water to the central and eastern pacific precipitation increases and generates more clouds in the north which makes it unfavorable for the growth of phytoplankton the simulation of the south north asymmetry of chl under extreme el niño events in fifteen models from cmip6 are evaluated based on a series of comparisons of basic variability of chl data from models with observational data it is found that only 5 miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm of 15 models can be used to assess this south north equatorial asymmetry after composite analyses of chl sst u and precipitation from these 5 models it is found that the simulation of u and precipitation anomalies is the key to the simulation of chl asymmetry among these 5 models only 2 noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm show asymmetry during extreme el niño events together with asymmetrical u and precipitation distributions the other three models miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr and mpi esm1 2 lr show symmetrical distributions of chl the contributions of u and precipitation in these three models are more complicated and show great differences from the observations the contrast between these 5 models emphasizes the important role of physical processes in simulating the variation in chl the complicated u and precipitation fields of mpi esm1 2 hr and mpi esm1 2 lr indicate that some other processes besides these two variables affect the simulation of chl therefore enhancing the simulation of physical processes is important to improve the simulation of biological processes in the model the present study illustrates that most cmip6 models are still unable to capture the general characteristics of chl in the tropical pacific

23783,the interannual variability of chlorophyll chl in the tropical pacific ocean is influenced by el niño when el niño occurs insufficient nutrients suppressed upwelling reduced shortwave radiation reaching the surface increased precipitation and eastward zonal current u anomalies which transport low chl from western pacific warm pool water to the east can cause a reduction in tropical pacific chl the el niño induced chl anomaly is asymmetrically distributed across the equator between 10 s and 10 n and is particularly significant in extreme el niño events this asymmetric phenomenon is mainly caused by asymmetrical anomalies of the eastward u and precipitation during el niño events u and precipitation anomalies are much stronger north of the equator which can cause a greater reduction in chl which is asymmetrical models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 are used to evaluate the simulation of the south north asymmetry of chl under extreme el niño events it finds that the simulation of u and precipitation anomalies is the key parameter to the simulation of this asymmetry among 15 cmip6 models that provided chl data only 5 of them miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm can be used to investigate the asymmetrical distribution of chl during extreme el niño after comparison with observational chl among the 5 selected models only 2 noresm2 lm noresm2 mm can show asymmetry during extreme el niño events and the other three models miroc es2 l mpi esm1 miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr show symmetrical distributions from the composite distribution of u and precipitation for these five models it can be seen that the key reasons for whether a model can simulate the asymmetry lies in the simulation of u and precipitation keywords chlorophyll el niño cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the major primary producers of marine ecosystems phytoplankton can influence the global carbon cycle and oxygen production via photosynthesis as well as the cycling of other nutrients behrenfeld et al 2001 chl a proxy for phytoplankton biomass has been widely used to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of biological processes mcclain 2009 primary production and phytoplankton concentration is high in equatorial pacific playing an important role in regulating carbon dioxide in climate system murray et al 1995 by using satellite derived chl data the interannual variability of chl in the tropical pacific ocean is found to be influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso activity which is the strongest interannual variability in the tropical pacific borgne et al 2002 chavez et al 1999 yoder and kennelly 2003 the mechanisms inducing variations in chl concentrations during enso are connected to the parameters that could change the growth of phytoplankton such as light and nutrients during neutral phase of enso stable eastly trade wind keep pushing water to western pacific inducing strong upwelling in eastern pacific strong upwelling can transport nutrient rich deeper water into euphotic zone favoring high primary production in eastern pacific during el niño phases anomalous warming sea surface temperature sst and reduced sea level pressure in central and eastern pacific decrease eastly trade wind and then suppressing upwelling in central and eastern pacific reduction in upwelling decrease upward nutrient transport and therefore reduction in primary productivity in central and eastern pacific chavez et al 2002 turk et al 2011 radenac et al 2013 conversely trade wind enhanced during cold phase of enso la niña leading to stronger upwelling and higher productivity in central and eastern pacific it is well known that chl concentrations are different between the western and eastern pacific therefore anomalies in zonal currents u can also cause chlorophyll changes in the tropical pacific radenac et al 2005 ryan et al 2006 during el niño the eastward u anomaly can transport nutrient and phytoplankton poor water from the western pacific to the east therefore causing a decrease in chl concentration in the central and eastern pacific in addition solar radiation is a key parameter for the growth of phytoplankton park et al 2011 proposed that el niño can enhance the convective instability in the equator and make less radiation down to the sea surface therefore contributing to a decrease in chl however some studies have suggested that the reduction in shortwave radiation caused by el niño does not affect chl concentrations in the tropical pacific because these photosynthetically available light variations are relatively weak they can only have a weak impact on phytoplankton growth radenac et al 2012 therefore it remains uncertain whether the variation in sunlight can have an effect on chl in the tropical pacific el niño events can be classified into different types based on different characteristic based on different intensities of sst warming in the central eastern tropical pacific extreme and moderate el niño have different effect on floods ecosystems and other climatic events chen et al 2018 2020 brainard et al 2018 tong et al 2023 recently it has been demonstrated that el niño events can be classified into two or three types according to the location of the sst warming maximum which show different climatic ashok et al 2007 wang and wang 2013 chen et al 2019 and ecological turk et al 2011 radenac et al 2012 racault et al 2017 impacts therefore the impacts of diversity el niño events on chl need to be further studied the current studies of chl variability were mostly analyzed by satellite data which helps broaden our understanding of the phytoplankton enso relationship however the satellite data can only observe the surface chl and the observational time is relatively short approximately two decades i e 1997 to present few el niño events especially extreme events have been recorded since continuous ocean color measurements via satellites to understand the long term variability in chl there is a need for continuous data at multiple levels over a much longer time the models are able to provide data at longer time scales and subsurface layers therefore allowing the analyses of the variability of chl at different spatial and temporal scales bopp et al 2013 laufkotter et al 2015 stock et al 2014 especially enso wang et al 2005 park et al 2018 the earth system models esms that participate in the

negative anomaly locations between moderate and extreme events fig 5 in extreme events chl is significantly decreasing within 0 10 n which can reach 120 w while negative anomalies are not as evident within 10 degrees south of the equator fig 5a and e this south north asymmetrical feature is not significant in moderate events only with a narrow band zonal band of negative chl anomalies appearing between 5 n and 10 n and west of 160 w fig 5i the south north asymmetry of chlorophyll anomalies is present in the regression field of chlorophyll in fig 4a to investigate the mechanism that contribute to this south north equatorial asymmetry several parameters sst zonal current precipitation and d20 that can induce chl anomalies are checked the spatial distribution of sst is relatively symmetrical off the equator to the pole from previous regression fields fig 4b indicating depression of upwelling reduced upward nutrient flux is not the main reason for the asymmetry of chl distribution furthermore the composited sst of different el niño intensities shows a symmetrical distribution except for the difference in the intensity of positive anomalies the positive anomalies of sst in both moderate and extreme events are symmetric along the equator south north fig 5b f and j the distribution of d20 is shallowing west of 180 e contributing to the increasement of chl here the deepening of d20 is confined to east of 150 w and is distributed symmetrically cross equator during different intensities of el niño therefore asymmetrical distribution of chl is not caused by d20 anomalies different from sst and d20 the regression fields of zonal currents show significant south north asymmetry fig 4c d the eastward zonal current anomaly is more pronounced north of the equator and is capable of transporting more low chl western pacific warm pool water to the central and eastern pacific fig 4c these results are consistent with studies of radenac et al 2012 which attributed the narrow zonal band of negative chlorophyll anomalies between 5 n and 10 n to the eastward current anomaly radenac et al 2012 present that this feature occurs in cp el niño events while our work suggests that this phenomenon is more relevant to the intensity of el niño the eastward current anomaly is affected by the position of north equatorial current bifurcation which varies during different warming types of el niño wang et al 2020 similar to zonal currents precipitation regression is stronger north of the equator fig 4d and unfavorable for phytoplankton growth and decreases chlorophyll it is indicated that the contribution of shortwave radiation reduction is not negligible which is different from previous studies the regression analysis shows that the asymmetrical anomalies of zonal current and precipitation could work together to induce the asymmetrical distribution of chl the composite zonal current and precipitation anomalies further show that although the south north asymmetry of both parameters exists during el niño events of different intensities the asymmetry is stronger in extreme events which is more unfavorable to chl production fig 5c d g h k l indeed during moderate events zonal current and precipitation anomalies are restricted to the western pacific fig 5k l this is also consistent with the fact that in the moderate event chl has a south north asymmetrical distribution but the asymmetry is relatively weak and only appears in the western pacific zonal current and precipitation anomalies are the two key parameters that cause the asymmetry of chl anomalies in the following section we assess how the chl data provided by 15 cmip6 models behave during el niño events and discuss whether they can simulate the feature of equatorial south north asymmetry of chl anomalies during extreme el niño events 4 evaluations of cmip6 models in simulating the response of chl to el niño events the climatological distribution of chl from cmip6 models and the response of chl to el niño are first evaluated to see if these patterns can depict the most fundamental features of chl variability fig 6 plots the oc cci satellite measured chl during 1997 2020 and the individual model mean values of chl over 1850 2014 all 15 cmip6 models are able to characterize the distribution of chl in the tropical pacific with high chl concentrations in the upwelling zone and low chl concentrations in the subtropical gyre and the western pacific warm pool fig 6 however most of these models largely overestimate the chl concentration over the basin especially over equatorial and coastal upwelling regions biases in biochemistry such as excessive nutrient may contribute to overestimation in chl yool et al 2021 indeed biases also exist in simulating characteristic of the observed el niño events in esms with significant bias in sst simulation zheng et al 2015 jiang et al 2021 the overestimation of chl may result from both physical and biogeochemical biases in the models the eof analyses are carried out for chl averaged over ond in the tropical pacific ocean from 15 cmip6 models fig 7 the spatial distribution of eof1 of each model is compared with that of the observation and it is found that only 7 of them miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr mri esm2 0 noresm2 lm noresm2 mm could capture the main spatial distribution features with significant spatial correlation coefficients among these 7 models gfdl esm4 is not considered in the following study due to the absence of the u variable in the model in addition the 7 preselective models some models have significant spatial correlation coefficients with observational data however the main variation centers of their corresponding eof1 significantly differ from the observations for example the spatial distribution of their eof1 in cesm2 and cesm2 waccm shows an anomaly center in the eastern pacific which distinctly differs from the observational data fig 7d e therefore these models are not considered according to previous study fig 3 pc1 of chl is significantly negatively correlated with the niño 3 4 index in the observational data the correlation coefficients between the pc1 of the models and their corresponding niño 3 4 index are analyzed fig 8 the correlation coefficient between the pc1 of mri esm2 0 and its niño 3 4 index is not significant and thus this model is not considered in the subsequent analysis the following analyses on the simulation of the south north asymmetry of chl during extreme el niño events are carried out by 5 models miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm the average sst in the niño 3 4 region of the five models is calculated and the extreme el niño events corresponding to each of these modes are selected composite analyses of sst chl u and precipitation are carried out based on selected extreme el niño events the distribution of sst composites in the models is the same as that in the observed extreme el niño events with anomalous warming of sst in the eastern pacific and cooling sst in the western pacific fig 9 it is suggested that these five models are able to portray the sst anomalies during extreme el niño events fig 10 shows the composites of chl anomalies of these five models in extreme el niño years the observed analysis shows that the chl in the tropical pacific is lower in the central eastern pacific and that its negative anomaly is asymmetrically distributed south north across the equator in extreme years although all five models can portray the reduction in chl in the tropical pacific during extreme events their spatial distribution still slightly differs from that of the observation fig 10 especially the center of the negative anomalies for example noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm both show negative anomaly centers between 120 90 w south of the equator fig 10d e this negative character is displayed in the eof analyses of these two models fig 7n o however this region is much more stable in the observations the reasons for these differences might be much more complicated to focus our aim on the study the details are not going to be discussed in this study among these 5 models only the chl anomalies of noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm are asymmetrically distributed across the south and north of the equator fig 10d e similar to the observation while the chl anomalies of the other three models miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr are symmetrically distributed fig 10a c based on the observed results fig 4c d the south north asymmetry of chl across the equator during extreme el niño is mainly caused by u and precipitation therefore the distributions of u and precipitation during extreme el niño are composited respectively figs 11 and 12 the composite distributions of the zonal current and precipitation anomalies of noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm during extreme el niño events are more similar to the distribution of these two variables in the observations which can simulate stronger eastward u and positive precipitation north of the equator figs 11d e and 12d e however the simulated oceanic currents and precipitation in the other three models are different from the observational data the eastward u and precipitation anomalies of miroc es2l are symmetrically distributed along the equator figs 11a 12a contributing to the symmetrical distribution of chl the chl values in mpi esm1 2 hr and mpi esm1 2 lr show symmetrical distributions while the reason for this symmetry is different from that in miroc es2l u in mpi esm1 2 hr and mpi esm1 2 lr show equatorial symmetrical eastward anomalies while they are less significant in mpi esm1 2 lr in addition the precipitation anomalies in these two models are confined to the western pacific and do not show anomalies along the equator to the eastern pacific the asymmetry in these two models might be mainly caused by u with less contribution from precipitation however it can be found that the simulation of u and precipitation of the model can both have an important role in simulating the variability of chl indicating that improving the simulation of environmental variable fields is important to improve the simulation of ecological variables 5 summary and discussion the objective of this research is to investigate the response of chl to el niño events in the tropical pacific the interannual variability in chl is found to be affected by el niño chl is significantly decreased in the central and eastern pacific during el niño events the reduction is mainly caused by the suppressed upwelling reduced solar radiation and zonal advection when el niño occurs insufficient nutrients suppressed upwelling reduced shortwave radiation reaching the surface increased precipitation and eastward u anomalies which transport low chl western pacific warm pool water to the east can cause a reduction in tropical pacific chl the low chl concentrations in western pacific warm pool are associated barrier layers that can inhibit the nutrient rich waters from below the thermocline into the surface messié and chavez 2013 the thickness of barrier layers in this region is modulated by enso wang and liu 2016 and how the changes of thickness affect chl need further study the el niño induced chl anomaly is asymmetrically distributed across the equator within 10 degrees of the pole and is particularly significant in extreme el niño events possible mechanisms to explain the asymmetry have been investigated by checking the previous parameters that can induce chl anomalies it is found that this asymmetric phenomenon is mainly caused by asymmetrical anomalies of the eastward u and precipitation sst does not contribute to it because of its symmetrical distribution during el niño events eastward u is stronger north of the equator which can transport more low chl water to the central and eastern pacific precipitation increases and generates more clouds in the north which makes it unfavorable for the growth of phytoplankton the simulation of the south north asymmetry of chl under extreme el niño events in fifteen models from cmip6 are evaluated based on a series of comparisons of basic variability of chl data from models with observational data it is found that only 5 miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr mpi esm1 2 lr noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm of 15 models can be used to assess this south north equatorial asymmetry after composite analyses of chl sst u and precipitation from these 5 models it is found that the simulation of u and precipitation anomalies is the key to the simulation of chl asymmetry among these 5 models only 2 noresm2 lm and noresm2 mm show asymmetry during extreme el niño events together with asymmetrical u and precipitation distributions the other three models miroc es2 l mpi esm1 2 hr and mpi esm1 2 lr show symmetrical distributions of chl the contributions of u and precipitation in these three models are more complicated and show great differences from the observations the contrast between these 5 models emphasizes the important role of physical processes in simulating the variation in chl the complicated u and precipitation fields of mpi esm1 2 hr and mpi esm1 2 lr indicate that some other processes besides these two variables affect the simulation of chl therefore enhancing the simulation of physical processes is important to improve the simulation of biological processes in the model the present study illustrates that most cmip6 models are still unable to capture the general characteristics of chl in the tropical pacific

96822 corresponding author forecast sensitivity based observation impacts fsoi in an analysis forecast system of the california current system ccs are quantified using an adjoint based approach the analysis forecast system is based on the regional ocean modeling system roms and a 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation approach fsoi was applied to four different metrics of forecast skill that target important features of the ccs circulation along the central california coast a particular focus of the fsoi analysis is the impact of assimilation of measurements of the radial component of surface currents from a network of high frequency hf radars since this is a new data stream in the near real time system considered here on average 50 60 of all observations assimilated into the model yielded improvements in the forecast skill conversely the remaining 40 50 of data degrade the forecasts in line with similar findings in numerical weather prediction systems much of the improvement in forecast skill arises from remotely sensed observations including hf radar data on average only 50 of in situ measurements contribute to a reduction in forecast error this is partly due to the large volume of remote sensing observations compared to in situ observations however in situ observations are an order of magnitude more impactful than remotely sensed data when viewed in terms of the average impact per observation keywords forecast sensitivity based observation impacts fsoi california current 4d var coastal hf radars u s ioos data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the earliest applications of data assimilation in the ocean is that of robinson and leslie 1985 in a quasi geostrophic ocean model configured for a region of the northeast atlantic since this early pioneering effort ocean data assimilation has matured considerably and is now employed routinely at both regional and global scales e g moore et al 2019 for example within u s territorial waters the integrated ocean observing system ioos is an important program that supports real time ocean observing systems data assimilation and forecasting activities to meet the needs of a wide range of stakeholders just as data assimilation in support of operational numerical weather prediction nwp has advanced considerably in recent decades operational ocean data assimilation has been quick to adopt many of the approaches and best practices of nwp for example an essential diagnostic in many current nwp systems is the impact of observations on the predictive skill of the analysis forecast system the so called forecast sensitivity based observation impact fsoi provides quantitative information about the relative contribution of each observation assimilated into the model during the analysis to the skill of the ensuing forecast fsoi as it is generally used in nwp was introduced by langland and baker 2004 hereafter lb and is based on an adjoint approach the approach is based on comparing the skill of two forecasts initialized from two different initial conditions one that benefits from observational information and one that does not as discussed in section 2 the adjoint of the gain matrix is central to quantifying the contribution of each observation to the difference in forecast error between the two forecasts in this way observations that improve or degrade the forecast skill can be identified since the seminal work of lb fsoi has been widely studied and adopted by the nwp community e g errico 2007 trémolet 2008 zhu and gelaro 2008 gelaro and zhu 2009 cardinali 2009 gelaro et al 2010 jung et al 2013 tyndall and horel 2013 cardinali and healy 2014 cardinali 2018 diniz and todling 2020 while the original approach of lb was developed for a 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation approach similar methods have also been developed in nwp for ensemble based data assimilation systems e g liu and kalnay 2008 kunii et al 2012 sommer and weissmann 2016 the traditional approach to computing the impact of an observing system on forecast skill is observing system experiments oses during oses the systematic removal of different observing platforms on the performance of forecast skill is assessed by rerunning the analysis forecast system a computationally demanding approach while fsoi differs from traditional oses collectively they provide complementary information about the efficacy of the observing system e g gelaro and zhu 2009 cardinali 2009 routine monitoring of fsoi provides information about the performance of the data assimilation system and can identify underlying issues with the forecast model such as bias e g cardinali 2009 2018 in addition fsoi provides a quantitative measure of the efficacy of the current observing systems for example gelaro et al 2010 compare the observation impact from a suite of operational models during the observing system research and predictability experiment thorpex a decade long initiative to improve the accuracy of nwp forecasts on the short to medium range for high impact weather events fsoi was used to quantify the impact of different components of the global observing system on forecast skill to provide guidance on future observing system enhancements fsoi from three different nwp models revealed that only 50 of the observations lead to an improvement in forecast skill which falls just short of an empirically derived limit of 60 65 suggested by ehrendorfer 2007 using monte carlo experiments thus an important conclusion from thorpex fsoi is that assimilating more observations rather than less may be better perhaps due to the higher level of redundancy gelaro et al 2010 also highlight the potential ability of adjoint based impact methods for identifying problems with observation quality and data processing and or the assimilation methodology the success and demonstrated value of fsoi in nwp has led to the development of a similar capability in the widely used regional ocean modeling system roms in support of a 4d var data assimilation system to date observation impact work in roms has been almost exclusively confined to the analysis cycle e g moore et al 2011c 2015 2017 iermano et al 2016 powell 2017 kerry et al 2018 levin et al 2020 2021a b he et al 2022 the work documented here is a feasibility study and validation of fsoi in preparation for implementation into several near real time nrt regional ocean analysis forecast systems and follows earlier work by moore et al 2011c our focus is on the california current system ccs which represents the eastern portion of the subtropical and subpolar gyre circulations in the northeast pacific the ccs is an example of an eastern boundary current upwelling environment it is recognized as one of the world s large marine ecosystems lmes of considerable environmental and socio economic importance the ccs derives its name from the california current cc which represents the easternmost portion of the equatorward branch of the north pacific subtropical gyre hickey 1979 1998 checkley and barth 2009 during boreal spring and summer the cc is a coherent feature along the coast of washington and oregon near 40 n the cc is steered offshore by cape mendocino cm a large coastal promontory see fig 2 geographical locations equatorward of cm the cc is less coherent as it becomes unstable exhibiting substantial meandering centurioni et al 2008 amidst a field of energetic mesoscale eddies kelly et al 1998 the alongshore wind conditions near the coast are a significant driving force for the ccs during wintertime the atmospheric circulation in the ne pacific is dominated by the aleutian low pressure system and the associated cyclonic wind field directs ekman transport onshore poleward of cm leading to coastal downwelling and a poleward coastal current equatorward of cm the north pacific high is present year round though with seasonal changes where the associated alongshore winds are upwelling favorable during the spring and summer the aleutian low yields to the north pacific high and upwelling favorable wind conditions exist from the canadian border south to the baja peninsula in addition to the cc other important circulation features develop inshore due to baroclinic mass conservation gill 1982 and poleward pressure gradient forces connolly et al 2014 a poleward return flow develops along the continental slope at a depth of around 600 m this is referred to as the california undercurrent cuc during the peak upwelling seasons of spring and summer the strong cross shore pressure gradients that develop drive an equatorward coastal jet the coastal jet is located within 1 2 baroclinic rossby radii of deformation 30 60 km from the coast and is distinct from the cc checkley and barth 2009 stakeholder needs of the ccs are served by three different regional associations of the u s ioos program these are the southern california coastal ocean observing system sccoos the central and northern california coastal ocean observing system cencoos and the northwest association of networked ocean observing systems nanoos the nrt analysis forecast system described here is run routinely in support of cencoos as described by moore et al 2013 a new observation data stream added recently to the cencoos nrt system provides estimates of surface currents from a network of coastal high frequency hf radars therefore a specific focus of this study will be the impact of hf radar observations on the forecast skill the remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows the approach used to compute the fsoi is described in section 2 in relation to the roms 4d var data assimilation employed in the nrt system the roms and 4d var configurations are detailed in section 3 where the observation data streams are also described the fsoi results are presented in section 4 which provides further information about practical aspects of the approach to fsoi in ocean models fsoi is applied to several different forecast metrics that target specific characteristics of the ccs circulation described above the fsoi information is presented and analyzed in several different ways to highlight the performance features of the data assimilation system and to contrast the relative advantages of various components of the observing system finally a summary and some conclusions are presented in section 5 2 forecast sensitivity based observation impact fsoi following the accepted notation ide et al 1997 we will denote by x t the state vector comprising all ocean grid point values of temperature salinity two horizontal velocity components and sea surface elevation the analysis forecast system considered here is based on 4d var data assimilation so the method used to quantify the observation impacts is described with this in mind that said the schematic in fig 1 illustrates a typical analysis forecast cycle as it is employed here the analysis cycle spans the interval t τ 0 where t 0 corresponds to the current time during the analysis cycle observations from the interval t τ 0 are assimilated into the model using 4d var to compute increments to a background estimate x b τ according to 1 x a τ x b τ b h t hb h t r 1 y h x b where x a τ is the desired analysis y is the vector of observations h is the observation operator which includes the nonlinear model such that h x b represents the time evolving background over the analysis interval sampled at the space time observation locations h is the tangent linear observation operator and includes the tangent linear model h t is the adjoint model forced at the space time observation locations and b and r are the background error covariance matrix and observation error covariance matrix respectively as illustrated in fig 1 the 4d var analysis x a 0 at the current time is used to initialize a forecast represented here by the interval t 0 t f and denoted x f a t this forecast will benefit from the observations assimilated during the analysis cycle at the same time we can also consider a forecast over the same interval that is initialized from the background x b τ in contrast this second forecast denoted by x f b t will not benefit from the most recent observations assimilated during the analysis cycle therefore the difference between the forecast errors in x f a t and x f b t can be used as a basis for quantifying the so called forecast sensitivity based observation impact fsoi this paradigm underpins routine monitoring of observation impacts on forecast skill at many operational nwp centers e g https ios jcsda org the approach used here follows that originally described by lb which is based on the earlier work of baker and daley 2000 suppose that x t represents the true ocean state at forecast time t f the forecast error e can then be quantified according to 2 e x f x t t c x f x t where c is a weight matrix for example suppose c is a diagonal matrix with elements equal to 1 corresponding to all surface temperature grid points and zero elsewhere in that case e represents the sum of the squared errors in sea surface temperature sst forecast error metrics of the form 2 are commonly used in operational nwp and oceanography the difference in the forecast errors of x f a t f and x f b t f can then be expressed as 3 δ e x f a t f x t t c x f a t f x t x f b t f x t t c x f b t f x t e a e b of course the true state vector x t will never be known so it is customary to compute the forecast error e relative to the new analysis valid at forecast time t f this is often referred to as the verifying analysis and will be denoted as x a t f in which case 3 becomes 4 δ e x f a t f x a t f t c x f a t f x a t f x f b t f x a t f t c x f b t f x a t f in the case where δ e 0 the error in the forecast initialized from the 4d var analysis is lower than the error in the forecast initialized from the background which indicates that the forecast has benefited from the assimilation of observations during the analysis cycle i e e a e b conversely cases where δ e 0 indicate that the assimilation of observations during the analysis cycle have degraded the skill of the forecast i e e a e b following lb the forecast error difference δ e can be approximated by 5 δ e x f a t f x f b t f t 1 2 e a x f a e b x f b the gradients e a x f a and e b x f b at forecast time t f can be mapped back to the analysis time t τ using the adjoint model to yield e a x a t τ and e b x b t τ in which case 6 δ e x a τ x b τ t 1 2 e a x a t τ e b x b t τ 7 δ e d t k t 1 2 e a x a t τ e b x b t τ where 7 follows from 1 d y h x b is the innovation vector and k b h t hb h t r 1 is the gain matrix the impact of the observations on the forecast skill can then be evaluated using 7 errico 2007 showed that 7 is in fact a 3rd order accurate linear approximation which using 2 and 4 can be written as 8 δ e d t k t m t m b t c x f b t f x a t f m a t c x f a t f x a t f where m t is the adjoint model linearized about the background x b t during the analysis cycle t τ 0 m b t is the adjoint model linearized about the forecast x f b t during the forecast cycle t 0 t f and m a t is the adjoint model linearized about the forecast x f a t during the forecast cycle t 0 t f it is generally recognized that the 3rd order approximation 8 performs best in operational nwp systems gelaro et al 2007 as noted by lb δ e given by 8 represents the dot product of the innovation vector d with a second vector g k t m t m b t c x f b t f x a t f m a t c x f a t f x a t f since both d and g span the observation space and each element of d is uniquely associated with an individual observation y i the products d i g i represent the contribution aka impact of each observation to the change in forecast error δ e the observations for which d i g i 0 are associated with improvements in the forecast skill while observations for which d i g i 0 correspond to observations that degrade the forecast skill inspection of 8 shows that calculation of δ e requires three integrations of the adjoint model one initialized by c x f b t f x a t f a second initialized by c x f a t f x a t f and a third initialized by the sum of these two integrations in each case the adjoint model is linearized about a different state as indicated above daescu 2009 has explored how errors in the verifying analysis also referred to as self analysis can adversely influence the observation impacts resulting from 8 furthermore recent studies in nwp indicate that observation impacts relative to the verifying analysis can lead to overestimates of the actual impacts e g privé et al 2020 therefore an alternative approach is also employed to compute the observation impacts relative to observations e g neckler et al 2018 cardinali 2018 in this case the forecast error at time t f is computed relative to independent observations before they are assimilated into the model where e a and e b are now given by 9 e a b y f a b y f t c y f a b y f where y f is the vector of independent observations available at the forecast time t f the vectors y f a and y f b are the forecasts x f a and x f b sampled at the same space time locations as the observations y f and c is a weight matrix now in the observation space the forecast error difference δ e e a e b to 3rd order in this case is given by 10 δ e d t k t m t h b t c y f b y f h a t c y f a y f where h a and h b are the appropriate tangent linear observation operators as noted in section 1 roms 4d var underpins the ccs analysis forecast system that is considered here in roms the analysis increments δ x x a τ x b τ in 1 are identified using an incremental formulation of 4d var courtier et al 1994 specifically as described by gürol et al 2014 the gain matrix k in 1 is evaluated iteratively using the lanczos formulation of the conjugate gradient cg method according to 11 k k m b h t v m t m 1 v m t hb h t r 1 where v m is the matrix of m normalized cg search directions aka lanczos vectors arising from m inner loop iterations and t m v m t hb h t r 1 hb h t i v m therefore if the lanczos vector matrices v m are archived during each 4d var analysis cycle k t k m t in 8 and 10 can be readily computed from 11 as discussed by trémolet 2008 3 ccs analysis forecast system as noted in section 1 the cencoos nrt analysis forecast system is based on roms roms is a free surface hydrostatic ocean model that uses stretched terrain following coordinates in the vertical and generalized orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in the horizontal haidvogel et al 2008 such a coordinate system allows for increased resolution where needed such as in areas with complex bathymetry or in the thermocline and bottom boundary layers roms uses a split explicit time stepping scheme to solve the primitive equations of momentum where there is coupling between barotropic and baroclinic modes shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the roms configuration used here is shown in fig 2 and has a horizontal resolution of 1 10 th degree 10 km there are 42 terrain following σ levels in the vertical with 7 100 m resolution in deep water and 0 3 8 m resolution on the continental shelf the efficacy of the non data assimilative model solutions has been quantified by veneziani et al 2009a the model is forced at the surface by fluxes of momentum heat and freshwater derived from the coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps hodur et al 2002 doyle et al 2009 the naval research laboratory monterey has configured coamps for the ccs and its present triply nested 36 12 4 km configuration with highest resolution along the central california coast is run operationally at the fleet numerical meteorological and oceanography center constrained by 4d var data assimilation atmospheric model properties e g wind specific humidity air temperature 2 m above the surface are converted to air sea fluxes using roms atmospheric boundary layer bulk flux parameterizations the roms open boundaries are constrained by a 1 1 2 º global data assimilation product from hycom based on the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system and 3d var cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 the current version of the nrt system does not include the influence of tides or rivers the roms configuration shown in fig 2 has an extensive history of 4d var data assimilation e g broquet et al 2009a b 2011 moore et al 2011a b c 2013 and has also been used to compute a sequence of re analyses spanning several decades neveu et al 2016 and for biogeochemical data assimilation e g song et al 2016 mattern et al 2017 observations are assimilated from a variety of different remote sensing and in situ platforms the various data streams are summarized in table 1 and include sea surface temperature sst and sea surface height ssh derived from satellite remote sensing estimates of radial surface currents from coastal high frequency hf radars and in situ measurements of temperature t and salinity s from ocean gliders and free drifting profiling argo floats the sst ssh and in situ observations were thinned in space and time prior to assimilation by forming super observations so that no more than one observation of a given type was assimilated into a model grid cell during a 1 h window the hf radar observations of the radial component of velocity extend to 200 km offshore and were thinned by first applying a 25 h moving average to minimize the tidal signal the resulting averaged data were sub sampled once per day the daily sub sampled data were assimilated into the model with no spatial thinning the period considered here is jan 2018 jan 2020 and the duration of each 4d var analysis cycle in fig 1 was chosen to be 4 days the volume of data assimilated is relatively uniform from cycle to cycle and the mean and standard deviation of the number of observations assimilated during each 4 day window is indicated in table 1 the most abundant observations are those from the hf radar network and satellite derived sst as described in moore et al 2011a the background error covariance matrix b in 1 is modeled using the diffusion operator approach of weaver and courtier 2001 in the current formulation the error correlations are assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous in the horizontal while the error covariances do not vary in time during a single analysis cycle they vary seasonally the standard deviations of the background error are based on the climatological variance and computed from a long roms simulation without data assimilation the exception is for salinity where the background error variance was capped at 0 01 the horizontal decorrelation length for the background errors was assumed to be 50 km for all state variables a 30 m decorrelation length was adopted in the vertical for all state variables except for salinity where 100 m was used a quality control check on the observations based on the background was performed following andersson and järvinen 1999 the innovation d i associated with each observation was compared to the expected standard error based on the variance of the errors in the background σ b 2 and the observations σ o 2 specifically if d i 2 α 2 σ b 2 σ o 2 then the observation was rejected and not included in the analysis the threshold parameter α 4 was used for all observation types assimilated here the observation error covariance matrix r was assumed to be diagonal the nominal combined instrument error and error of representativeness standard deviations assigned to each observation type are summarized in the last column of table 1 in practice following the calculation of super observations the nominal errors were augmented by the variance of the observations within a grid box based on the expected standard error based on previous experience the current nrt 4d var system employs one outer loop and nine inner loops the control vector comprises only the model initial conditions x a τ in 1 this configuration represents a compromise between a satisfactory reduction of the 4d var cost function and the computational time required to perform the analysis and forecast in real time on the computer systems available the analysis at the end of each 4d var analysis cycle in fig 1 becomes the background at the start of the subsequent analysis cycle in this way the 4d var system was cycled every 4 days for the period jan 2018 jan 2020 4 forecast observation impacts 4 1 the fsoi procedure the procedure used here to compute the fsoi closely parallels that employed in nwp as outlined in fig 1 as noted in section 3 the surface fluxes of heat momentum and freshwater are computed using a bulk flux formulation and atmospheric fields near the surface however the surface heat flux and surface wind stress depend on sst therefore care must be taken to ensure that the surface fluxes applied during forecasts x f a and x f b in fig 1 are identical despite differences in sst otherwise differences in the forecast error will result from differences in the surface boundary conditions ideally the lateral open boundary conditions used during both forecasts should also be identical for the same reasons in the roms configuration employed here a combination of a radiation condition and nudging to the hycom boundary fields described in section 3 was applied to the 3 dimensional fields of temperature salinity and both components of horizontal velocity in addition the chapman 1985 boundary conditions were applied to sea surface height while the vertically integrated flow is subject to the flather 1976 condition as a result of this combination of lateral open boundary conditions the boundary values during the forecast x f a and x f b will not be identical however as demonstrated by veneziani et al 2009b the circulation away from the open boundaries and adjacent to the coast is relatively insensitive to changes in the open boundary conditions data assimilation experiments using 4d var by moore et al 2011c in which the lateral open boundary conditions are adjusted as part of the control vector also demonstrate that the model state estimates are insensitive to boundary adjustments therefore despite the inevitable differences that will arise between the boundary fields during x f a and x f b we are confident that these differences will exert a relatively small influence on the forecast skill this is borne out by the time series of the forecast metrics discussed in section 4 2 similar issues related to lateral open boundary conditions present themselves in regional nwp models e g amerault et al 2013 kim and kim 2021 therefore with these issues in mind the fsoi calculations proceed in the following way 1 x f a is first computed using the 4d var analysis as the initial condition and surface flux boundary conditions computed in the usual way using the bulk flux formulation the surface fluxes are archived frequently in this case every hour 2 x f a is then computed a second time using prescribed surface fluxes from the archived fluxes from step 1 linearly interpolated in time the forecast differences in x f a calculated from steps 1 and 2 were found to be very small not shown 3 x f b was initialized from the 4d var background and using the surface fluxes archived from step 1 linearly interpolated in time as in step 2 the forecasts x f a and x f b then form the basis for the fsoi calculations the open boundary conditions imposed are identical during steps 1 2 and 3 unless otherwise indicated the forecast interval is 4 days the forecast error metrics given by 2 or 9 were computed as the average forecast error during the last 24 h of the forecast i e midnight on forecast day 3 to midnight on forecast day 4 indicated by the verification interval in fig 1 while the expressions for the fsoi in 8 and 10 are valid for forecast errors evaluated at a single time they can be easily generalized to time averaged errors e g see moore et al 2011c 4 2 forecast error metrics users and stakeholders of regional ocean analyses and forecasts have a wide range of interests and needs therefore fsoi information based on different and specifically targeted metrics is generally of interest with this in mind we consider here four different metrics focused on the unique attributes of the eastern boundary current and upwelling dynamics of the ccs 4 2 1 coastal sst variations in sst along the u s west coast are an important and characteristic feature of the ccs circulation here we focus specifically on the central california region and consider a forecast error metric based on the mean squared error mse in sst denoted e s s t this error is computed from sst observations according to 9 where the matrix of weights c targets all of the observation points in the region indicated in fig 2 between cape mendocino 40 4 n cm and point conception 34 4 n hereafter pc extending from the coast to 250 km offshore this region is characterized by variability on a wide range of time scales from sub seasonal to decadal in addition there is considerable spatial heterogeneity associated with the presence of mesoscale eddies fronts and meanders as well as localized regions of strong upwelling and downwelling particularly in the lee of major coastal promontories as such sst in this region is an important predictive variable for models of the distribution and population of some commercial fish stocks and is of interest in support of fisheries management e g scales et al 2017 santora et al 2020 fig 3a shows the time series of e s s t a and e s s t b for the jan 2018 jan 2020 period considered here as noted in section 4 1 the forecast duration is 4 days and the forecast errors are computed as an average over the last 24 h of the forecast in general data assimilation reduces the forecast error as measured by this metric this is further illustrated in fig 3b which shows a time series of δ e s s t e s s t a e s s t b for the same period computed directly from the nonlinear model forecasts x f a and x f b in general δ e s s t 0 for most analysis forecast cycles indicating that assimilation of observations improves the forecast skill for sst the largest reduction in error equivalent to 1 3 c occurs during the spring and summer upwelling seasons and fig 3a indicates that this represents a factor of 2 3 drop in error compared to e s s t b data assimilation has little impact on the forecast skill as quantified by this metric during fall and winter months fig 3b also shows a time series of δ e s s t based on the 3rd order linear approximation 10 there is generally excellent agreement between the linear approximation of δ e s s t and that computed directly from the nonlinear model forecasts which attests to the efficacy of the tangent linear approximation on which the fsoi calculations are predicated 4 2 2 surface currents surface currents in the coastal region are also highly variable and reflect the presence of a variety of important circulation features including mesoscale eddies meanders jets and the passage of coastally trapped waves therefore a second metric considered here is the mse of surface velocity denoted e v computed from observed surface current estimates derived from the coastal hf radar network the coastal hf radar antennae sites are shown below in fig 5a during the last 24 h of the forecast cycle in this case the matrix of weights c in 9 targeted all of the observation points in the same central california coast target region used for the sst metric in section 4 2 1 and indicated in fig 2 this particular metric is of interest because hf radial observations of surface currents from the u s west coast network are a very recent addition to the cencoos nrt analysis forecast system and validation of their impact on the system is ongoing it is noteworthy however that hf radial observations have been used for some time in the pacific islands ocean observing system pacioos nrt system souza et al 2014 partridge et al 2019 fig 3c shows the time series of e v a and e v b and similar to e s s t exhibits a pronounced seasonal cycle with the largest errors in the surface velocities during late spring and summer data assimilation reduces the error by 25 as illustrated in fig 3d which shows the time series of δ e v computed directly from x f a and x f b and using the tangent linear approximation 10 again δ e v is generally negative throughout indicating that data assimilation reduces forecast error of surface currents by the equivalent 5 10 cm s 1 as in the case of sst errors there is a pronounced seasonal cycle in δ e v with the largest forecast improvements following data assimilation during the spring and summer months in this case too the tangent linear approximation 10 reliably reproduces the temporal behavior of δ e v 4 2 3 alongshore transport alongshore transport is essential for the redistribution of water masses within the ccs the ccs comprises a complicated system of currents that include the equatorward cc the poleward cuc and during the onset of upwelling a nearshore equatorward coastal jet as described in section 1 alongshore exchange is also associated with the passage of eddies and coastally trapped waves therefore a metric that quantifies the forecast skill in estimates of alongshore transport is also of interest here we consider the transport along a vertical zonal section at 37 n from the coast to 125 w and from the surface to 500 m depth or to the bottom if shallower as indicated in fig 2 this section is representative of other latitudes along the central california coast there are no routine direct observations of transport so in this case the mse denoted e 37 n in forecasts of transport at 37 n was computed relative to a verifying analysis according to 3 over the last 24 h of the forecast cycle in this case c h h t where h is a vector such that h t x f t is the transport forecast along the 37 n section broquet et al 2011 have demonstrated that 4d var estimates can effectively capture the observed mean geostrophic circulation along the 37 n section so the assumption here is that the 4d var verifying analyses provide meaningful estimates of the alongshore transport variations with this in mind fig 3e shows the time series of e 37 n a and e 37 n b and reveals substantial reductions in forecast error due to data assimilation when measured against the verifying analysis the time series of δ e 37 n e 37 n a e 37 n b computed directly from the nonlinear forecasts and based on the tangent linear approximation 8 are shown in fig 3f the errors in the transport forecasts are reduced by data assimilation by the equivalent 1 2 sv although there are no noticeable seasonal variations in this case fig 3f shows that δ e 37 n is also described well by 8 4 2 4 upwelling transport coastal upwelling and downwelling exert a profound influence on the ccs and its associated marine ecosystems however direct observations of vertical velocity in the ocean present a considerable challenge traditionally indirect estimates of vertical transport on the continental shelf have been based on surface wind stress e g bakun 1973 as such estimates of vertical transport in coastal regions that are indirectly informed by ocean observations even if relatively uncertain are of considerable interest e g jacox et al 2014 2018 therefore we will consider the mse denoted e w in vertical transport estimates evaluated at a depth of 40 m in the nearshore coastal region shown in fig 2 in this case also e w was computed relative to the verifying analysis as an average over the last 24 h of the forecast cycle where c h h t and h is a vector such that h t x f t is the total vertical transport over the target area the time series of e w a e w b and δ e w e w a e w b computed from the nonlinear model forecasts and based on the tangent linear approximation are shown in fig 3g and h in this case the results are somewhat mixed while during many forecast cycles the change in error is close to zero on average δ e w 0 see also fig 4d below furthermore similar to the alongshore transport δ e w exhibits no apparent seasonal dependence and is in the range equivalent to 0 2 0 3 sv 4 3 observation impacts 4 3 1 the impact of individual platforms as described in section 2 the change in forecast error δ e due to assimilating the observations and given by 8 or 10 can be partitioned into the contribution from each observation here we consider the collective contribution aka impact to δ e of subsets of different types of observations fig 4 shows the time series of δ e for the four metrics described in section 4 2 partitioned according to the impact of each observation type during each analysis forecast cycle the mean observation impact of each observation type for all analysis forecast cycles is also in fig 4 not surprisingly sst observations have the largest impact on δ e s s t fig 4a with hf radar observations of radial surface currents in second place in situ temperature and salinity observations have an approximately equal impact overall and ssh observations have the least influence in the case of δ e v fig 4b hf radial data account for about 40 of the impact in contrast the impact of the remaining observations is approximately equally partitioned although leaning in favor of in situ salinity the situation is similar for δ e 37 n fig 4c hf radial observations are similarly most impactful on δ e w while observations of ssh on average degrade the forecast skill based on this metric fig 4d in all cases there is a general consensus between the average impact of the different observation types on forecast skill during each analysis forecast cycle i e during each cycle all data types on average either decrease or increase the forecast error given the significant impact that hf radar observations of surface currents have on forecast skill as measured by all metrics fig 5 shows time series of the impact of observations from individual antennae the impacts are color coded from blue to red moving along the coast from north to south fig 5 indicates that in general hf radar sites at all latitudes along the coast impact the forecast skill of the circulation features represented by each metric the relationship between the innovation d i i e observation minus background and the impact associated with each observation is also of interest since it provides information about the system performance also explored further in section 4 3 3 to illustrate fig 6 shows binned scatter plots of the impact of individual observations on δ e 37 n versus the innovation for all analysis forecast cycles for each observation type also shown in fig 6 is the percentage of observations that fall within each quadrant of the scatter plots when interpreted as contingency diagrams in general observations with a small innovation i e where the background agrees well with the observation have a small impact on forecast errors in 37 n transport conversely observations with larger innovations span a wide range of impacts except for in situ temperature the observations are approximately equally divided between positive and negative innovations indicating no significant biases in the model or observations in the case of in situ temperature a clear bias toward positive innovations indicates a tendency for a cold bias in the model in accordance with figs 4 and 5 the negative impacts associated with individual observations i e that contribute to an improvement in the forecast skill are generally larger than the positive impacts fig 6 also shows that the most heavily populated bins lie close to the abscissa indicating that a significant fraction of the observations have a minimal impact on forecast skill even though fig 6 suggest that the cumulative impact of all observations improves forecast skill this does not mean that the majority of observations contribute to this improvement table 2 shows the percentage of all observations of a particular type that enhance the forecast skill i e δ e 0 and that degrade forecast i e δ e 0 for each forecast skill metric in the case of δ e 37 n shown in fig 6 most sst ssh and hf radar observations improve the forecast in contrast in the case of in situ temperature and salinity approximately half of the observations degrade the forecast the same trends can be seen for δ e s s t and δ e v in the case of δ e w only about 50 of the remote sensing observations yield an improvement in forecast skill while the majority of in situ observations degrade the forecast skill it should be noted that while the percentage differences are significant they are generally not overwhelming in favor of one outcome or another 4 3 2 spatial variations in observation impacts to illustrate the spatial variations in the impact of the observations on forecast skill fig 7 shows the mean impact of hf radial observations that fall within each surface grid cell of the model over all analysis forecast cycles while observations that fall within the target regions have the largest impact in the case of δ e s s t δ e v and δ e w the impact varies considerably between sites for instance observations from the ucsb radar sites in the vicinity of point conception 34 4 n see fig 2 for the antennae locations see fig 5a have some of the largest impacts on these three metrics cf fig 7a b and d however radar sites remote from the target regions also exert considerable influence on the forecast skill as measured by all four metrics in particular fig 7 shows that hf radar data from the southern california bight plays an important role in reducing the forecast error of the circulation along the central california coast this indicates how information from observations downstream in the ccs can influence the forecast skill of the circulation upstream via the propagation of information backwards in time i e upstream in the adjoint model in the case of δ e 37 n fig 7c information from both upstream and downstream of the target vertical section has greater impact than observations along the transport section itself these results illustrate the complexity of the flow of information within the analysis forecast system the spatial distributions of the impacts of sst and in situ hydrographic observations on δ e s s t averaged over all analysis forecast cycles are shown in fig 8 on average sst observations everywhere in the domain reduce forecast error although as expected sst data in the target area have the largest impact fig 8a these results show that sst upstream along the coast of northern california oregon and washington also improve the efficacy of sst forecasts along the central california coast as described in section 3 in situ observations are available from gliders and argo floats and the individual transects and trajectories of each are apparent in fig 8b and c while most observations from the glider lines lead to improvements a notable exception as revealed in fig 8b is that temperature data from the glider transects originating near monterey bay labelled g degrade the forecast skill of sst in this region in contrast salinity observations along the same line lower the forecast error fig 8c on the other hand temperature observations along this line yield improvements in forecast skill for the other metrics considered not shown as in section 4 3 1 fsoi indicates that in general around one half of the in situ observations assimilated into the model during the analysis cycle subsequently degrade forecast skill fig 8b represents one example where on average temperature observations along the glider line g degrade forecasts of sst along the central ca coast to explore this further fig 9 shows a binned scatter diagram of the impact on δ e s s t versus innovation for all temperature observations from the monterey bay glider line g fig 9 reveals two important features first 64 of the observations are associated with positive innovations recalling that the innovation d i for each observation y i in 1 is defined as the observation minus the background fig 9 indicates the presence of cold bias in the modeled ocean temperatures along this line this is a known issue of the model particularly during upwelling season as identified by veneziani et al 2009a and broquet et al 2009a second some 28 of temperature observations are associated with δ e i 0 and d i 0 the quadrant that is clearly anomalous with respect to the extent to which some of the observations degrade forecasts of sst in particular a distinct group of observations clusters along the 45 line in the upper right hand quadrant which degrades forecast skill based on a similar experience in nwp e g cardinali 2009 it seems likely that the disproportionate adverse impact of these data on forecast skill is associated with the cold bias in the vicinity of the glider line thus fig 9 also serves as an example of how fsoi can be used to monitor the efficacy of data streams within the assimilation system to identify the detrimental effects of bias and potential issues related to data processing and the data assimilation procedure 4 3 3 observation rankings and system performance as discussed in section 4 3 1 while many observations assimilated in the model increase the forecast skill a significant fraction also degrade the forecast experience in nwp has demonstrated that for a well tuned forecast model approximately half of the observations degrade the forecast skill e g gelaro et al 2010 lorenc and marriott 2014 argue that this situation can arise due to the combined influence of growing modes errors in the observations and errors in the verifying analysis the relative rankings of the total impact of observations from each platform on forecast skill are summarized in fig 10 for the four metrics while the platform associated with the largest number of observations generally has the greatest impact on forecast skill fig 10 shows that this is not the only factor controlling the impact of data from a particular platform for example in all cases in situ observations have a significant impact despite the relatively small number of these data compared to remote sensing generally observations from the glider lines cf fig 8 have the largest impact of all platforms that provide subsurface observations for all but one of the forecast metrics the total impact of all observations of a particular type is to reduce the forecast error the exception is the case of ssh observations which on average degrade forecasts of the upwelling transport fig 10e the reason for this is not well understood and requires further investigation given the apparent disparity in the number of observations from each platform assimilated into the model during a 4d var cycle it is illuminating to quantify the average impact on forecast skill of a single observation from each platform with this in mind table 3 shows the mean observation impact per datum i e the average impact per observation denoted α p associated with each type of observation p for the four forecast skill metrics values of α were computed separately for observations that reduce forecast error α p and for observations that increase forecast error α p table 3 indicates that for all metrics the impact per datum of in situ observations of temperature and salinity on forecast skill is typically an order of magnitude greater than that for other observation types however the relative impact of the remote sensing observations varies between metrics for example for δ e s s t a single observation of sst has approximately the same impact on forecast skill as an observation of ssh or surface radial velocity on the other hand for δ e 37 n an ssh observation has almost three times the impact of a radial velocity observation and five times the impact of an sst observation in the case of α p in addition for all observation types and metrics the impact per datum is larger in cases where the data improve the forecast α p compared to cases where the data degrade the forecast α p this is consistent with the general tendency illustrated in the scatter plot histograms of fig 6 where the negative impacts i e observations that reduce the forecast error are typically larger than the positive impacts i e observations that increase the forecast error another valuable indicator of analysis forecast system performance is the mean impact of the different observation types during each inner loop of the 4d var analysis fig 11 shows an example for the forecast metric e 37 n averaged over all analysis forecast cycles the mean impact is negative during all inner loops indicating that at all stages of the 4d var analysis on average the observations contribute to improvements in the forecast skill during the initial 3 or 4 inner loops fig 11 shows that the mean impact of hf radar observations and sst are comparable however beyond inner loop 4 the impact of sst observations levels off while that of the hf radar data continues to yield further reductions in forecast error by the end of the 4d var analysis cycle the mean impact of sst ssh and in situ observations is similar and collectively has approximately the same impact as hf radar data while the impact of the sst observations displays signs of an asymptote to a near constant value the impact of hf radar observations and to a lesser extent ssh and in situ data exhibit a continued downward trend indicating that there is still additional useful forecast information that can be mined from these data during 4d var 5 summary and discussion an adjoint based fsoi procedure similar to that used in operational nwp has been applied in roms configured for the ccs the roms ccs configuration is currently used in conjunction with 4d var to compute nrt ocean analyses and forecasts for the u s west coast circulation in support of the cencoos regional association of u s ioos the fsoi system described here is a prototype that is currently being transitioned to several ioos nrt systems in the roms ccs system four different metrics of forecast skill were considered that target other important processes and circulation features specifically we have considered metrics based on the mse of central ca sst and surface velocity measured relative to independent observations i e before these observations are assimilated and the mse in alongshore upper ocean transport at 37 n and central ca nearshore upwelling transport both measured relative to a verifying analysis the fsoi approach employed here is predicated on several tangent linear approximations that are generally valid in all cases while the number of observations from a particular platform is an important factor in controlling the impact of these observations on forecast skill this is not always the case in the experiments reported here the distribution of observation by type is 51 hf radar 38 sst 7 ssh and 4 in situ thus hf radar observations of radial surface currents significantly influence all of the forecast metrics radial velocity observations from hf radars are a new data stream in the cencoos nrt system considered here because the radial beams converge on the antenna the observation density increases rapidly with decreasing distance from the coast while no effort was made to spatially thin the hf radar observations to overcome the high data density on average just over half of all observations assimilated are from the radar network the authors are aware that thinning of hf radar observations is required to offset the effects of correlated observation errors and matranga 2021 has reported on some potential approaches in the nrt system on average only 49 61 of all observations combined contribute to a reduction in forecast error the remaining 39 51 of observations degrade the forecast which is consistent with experience in nwp gelaro et al 2010 when viewed in terms of each platform 49 67 of remote sensing observations including hf radar reduce forecast errors compared to only 42 53 in the case of in situ observations of temperature and salinity therefore even though further thinning of hf radar observations and other remote sensing data is probably warranted a case can also be made for less thinning in line with the experience and conclusions of thorpex that assimilating a larger number of potentially redundant observations rather than fewer observations may be better gelaro et al 2010 more research is clearly needed to resolve the relative importance of the various competing factors at play an interesting question that of course arises is whether there is more to be gained by eliminating the data from the 4d var analysis cycle that are detrimental to the forecast skill recent studies by chen and kalnay 2019 2020 have explored this idea in the context of nwp while on aggregate remotely sensed observations have the largest impact on forecast skill the average impact of a single observation varies considerably across platforms when viewed in this way hf radar sst and ssh observations all exhibit a similar fsoi per datum within about a factor of 2 while the fsoi per datum for in situ observations is typically an order of magnitude higher similar results have been reported for the observation impacts during analysis cycles in the same system moore et al 2018 and other roms and 4d var configurations levin et al 2020 2021a b interestingly regardless of observation type the magnitude of the fsoi per datum is significantly higher for observations that reduce forecast error than for observations that degrade the forecasts the reason for this disparity is not fully understood and requires further investigation another issue that requires further exploration is the influence of lateral boundary conditions and surface fluxes on forecast skill and fsoi a recent study by kim and kim 2021 has demonstrated that in a regional nwp model forecast skill and fsoi can be significantly influenced by the treatment of the open boundaries while it is certainly true that forecasts in regional nwp models are strongly influenced by conditions imposed at the open boundaries the same cannot generally said for regional ocean models because of the different spatio temporal characteristics of the ocean experience with the ccs roms configuration considered here has shown that the circulation away from the open boundaries and adjacent to the coast is relatively insensitive to variations in the open boundary values veneziani et al 2009b moore et al 2011c therefore we feel confident that the fsoi approach applied here is sound however the same approach may not perform so well in other regions and or dynamical regimes and further study is needed the issue of the influence of ocean surface forcing on forecast skill has been side stepped in the present study by purposely imposing the same surface fluxes of heat momentum and freshwater on the forecasts initialized from the analysis and background ocean state estimates this has important practical advantages for the adjoint sensitivity based fsoi approach that we are advocating for here however we appreciate that differences in surface forcing derived from the bulk formulae resulting from updated sst estimates arising from data assimilation could also appreciably impact the forecast skill compared to the direct information from the observations alone this is a topic that also requires further exploration nonetheless these issues aside this study indicates that fsoi can also be a useful tool for monitoring the efficacy of data streams within the assimilation system to identify the detrimental effects of bias and potential issues related to data processing and data assimilation furthermore trends in the average impact of each observation platform during the inner loops suggest the potential for extracting additional information from hf radar observations during 4d var that will be beneficial to the skill of the forecasts this will be explored in a future study credit

analysis forecast system is based on the regional ocean modeling system roms and a 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation approach fsoi was applied to four different metrics of forecast skill that target important features of the ccs circulation along the central california coast a particular focus of the fsoi analysis is the impact of assimilation of measurements of the radial component of surface currents from a network of high frequency hf radars since this is a new data stream in the near real time system considered here on average 50 60 of all observations assimilated into the model yielded improvements in the forecast skill conversely the remaining 40 50 of data degrade the forecasts in line with similar findings in numerical weather prediction systems much of the improvement in forecast skill arises from remotely sensed observations including hf radar data on average only 50 of in situ measurements contribute to a reduction in forecast error this is partly due to the large volume of remote sensing observations compared to in situ observations however in situ observations are an order of magnitude more impactful than remotely sensed data when viewed in terms of the average impact per observation keywords forecast sensitivity based observation impacts fsoi california current 4d var coastal hf radars u s ioos data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the earliest applications of data assimilation in the ocean is that of robinson and leslie 1985 in a quasi geostrophic ocean model configured for a region of the northeast atlantic since this early pioneering effort ocean data assimilation has matured considerably and is now employed routinely at both regional and global scales e g moore et al 2019 for example within u s territorial waters the integrated ocean observing system ioos is an important program that supports real time ocean observing systems data assimilation and forecasting activities to meet the needs of a wide range of stakeholders just as data assimilation in support of operational numerical weather prediction nwp has advanced considerably in recent decades operational ocean data assimilation has been quick to adopt many of the approaches and best practices of nwp for example an essential diagnostic in many current nwp systems is the impact of observations on the predictive skill of the analysis forecast system the so called forecast sensitivity based observation impact fsoi provides quantitative information about the relative contribution of each observation assimilated into the model during the analysis to the skill of the ensuing forecast fsoi as it is generally used in nwp was introduced by langland and baker 2004 hereafter lb and is based on an adjoint approach the approach is based on comparing the skill of two forecasts initialized from two different initial conditions one that benefits from observational information and one that does not as discussed in section 2 the adjoint of the gain matrix is central to quantifying the contribution of each observation to the difference in forecast error between the two forecasts in this way observations that improve or degrade the forecast skill can be identified since the seminal work of lb fsoi has been widely studied and adopted by the nwp community e g errico 2007 trémolet 2008 zhu and gelaro 2008 gelaro and zhu 2009 cardinali 2009 gelaro et al 2010 jung et al 2013 tyndall and horel 2013 cardinali and healy 2014 cardinali 2018 diniz and todling 2020 while the original approach of lb was developed for a 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation approach similar methods have also been developed in nwp for ensemble based data assimilation systems e g liu and kalnay 2008 kunii et al 2012 sommer and weissmann 2016 the traditional approach to computing the impact of an observing system on forecast skill is observing system experiments oses during oses the systematic removal of different observing platforms on the performance of forecast skill is assessed by rerunning the analysis forecast system a computationally demanding approach while fsoi differs from traditional oses collectively they provide complementary information about the efficacy of the observing system e g gelaro and zhu 2009 cardinali 2009 routine monitoring of fsoi provides information about the performance of the data assimilation system and can identify underlying issues with the forecast model such as bias e g cardinali 2009 2018 in addition fsoi provides a quantitative measure of the efficacy of the current observing systems for example gelaro et al 2010 compare the observation impact from a suite of operational models during the observing system research and predictability experiment thorpex a decade long initiative to improve the accuracy of nwp forecasts on the short to medium range for high impact weather events fsoi was used to quantify the impact of different components of the global observing system on forecast skill to provide guidance on future observing system enhancements fsoi from three different nwp models revealed that only 50 of the observations lead to an improvement in forecast skill which falls just short of an empirically derived limit of 60 65 suggested by ehrendorfer 2007 using monte carlo experiments thus an important conclusion from thorpex fsoi is that assimilating more observations rather than less may be better perhaps due to the higher level of redundancy gelaro et al 2010 also highlight the potential ability of adjoint based impact methods for identifying problems with observation quality and data processing and or the assimilation methodology the success and demonstrated value of fsoi in nwp has led to the development of a similar capability in the widely used regional ocean modeling system roms in support of a 4d var data assimilation system to date observation impact work in roms has been almost exclusively confined to the analysis cycle e g moore et al 2011c 2015 2017 iermano et al 2016 powell 2017 kerry et al 2018 levin et al 2020 2021a b he et al 2022 the work documented here is a feasibility study and validation of fsoi in preparation for implementation into several near real time nrt regional ocean analysis forecast systems and follows earlier work by moore et al 2011c our focus is on the california current system ccs which represents the eastern portion of the subtropical and subpolar gyre circulations in the northeast pacific the ccs is an example of an eastern boundary current upwelling environment it is recognized as one of the world s large marine ecosystems lmes of considerable environmental and socio economic importance the ccs derives its name from the california current cc which represents the easternmost portion of the equatorward branch of the north pacific subtropical gyre hickey 1979 1998 checkley and barth 2009 during boreal spring and summer the cc is a coherent feature along the coast of washington and oregon near 40 n the cc is steered offshore by cape mendocino cm a large coastal promontory see fig 2 geographical locations equatorward of cm the cc is less coherent as it becomes unstable exhibiting substantial meandering centurioni et al 2008 amidst a field of energetic mesoscale eddies kelly et al 1998 the alongshore wind conditions near the coast are a significant driving force for the ccs during wintertime the atmospheric circulation in the ne pacific is dominated by the aleutian low pressure system and the associated cyclonic wind field directs ekman transport onshore poleward of cm leading to coastal downwelling and a poleward coastal current equatorward of cm the north pacific high is present year round though with seasonal changes where the associated alongshore winds are upwelling favorable during the spring and summer the aleutian low yields to the north pacific high and upwelling favorable wind conditions exist from the canadian border south to the baja peninsula in addition to the cc other important circulation features develop inshore due to baroclinic mass conservation gill 1982 and poleward pressure gradient forces connolly et al 2014 a poleward return flow develops along the continental slope at a depth of around 600 m this is referred to as the california undercurrent cuc during the peak upwelling seasons of spring and summer the strong cross shore pressure gradients that develop drive an equatorward coastal jet the coastal jet is located within 1 2 baroclinic rossby radii of deformation 30 60 km from the coast and is distinct from the cc checkley and barth 2009 stakeholder needs of the ccs are served by three different regional associations of the u s ioos program these are the southern california coastal ocean observing system sccoos the central and northern california coastal ocean observing system cencoos and the northwest association of networked ocean observing systems nanoos the nrt analysis forecast system described here is run routinely in support of cencoos as described by moore et al 2013 a new observation data stream added recently to the cencoos nrt system provides estimates of surface currents from a network of coastal high frequency hf radars therefore a specific focus of this study will be the impact of hf radar observations on the forecast skill the remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows the approach used to compute the fsoi is described in section 2 in relation to the roms 4d var data assimilation employed in the nrt system the roms and 4d var configurations are detailed in section 3 where the observation data streams are also described the fsoi results are presented in section 4 which provides further information about practical aspects of the approach to fsoi in ocean models fsoi is applied to several different forecast metrics that target specific characteristics of the ccs circulation described above the fsoi information is presented and analyzed in several different ways to highlight the performance features of the data assimilation system and to contrast the relative advantages of various components of the observing system finally a summary and some conclusions are presented in section 5 2 forecast sensitivity based observation impact fsoi following the accepted notation ide et al 1997 we will denote by x t the state vector comprising all ocean grid point values of temperature salinity two horizontal velocity components and sea surface elevation the analysis forecast system considered here is based on 4d var data assimilation so the method used to quantify the observation impacts is described with this in mind that said the schematic in fig 1 illustrates a typical analysis forecast cycle as it is employed here the analysis cycle spans the interval t τ 0 where t 0 corresponds to the current time during the analysis cycle observations from the interval t τ 0 are assimilated into the model using 4d var to compute increments to a background estimate x b τ according to 1 x a τ x b τ b h t hb h t r 1 y h x b where x a τ is the desired analysis y is the vector of observations h is the observation operator which includes the nonlinear model such that h x b represents the time evolving background over the analysis interval sampled at the space time observation locations h is the tangent linear observation operator and includes the tangent linear model h t is the adjoint model forced at the space time observation locations and b and r are the background error covariance matrix and observation error covariance matrix respectively as illustrated in fig 1 the 4d var analysis x a 0 at the current time is used to initialize a forecast represented here by the interval t 0 t f and denoted x f a t this forecast will benefit from the observations assimilated during the analysis cycle at the same time we can also consider a forecast over the same interval that is initialized from the background x b τ in contrast this second forecast denoted by x f b t will not benefit from the most recent observations assimilated during the analysis cycle therefore the difference between the forecast errors in x f a t and x f b t can be used as a basis for quantifying the so called forecast sensitivity based observation impact fsoi this paradigm underpins routine monitoring of observation impacts on forecast skill at many operational nwp centers e g https ios jcsda org the approach used here follows that originally described by lb which is based on the earlier work of baker and daley 2000 suppose that x t represents the true ocean state at forecast time t f the forecast error e can then be quantified according to 2 e x f x t t c x f x t where c is a weight matrix for example suppose c is a diagonal matrix with elements equal to 1 corresponding to all surface temperature grid points and zero elsewhere in that case e represents the sum of the squared errors in sea surface temperature sst forecast error metrics of the form 2 are commonly used in operational nwp and oceanography the difference in the forecast errors of x f a t f and x f b t f can then be expressed as 3 δ e x f a t f x t t c x f a t f x t x f b t f x t t c x f b t f x t e a e b of course the true state vector x t will never be known so it is customary to compute the forecast error e relative to the new analysis valid at forecast time t f this is often referred to as the verifying analysis and will be denoted as x a t f in which case 3 becomes 4 δ e x f a t f x a t f t c x f a t f x a t f x f b t f x a t f t c x f b t f x a t f in the case where δ e 0 the error in the forecast initialized from the 4d var analysis is lower than the error in the forecast initialized from the background which indicates that the forecast has benefited from the assimilation of observations during the analysis cycle i e e a e b conversely cases where δ e 0 indicate that the assimilation of observations during the analysis cycle have degraded the skill of the forecast i e e a e b following lb the forecast error difference δ e can be approximated by 5 δ e x f a t f x f b t f t 1 2 e a x f a e b x f b the gradients e a x f a and e b x f b at forecast time t f can be mapped back to the analysis time t τ using the adjoint model to yield e a x a t τ and e b x b t τ in which case 6 δ e x a τ x b τ t 1 2 e a x a t τ e b x b t τ 7 δ e d t k t 1 2 e a x a t τ e b x b t τ where 7 follows from 1 d y h x b is the innovation vector and k b h t hb h t r 1 is the gain matrix the impact of the observations on the forecast skill can then be evaluated using 7 errico 2007 showed that 7 is in fact a 3rd order accurate linear approximation which using 2 and 4 can be written as 8 δ e d t k t m t m b t c x f b t f x a t f m a t c x f a t f x a t f where m t is the adjoint model linearized about the background x b t during the analysis cycle t τ 0 m b t is the adjoint model linearized about the forecast x f b t during the forecast cycle t 0 t f and m a t is the adjoint model linearized about the forecast x f a t during the forecast cycle t 0 t f it is generally recognized that the 3rd order approximation 8 performs best in operational nwp systems gelaro et al 2007 as noted by lb δ e given by 8 represents the dot product of the innovation vector d with a second vector g k t m t m b t c x f b t f x a t f m a t c x f a t f x a t f since both d and g span the observation space and each element of d is uniquely associated with an individual observation y i the products d i g i represent the contribution aka impact of each observation to the change in forecast error δ e the observations for which d i g i 0 are associated with improvements in the forecast skill while observations for which d i g i 0 correspond to observations that degrade the forecast skill inspection of 8 shows that calculation of δ e requires three integrations of the adjoint model one initialized by c x f b t f x a t f a second initialized by c x f a t f x a t f and a third initialized by the sum of these two integrations in each case the adjoint model is linearized about a different state as indicated above daescu 2009 has explored how errors in the verifying analysis also referred to as self analysis can adversely influence the observation impacts resulting from 8 furthermore recent studies in nwp indicate that observation impacts relative to the verifying analysis can lead to overestimates of the actual impacts e g privé et al 2020 therefore an alternative approach is also employed to compute the observation impacts relative to observations e g neckler et al 2018 cardinali 2018 in this case the forecast error at time t f is computed relative to independent observations before they are assimilated into the model where e a and e b are now given by 9 e a b y f a b y f t c y f a b y f where y f is the vector of independent observations available at the forecast time t f the vectors y f a and y f b are the forecasts x f a and x f b sampled at the same space time locations as the observations y f and c is a weight matrix now in the observation space the forecast error difference δ e e a e b to 3rd order in this case is given by 10 δ e d t k t m t h b t c y f b y f h a t c y f a y f where h a and h b are the appropriate tangent linear observation operators as noted in section 1 roms 4d var underpins the ccs analysis forecast system that is considered here in roms the analysis increments δ x x a τ x b τ in 1 are identified using an incremental formulation of 4d var courtier et al 1994 specifically as described by gürol et al 2014 the gain matrix k in 1 is evaluated iteratively using the lanczos formulation of the conjugate gradient cg method according to 11 k k m b h t v m t m 1 v m t hb h t r 1 where v m is the matrix of m normalized cg search directions aka lanczos vectors arising from m inner loop iterations and t m v m t hb h t r 1 hb h t i v m therefore if the lanczos vector matrices v m are archived during each 4d var analysis cycle k t k m t in 8 and 10 can be readily computed from 11 as discussed by trémolet 2008 3 ccs analysis forecast system as noted in section 1 the cencoos nrt analysis forecast system is based on roms roms is a free surface hydrostatic ocean model that uses stretched terrain following coordinates in the vertical and generalized orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in the horizontal haidvogel et al 2008 such a coordinate system allows for increased resolution where needed such as in areas with complex bathymetry or in the thermocline and bottom boundary layers roms uses a split explicit time stepping scheme to solve the primitive equations of momentum where there is coupling between barotropic and baroclinic modes shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the roms configuration used here is shown in fig 2 and has a horizontal resolution of 1 10 th degree 10 km there are 42 terrain following σ levels in the vertical with 7 100 m resolution in deep water and 0 3 8 m resolution on the continental shelf the efficacy of the non data assimilative model solutions has been quantified by veneziani et al 2009a the model is forced at the surface by fluxes of momentum heat and freshwater derived from the coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps hodur et al 2002 doyle et al 2009 the naval research laboratory monterey has configured coamps for the ccs and its present triply nested 36 12 4 km configuration with highest resolution along the central california coast is run operationally at the fleet numerical meteorological and oceanography center constrained by 4d var data assimilation atmospheric model properties e g wind specific humidity air temperature 2 m above the surface are converted to air sea fluxes using roms atmospheric boundary layer bulk flux parameterizations the roms open boundaries are constrained by a 1 1 2 º global data assimilation product from hycom based on the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system and 3d var cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 the current version of the nrt system does not include the influence of tides or rivers the roms configuration shown in fig 2 has an extensive history of 4d var data assimilation e g broquet et al 2009a b 2011 moore et al 2011a b c 2013 and has also been used to compute a sequence of re analyses spanning several decades neveu et al 2016 and for biogeochemical data assimilation e g song et al 2016 mattern et al 2017 observations are assimilated from a variety of different remote sensing and in situ platforms the various data streams are summarized in table 1 and include sea surface temperature sst and sea surface height ssh derived from satellite remote sensing estimates of radial surface currents from coastal high frequency hf radars and in situ measurements of temperature t and salinity s from ocean gliders and free drifting profiling argo floats the sst ssh and in situ observations were thinned in space and time prior to assimilation by forming super observations so that no more than one observation of a given type was assimilated into a model grid cell during a 1 h window the hf radar observations of the radial component of velocity extend to 200 km offshore and were thinned by first applying a 25 h moving average to minimize the tidal signal the resulting averaged data were sub sampled once per day the daily sub sampled data were assimilated into the model with no spatial thinning the period considered here is jan 2018 jan 2020 and the duration of each 4d var analysis cycle in fig 1 was chosen to be 4 days the volume of data assimilated is relatively uniform from cycle to cycle and the mean and standard deviation of the number of observations assimilated during each 4 day window is indicated in table 1 the most abundant observations are those from the hf radar network and satellite derived sst as described in moore et al 2011a the background error covariance matrix b in 1 is modeled using the diffusion operator approach of weaver and courtier 2001 in the current formulation the error correlations are assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous in the horizontal while the error covariances do not vary in time during a single analysis cycle they vary seasonally the standard deviations of the background error are based on the climatological variance and computed from a long roms simulation without data assimilation the exception is for salinity where the background error variance was capped at 0 01 the horizontal decorrelation length for the background errors was assumed to be 50 km for all state variables a 30 m decorrelation length was adopted in the vertical for all state variables except for salinity where 100 m was used a quality control check on the observations based on the background was performed following andersson and järvinen 1999 the innovation d i associated with each observation was compared to the expected standard error based on the variance of the errors in the background σ b 2 and the observations σ o 2 specifically if d i 2 α 2 σ b 2 σ o 2 then the observation was rejected and not included in the analysis the threshold parameter α 4 was used for all observation types assimilated here the observation error covariance matrix r was assumed to be diagonal the nominal combined instrument error and error of representativeness standard deviations assigned to each observation type are summarized in the last column of table 1 in practice following the calculation of super observations the nominal errors were augmented by the variance of the observations within a grid box based on the expected standard error based on previous experience the current nrt 4d var system employs one outer loop and nine inner loops the control vector comprises only the model initial conditions x a τ in 1 this configuration represents a compromise between a satisfactory reduction of the 4d var cost function and the computational time required to perform the analysis and forecast in real time on the computer systems available the analysis at the end of each 4d var analysis cycle in fig 1 becomes the background at the start of the subsequent analysis cycle in this way the 4d var system was cycled every 4 days for the period jan 2018 jan 2020 4 forecast observation impacts 4 1 the fsoi procedure the procedure used here to compute the fsoi closely parallels that employed in nwp as outlined in fig 1 as noted in section 3 the surface fluxes of heat momentum and freshwater are computed using a bulk flux formulation and atmospheric fields near the surface however the surface heat flux and surface wind stress depend on sst therefore care must be taken to ensure that the surface fluxes applied during forecasts x f a and x f b in fig 1 are identical despite differences in sst otherwise differences in the forecast error will result from differences in the surface boundary conditions ideally the lateral open boundary conditions used during both forecasts should also be identical for the same reasons in the roms configuration employed here a combination of a radiation condition and nudging to the hycom boundary fields described in section 3 was applied to the 3 dimensional fields of temperature salinity and both components of horizontal velocity in addition the chapman 1985 boundary conditions were applied to sea surface height while the vertically integrated flow is subject to the flather 1976 condition as a result of this combination of lateral open boundary conditions the boundary values during the forecast x f a and x f b will not be identical however as demonstrated by veneziani et al 2009b the circulation away from the open boundaries and adjacent to the coast is relatively insensitive to changes in the open boundary conditions data assimilation experiments using 4d var by moore et al 2011c in which the lateral open boundary conditions are adjusted as part of the control vector also demonstrate that the model state estimates are insensitive to boundary adjustments therefore despite the inevitable differences that will arise between the boundary fields during x f a and x f b we are confident that these differences will exert a relatively small influence on the forecast skill this is borne out by the time series of the forecast metrics discussed in section 4 2 similar issues related to lateral open boundary conditions present themselves in regional nwp models e g amerault et al 2013 kim and kim 2021 therefore with these issues in mind the fsoi calculations proceed in the following way 1 x f a is first computed using the 4d var analysis as the initial condition and surface flux boundary conditions computed in the usual way using the bulk flux formulation the surface fluxes are archived frequently in this case every hour 2 x f a is then computed a second time using prescribed surface fluxes from the archived fluxes from step 1 linearly interpolated in time the forecast differences in x f a calculated from steps 1 and 2 were found to be very small not shown 3 x f b was initialized from the 4d var background and using the surface fluxes archived from step 1 linearly interpolated in time as in step 2 the forecasts x f a and x f b then form the basis for the fsoi calculations the open boundary conditions imposed are identical during steps 1 2 and 3 unless otherwise indicated the forecast interval is 4 days the forecast error metrics given by 2 or 9 were computed as the average forecast error during the last 24 h of the forecast i e midnight on forecast day 3 to midnight on forecast day 4 indicated by the verification interval in fig 1 while the expressions for the fsoi in 8 and 10 are valid for forecast errors evaluated at a single time they can be easily generalized to time averaged errors e g see moore et al 2011c 4 2 forecast error metrics users and stakeholders of regional ocean analyses and forecasts have a wide range of interests and needs therefore fsoi information based on different and specifically targeted metrics is generally of interest with this in mind we consider here four different metrics focused on the unique attributes of the eastern boundary current and upwelling dynamics of the ccs 4 2 1 coastal sst variations in sst along the u s west coast are an important and characteristic feature of the ccs circulation here we focus specifically on the central california region and consider a forecast error metric based on the mean squared error mse in sst denoted e s s t this error is computed from sst observations according to 9 where the matrix of weights c targets all of the observation points in the region indicated in fig 2 between cape mendocino 40 4 n cm and point conception 34 4 n hereafter pc extending from the coast to 250 km offshore this region is characterized by variability on a wide range of time scales from sub seasonal to decadal in addition there is considerable spatial heterogeneity associated with the presence of mesoscale eddies fronts and meanders as well as localized regions of strong upwelling and downwelling particularly in the lee of major coastal promontories as such sst in this region is an important predictive variable for models of the distribution and population of some commercial fish stocks and is of interest in support of fisheries management e g scales et al 2017 santora et al 2020 fig 3a shows the time series of e s s t a and e s s t b for the jan 2018 jan 2020 period considered here as noted in section 4 1 the forecast duration is 4 days and the forecast errors are computed as an average over the last 24 h of the forecast in general data assimilation reduces the forecast error as measured by this metric this is further illustrated in fig 3b which shows a time series of δ e s s t e s s t a e s s t b for the same period computed directly from the nonlinear model forecasts x f a and x f b in general δ e s s t 0 for most analysis forecast cycles indicating that assimilation of observations improves the forecast skill for sst the largest reduction in error equivalent to 1 3 c occurs during the spring and summer upwelling seasons and fig 3a indicates that this represents a factor of 2 3 drop in error compared to e s s t b data assimilation has little impact on the forecast skill as quantified by this metric during fall and winter months fig 3b also shows a time series of δ e s s t based on the 3rd order linear approximation 10 there is generally excellent agreement between the linear approximation of δ e s s t and that computed directly from the nonlinear model forecasts which attests to the efficacy of the tangent linear approximation on which the fsoi calculations are predicated 4 2 2 surface currents surface currents in the coastal region are also highly variable and reflect the presence of a variety of important circulation features including mesoscale eddies meanders jets and the passage of coastally trapped waves therefore a second metric considered here is the mse of surface velocity denoted e v computed from observed surface current estimates derived from the coastal hf radar network the coastal hf radar antennae sites are shown below in fig 5a during the last 24 h of the forecast cycle in this case the matrix of weights c in 9 targeted all of the observation points in the same central california coast target region used for the sst metric in section 4 2 1 and indicated in fig 2 this particular metric is of interest because hf radial observations of surface currents from the u s west coast network are a very recent addition to the cencoos nrt analysis forecast system and validation of their impact on the system is ongoing it is noteworthy however that hf radial observations have been used for some time in the pacific islands ocean observing system pacioos nrt system souza et al 2014 partridge et al 2019 fig 3c shows the time series of e v a and e v b and similar to e s s t exhibits a pronounced seasonal cycle with the largest errors in the surface velocities during late spring and summer data assimilation reduces the error by 25 as illustrated in fig 3d which shows the time series of δ e v computed directly from x f a and x f b and using the tangent linear approximation 10 again δ e v is generally negative throughout indicating that data assimilation reduces forecast error of surface currents by the equivalent 5 10 cm s 1 as in the case of sst errors there is a pronounced seasonal cycle in δ e v with the largest forecast improvements following data assimilation during the spring and summer months in this case too the tangent linear approximation 10 reliably reproduces the temporal behavior of δ e v 4 2 3 alongshore transport alongshore transport is essential for the redistribution of water masses within the ccs the ccs comprises a complicated system of currents that include the equatorward cc the poleward cuc and during the onset of upwelling a nearshore equatorward coastal jet as described in section 1 alongshore exchange is also associated with the passage of eddies and coastally trapped waves therefore a metric that quantifies the forecast skill in estimates of alongshore transport is also of interest here we consider the transport along a vertical zonal section at 37 n from the coast to 125 w and from the surface to 500 m depth or to the bottom if shallower as indicated in fig 2 this section is representative of other latitudes along the central california coast there are no routine direct observations of transport so in this case the mse denoted e 37 n in forecasts of transport at 37 n was computed relative to a verifying analysis according to 3 over the last 24 h of the forecast cycle in this case c h h t where h is a vector such that h t x f t is the transport forecast along the 37 n section broquet et al 2011 have demonstrated that 4d var estimates can effectively capture the observed mean geostrophic circulation along the 37 n section so the assumption here is that the 4d var verifying analyses provide meaningful estimates of the alongshore transport variations with this in mind fig 3e shows the time series of e 37 n a and e 37 n b and reveals substantial reductions in forecast error due to data assimilation when measured against the verifying analysis the time series of δ e 37 n e 37 n a e 37 n b computed directly from the nonlinear forecasts and based on the tangent linear approximation 8 are shown in fig 3f the errors in the transport forecasts are reduced by data assimilation by the equivalent 1 2 sv although there are no noticeable seasonal variations in this case fig 3f shows that δ e 37 n is also described well by 8 4 2 4 upwelling transport coastal upwelling and downwelling exert a profound influence on the ccs and its associated marine ecosystems however direct observations of vertical velocity in the ocean present a considerable challenge traditionally indirect estimates of vertical transport on the continental shelf have been based on surface wind stress e g bakun 1973 as such estimates of vertical transport in coastal regions that are indirectly informed by ocean observations even if relatively uncertain are of considerable interest e g jacox et al 2014 2018 therefore we will consider the mse denoted e w in vertical transport estimates evaluated at a depth of 40 m in the nearshore coastal region shown in fig 2 in this case also e w was computed relative to the verifying analysis as an average over the last 24 h of the forecast cycle where c h h t and h is a vector such that h t x f t is the total vertical transport over the target area the time series of e w a e w b and δ e w e w a e w b computed from the nonlinear model forecasts and based on the tangent linear approximation are shown in fig 3g and h in this case the results are somewhat mixed while during many forecast cycles the change in error is close to zero on average δ e w 0 see also fig 4d below furthermore similar to the alongshore transport δ e w exhibits no apparent seasonal dependence and is in the range equivalent to 0 2 0 3 sv 4 3 observation impacts 4 3 1 the impact of individual platforms as described in section 2 the change in forecast error δ e due to assimilating the observations and given by 8 or 10 can be partitioned into the contribution from each observation here we consider the collective contribution aka impact to δ e of subsets of different types of observations fig 4 shows the time series of δ e for the four metrics described in section 4 2 partitioned according to the impact of each observation type during each analysis forecast cycle the mean observation impact of each observation type for all analysis forecast cycles is also in fig 4 not surprisingly sst observations have the largest impact on δ e s s t fig 4a with hf radar observations of radial surface currents in second place in situ temperature and salinity observations have an approximately equal impact overall and ssh observations have the least influence in the case of δ e v fig 4b hf radial data account for about 40 of the impact in contrast the impact of the remaining observations is approximately equally partitioned although leaning in favor of in situ salinity the situation is similar for δ e 37 n fig 4c hf radial observations are similarly most impactful on δ e w while observations of ssh on average degrade the forecast skill based on this metric fig 4d in all cases there is a general consensus between the average impact of the different observation types on forecast skill during each analysis forecast cycle i e during each cycle all data types on average either decrease or increase the forecast error given the significant impact that hf radar observations of surface currents have on forecast skill as measured by all metrics fig 5 shows time series of the impact of observations from individual antennae the impacts are color coded from blue to red moving along the coast from north to south fig 5 indicates that in general hf radar sites at all latitudes along the coast impact the forecast skill of the circulation features represented by each metric the relationship between the innovation d i i e observation minus background and the impact associated with each observation is also of interest since it provides information about the system performance also explored further in section 4 3 3 to illustrate fig 6 shows binned scatter plots of the impact of individual observations on δ e 37 n versus the innovation for all analysis forecast cycles for each observation type also shown in fig 6 is the percentage of observations that fall within each quadrant of the scatter plots when interpreted as contingency diagrams in general observations with a small innovation i e where the background agrees well with the observation have a small impact on forecast errors in 37 n transport conversely observations with larger innovations span a wide range of impacts except for in situ temperature the observations are approximately equally divided between positive and negative innovations indicating no significant biases in the model or observations in the case of in situ temperature a clear bias toward positive innovations indicates a tendency for a cold bias in the model in accordance with figs 4 and 5 the negative impacts associated with individual observations i e that contribute to an improvement in the forecast skill are generally larger than the positive impacts fig 6 also shows that the most heavily populated bins lie close to the abscissa indicating that a significant fraction of the observations have a minimal impact on forecast skill even though fig 6 suggest that the cumulative impact of all observations improves forecast skill this does not mean that the majority of observations contribute to this improvement table 2 shows the percentage of all observations of a particular type that enhance the forecast skill i e δ e 0 and that degrade forecast i e δ e 0 for each forecast skill metric in the case of δ e 37 n shown in fig 6 most sst ssh and hf radar observations improve the forecast in contrast in the case of in situ temperature and salinity approximately half of the observations degrade the forecast the same trends can be seen for δ e s s t and δ e v in the case of δ e w only about 50 of the remote sensing observations yield an improvement in forecast skill while the majority of in situ observations degrade the forecast skill it should be noted that while the percentage differences are significant they are generally not overwhelming in favor of one outcome or another 4 3 2 spatial variations in observation impacts to illustrate the spatial variations in the impact of the observations on forecast skill fig 7 shows the mean impact of hf radial observations that fall within each surface grid cell of the model over all analysis forecast cycles while observations that fall within the target regions have the largest impact in the case of δ e s s t δ e v and δ e w the impact varies considerably between sites for instance observations from the ucsb radar sites in the vicinity of point conception 34 4 n see fig 2 for the antennae locations see fig 5a have some of the largest impacts on these three metrics cf fig 7a b and d however radar sites remote from the target regions also exert considerable influence on the forecast skill as measured by all four metrics in particular fig 7 shows that hf radar data from the southern california bight plays an important role in reducing the forecast error of the circulation along the central california coast this indicates how information from observations downstream in the ccs can influence the forecast skill of the circulation upstream via the propagation of information backwards in time i e upstream in the adjoint model in the case of δ e 37 n fig 7c information from both upstream and downstream of the target vertical section has greater impact than observations along the transport section itself these results illustrate the complexity of the flow of information within the analysis forecast system the spatial distributions of the impacts of sst and in situ hydrographic observations on δ e s s t averaged over all analysis forecast cycles are shown in fig 8 on average sst observations everywhere in the domain reduce forecast error although as expected sst data in the target area have the largest impact fig 8a these results show that sst upstream along the coast of northern california oregon and washington also improve the efficacy of sst forecasts along the central california coast as described in section 3 in situ observations are available from gliders and argo floats and the individual transects and trajectories of each are apparent in fig 8b and c while most observations from the glider lines lead to improvements a notable exception as revealed in fig 8b is that temperature data from the glider transects originating near monterey bay labelled g degrade the forecast skill of sst in this region in contrast salinity observations along the same line lower the forecast error fig 8c on the other hand temperature observations along this line yield improvements in forecast skill for the other metrics considered not shown as in section 4 3 1 fsoi indicates that in general around one half of the in situ observations assimilated into the model during the analysis cycle subsequently degrade forecast skill fig 8b represents one example where on average temperature observations along the glider line g degrade forecasts of sst along the central ca coast to explore this further fig 9 shows a binned scatter diagram of the impact on δ e s s t versus innovation for all temperature observations from the monterey bay glider line g fig 9 reveals two important features first 64 of the observations are associated with positive innovations recalling that the innovation d i for each observation y i in 1 is defined as the observation minus the background fig 9 indicates the presence of cold bias in the modeled ocean temperatures along this line this is a known issue of the model particularly during upwelling season as identified by veneziani et al 2009a and broquet et al 2009a second some 28 of temperature observations are associated with δ e i 0 and d i 0 the quadrant that is clearly anomalous with respect to the extent to which some of the observations degrade forecasts of sst in particular a distinct group of observations clusters along the 45 line in the upper right hand quadrant which degrades forecast skill based on a similar experience in nwp e g cardinali 2009 it seems likely that the disproportionate adverse impact of these data on forecast skill is associated with the cold bias in the vicinity of the glider line thus fig 9 also serves as an example of how fsoi can be used to monitor the efficacy of data streams within the assimilation system to identify the detrimental effects of bias and potential issues related to data processing and the data assimilation procedure 4 3 3 observation rankings and system performance as discussed in section 4 3 1 while many observations assimilated in the model increase the forecast skill a significant fraction also degrade the forecast experience in nwp has demonstrated that for a well tuned forecast model approximately half of the observations degrade the forecast skill e g gelaro et al 2010 lorenc and marriott 2014 argue that this situation can arise due to the combined influence of growing modes errors in the observations and errors in the verifying analysis the relative rankings of the total impact of observations from each platform on forecast skill are summarized in fig 10 for the four metrics while the platform associated with the largest number of observations generally has the greatest impact on forecast skill fig 10 shows that this is not the only factor controlling the impact of data from a particular platform for example in all cases in situ observations have a significant impact despite the relatively small number of these data compared to remote sensing generally observations from the glider lines cf fig 8 have the largest impact of all platforms that provide subsurface observations for all but one of the forecast metrics the total impact of all observations of a particular type is to reduce the forecast error the exception is the case of ssh observations which on average degrade forecasts of the upwelling transport fig 10e the reason for this is not well understood and requires further investigation given the apparent disparity in the number of observations from each platform assimilated into the model during a 4d var cycle it is illuminating to quantify the average impact on forecast skill of a single observation from each platform with this in mind table 3 shows the mean observation impact per datum i e the average impact per observation denoted α p associated with each type of observation p for the four forecast skill metrics values of α were computed separately for observations that reduce forecast error α p and for observations that increase forecast error α p table 3 indicates that for all metrics the impact per datum of in situ observations of temperature and salinity on forecast skill is typically an order of magnitude greater than that for other observation types however the relative impact of the remote sensing observations varies between metrics for example for δ e s s t a single observation of sst has approximately the same impact on forecast skill as an observation of ssh or surface radial velocity on the other hand for δ e 37 n an ssh observation has almost three times the impact of a radial velocity observation and five times the impact of an sst observation in the case of α p in addition for all observation types and metrics the impact per datum is larger in cases where the data improve the forecast α p compared to cases where the data degrade the forecast α p this is consistent with the general tendency illustrated in the scatter plot histograms of fig 6 where the negative impacts i e observations that reduce the forecast error are typically larger than the positive impacts i e observations that increase the forecast error another valuable indicator of analysis forecast system performance is the mean impact of the different observation types during each inner loop of the 4d var analysis fig 11 shows an example for the forecast metric e 37 n averaged over all analysis forecast cycles the mean impact is negative during all inner loops indicating that at all stages of the 4d var analysis on average the observations contribute to improvements in the forecast skill during the initial 3 or 4 inner loops fig 11 shows that the mean impact of hf radar observations and sst are comparable however beyond inner loop 4 the impact of sst observations levels off while that of the hf radar data continues to yield further reductions in forecast error by the end of the 4d var analysis cycle the mean impact of sst ssh and in situ observations is similar and collectively has approximately the same impact as hf radar data while the impact of the sst observations displays signs of an asymptote to a near constant value the impact of hf radar observations and to a lesser extent ssh and in situ data exhibit a continued downward trend indicating that there is still additional useful forecast information that can be mined from these data during 4d var 5 summary and discussion an adjoint based fsoi procedure similar to that used in operational nwp has been applied in roms configured for the ccs the roms ccs configuration is currently used in conjunction with 4d var to compute nrt ocean analyses and forecasts for the u s west coast circulation in support of the cencoos regional association of u s ioos the fsoi system described here is a prototype that is currently being transitioned to several ioos nrt systems in the roms ccs system four different metrics of forecast skill were considered that target other important processes and circulation features specifically we have considered metrics based on the mse of central ca sst and surface velocity measured relative to independent observations i e before these observations are assimilated and the mse in alongshore upper ocean transport at 37 n and central ca nearshore upwelling transport both measured relative to a verifying analysis the fsoi approach employed here is predicated on several tangent linear approximations that are generally valid in all cases while the number of observations from a particular platform is an important factor in controlling the impact of these observations on forecast skill this is not always the case in the experiments reported here the distribution of observation by type is 51 hf radar 38 sst 7 ssh and 4 in situ thus hf radar observations of radial surface currents significantly influence all of the forecast metrics radial velocity observations from hf radars are a new data stream in the cencoos nrt system considered here because the radial beams converge on the antenna the observation density increases rapidly with decreasing distance from the coast while no effort was made to spatially thin the hf radar observations to overcome the high data density on average just over half of all observations assimilated are from the radar network the authors are aware that thinning of hf radar observations is required to offset the effects of correlated observation errors and matranga 2021 has reported on some potential approaches in the nrt system on average only 49 61 of all observations combined contribute to a reduction in forecast error the remaining 39 51 of observations degrade the forecast which is consistent with experience in nwp gelaro et al 2010 when viewed in terms of each platform 49 67 of remote sensing observations including hf radar reduce forecast errors compared to only 42 53 in the case of in situ observations of temperature and salinity therefore even though further thinning of hf radar observations and other remote sensing data is probably warranted a case can also be made for less thinning in line with the experience and conclusions of thorpex that assimilating a larger number of potentially redundant observations rather than fewer observations may be better gelaro et al 2010 more research is clearly needed to resolve the relative importance of the various competing factors at play an interesting question that of course arises is whether there is more to be gained by eliminating the data from the 4d var analysis cycle that are detrimental to the forecast skill recent studies by chen and kalnay 2019 2020 have explored this idea in the context of nwp while on aggregate remotely sensed observations have the largest impact on forecast skill the average impact of a single observation varies considerably across platforms when viewed in this way hf radar sst and ssh observations all exhibit a similar fsoi per datum within about a factor of 2 while the fsoi per datum for in situ observations is typically an order of magnitude higher similar results have been reported for the observation impacts during analysis cycles in the same system moore et al 2018 and other roms and 4d var configurations levin et al 2020 2021a b interestingly regardless of observation type the magnitude of the fsoi per datum is significantly higher for observations that reduce forecast error than for observations that degrade the forecasts the reason for this disparity is not fully understood and requires further investigation another issue that requires further exploration is the influence of lateral boundary conditions and surface fluxes on forecast skill and fsoi a recent study by kim and kim 2021 has demonstrated that in a regional nwp model forecast skill and fsoi can be significantly influenced by the treatment of the open boundaries while it is certainly true that forecasts in regional nwp models are strongly influenced by conditions imposed at the open boundaries the same cannot generally said for regional ocean models because of the different spatio temporal characteristics of the ocean experience with the ccs roms configuration considered here has shown that the circulation away from the open boundaries and adjacent to the coast is relatively insensitive to variations in the open boundary values veneziani et al 2009b moore et al 2011c therefore we feel confident that the fsoi approach applied here is sound however the same approach may not perform so well in other regions and or dynamical regimes and further study is needed the issue of the influence of ocean surface forcing on forecast skill has been side stepped in the present study by purposely imposing the same surface fluxes of heat momentum and freshwater on the forecasts initialized from the analysis and background ocean state estimates this has important practical advantages for the adjoint sensitivity based fsoi approach that we are advocating for here however we appreciate that differences in surface forcing derived from the bulk formulae resulting from updated sst estimates arising from data assimilation could also appreciably impact the forecast skill compared to the direct information from the observations alone this is a topic that also requires further exploration nonetheless these issues aside this study indicates that fsoi can also be a useful tool for monitoring the efficacy of data streams within the assimilation system to identify the detrimental effects of bias and potential issues related to data processing and data assimilation furthermore trends in the average impact of each observation platform during the inner loops suggest the potential for extracting additional information from hf radar observations during 4d var that will be beneficial to the skill of the forecasts this will be explored in a future study credit
