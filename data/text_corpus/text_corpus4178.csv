20890,the hydrodynamics of an offshore stationary platform consisting of four cylindrical oscillating water column owc wave energy converters wecs are considered in this paper based on the potential flow theory a second order higher order boundary element method hobem model is developed to simulate the wave interaction with the multi owc platform in time domain laboratory tests of a carefully instrumented scale model are also conducted and the results from the two methods are compared for the validation it is found that the linear model overestimates the relative capture width of the owc device by approximately 10 around the resonant frequency subsequently the hydrodynamic properties of the multi owc platform are investigated systematically in terms of the air pressure and free surface oscillations in the chamber as well as the relative capture width the isolated cylindrical owc device is also considered for the comparison the effects of the incident wave direction the column and row spacing between the owc devices are explored the surface elevation distribution inside and around the owc device is discussed the occurrence of the maximum free surface elevation inside the chambers is found to lag behind the crest of the incident wave the optimum angle of wave incidence in terms of energy capture is β 0 i e multi owc platform aligned with the incoming waves a

energy is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy under development lópez et al 2013 however wave energy capturing technology is still relatively immature with only very few systems having reached commercial stage which highlights the need for further research ahamed et al 2020 among a variety of wave energy converters wecs the oscillating water column owc wec has been studied and applied widely due to its mechanical and structural simplicity zabala et al 2019 the owc device consists of a partially submerged chamber either fixed or freely floating and an air turbine falcão and henriques 2016 the air flow generated by the free surface rising and falling within the owc chamber i e the oscillating water column drives a bi directional air turbine coupled to a generator owc wecs have attained the full scale prototyping stage worldwide e g the oe buoy tested by marei in ireland which at the time of writing is about to be deployed off hawai the mighty whale in japan the oceanlinx mk3 in australia and the spar buoy owc in uk falcão and henriques 2016 moreover an owc plant has been in commercial operation in mutriku spain since 2011 ibarra berastegi et al 2018 however the real challenge for wave energy capturing technology is to develop wec s with lower costs and higher conversion efficiency gaebele et al 2020 to achieve this wecs will typically be deployed in arrays i e in the form of a wave farm so as to reduce the levelised cost of energy lcoe astariz and iglesias 2016 indeed for a wave farm the lcoe can be reduced by realizing economies of scale and sharing a number of elements such as the export cable or the mooring system astariz and iglesias 2015 de chowdhury et al 2015 in addition for certain arrangement the multi interactions among the wecs in a wave farm can lead to a higher power generation vicente et al 2009 nevertheless the commercial scale deployment of a wec farm is still uncompetitive when compared with other fuel based sources doyle and aggidis 2019 a multi functional marine platform equipped with wecs is a promising alternative which reduces the construction costs and utilizes the ocean space efficiently when compared to an individual floating platform and wec wan et al 2015 zhao et al 2020a and a number of novel concepts for multi purpose integrated platforms have been proposed naty et al 2016 zhao et al 2020b zhang et al 2017 proposed an elastic platform integrated with an array of floating buoyant columns which provides novel design guidelines for such facility it is found that the anti phase motions between the platform and buoyant columns can enhance the performance in terms of energy absorption zheng et al 2019a presented an analytical model to evaluate the performance of an array of owc wecs integrated into coastal structures the hydrodynamic interactions between the wecs and the coastline increase the power extraction significantly based on linear potential flow theory zheng et al doyle and aggidis 2019 further developed a semi analytical model to simulate a rectangular breakwater incorporating multi owc wecs the effects on the wave attenuation and power extraction of the power take off pto control strategies the number of chambers and the geometrical parameters were assessed systematically he et al 2017 carried out an experimental investigation to examine the wave power extraction of a dual chamber owc wec integrated into a floating breakwater it was concluded that the wec with a shallower chamber draft achieves a higher peak power extraction the functional integration between a wind turbine and an owc device is another successful concept for extracting multiple marine resources by means of one hybrid system perez collazo et al 2018 the characterization of a hybrid wind wave system which integrates an owc wec with an offshore wind turbine on a monopile foundation has been investigated experimentally and numerically by perez collazo et al 2019 based on the boundary element method bem zhou et al 2020 further discussed the hydrodynamic wave force on the monopile of this hybrid system based on linear potential flow theory michele et al 2019 developed an analytical model to analyze the effects of a skirt on an owc device integrated into an offshore wind turbine monopile sarmiento et al 2019 performed scaled model testing on a multi use floating platform embedded with three cylindrical owc devices the experimental result suggested that the turbine damping has limited influence on the hydrodynamic response of the whole floating platform mazarakos et al 2019 carried out a hydro aero elastic analysis of a floating wind turbine integrated with owc devices it was found that the pto damping has little influence on the horizontal motion of the platform in this work the hydrodynamics of an offshore stationary multi owc platform consisting of four cylindrical owc devices are simulated this platform could be integrated with an offshore wind turbine the optimized design arrangement of which could be informed by the hydrodynamic analysis carried out in this work extensive research on the wave interaction with owc devices either be a stand alone device or as a component of arrays has been carried out zheng et al 2019b using experimental theoretical and numerical analyses ulazia et al 2020 based on linear potential flow theory and the eigenfunction matching method martins rivas martins rivas and mei 2009 derived an analytical model for a thin walled owc device along a straight coast zheng et al 2019b further extended martins rivas s martins rivas and mei 2009 model to investigate the influence of the wall thickness radius and draft of the owc chamber on the wave power absorption the limitations associated with e g the wall thickness in martins rivas sarmiento et al 2019 were removed it is found that due to the wave reflection of the coast breakwater the capture efficiency can be twice as large as in the offshore case konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 presented an analytical model to evaluate the hydrodynamics of an array of freely floating owc devices the first and second order mean wave forces the air pressure and the capturing efficiency were considered konispoliatis et al 2016 further used this analytical method to solve the diffraction and radiation problems around a three unit array of owc platform nader et al 2014 applied a linear finite element method fem model to investigate the performance of an array of owc devices three different types of array arrangement were considered it is shown that the overall power extraction and the effective frequency bandwidth increase with the array arrangement considered the linear theory mentioned above is incapable in capturing all the detailed physics involved in the problem including strong nonlinearities complex viscous effects and vortex shedding rezanejad et al 2013 yang and zhang 2018 nonlinear numerical models have thus been developed and the experimental tests been conducted to investigate the strong nonlinear wave interaction with owc devices elhanafi et al 2017 ning et al 2019 a triangular arrayed spar buoy owc experiment was carried out to model the wave dynamics the energy extraction and the mooring system dynamics in both regular and irregular waves da fonseca et al 2016 it was observed that the spar buoy device with a heavier ballast can improve the energy conversion performance xu and huang 2018 performed a series of wave flume tests to evaluate the performance of a dual functional wave power plant such dual functional integration can not only significantly increase the capture width ratio of the owc devices but also reduce both the reflection and transmission coefficients when acting as a breakwater based on the navier stokes n s equations shalby et al 2019 constructed an incompressible 3d computational fluid dynamics model for the cases of a fixed multi chamber owc device the cfd predictions agree well with the experimental measurements collected in all chambers dai et al 2019 used the reynolds average navier stokes rans method to investigate the scale effects on a fixed owc device compared with the large scale model the small scale cfd simulation underestimates the peak capture factor by about 22 9 based on the rans based cfd model and experimental campaign lopez et al lópez et al 2020 quantified the error in the assessment of the capture width ratio of owcs when the air compressibility is neglected it was concluded that the errors could be significant on resonant period and capture width ratio simonetti et al 2018 evaluated the error induced by neglecting the air compressibility using a compressible cfd model an overestimation up to 15 occurs for both the air volume flux and the air pressure inside the owc chamber but less than 10 for the capture width ratio it has been demonstrated that the cfd type model can be an effective tool for investigating owc devices however the computational efficiency of these cfd models is low especially for the simulation of the 3d array owc devices ning et al 2015 huang et al 2019 recently the time domain boundary element method bem has been applied to simulate the nonlinear wave interaction with the owc devices wang et al 2018 koo and kim 2010 wang et al 2020 applied a 2d time domain higher order boundary element method hobem to investigate the wave loads on a land fixed dual chamber owc device a shorter curtain wall draft is suggested for the smaller wave load and larger power capture efficiency ning et al 2019 a 3d time domain hobem model is used to evaluate the wave loads on the monopile of a wind turbine integrated with a cylindrical owc device zhou et al 2020 this paper focuses on the study of the hydrodynamics of an offshore stationary multi owc platform the primary objective is to evaluate the wave energy capturing of the system using a nonlinear hobem numerical model the effects of the incident wave direction the column and row spacing on the hydrodynamic performance are considered the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents mathematics associated with a 3d nonlinear time domain hobem model a nonlinear pto damping effect is introduced on the surface boundary conditions inside the owc chamber to simulate the effects of the air turbine the numerical model is validated by comparison with the experimental results in section 3 section 4 discusses the effects of the wave direction and the array layout column and row spacing finally conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical model a second order time domain numerical model based on the higher order boundary element method is applied to simulate wave interactions with a multi owc platform bai and teng 2013 in the present study an array of four cylindrical owc devices is considered fig 1 shows the array layout a cartesian coordinate system is defined with its origin o at the center of the devices l x and l y denote the row and column spacing between the owc devices respectively and β is the incident wave direction i e the angle between the incident wave direction and the

scattered wave η s taylor and hung 1987 the wave field can be described by a complex velocity potential φ composed of both the incident potential φ i and the scattered potential φ s based on the second order perturbation expansion technique the scattered potential φ s satisfies the laplacian equation 1 2 φ s m 0 where the superscript m 1 2 denotes the order of approximations in satisfying the

owc device are set to the same with the chamber draft being labelled d the chamber wall thickness b w and the external diameter d a circular orifice with a diameter of d o is introduced to represent the turbine damping ning et al 2020 in order to satisfy the far field boundary condition a circular sponge layer is designed to absorb the scattered wave from the devices ferrant 1993 as shown in fig 2 the water column oscillates inside the chamber and viscous dissipation occurs simultaneously thus an additional damping term μ 1 in eqs 8 and 9 is introduced into the dynamic free surface boundary

and μ 2 can be determined by comparing with the experimental measurements the coefficients μ 1 and μ 2 are set to 0 for the free surface outside the owc chamber the above mixed boundary value problem can be solved by the boundary element method the mth order boundary integral equation for the scattered potential is 11 α s φ s m p s s φ s m q f g q f p s n g q f p s φ s m q f n d s where α s is the solid angle coefficient and the boundary surface s includes the mean free surface sof and sif and the mean wet solid surface sb g is the green function which is expressed as the sum of two sources isaacson et al 1993 12 g p s q f 1 4 π 1 r 0 1 r z where p s x 1 y 1 z 1 and q f x y z are the source point and the field point respectively and 13 r 0 x x 1 2 y y 1 2 z z 1 2 r z x x 1 2 y y 1 2 z z 1 2 h 2 this boundary integral equation is solved by applying the hobem in which the discretized elements and quadratic shape functions are introduced jin et al 2017 in the time domain the simulation is advanced using the fourth order adams bash forth predictor corrector scheme for capturing the time varying free surface once eq 11 is resolved the air pressure and wave motion in the chambers can be determined and the time averaged pneumatic power for each owc device can be calculated as morris thomas et al 2007 14 p o w c n s f p a i r n t q n t d s 1 t t t t s f π d 0 2 4 μ 2 u n t u n t 2 d

amplitude the relative capture width of each owc device is then calculated konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 16 ξ n p o w c n p i n c d 2 b w n 1 4 and the averaged relative capture width by the array owc devices is calculated following on the definition in konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 17 ξ 1 4 n 1 4 p o w c n p i n c d 2 b w 1 4 n 1 4 ξ n 3 model validation in order to validate the present numerical model a physical experiment of an isolated offshore stationary owc device was performed at a froude scale of 1 20 in a wave current flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology china the flume is 60 m long 4 m wide and 2 5 m high and a 9 m long beach is located at the end to absorb the outgoing waves the scaled owc model and the experimental setup are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the owc model was installed 20 m away from the wave maker allowing a full development of the incident waves before interact with the model owc device a cartesian coordinate system is defined with its origin o at the still water level as shown in fig 3 b the static water depth h is 1 0 m the main geometric parameters of the owc device were the chamber thickness b w 0 1 m the external diameter d 2r 0 8 m the chamber draft d 0 3 m and the chamber height d c 0 2 m as shown in fig 3 c the effects of flume walls include wave reflections from the walls are assumed to be small with a ratio of b d 5 where b 4 m is the width of the flume soares 1995 a circular orifice was introduced to model the pneumatic damping induced by the pto system for energy capturing ning et al 2016 noting that the dimensions of the owc were informed by performing analytical analysis mavrakos and konispoliatis 2012 prior to the experiments the draft d 0 3 m and the diameter of the chamber d 0 8 m were selected to ensure that the device has an effective frequency bandwidth of 1 kh 3 which are in line with the surrounding sea conditions that can be generated by the wave paddle in the wave flume aforementioned a relatively large optimal wave energy conversion is hence expected at least in terms of a single device and within the framework of linear wave theory the wall thickness was selected as d w h 0 1 to provide enough structural strength for the owc chamber wall four different orifice diameters were examined in the experiments and the corresponding relative capture width are calculated by measuring the chamber surface elevation and the air pressure it is found that for these diameters studied the diameter of d 0 0 104 m leads to the largest relative capture width at the resonant frequency of the device hence being selected for the analysis followed two resistive type wave gauges with a sampling rate of 100 hz are installed to measure the instantaneous free surface elevations inside the chamber at locations of g3 0 15 m 0 m 0 m and g4 0 15 m 0 m 0 m in addition two cy200 type pressure sensors with a sampling rate of 100 hz are used to measure the air pressure at locations of sa1 0 11 m 0 11 m 0 2 m and sa2 0 11 m 0 11 m 0 2 m respectively in the experiment a series of monochromatic waves are generated to simulate the real ocean wave with the same wave steepness ka 0 05 ning et al 2020 where the wave amplitude a varies with the wave number k the wave period t is in the range of 1 1s t 2 3s in the present study the experimental results are used to validate the hobem model the numerical model is set up to reproduce the experiments i e b w 0 1 m d 0 8 m d 0 3 m and h 1 m it is noted that the air compressibility is not represented here since the thermodynamic effects are considered to be small for small scaled physical modeling as is the case in the work medina lopez et al 2016 a sponge layer fig 2 with the radii r 0 λ and r 1 2λ is set to absorb the reflected waves from the owc device s the time step t is t 100 in which t is the wave period according to the convergence tests the computational domain is discretized into 1732 nodes and 492 elements on the free water surface and 588 nodes and 192 elements on the owc device surfaces the time histories of the free surface elevation and the air pressure inside the owc chamber are compared between the numerical and experimental results noted that μ 1 and μ 2 are tuned to be 0 03 and 1 443 respectively fig 4 shows the time series of the free surface elevations η at g3 and g4 and fig 5 shows the results of the chamber air pressure p air at kh 1 87 and 2 60 good agreements between the numerical and experimental results can be seen for both the long and short waves which verify the high accuracy of the present hobem model fig 6 shows the variations of the parameters of interest with the dimensionless wave number the amplitudes of the air pressure in the owc chamber p air max p t a i r min p t a i r 2 the free surface elevation in the owc chamber η a max η a t min η a t 2 and the relative capture width ξ of a single owc device are considered it can be seen that the resonance of the air pressure the free surface elevation and the relative capture width occur at the same condition kh 2 1 a similar phenomenon is observed in the analytical research zhou et al 2018 there is a discrepancy between the numerical solutions and the experimental results at kh 1 53 for all three parameters considered while the nonlinear solutions agree well with those from linear models at this particular condition a transverse sloshing mode of the wave flume occurs when the wavelength is close to the breadth of the wave flume i e at kh 1 53 ning et al 2020 gomes et al 2016 however there is no effects of side walls in the numerical model which are for a structure in an infinite domain nevertheless the current hobem model is still considered to be a promising tool for investigating the hydrodynamics of owc devices as this condition is found to be out of the resonant region the latter is of importance and of interest in this study however nonlinear models are found to work better around the resonant region when compared to the linear model 10 overestimation is observed for the linear model around the resonant region this supports the use of the proposed nonlinear model in modeling wave owc device interaction the present numerical model is further validated by comparing to solutions from a finite element model fem presented by nader et al 2014 an array of four owc devices that are arranged on a rectangular grid are considered the comparisons in terms of the air volume flux of the front device denoted owc 4 are shown in fig 7 the air volume flux is nondimensionalized by dividing by ωas f the incident wave direction is set as β 0 here the linear hobem model is considered with the damping coefficients μ 1 0 and μ 2 0 the geometric parameters of the arrayed owc devices are d h 0 2 b w h 0 05 d h 0 5 and l h 1 5 the same as those in neder et al nader et al 2014 it can be seen that good agreement is obtained indicating that the proposed hobem model is capable of investigating the hydrodynamic performance of multi owc devices both wave scattering from the arrayed devices and the interference effects between the devices can be captured accurately 4 results and discussions 4 1 effects of the incident wave direction it is well known that the hydrodynamic properties of the multi owc platform are strongly dependent upon the incident wave direction zheng et al 2019b in this section three different incident wave directions are considered i e β 0 π 8 and π 4 the row and column spacing between the devices are the same with l x l y 2d the main parameters of the owc device are selected as d 0 3 m b w 0 1 m d 0 8 m and d o 0 104 m these are the same as the isolated owc so as to allow a direct comparison hence the same artificial and pneumatic damping coefficients of the isolated owc are used i e μ 1 0 03 and μ 2 1 443 the wave steepness is also the same i e ka 0 05 the variations of the chamber air pressure p air the averaged chamber surface elevation η a and the relative capture width ξ n of each device with the dimensionless wave number are shown in figs 8 10 in which the corresponding results of an isolated owc device can also be found it is clear that the variations of p air η a and ξ show the similar main trends versus kh for each device i e they increase with kh to the maxima and then decrease with further increases of kh elhanafi and chan 2018 even though the incident wave directions are different in the low frequency region the hydrodynamics of both the arrayed and isolated owc devices are approaching to the same values this is not surprising as the scattered interaction is expected to be small when the ratio of the wavelength and the platform size is relatively large ning et al 2018 however the hydrodynamic properties of each owc device are rather different in the region of kh 1 25 compared with the isolated owc device the hydrodynamic efficiencies of owc 1 and owc 2 are always smaller for all three wave directions considered this is due to the fact that the wave scattered from the front two owc devices weakens the incident wave energy at the rear owc devices i e sheltering effects recall that the owcs 1 2 are arranged at the leeward side as shown in fig 1 in fig 10 a dashed thick line is marked to illustrate the effective frequency bandwidth with the reference value of ξ 20 i e the effective frequency bandwidth is defined to be the frequency range within which the efficiency is larger than 20 it is found that both the peak relative capture width and the effective frequency bandwidth increase as β decreases from π 4 to 0 in general it is noted that the relative capture width of owc 3 and owc 4 ξ 3 and ξ 4 reaches the peak values of 93 49 at kh 2 3 for β 0 the behaviors of these two component owc devices are the same as they are symmetric with each other for β 0 this suggests that the best performance in terms of wave energy capturing occurs when the arrayed owc system operates with its centerline heading to the prevailing surrounding seas nader et al 2012 the owcs 3 4 outperform the owcs 1 2 hence the efficiencies of the former can be used to represent the performance of the total system to a certain level it is noted that a better parameter notably the averaged relative capture width of the system will also be used and will be discussed later head on wave β 0 is the optimal condition for the maximum relative capture width as shown in fig 10 the energy of the multi scattering waves from the arrayed devices focuses inside the chambers of owc 3 and owc 4 which leads to a higher capability for capturing wave energy for β 0 zheng et al 2019a from fig 10 it also can be seen that the peak frequencies of each owc device vary in the range of 2 0 kh 2 3 which are close to the resonant frequency kh 2 1 of the corresponding isolated device nader et al 2012 also observed the similar phenomenon in modeling an array of four nine owc devices the shifts between the peak and resonant frequencies are due to the effects of the multi scattering waves between the owc devices in the array which can increase or decrease the air volume flux inside the owc chamber 4 2 wave distribution around the arrayed owc devices the spatial distribution of the wave field inside and around the owc devices is studied in this section the contour plots of the wave field under the wave incident directions β 0 and β π 4 are shown the same geometry and spacing parameters as in section 4 1 are used figs 11 and 12 show the dimensionless wave field at frequencies kh 2 3 and 2 0 respectively recalling that owcs 3 4 obtain the maximum wave energy capturing at kh 2 3 and 2 0 for β 0 and β π 4 respectively as shown in fig 10 c and d the blue arrow indicates the wave direction a dashed line is plotted to indicate the position of the incident wave crest it is clear that the wave fields are symmetrical about the incident wave direction due to the square arrangement of the devices in fig 11 a and b the total free surface elevations in the front and rear owc chambers increase to the maxima at t 0 9 t and t 1 6 t respectively the occurrence of the maximum free surface elevation inside the chambers is found to lag behind the crest of the incident wave outside the chambers in order to illustrate the phenomenon fig 11 c and d present the scattered wave field at the same instants t 0 9 t and t 1 6 t respectively it can be seen that the scattered surface wave fields inside the front and rear two devices generated by the device and then propagated inside the chambers reach their respective maximum values at these two instants respectively it is reasonable that the maximum total surface elevation resulting from both scattered and incident waves occurs after the incident crest passes the contribution of scattered waves is larger it can also be seen that the scattered surface elevation on the sponge layer is nearly zero which illustrates its effectiveness in absorbing the scattered wave in fig 11 a and c another two wave focusing areas crest and trough focus can be found in front of the arrayed owc devices this is due to the concentration of the reflected and incident waves in front of the device which can be explained by the standing wave induced by the straight wall voermans et al 2020 fig 12 presents the peak surface elevation in the owc chamber at t 0 8 t 1 2 t and 1 6 t for incident waves with β π 4 the peak scattered free surface elevations inside the owc chambers are smaller than those for owc 3 and owc 4 in fig 11 the multi scattered waves between the owc devices for this angle of attack weaken the total free surface elevation inside the chambers leading to the minimal relative capture width shown in fig 10 compared with the incident wave direction β 0 the interference hence the improvement in the relative capture width of the multi owc system arranged in the square configuration on the wave field is smaller at β π 4 this oblique orientation to the incident waves β π 4 would be therefore optimal in terms of safety in extreme sea conditions 4 3 effects of the column spacing in this section the effects of the column spacing l y on the hydrodynamics of the multi owc platform are discussed four different column spacings are considered l y d 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 4 0 the incident wave direction is β 0 the selected wave and geometry parameters are ka 0 05 d 0 3 m b w 0 1 m d 0 8 m l x d 2 0 and d o 0 104 m figs 13 15 present the dimensionless amplitudes of the chamber air pressure p air the averaged chamber surface elevation η a and the relative capture width of the owc 1 and owc 3 versus kh respectively due to the symmetry of the platform geometry and the incident waves the hydrodynamics of owc 3 and owc 2 are the same as those of owc 1 and owc 4 respectively hence not shown here for brevity the column spacing l y between the devices plays a greater role on the hydrodynamics of the front owc devices owc 3 and owc 4 than on the rear devices owc1 and owc2 as can be seen from figs 13 15 the peak values of the air pressure p air the surface elevation η a and the relative capture width of owc 3 increase as the column spacing l y d decreases from 4 0 to 1 5 for its part the peak frequency increases from kh 2 1 to 2 3 with the corresponding wavelength decreasing from λ 3 0 m 2 73 m this is explained by the fact that the hydrodynamic interaction between the devices is enhanced with a smaller l y d the shorter wave contributes more to excite the resonance with a smaller column distance l y d due to the phenomenon of so called narrow slit resonance lin and zhang 2019 the maximum relative capture width of owc 3 is ξ 3 104 5 at kh 2 3 with l y d 1 5 it is not surprising that the efficiency characterized by the relative capture width is larger than 100 as the local wave field now is more complex and concentrate more energy from wave scattering or reflection similar phenomena are also presented in zheng et al 2019a nader et al 2012 for which the owc device is arranged in front of a straight coast and arranged in an array respectively as for the rear owc devices owc1 and owc2 the hydrodynamic amplitudes behave in the opposite way i e decrease as the column space l y d decreases although the variation is small this can be explained by the fact that the reduction in column spacing l y d restricts the amount of wave energy passing through and propagating to the rear devices it is noted that there are two hydrodynamic peaks for the case with column spacing l y d 4 0 the first peak corresponds to the natural frequency which is same as that of the isolated owc device the second peak occurs at kh 2 6 with the corresponding dimensionless wavelength λ d 3 it is also worth mentioning that a wider effective frequency bandwidth is found for this column spacing nevertheless it is still recommended that the array arrangement with a column spacing l y d 4 0 should be avoided as its general relative capture width is low due to the weaker interactions between waves and devices for large column spacings 4 4 effects of the row spacing it is well known that the row spacing l x d also plays a significant role in the hydrodynamic properties of the multi owc platform nader et al 2012 in this section the wave steepness is ka 0 05 and the platform is exposed to waves with the direction β 0 four row spacings l x d 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 4 0 are explored to investigate its effects on p air η a of the owc chamber and ξ as shown in figs 16 18 the isolated owc device is also considered for direct comparison the geometry parameters of the owc devices are the same as those in section 4 3 as with the numerical experiments investigating the effects of l y d the front owc devices are found to be more sensitive to the row spacing l x d than the rear devices in fig 18 b the peak efficiencies of owc 3 are 44 6 93 5 120 6 and 105 8 for the row spacing l x d 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 4 0 respectively the corresponding peak frequencies are kh 2 2 2 3 2 15 and 2 3 respectively as might be expected the relative capture width of owc 1 is lower when compared to the isolated device due to the sheltering effect of the front devices it may also be concluded that the arrayed owc devices with a smaller row spacing l x d 1 5 result in a low capability for wave energy capturing for this reason the multi owc platform should be designed with a row spacing l x d 2 0 for a certain row spacing the peak frequencies of p air the η a and ξ are within the range of 2 15 kh 2 25 close to the natural frequency of the isolated owc device kh 2 1 it is noted that a bimodal curve can be seen for the row spacing l x d 4 0 the first peak frequency occurs at kh 1 45 with a wave length λ d 4 33 which is close to the row spacing l x d 4 0 the scattered waves reflected from the rear devices contributing to a large oscillation amplitude in the chamber from fig 18 it can also be seen that the effective frequency bandwidth varies slightly with the row spacing hence the row spacing needs to be carefully determined in order to obtain an optimal relative capture width 4 5 hydrodynamics of the optimized multi owc platform finally the hydrodynamic properties of the optimized multi owc platform are explored for the incident wave direction β 0 the geometry parameters of the owc device are the same as those in previous sections according to the analysis in sections 4 3 and 4 4 the optimal column and row spacing are selected as l y d 2 5 and l x d 1 5 respectively fig 19 shows the comparison between the optimized multi owc platform represented by the owc 1 and owc 3 results for owc 2 and 4 are not shown for brevity and the isolated owc device it can be seen that the amplitudes of the chamber air pressure oscillation chamber free surface elevation and relative capture width of the owc 3 are larger than those of an isolated device in the frequency range of 1 6 kh 2 75 due to the sheltering effect of the front devices the relative capture width of owc 1 is lower in the low and intermediate frequency region however in the high frequency domain another resonance occurs at the rear owc device which leads to a higher capturing capability in fig 19 c the peak relative capture width of owc 3 reaches 127 8 at the frequency kh 2 3 and the effective frequency bandwidth 1 6 kh 2 68 increases towards the high frequency region in comparison to the isolated device the averaged relative capture width of the multi owc platform further illustrates the interest of the multi owc platform the lower relative capture width of the rear devices notwithstanding 5 conclusions in this study the hydrodynamic performance in terms of wave energy capturing of a 3d multi owc platform is investigated numerically based on the potential flow theory a second order time domain hobem model is developed to simulate the wave interactions with the multi owc platform a nonlinear pto system is modeled by an orifice on the top of the owc chamber the developed model is validated by comparison to a physical experiment with a froude scale of 1 20 the validated model is subsequently extended to investigate the hydrodynamics of the multi owc platform systematically the hydrodynamic performance characterized by the chamber air pressure oscillation amplitude the chamber free surface oscillation amplitude and the relative capture width is investigated three different incident wave directions are considered to explore the effect of wave incident direction which is of importance as the real offshore wave conditions are highly directional the multi owc platform arranged with its centerline heading to the prevailing surrounding seas β 0 shows a significant improvement in capturing wave energy when compared to the corresponding isolated owc device the variations of the surface elevation distribution inside and around the owc devices are discussed including the total and scattered surface elevations the occurrence of the maximum free surface elevation inside the chambers is found to lag behind the crest of the incident wave the effects of the column and row spacing on the hydrodynamics of the arrayed owc devices are explored a narrow column spacing between the owc devices can significantly enhance the total power output the relatively lower relative capture width of the rear devices notwithstanding a strategic selection of the row spacing can produce an optimal relative capture width superior to that of the isolated owc the proposed multi owc platform is assumed to be offshore and stationary the effects of the mooring line are not considered in the numerical model a series of regular waves are simulated whereas irregular waves exist in the real ocean environment therefore further work will concentrate on the effects of both the regular and irregular waves on the relative capture width and wave loads of a floating

20890,the hydrodynamics of an offshore stationary platform consisting of four cylindrical oscillating water column owc wave energy converters wecs are considered in this paper based on the potential flow theory a second order higher order boundary element method hobem model is developed to simulate the wave interaction with the multi owc platform in time domain laboratory tests of a carefully instrumented scale model are also conducted and the results from the two methods are compared for the validation it is found that the linear model overestimates the relative capture width of the owc

energy is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy under development lópez et al 2013 however wave energy capturing technology is still relatively immature with only very few systems having reached commercial stage which highlights the need for further research ahamed et al 2020 among a variety of wave energy converters wecs the oscillating water column owc wec has been studied and applied widely due to its mechanical and structural simplicity zabala et al 2019 the owc device consists of a partially submerged chamber either fixed or freely floating and an air turbine falcão and henriques 2016 the air flow generated by the free surface rising and falling within the owc chamber i e the oscillating water column drives a bi directional air turbine coupled to a generator owc wecs have attained the full scale prototyping stage worldwide e g the oe buoy tested by marei in ireland which at the time of writing is about to be deployed off hawai the mighty whale in japan the oceanlinx mk3 in australia and the spar buoy owc in uk falcão and henriques 2016 moreover an owc plant has been in commercial operation in mutriku spain since 2011 ibarra berastegi et al 2018 however the real challenge for wave energy capturing technology is to develop wec s with lower costs and higher conversion efficiency gaebele et al 2020 to achieve this wecs will typically be deployed in arrays i e in the form of a wave farm so as to reduce the levelised cost of energy lcoe astariz and iglesias 2016 indeed for a wave farm the lcoe can be reduced by realizing economies of scale and sharing a number of elements such as the export cable or the mooring system astariz and iglesias 2015 de chowdhury et al 2015 in addition for certain arrangement the multi interactions among the wecs in a wave farm can lead to a higher power generation vicente et al 2009 nevertheless the commercial scale deployment of a wec farm is still uncompetitive when compared with other fuel based sources doyle and aggidis 2019 a multi functional marine platform equipped with wecs is a promising alternative which reduces the construction costs and utilizes the ocean space efficiently when compared to an individual floating platform and wec wan et al 2015 zhao et al 2020a and a number of novel concepts for multi purpose integrated platforms have been proposed naty et al 2016 zhao et al 2020b zhang et al 2017 proposed an elastic platform integrated with an array of floating buoyant columns which provides novel design guidelines for such facility it is found that the anti phase motions between the platform and buoyant columns can enhance the performance in terms of energy absorption zheng et al 2019a presented an analytical model to evaluate the performance of an array of owc wecs integrated into coastal structures the hydrodynamic interactions between the wecs and the coastline increase the power extraction significantly based on linear potential flow theory zheng et al doyle and aggidis 2019 further developed a semi analytical model to simulate a rectangular breakwater incorporating multi owc wecs the effects on the wave attenuation and power extraction of the power take off pto control strategies the number of chambers and the geometrical parameters were assessed systematically he et al 2017 carried out an experimental investigation to examine the wave power extraction of a dual chamber owc wec integrated into a floating breakwater it was concluded that the wec with a shallower chamber draft achieves a higher peak power extraction the functional integration between a wind turbine and an owc device is another successful concept for extracting multiple marine resources by means of one hybrid system perez collazo et al 2018 the characterization of a hybrid wind wave system which integrates an owc wec with an offshore wind turbine on a monopile foundation has been investigated experimentally and numerically by perez collazo et al 2019 based on the boundary element method bem zhou et al 2020 further discussed the hydrodynamic wave force on the monopile of this hybrid system based on linear potential flow theory michele et al 2019 developed an analytical model to analyze the effects of a skirt on an owc device integrated into an offshore wind turbine monopile sarmiento et al 2019 performed scaled model testing on a multi use floating platform embedded with three cylindrical owc devices the experimental result suggested that the turbine damping has limited influence on the hydrodynamic response of the whole floating platform mazarakos et al 2019 carried out a hydro aero elastic analysis of a floating wind turbine integrated with owc devices it was found that the pto damping has little influence on the horizontal motion of the platform in this work the hydrodynamics of an offshore stationary multi owc platform consisting of four cylindrical owc devices are simulated this platform could be integrated with an offshore wind turbine the optimized design arrangement of which could be informed by the hydrodynamic analysis carried out in this work extensive research on the wave interaction with owc devices either be a stand alone device or as a component of arrays has been carried out zheng et al 2019b using experimental theoretical and numerical analyses ulazia et al 2020 based on linear potential flow theory and the eigenfunction matching method martins rivas martins rivas and mei 2009 derived an analytical model for a thin walled owc device along a straight coast zheng et al 2019b further extended martins rivas s martins rivas and mei 2009 model to investigate the influence of the wall thickness radius and draft of the owc chamber on the wave power absorption the limitations associated with e g the wall thickness in martins rivas sarmiento et al 2019 were removed it is found that due to the wave reflection of the coast breakwater the capture efficiency can be twice as large as in the offshore case konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 presented an analytical model to evaluate the hydrodynamics of an array of freely floating owc devices the first and second order mean wave forces the air pressure and the capturing efficiency were considered konispoliatis et al 2016 further used this analytical method to solve the diffraction and radiation problems around a three unit array of owc platform nader et al 2014 applied a linear finite element method fem model to investigate the performance of an array of owc devices three different types of array arrangement were considered it is shown that the overall power extraction and the effective frequency bandwidth increase with the array arrangement considered the linear theory mentioned above is incapable in capturing all the detailed physics involved in the problem including strong nonlinearities complex viscous effects and vortex shedding rezanejad et al 2013 yang and zhang 2018 nonlinear numerical models have thus been developed and the experimental tests been conducted to investigate the strong nonlinear wave interaction with owc devices elhanafi et al 2017 ning et al 2019 a triangular arrayed spar buoy owc experiment was carried out to model the wave dynamics the energy extraction and the mooring system dynamics in both regular and irregular waves da fonseca et al 2016 it was observed that the spar buoy device with a heavier ballast can improve the energy conversion performance xu and huang 2018 performed a series of wave flume tests to evaluate the performance of a dual functional wave power plant such dual functional integration can not only significantly increase the capture width ratio of the owc devices but also reduce both the reflection and transmission coefficients when acting as a breakwater based on the navier stokes n s equations shalby et al 2019 constructed an incompressible 3d computational fluid dynamics model for the cases of a fixed multi chamber owc device the cfd predictions agree well with the experimental measurements collected in all chambers dai et al 2019 used the reynolds average navier stokes rans method to investigate the scale effects on a fixed owc device compared with the large scale model the small scale cfd simulation underestimates the peak capture factor by about 22 9 based on the rans based cfd model and experimental campaign lopez et al lópez et al 2020 quantified the error in the assessment of the capture width ratio of owcs when the air compressibility is neglected it was concluded that the errors could be significant on resonant period and capture width ratio simonetti et al 2018 evaluated the error induced by neglecting the air compressibility using a compressible cfd model an overestimation up to 15 occurs for both the air volume flux and the air pressure inside the owc chamber but less than 10 for the capture width ratio it has been demonstrated that the cfd type model can be an effective tool for investigating owc devices however the computational efficiency of these cfd models is low especially for the simulation of the 3d array owc devices ning et al 2015 huang et al 2019 recently the time domain boundary element method bem has been applied to simulate the nonlinear wave interaction with the owc devices wang et al 2018 koo and kim 2010 wang et al 2020 applied a 2d time domain higher order boundary element method hobem to investigate the wave loads on a land fixed dual chamber owc device a shorter curtain wall draft is suggested for the smaller wave load and larger power capture efficiency ning et al 2019 a 3d time domain hobem model is used to evaluate the wave loads on the monopile of a wind turbine integrated with a cylindrical owc device zhou et al 2020 this paper focuses on the study of the hydrodynamics of an offshore stationary multi owc platform the primary objective is to evaluate the wave energy capturing of the system using a nonlinear hobem numerical model the effects of the incident wave direction the column and row spacing on the hydrodynamic performance are considered the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents mathematics associated with a 3d nonlinear time domain hobem model a nonlinear pto damping effect is introduced on the surface boundary conditions inside the owc chamber to simulate the effects of the air turbine the numerical model is validated by comparison with the experimental results in section 3 section 4 discusses the effects of the wave direction and the array layout column and row spacing finally conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical model a second order time domain numerical model based on the higher order boundary element method is applied to simulate wave interactions with a multi owc platform bai and teng 2013 in the present study an array of four cylindrical owc devices is considered fig 1 shows the array layout a cartesian coordinate system is defined with its origin o at the

scattered wave η s taylor and hung 1987 the wave field can be described by a complex velocity potential φ composed of both the incident potential φ i and the scattered potential φ s based on the

the turbine damping ning et al 2020 in order to satisfy the far field boundary condition a circular sponge layer is designed to absorb the scattered wave from the devices ferrant 1993 as shown in fig 2 the water column oscillates inside the chamber and viscous dissipation occurs simultaneously thus an additional damping term μ 1 in eqs 8 and 9 is introduced into the dynamic free surface boundary

and μ 2 can be determined by comparing with the experimental measurements the coefficients μ 1 and μ 2 are set to 0 for the free surface outside the owc chamber the above mixed boundary value problem

is advanced using the fourth order adams bash forth predictor corrector scheme for capturing the time varying free surface once eq 11 is resolved the air pressure and wave motion in the chambers can be determined and the time averaged pneumatic power for each owc device can be calculated as morris thomas et al 2007 14 p o w c n s f p a i r n t q n t d s 1 t t t t s f π d 0 2 4 μ 2 u n t u n t 2 d

numerical model a physical experiment of an isolated offshore stationary owc device was performed at a froude scale of 1 20 in a wave current flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology china the flume is 60 m long 4 m wide and 2 5 m high and a 9 m long beach is located at the end to absorb the outgoing waves the scaled owc model and the experimental setup are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the owc model was installed 20 m away from the wave maker allowing a full development of the incident waves before interact with the model owc device a cartesian coordinate system is defined with its origin o at the still water level as shown in fig 3 b the static water depth h is 1 0 m the main geometric parameters of the owc device were the chamber thickness b w 0 1 m the external diameter d 2r 0 8 m the chamber draft d 0 3 m and the chamber height d c 0 2 m as shown in fig 3 c the effects of flume walls include wave reflections from the walls are assumed to be small with a ratio of b d 5 where b 4 m is the width of the flume soares 1995 a circular orifice was introduced to model the pneumatic damping induced by the pto system for energy capturing ning et al 2016 noting that the dimensions of the owc were informed by performing analytical analysis mavrakos and konispoliatis 2012 prior to the experiments the draft d 0 3 m and the diameter of the chamber d 0 8 m were selected to ensure that the device has an effective frequency bandwidth of 1 kh 3 which are in line with the surrounding sea conditions that can be generated by the wave paddle in the wave flume aforementioned a relatively large optimal wave energy conversion is hence expected at least in terms of a single device and within the framework of linear wave theory the wall thickness was selected as d w h 0 1 to provide enough structural strength for the owc chamber wall four different orifice diameters were examined in the experiments and the corresponding relative capture width are calculated by measuring the chamber surface elevation and the air pressure it is found that for these diameters studied the diameter of d 0 0 104 m leads to the largest relative capture width at the resonant frequency of the device hence being selected for the analysis followed two resistive type wave gauges with a sampling rate of 100 hz are installed to measure the instantaneous free surface elevations inside the chamber at locations of g3 0 15 m 0 m 0 m and g4 0 15 m 0 m 0 m in addition two cy200 type pressure sensors with a sampling rate of 100 hz are used to measure the air pressure at locations of sa1 0 11 m 0 11 m 0 2 m and sa2 0 11 m 0 11 m 0 2 m respectively in the experiment a series of monochromatic waves are generated to simulate the real ocean wave with the same wave steepness ka 0 05 ning et al 2020 where the wave amplitude a varies with the wave number k the wave period t is in the range of 1 1s t 2 3s in the present study the experimental results are used to validate the hobem model the numerical model is set up to reproduce the experiments i e b w 0 1 m d 0 8 m d 0 3 m and h 1 m it is noted that the air compressibility is not represented here since the thermodynamic effects are considered to be small for small scaled physical modeling as is the case in the work medina lopez et al 2016 a sponge layer fig 2 with the radii r 0 λ and r 1 2λ is set to absorb the reflected waves from the owc device s the time step t is t 100 in which t is the wave period according to the convergence tests the computational domain is discretized into 1732 nodes and 492 elements on the free water surface and 588 nodes and 192 elements on the owc device surfaces the time histories of the free surface elevation and the air pressure inside the owc chamber are compared between the numerical and experimental results noted that μ 1 and μ 2 are tuned to be 0 03 and 1 443 respectively fig 4 shows the time series of the free surface elevations η at g3 and g4 and fig 5 shows the results of the chamber air pressure p air at kh 1 87 and 2 60 good agreements between the numerical and experimental results can be seen for both the long and short waves which verify the high accuracy of the present hobem model fig 6 shows the variations of the parameters of interest with the dimensionless wave number the amplitudes of the air pressure in the owc chamber p air max p t a i r min p t a i r 2 the free surface elevation in the owc chamber η a max η a t min η a t 2 and the relative capture width ξ of a single owc device are considered it can be seen that the resonance of the air pressure the free surface elevation and the relative capture width occur at the same condition kh 2 1 a similar phenomenon is observed in the analytical research zhou et al 2018 there is a discrepancy between the numerical solutions and the experimental results at kh 1 53 for all three parameters considered while the nonlinear solutions agree well with those from linear models at this particular condition a transverse sloshing mode of the wave flume occurs when the wavelength is close to the breadth of the wave flume i e at kh 1 53 ning et al 2020 gomes et al 2016 however there is no effects of side walls in the numerical model which are for a structure in an infinite domain nevertheless the current hobem model is still considered to be a promising tool for investigating the hydrodynamics of owc devices as this condition is found to be out of the resonant region the latter is of importance and of interest in this study however nonlinear models are found to work better around the resonant region when compared to the linear model 10 overestimation is observed for the linear model around the resonant region this supports the use of the proposed nonlinear model in modeling wave owc device interaction the present numerical model is further validated by comparing to solutions from a finite element model fem presented by nader et al 2014 an array of four owc devices that are arranged on a rectangular grid are considered the comparisons in terms of the air volume flux of the front device denoted owc 4 are shown in fig 7 the air volume flux is nondimensionalized by dividing by ωas f the incident wave direction is set as β 0 here the linear hobem model is considered with the damping coefficients μ 1 0 and μ 2 0 the geometric parameters of the arrayed owc devices are d h 0 2 b w h 0 05 d h 0 5 and l h 1 5 the same as those in neder et al nader et al 2014 it can be seen that good agreement is obtained indicating that the proposed hobem model is capable of investigating the hydrodynamic performance of multi owc devices both wave scattering from the arrayed devices and the interference effects between the devices can be captured accurately 4 results and discussions 4 1 effects of the incident wave direction it is well known that the hydrodynamic properties of the multi owc platform are strongly dependent upon the incident wave direction zheng et al 2019b in this section three different incident wave directions are considered i e β 0 π 8 and π 4 the row and column spacing between the devices are the same with l x l y 2d the main parameters of the owc device are selected as d 0 3 m b w 0 1 m d 0 8 m and d o 0 104 m these are the same as the isolated owc so as to allow a direct comparison hence the same artificial and pneumatic damping coefficients of the isolated owc are used i e μ 1 0 03 and μ 2 1 443 the wave steepness is also the same i e ka 0 05 the variations of the chamber air pressure p air the averaged chamber surface elevation η a and the relative capture width ξ n of each device with the dimensionless wave number are shown in figs 8 10 in which the corresponding results of an isolated owc device can also be found it is clear that the variations of p air η a and ξ show the similar main trends versus kh for each device i e they increase with kh to the maxima and then decrease with further increases of kh elhanafi and chan 2018 even though the incident wave directions are different in the low frequency region the hydrodynamics of both the arrayed and isolated owc devices are approaching to the same values this is not surprising as the scattered interaction is expected to be small when the ratio of the wavelength and the platform size is relatively large ning et al 2018 however the hydrodynamic properties of each owc device are rather different in the region of kh 1 25 compared with the isolated owc device the hydrodynamic efficiencies of owc 1 and owc 2 are always smaller for all three wave directions considered this is due to the fact that the wave scattered from the front two owc devices weakens the incident wave energy at the rear owc devices i e sheltering effects recall that the owcs 1 2 are arranged at the leeward side as shown in fig 1 in fig 10 a dashed thick line is marked to illustrate the effective frequency bandwidth with the reference value of ξ 20 i e the effective frequency bandwidth is defined to be the frequency range within which the efficiency is larger than 20 it is found that both the peak relative capture width and the effective frequency bandwidth increase as β decreases from π 4 to 0 in general it is noted that the relative capture width of owc 3 and owc 4 ξ 3 and ξ 4 reaches the peak values of 93 49 at kh 2 3 for β 0 the behaviors of these two component owc devices are the same as they are symmetric with each other for β 0 this suggests that the best performance in terms of wave energy capturing occurs when the arrayed owc system operates with its centerline heading to the prevailing surrounding seas nader et al 2012 the owcs 3 4 outperform the owcs 1 2 hence the efficiencies of the former can be used to represent the performance of the total system to a certain level it is noted that a better parameter notably the averaged relative capture width of the system will also be used and will be discussed later head on wave β 0 is the optimal condition for the maximum relative capture width as shown in fig 10 the energy of the multi scattering waves from the arrayed devices focuses inside the chambers of owc 3 and owc 4 which leads to a higher capability for capturing wave energy for β 0 zheng et al 2019a from fig 10 it also can be seen that the peak frequencies of each owc device vary in the range of 2 0 kh 2 3 which are close to the resonant frequency kh 2 1 of the corresponding isolated device nader et al 2012 also observed the similar phenomenon in modeling an array of four nine owc devices the shifts between the peak and resonant frequencies are due to the effects of the multi scattering waves between the owc devices in the array which can increase or decrease the air volume flux inside the owc chamber 4 2 wave distribution around the arrayed owc devices the spatial distribution of the wave field inside and around the owc devices is studied in this section the contour plots of the wave field under the wave incident directions β 0 and β π 4 are shown the same geometry and spacing parameters as in section 4 1 are used figs 11 and 12 show the dimensionless wave field at frequencies kh 2 3 and 2 0 respectively recalling that owcs 3 4 obtain the maximum wave energy capturing at kh 2 3 and 2 0 for β 0 and β π 4 respectively as shown in fig 10 c and d the blue arrow indicates the wave direction a dashed line is plotted to indicate the position of the incident wave crest it is clear that the wave fields are symmetrical about the incident wave direction due to the square arrangement of the devices in fig 11 a and b the total free surface elevations in the front and rear owc chambers increase to the maxima at t 0 9 t and t 1 6 t respectively the occurrence of the maximum free surface elevation inside the chambers is found to lag behind the crest of the incident wave outside the chambers in order to illustrate the phenomenon fig 11 c and d present the scattered wave field at the same instants t 0 9 t and t 1 6 t respectively it can be seen that the scattered surface wave fields inside the front and rear two devices generated by the device and then propagated inside the chambers reach their respective maximum values at these two instants respectively it is reasonable that the maximum total surface elevation resulting from both scattered and incident waves occurs after the incident crest passes the contribution of scattered waves is larger it can also be seen that the scattered surface elevation on the sponge layer is nearly zero which illustrates its effectiveness in absorbing the scattered wave in fig 11 a and c another two wave focusing areas crest and trough focus can be found in front of the arrayed owc devices this is due to the concentration of the reflected and incident waves in front of the device which can be explained by the standing wave induced by the straight wall voermans et al 2020 fig 12 presents the peak surface elevation in the owc chamber at t 0 8 t 1 2 t and 1 6 t for incident waves with β π 4 the peak scattered free surface elevations inside the owc chambers are smaller than those for owc 3 and owc 4 in fig 11 the multi scattered waves between the owc devices for this angle of attack weaken the total free surface elevation inside the chambers leading to the minimal relative capture width shown in fig 10 compared with the incident wave direction β 0 the interference hence the improvement in the relative capture width of the multi owc system arranged in the square configuration on the wave field is smaller at β π 4 this oblique orientation to the incident waves β π 4 would be therefore optimal in terms of safety in extreme sea conditions 4 3 effects of the column spacing in this section the effects of the column spacing l y on the hydrodynamics of the multi owc platform are discussed four different column spacings are considered l y d 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 4 0 the incident wave direction is β 0 the selected wave and geometry parameters are ka 0 05 d 0 3 m b w 0 1 m d 0 8 m l x d 2 0 and d o 0 104 m figs 13 15 present the dimensionless amplitudes of the chamber air pressure p air the averaged chamber surface elevation η a and the relative capture width of the owc 1 and owc 3 versus kh respectively due to the symmetry of the platform geometry and the incident waves the hydrodynamics of owc 3 and owc 2 are the same as those of owc 1 and owc 4 respectively hence not shown here for brevity the column spacing l y between the devices plays a greater role on the hydrodynamics of the front owc devices owc 3 and owc 4 than on the rear devices owc1 and owc2 as can be seen from figs 13 15 the peak values of the air pressure p air the surface elevation η a and the relative capture width of owc 3 increase as the column spacing l y d decreases from 4 0 to 1 5 for its part the peak frequency increases from kh 2 1 to 2 3 with the corresponding wavelength decreasing from λ 3 0 m 2 73 m this is explained by the fact that the hydrodynamic interaction between the devices is enhanced with a smaller l y d the shorter wave contributes more to excite the resonance with a smaller column distance l y d due to the phenomenon of so called narrow slit resonance lin and zhang 2019 the maximum relative capture width of owc 3 is ξ 3 104 5 at kh 2 3 with l y d 1 5 it is not surprising that the efficiency characterized by the relative capture width is larger than 100 as the local wave field now is more complex and concentrate more energy from wave scattering or reflection similar phenomena are also presented in zheng et al 2019a nader et al 2012 for which the owc device is arranged in front of a straight coast and arranged in an array respectively as for the rear owc devices owc1 and owc2 the hydrodynamic amplitudes behave in the opposite way i e decrease as the column space l y d decreases although the variation is small this can be explained by the fact that the reduction in column spacing l y d restricts the amount of wave energy passing through and propagating to the rear devices it is noted that there are two hydrodynamic peaks for the case with column spacing l y d 4 0 the first peak corresponds to the natural frequency which is same as that of the isolated owc device the second peak occurs at kh 2 6 with the corresponding dimensionless wavelength λ d 3 it is also worth mentioning that a wider effective frequency bandwidth is found for this column spacing nevertheless it is still recommended that the array arrangement with a column spacing l y d 4 0 should be avoided as its general relative capture width is low due to the weaker interactions between waves and devices for large column spacings 4 4 effects of the row spacing it is well known that the row spacing l x d also plays a significant role in the hydrodynamic properties of the multi owc platform nader et al 2012 in this section the wave steepness is ka 0 05 and the platform is exposed to waves with the direction β 0 four row spacings l x d 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 4 0 are explored to investigate its effects on p air η a of the owc chamber and ξ as shown in figs 16 18 the isolated owc device is also considered for direct comparison the geometry parameters of the owc devices are the same as those in section 4 3 as with the numerical experiments investigating the effects of l y d the front owc devices are found to be more sensitive to the row spacing l x d than the rear devices in fig 18 b the peak efficiencies of owc 3 are 44 6 93 5 120 6 and 105 8 for the row spacing l x d 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 4 0 respectively the corresponding peak frequencies are kh 2 2 2 3 2 15 and 2 3 respectively as might be expected the relative capture width of owc 1 is lower when compared to the isolated device due to the sheltering effect of the front devices it may also be concluded that the arrayed owc devices with a smaller row spacing l x d 1 5 result in a low capability for wave energy capturing for this reason the multi owc platform should be designed with a row spacing l x d 2 0 for a certain row spacing the peak frequencies of p air the η a and ξ are within the range of 2 15 kh 2 25 close to the natural frequency of the isolated owc device kh 2 1 it is noted that a bimodal curve can be seen for the row spacing l x d 4 0 the first peak frequency occurs at kh 1 45 with a wave length λ d 4 33 which is close to the row spacing l x d 4 0 the scattered waves reflected from the rear devices contributing to a large oscillation amplitude in the chamber from fig 18 it can also be seen that the effective frequency bandwidth varies slightly with the row spacing hence the row spacing needs to be carefully determined in order to obtain an optimal relative capture width 4 5 hydrodynamics of the optimized multi owc platform finally the hydrodynamic properties of the optimized multi owc platform are explored for the incident wave direction β 0 the geometry parameters of the owc device are the same as those in previous sections according to the analysis in sections 4 3 and 4 4 the optimal column and row spacing are selected as l y d 2 5 and l x d 1 5 respectively fig 19 shows the comparison between the optimized multi owc platform represented by the owc 1 and owc 3 results for owc 2 and 4 are not shown for brevity and the isolated owc device it can be seen that the amplitudes of the chamber air pressure oscillation chamber free surface elevation and relative capture width of the owc 3 are larger than those of an isolated device in the frequency range of 1 6 kh 2 75 due to the sheltering effect of the front devices the relative capture width of owc 1 is lower in the low and intermediate frequency region however in the high frequency domain another resonance occurs at the rear owc device which leads to a higher capturing capability in fig 19 c the peak relative capture width of owc 3 reaches 127 8 at the frequency kh 2 3 and the effective frequency bandwidth 1 6 kh 2 68 increases towards the high frequency region in comparison to the isolated device the averaged relative capture width of the multi owc platform further illustrates the interest of the multi owc platform the lower relative capture width of the rear devices notwithstanding 5 conclusions in this study the hydrodynamic performance in terms of wave energy capturing of a 3d multi owc platform is investigated numerically based on the potential flow theory a second order time domain hobem model is developed to simulate the wave interactions with the multi owc platform a nonlinear pto system is modeled by an orifice on the top of the owc chamber the developed model is validated by comparison to a physical experiment with a froude scale of 1 20 the validated model is subsequently extended to investigate the hydrodynamics of the multi owc platform systematically the hydrodynamic performance characterized by the chamber air pressure oscillation amplitude the chamber free surface oscillation amplitude and the relative capture width is investigated three different incident wave directions are considered to explore the effect of wave incident direction which is of importance as the real offshore wave conditions are highly directional the multi owc platform arranged with its centerline heading to the prevailing surrounding seas β 0 shows a significant improvement in capturing wave energy when compared to the corresponding isolated owc device the variations of the surface elevation distribution inside and around the owc devices are discussed including the total and scattered surface elevations the occurrence of the maximum free surface elevation inside the chambers is found to lag behind the crest of the incident wave the effects of the column and row spacing on the hydrodynamics of the arrayed owc devices are explored a narrow column spacing between the owc devices can significantly enhance the total power output the relatively lower relative capture width of the rear devices notwithstanding a strategic selection of the row spacing can produce an optimal relative capture width superior to that of the isolated owc the proposed multi owc platform is assumed to be offshore and stationary the effects of the mooring line are not considered in the numerical model a series of regular waves are simulated whereas irregular waves exist in the real ocean environment therefore further work will concentrate on the effects of both the regular and irregular waves on the relative capture width and wave loads of a floating

20891,the present paper investigates the significance of gyroscopic effects on responses of floating offshore wind turbines fowts a 17 degree of freedom dof fowt model is rigorously developed using the euler lagrange approach based on rational approximation of the radiation loads an extended state space formulation is then established for the coupled mechanical hydrodynamic controller system enabling very efficient time domain simulations different strategies for deriving linear system equations of motion eoms within the euler lagrange framework are evaluated with the focus of highlighting the correct procedure for capturing the full gyroscopic couplings in linear eoms monte carlo simulations are performed on three scenarios i e no aerodynamics idling fowts and operational fowts it is observed that gyroscopic couplings significantly influence the tower torsion and possibly foundation yaw depending on the foundation type of fowts without aerodynamic loads and the spar type fowt is most sensitive to gyroscopic effects among the three concepts considered although the tlp can be similarly sensitive the aerodynamic loads are the dominating loads for both idling and operational fowts and the gyroscopic effect becomes less significant although it still plays a more important role in operational fowts than idling fowts excluding the gyroscopic effect leads to non negligible overestimation of the tower torsion of the operational fowt this study unfolds the correct derivation procedure the mathematical formulas the physical mechanism and the influence significance regarding the gyroscopic effects in fowts which also acts as a useful guideline for developing in house reduced order fowt models keywords floating offshore wind turbine coupled system gyroscopic effects gyroscopic matrix efficient time domain model 1 introduction floating offshore wind turbines fowts are believed to be the most cost effective and reasonable solution for far offshore areas with water depth larger than 60 m jonkman 2007 several types of floating foundations have been proposed and are under proof of concept investigations through numerical simulation or scaled model testing bachynski et al 2013 among these four concepts have gained most r d attentions i e spar buoy tension leg platform tlp semi submersible and barge pérez collazo et al 2015 jonkman and matha 2011 prototypes with various foundation concepts have been developed for demonstration purposes including windfloat fukushima floating wind farm floatgen demonstrator and hywind scotland a fowt is subject to combined stochastic wind aerodynamic and wave hydrodynamic loads as well as loads from mooring lines the wind wave induced motions of the floating foundation three translational motions i e surge sway and heave and three rotational motions i e pitch roll and yaw will lead to increased structural responses and thus increased fatigue damage compared with land based wind turbines due to the effect of large inertia and gravity especially for the tower jonkman and matha 2010 this requires a rigorous dynamic model that couples structural dynamics aerodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads controller dynamics and mooring loads for accurately assessing the system behavior butterfield et al 2005 borg et al 2014 several tools are available for simulating aero hydro servo elastic fowt systems and have been bench marked against each other jonkman and musial 2010 robertson et al 2014 some models e g fast jonkman and buhl 2005 hawc2 larsen and hansen 2007 bladed bossanyi 2003 and flex5 øye 2001 are originally onshore wind turbine models that have been expanded to include a floating foundation and others e g simo riflex ormberg et al 2011 have been developed by the offshore engineering community to include a wind turbine system further there are reduced order models developed specifically for fowts such as the simplified low order wind turbine slow model lemmer 2018 and the cambridge model lupton 2015 in fast flex5 and bladed a combined modal multibody dynamics formulation is used which is an efficient way of capturing the global dynamics of the system the high fidelity models e g hawc2 and simo riflex use a mixed multibody dynamics finite element formulation capturing higher modes and geometric non linearities that become important in the design of wind turbines with increasing blade and tower lengths fast also has the option to include a finite element formulation for the blades to get higher fidelity for the response and loads the slow model only involves 6 degrees of freedom dofs capturing the 2d out of plane motions and is quite computationally efficient and robust for controller design and parametric optimization lemmer et al 2020 the cambridge model is a 12 dof model including 6 rigid body dofs of the foundation together with the flapwise and edgewise deformations of the three blades but neglects the tower flexibility the model is linearized and used in the frequency domain for preliminary evaluation of fowts lupton and langley 2019 comparing with the design oriented high fidelity models the reduced order models e g the slow and cambridge models have the advantage of computational efficiency transparency of the formulations and equations as well as flexibility in implementation state space or frequency domain formulation therefore this type of model might be preferred for specific research or application purposes such as preliminary controller design and quick load analysis recently a highly tailored 2 dof model has been developed souza and bachynski 2019 aiming at revealing the mechanism of the changes in surge and pitch decay periods of fowts for varying wind speeds besides the mechanical model both aerodynamic load modelling hansen 2015 de vaal et al 2014 and hydrodynamic load modelling are essential in simulating system responses especially for fowts fluid structure interaction between the water and the moving foundation must be well accounted for morison s equation morison et al 1950 is widely used and represents the hydrodynamic loads well even for complex floating structures such as the semi submersible foundations when comparing with test results van phuc and ishihara 2007 morison s equation has an inertial and a viscous term the inertial term which includes the froude krylov excitation and the zero frequency added mass tends to agree well with potential theory for low frequencies kvittem et al 2012 however for high frequency waves diffraction loads become important and morison s equation starts to deviate from the potential flow theory to incorporate the numerically solved results from the potential flow theory into the time domain fowt model 6 by 6 convolution integrals are needed using the impulse response functions of the radiation loads cummins 1962 which is quite computationally inefficient convolution integrals can be avoided by rational approximations of the frequency response functions as already applied in hydrodynamic modelling for ships kristiansen et al 2005 moored floating structures jordán and beltrán aguedo 2004 wave energy converters nielsen et al 2013 floating bridges xu et al 2018 and floating wind turbines duarte et al 2013 høeg and zhang 2019 this enables the radiation loads to be efficiently solved in the time domain together with the fowt model in terms of an extended state space formulation computational fluid dynamics cfd models have also been used to verify the potential flow theory for floating platforms of wind turbines such as tlp nematbakhsh et al 2015 or to investigate the heave plates for spar heave damping subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 although being a promising alternative cfd models are yet computationally too expensive for running numerous time domain simulations during the structural integrity assessment of fowts from a mechanics point of view a significant difference between fowts and their bottom fixed counterparts is that the gyroscopic effect plays a much more important role for fowts this is due to the low resistance of the system against pitch and yaw movements leading to much larger pitch and yaw motions of the floating foundation the foundation pitch angular velocity combined with the rotor spin speed induces gyroscopic moments acting on the foundation yaw motion and the tower torsional vibration similarly the foundation yaw angular velocity combined with the rotor spin speed induces gyroscopic moments acting on the foundation pitch motion and the tower fore aft vibration due to the gyroscopic effects the above mentioned motions are highly coupled and they are actually also slightly coupled to the blade vibrations to date few studies have investigated the gyroscopic effects on fowts a 7 dof rigid body dynamic model was developed for a spar type fowt and the rotor gyroscopic effects were examined for an idling fowt without aerodynamic loads al solihat et al 2019 however the model fails to capture the elastic tower and blades responses which will also couple to the spar through the gyroscopic effects and the operational fowt was not examined a similar 6 dof rigid body dynamic model was developed in the frequency domain for a vertical axis fowt mounted on a semi submersible foundation and the gyroscopic effects were examined in terms of the response amplitude operators raos blusseau and patel 2012 time domain simulations of the system subjected to realistic wind and wave loads were not performed and flexibility in the tower and blades was again ignored in a real time hybrid testing campaign of a semi submersible fowt bachynski et al 2015 the wave loads and floater response were physically tested in a wave basin while the aerodynamic loads were simulated and applied by an actuator the gyroscopic moments were also calculated in the numerical model and applied to the physical model by the actuator bachynski et al 2015 the inclusion of gyroscopic moments was shown to reduce the standard deviation of the spar yaw response however a deeper insight into the gyroscopic coupling effect and its mechanism was not provided as seen a comprehensive study including modelling quantification and evaluation of the gyroscopic effects on responses of horizontal axis fowts in different conditions parked or operational is still lacking the present paper aims to address this knowledge gap through rigorous modelling and extensive time domain simulations in the first part of the paper sections 2 and 3 an efficient time domain fowt model in terms of an extended state space formulation is established which exhibits the advantages of a reduced order model while incorporating the full coupling between structural dynamics and hydrodynamics this enables performing a large number of monte carlo simulations of the fully coupled fowt system with acceptable computational cost which is needed for evaluating the influence of gyroscopic effects on system responses in different load case scenarios with different environmental conditions the second part of the paper sections 4 and 5 focuses on investigating the significance of gyroscopic effect on responses of fowts different strategies within the euler lagrange framework for deriving linear system eoms are evaluated explicitly highlighting the differences in the gyroscopic matrix and some terms in the stiffness matrix resulting from the different strategies the correct strategy for capturing the full gyroscopic coupling is identified and compared with a more simplified strategy that only partially captures the gyroscopic coupling extensive monte carlo simulations are performed on three different scenarios i e fowts without aerodynamic loads fowts in idling condition and fowts in operational condition and various environmental conditions are considered it is found that the gyroscopic moments dominate the tower torsional and spar yaw responses of the spar type fowt without aerodynamic loads while for the semi submersible fowt only the tower torsion is influenced by the gyroscopic effects the spar type fowt is most sensitive to gyroscopic effects due to its low yaw inertia for idling and operational fowts the responses are dominated by aerodynamic loads and the gyroscopic effects have less remarkable influence nevertheless the gyroscopic coupling still play a more important role in operational fowts than idling fowts tower torsion of the operational fowt is most remarkably influenced by the gyroscopic effects 2 mechanical modelling of the 17 dof fowt system a 17 dof aero hydro servo elastic fowt model is developed using the euler lagrange approach in analytical dynamics where a combined multi body and modal based formulation is used for expressing the system energies the main reasons for developing our own in house model are 1 include the tower torsional dof that is missing in many available soft wares in a fowt model accounting for its full coupling with other dofs in a rigorous manner 2 provide in depth and transparent explanation guidance on how to develop in house reduced order fowt models 3 it will enable examining different derivation strategies for obtaining linear system matrices by comparing the explicitly given system matrices this model includes the coupled blades drivetrain tower foundation vibrations nonlinear aeroelasticity nonlinear quasi static mooring cable model as well as controller dynamics from the collective blade pitch and generator torque controllers 2 1 overview of the model the dofs and coordinate systems cs of the fowt model are defined in fig 1 and fig 2 the motions of the floating foundation are described in the global fixed cs x 1 x 2 x 3 with its origin at the global center of

indicating the flapwise and edgewise tip displacements respectively the tower motions are defined by the translational dofs q 7 t and q 8 t indicating the fore aft and side side vibrations respectively as well as the tower torsional dof q 17 t the tower torsional moment often drives the design of the tower top sections where bending moments are small compared with the bottom sections and thus including the tower torsional dof may be important the drivetrain shown in fig 2 is modelled using st venant torsional theory by the dofs q 9 t and q 10 t denoting the deviations of the angular positions at the hub and at the generator from the rated angular positions ω 0 t and n ω 0 t respectively with ω 0 being the rated rotor spin speed and n being the gear ratio as a result ω t ω

of the first edgewise mode the 3d nature of the blade mode shapes results from the structural pre twist also possibly the blade pitch angle coupling the out of plane and in plane vibrations in the present study however the blade deformation field is simplified by assuming the blade flapwise and edgewise modes to be the pure out of plane and in plane modes respectively that means u b 1 j x 3 t φ

system of the fowt is comprised of both a collective blade pitch and a generator torque controller as defined in jonkman et al 2009 the generator torque controller is dominating at wind speeds below the rated wind speed and the pitch controller is dominating above the rated wind speed a full span collective pitch controller is included in the 17 dof model with time delay due to the inertia of the actuator modelled by a 1st order filter of β t zhang 2015 the pitch demand is specified by a pi controller with feedback from q 9 t and q 9 t a gain scheduled pi controller is used for this model i e the controller gains are dependent on the blade pitch angle jonkman et al 2009 furthermore the variable speed generator torque controller is implemented as in jonkman et al 2009 where the generator torque is computed as a tabulated function of the filtered generator speed incorporating five control regions the two main regions are the optimal power region below the rated wind speed where the tip speed ratio is kept constant at the optimal value and above rated where the generator torque is kept constant according to jonkman 2010 3 loads on the 17 dof fowt model 3 1 aerodynamic gravity and

17 dof model it takes into account the weight and axial stiffness of the cable as well as the seabed friction using the basic catenary equation which is solved by a newton raphson iteration scheme all dynamic effects i e the inertia and structural damping of the cable hydrodynamic drag and added mass and dynamic seabed and anchor interaction are ignored however cable dynamics have been shown to be insignificant for the fowt responses although the cable responses are influenced significantly høeg and zhang 2018 since the present paper focuses on the gyroscopic effect on fowt responses the computationally efficient quasi static mooring model is considered appropriate 3 2 hydrodynamic loads the hydrodynamic load f h t in eq 12 can be composed by contributions from waves diffraction

convolution integrals in eq 18 the radiation load f r i t can be represented by an equivalent system of coupled first order differential equations taghipour et al 2008 perez and fossen 2009 nielsen et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 and be solved along with the fowt equations of motion eq 12 the method is based on a replacement of each entry h i j ω of the frequency response matrix with an approximating

freely with the only restriction m i j n i j each frequency response function h i j ω will be fitted independently and with independent orders m i j n i j of the rational function h i j s different methods for performing the approximation were discussed in taghipour et al 2008 in the present paper the invfreqs function in matlab is used due to its good performance in stability here the difference between m i j and n i j is fixed to be one i e m i j n i j 1 the best integer orders are chosen from the r 2 value by evaluating different values of n i j from 2 to 20 furthermore larger weighing factors are placed on the low frequency part of the frequency response function during the approximation so that the low frequency contents are more accurately represented the input output

auxiliary function without physical interpretation eq 23 is the so called output differential equation and eq 24 is the filter differential equation eq 24 can be written in the state space form as 25 d d t z r t a r z r t b r q f t where z r t is the state vector containing all the auxiliary functions y i j t and their time derivatives a r and b r are the coefficient matrices the detailed expressions of z r t a r and b r are given in appendix b similarly eq 23 can be written in the matrix form 26 f r t c r z r t with the coefficient matrix c r being given in appendix c combining eqs 25 and 26 with the state space form of eq 12 as well as the eom of the pitch controller an extended state space formulation of the coupled mechanical hydrodynamic controller system is established which can be solved by the 4th order runge kutta method 3 2 3 wave loads diffraction loads the diffraction loads on the spar are calculated by summing up the contributions from all frequency components 27 f

the hydrostatic loads are composed of two parts i e the heave buoyancy force and the hydrostatic restoring matrix the heave buoyancy force is simply calculated as 29 f b 0 3 ρ w g v s where ρ w is the mass density of seawater g is the gravitational acceleration and v s is the volume of the submerged part of the spar when it is upright and at the design draft the hydrostatic restoring matrix consists of stiffness coefficients for the heave roll and pitch displacements faltinsen 1990 30 k h s ρ w g 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 π 4 d 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 h b g v s π d 1 4 64 0 0 0 0 0 0 h b g v s

along the x 1 axis k j ω j is the wave number found through the dispersion relationship ω j 2 g k j ω j tanh k j ω j h and h is the water depth the total hydrodynamic drag loads on the spar are obtained by integrating eq 31 over the submerged part of the spar 33 f d t h b h g p d 1 x 3 t p d 2 x 3 t 0 p d 2 x 3 t x 3 p d 1 x 3 t x 3 0 t d x 3 4 capture the full gyroscopic coupling in the linear eoms of the system in deriving eq 12 all the nonlinear terms in the eoms are kept till the step of using the euler lagrange equation after which linearization is performed on the left hand side of the eoms to extract the system matrices m t g t and k t in principle the established nonlinear eoms can be directly used for simulating system responses however linearized eoms with explicit system matrices are preferred due to its compact format and its significantly improved computational efficiency the nonlinear eoms without any simplifications are actually computationally too heavy for running many simulations in the present paper linearization involves two sequential sub steps 1 assumption of small rotations angles i e cos q 1 and sin q q with q being one of the rotational dofs as well as the tower fore aft and side side top rotations 2 second and higher order terms e g q i q j are numerically smaller than the first order terms thus being neglected it should be noted that in this study the nonlinearities nonlinear dependence on dofs involved in the load vectors are retained since the linearization is performed at the very last step all possible coupling effects in the mechanical model are retained leading to the correct linear eoms correct system matrices of the system with the full gyroscopic coupling in the gyroscopic matrix g t between the blades tower and spar being correctly captured actually it is proved through our derivation that removing third and higher order terms after introducing the small angle assumptions in the system kinetic energy will lead to the same correct eoms as well although in this paper the velocity vectors are described in the global cs as indicated by eq 4 it is also proved that describing them in the local cs will lead to the same correct eoms as long as the linearization operation is performed at the kinetic energy or at the last step in table 1 these two linearization strategies that lead to the correct eoms are summarized in the first two columns in the following the correct linear eoms derived on the basis of the global cs as described in section 2 are denoted the gyro model the system matrices of which have been given in appendix b for the case of θ t θ c β 0 a more straightforward strategy for deriving linear system eoms is to linearize the velocity vectors of all structural components before formulating the system kinetic energy eq 3 which will significantly simplify the derivation procedure this can be further classified into two strategies i e image 2 velocity vectors defined in the local cs or image 3 velocity vectors defined in the global cs however both strategies unfortunately lead to some errors in the obtained gyroscopic matrix g t and stiffness matrix k t although the mass matrix m t is always correct strategy image 4 local cs based formulation with linearized velocity vectors results in an incorrect g t and some missing off diagonal terms in k t as shown in eq 46 in appendix b g t is constructed as a block matrix with four blocks the lower block g s is a skew symmetric gyroscopic matrix of the support structure tower and spar indicating the full gyroscopic couplings between tower fore aft rotation tower torsion spar pitch and spar yaw motions which are especially important for fowts g s is captured by the gyro model but is completely missing in this strategy image 5 as indicated by the red color in eq 46 further the block g b s t represents the gyroscopic couplings from the support structure vibrations to the blade flapwise vibration and strategy image 6 misses a factor of 2 in all the non zero terms in g b s t the other off diagonal block g s b t represents the gyroscopic couplings from the blade edgewise vibrations to the support structure vibrations strategy image 7 falsely results in non zero terms in the first three columns of g s b t which should be zero in the correct matrix as indicated by the grey color in eq 48 as for the stiffness matrix k t it is also constructed as a block matrix as shown in eq 49 strategy image 8 correctly captures the blocks k b ω t and k s but misses the terms in the first three columns of k s b t as indicated by the red color in eq 52 this implies that the stiffness coupling from the blade flapwise vibration to the support structure vibration is missing in strategy image 9 the consequences of this linearization strategy are summarized in the fourth column of table 1 for fixed foundation wind turbines these missing gyroscopic coupling effects are insignificant due to the restrained motion of the foundation as well as the large torsional stiffness of the tower hence this strategy has actually been employed for developing an aero servo elastic model of a fixed foundation wind turbine 38 39 due to its simplified and more operable derivation procedure it should also be noted that in fast the tower torsion dof is not included for the fixed foundation wind turbine model and thus these gyroscopic couplings are not accounted for as well in the following the linear eoms derived using strategy image 10 are denoted the no gyro model in section 5 the fowt responses from the no gyro model will be compared with those from the gyro model under different load cases scenarios on the other hand strategy image 1 global cs based formulation with linearized velocity vectors leads to the correct gyroscopic matrix g s of the support structure however it results in incorrect g b s t g s b t and k s b t as in the case of strategy image 1 more critically additional diagonal terms on the tower and spar dofs in k s are falsely introduced by strategy image 1 which will alter the system eigenfrequencies thus this linearization strategy should be avoided in all situations the consequences of this linearization strategy is summarized in the third column of table 1 an intermediate linearization strategy could be to remove the second and higher order terms in the velocity vectors while keeping the sine and cosine terms from the coordinate transformations unchanged it can be implemented either in the global cs or the local cs resulting in the same linear eoms this strategy corresponds to a partial linearization of the velocity vectors as illustrated in the fifth and sixth columns in table 1 to obtain the linear eoms small angle assumptions cos q 1 and sin q q are introduced at the very last step this strategy provides a slightly more simple and operable derivation procedure than the correct strategies the first and second columns in table 1 but is still much more demanding than strategy image 1 the fourth column in table 1 as indicated in table 1 it turns out that g s and k s are correctly captured but g b s t g s b t and k s b t are incorrect actually the resulting g b s t g s b t and k s b t matrices are identical to those from strategy image 1 and strategy image 1 finally another partial linearization strategy could be to only introduce the small angle assumptions cos q 1 and sin q q in the velocity vectors this strategy when used in the global cs as indicated in the seventh column in table 1 introduces additional incorrect diagonal terms in k s same as in strategy image 1 and should therefore be avoided however when this partial linearization strategy is used in the local cs it actually leads to the correct eoms therefore this simplified derivation procedure in the local cs enables faster derivation of the eoms of large and complex systems while still ensuring the correct gyroscopic couplings and avoiding errors in the diagonal of the stiffness matrix k s this strategy is indicated in the last column of table 1 in addition to table 1 a flowchart figure 20 is provided in appendix d visualizing all the different strategies mentioned in this section additionally two more strategies similar to strategy image 1 and strategy image 1 are shown in appendix d but with the order reversed i e higher order terms e g q i q j are removed first and the small angle assumptions cos q 1 and sin q q are then introduced by simplifying the velocities in this order some higher order terms are kept throughout the derivations however these two strategies still lead to false eoms and are not recommended nevertheless they are included in the flowchart so that all possible strategies with different combinations of simplification steps are presented in figure 20 only the gyro model and the no gyro model are further investigated in section 5 5 results and discussions 5 1 17 dof model verification data from the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 were used to calibrate the wind turbine system and the spar type floating foundation oc3 hywind spar together with the mooring line parameters were taken from jonkman 2010 the mode shapes for the blades and tower are taken from the cert test files in fast which were obtained from the bmodes bir 2005 module of fast table 2 shows the calculated parameters employed in the 17 dof fowt model the expressions of the inertia constants of the blades and tower are given in the beginning of appendix b and the corresponding expressions of the stiffness parameters were given in subsection 2 2 2 the hydrodynamic added mass matrix the potential damping matrix and the transfer functions for the diffraction loads are obtained by linear potential flow theory using the software nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 from nemoh the added mass matrix with element m a i j ω and potential damping matrix with element c h i j ω at discrete frequencies are obtained following the procedure in subsection 3 2 2 rational approximation is performed on each frequency response function h h i j ω eq 20 fig 4 a and b show the rational approximation with the order m n 3 4 for the radiation forces in surge and pitch directions in terms of the added mass and potential damping respectively the fitting goodness of the rational approximation has an r 2 value of 0 991 and 0 996 for the surge and pitch dofs respectively indicating rather good agreement furthermore the poles and zeros of the rational approximation of the frequency response functions h h 11 ω and h h 55 ω are also shown in fig 4 a and b in the upper right corners of the respective graphs as seen the fitted rational functions have negative real parts of the poles leading to stable solutions using the 4th order runge kutta method with a time step of 0 02s simulations of the 17 dof model are performed the fast model is set up with θ t θ c 0 and the yaw controller and yaw dof turned off in order to match the 17 dof model setup additionally the aerodynamics in fast are set to the classical bem model using aerodyn v15 jonkman et al 2015 the inflow wind is steady without wind shear and the tower potential flow and hub loss effects are turned off the skewed wake correction model is set to pitt and peters as in the 17 dof model finally the hydrodynamics are modelled in a similar way as in the 17 dof model but with the convolution integral for the radiation loads the time step is 0 125s with a 4th order adams bashforth adams moulton scheme used for numerical time integration for the model comparisons in this section 5 1 the 17 dof model also uses a convolution integral to calculate the radiation loads with an equal 60s memory time as in fast this setup means that the main differences between the models are the additional second modes for the blade flapwise tower fore aft and side side vibrations as well as the missing tower torsion dof in fast these additional second modes in fast should in principle be switched off for more fair comparison however our simulation results indicate that they have negligible influence on the responses of the spar type fowt and thus they are kept on on the other hand it should be noted that the 2nd tower modes have remarkable influence on the dynamics of the tlp fowt the steady state responses of the model are compared with those from fast jonkman et al 2009 for wind speeds ranging from cut in 3 m s to cut out 25 m s very good agreement were obtained for all responses both structural responses and non structural responses the results of 17 output variables are shown in fig 5 the largest deviation is seen for the blade tip edgewise displacement but as shown if the structural pre twist is turned off in fast the results match again on the other hand this only introduces negligible changes in other responses in fast the blade edgewise response is not of great interest in the present study therefore the simplification made in section 2 2 1 where the structural pre twist has been ignored in the structural matrices is considered acceptable the yaw response also deviates from fast and mostly around the rated wind speed where the displacements and rotations are largest this could be due to the fact that fast is a nonlinear model with up to about 20 rotations jonkman 2007 and that the 17 dof model is linearized at q 0 finally a comparison of the 17 dof model with and without the blade pitch angle β included in the structural matrices are performed the results are almost unchanged except for the blade edgewise response where results above rated with β 0 are slightly lower for the case of neglecting the blade pitch angle in the structural matrices it should be noted that the statistical results in subsections 5 2 and 5 4 do not include the blade pitch angle in the structural matrices in addition to the steady state responses transient responses to a step input i e mean wind speed of 15 m s at t 0 are evaluated and compared with those from fast the initial rotor speed is 12 1 rpm and the pitch and generator torque controllers are turned on wind shear and wave loads are not considered in fig 6 only the blade flapwise vibration tower fore aft vibration spar pitch motion and spar yaw are shown the agreement of the blade flapwise tower fore aft and spar pitch are excellent in both time and frequency domains indicating that the 17 dof model accurately captures the global dynamics of a fowt system the spar yaw response deviates most and like the steady state response in fig 5 this might be due to the fact that some nonlinearities are not accounted for in the 17 dof model furthermore the 17 dof model also includes the tower torsion dof enabling the evaluation of full gyroscopic effects on the fowt responses under different load cases various environmental conditions are considered in the following simulations and are summarized in table 3 for the aerodynamic loads seven different mean wind speeds and one turbulence intensity are considered for the hydrodynamic loads four different irregular sea states with four different combinations of the significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p are considered corresponding to low medium high and extreme wave conditions table 4 summarizes the load cases scenarios simulated in the following subsections the no aero scenario is investigated in subsection 5 2 where the aerodynamic loads are turned off and the rotor speed is either 0 or 5 revolution per minute rpm and both the pitch and generator torque controllers are turned off the idling scenario is investigated in subsection 5 3 it is similar to but not equal to the design load case dlc 6 1a in the iec61400 3 international electrotechnical commission iec 2009 this load case includes a 50 year extreme mean wind speed of 50 m s and an extreme sea state with a significant wave height h s k 2 h s 50 1 09 15 6 m 17 0 m international electrotechnical commission iec 2009 the 15 6 m 50 year significant wave height is taken as the maximum value for a site off the coast of norway with a 200 m water depth li et al 2013 it should be noted that in the present study h s 17 0 m is chosen for the extreme wave condition ext in table 3 that is used for all three load cases as in summarized in table 4 the aerodynamic loads are calculated without using the blade element momentum theory i e no iterations in order to generate gyroscopic loads the blades are pitched to angles between 65 and 90 and the resulting rotor speed varies approximately linearly between 5 4 rpm to 0 2 rpm finally the operational scenario normal power production is investigated subsection 5 4 it is similar to but not equal to the dlc 1 1 or dlc 1 2 in iec61400 3 international electrotechnical commission iec 2009 for evaluating the ultimate or fatigue loads respectively different types of foundations have different natural frequencies and different resistance against pitch and yaw rotations therefore in subsection 5 2 the semi submersible robertson et al 2014 and the tlp matha 2010 are also simulated besides the spar in order to compare the significance of the gyroscopic effects in these three foundations the semi submersible platform for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is chosen as the oc4 semi submersible platform this platform has three offset columns each with a diameter of 12 0 m and one main column with a diameter of 6 5 m at the center to which the wind turbine is mounted the offset columns are spaced 50 0 m between each other for each of them a 24 0 m diameter heave plate is mounted at the bottom the height of the heave plate is 6 0 m and the total draft is 20 0 m the pontoons and cross members connecting the columns were disregarded in the hydrodynamic modelling in the present study the tlp platform for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is chosen as the mit nrel tension leg platform with one 18 0 m diameter column whose draft is 47 9 m the mit nrel tlp has four spokes at the bottom and each of them has two mooring lines attached the four spokes were disregarded in the hydrodynamic modelling the semi submersible and tlp fowt models are also established by using the 17 dof model explained in sections 2 and 3 and are verified by comparing with fast results as well not shown here with the 2nd tower modes of the tlp fowt being switched off in fast for each of the three load cases monte carlo simulations are performed and ultimate and fatigue related loads responses are statistically estimated for the tower fore aft base moment and tower torque a fatigue equivalent load hendriks and bulder 1995 or damage equivalent load is calculated for comparison a fatigue equivalent load is defined as the constant load amplitude at n e q load cycles that leads to the same damage as that caused by time varying load series obtained from rainflow counting rainflow function in matlab the range and number of load cycles are used to estimate the fatigue equivalent loads with n e q 10 7 cycles and an s n slope being m 4 on the other hand the standard deviation is used for spar pitch and yaw responses instead because the foundation is considered to be rigid thus the damage can not be defined as for the ultimate loads responses they are estimated based on the extreme value extrapolation from the obtained time histories with a gumbel distribution and an exceedance probability of 3 8 10 7 as detailed in høeg and zhang 2018 5 2 fowts with aerodynamic loads turned off first aerodynamic loads on the rotor are turned off while the floating platform is subjected to irregular waves in order to isolate the gyroscopic effects two different rotor spin speeds are considered i e 0 rpm and 5 rpm additionally for the 5 rpm case the no gyro model described in section 4 is also evaluated in order to highlight the significance of capturing the full gyroscopic coupling in the linear eoms fig 7 compares the responses from the above mentioned cases of 0 rpm 5 rpm as well as 5 rpm with no gyro model for spar type fowts it is seen from fig 7 a that the tower fore aft vibration is almost unchanged when ω changes from 0 rpm to 5 rpm which is also the case for the spar pitch motion not shown here this is because the dominating excitation is the wave load which directly excites the spar pitch and the tower fore aft responses due to their inertia coupling regardless of ω on the contrary the tower torsion and spar yaw responses are significantly changed as shown in fig 7 b and c this is due to the change of system gyroscopic matrix g t and stiffness matrix k t when ω changes from 0 rpm to 5 rpm where the skew symmetric gyroscopic matrix g s eq 46 of the support structure plays the most important role for the 5 rpm case g s in eq 46 is non zero and the full gyroscopic coupling of the four modes i e tower fore aft tower torsion spar pitch and spar yaw takes place as a result the mechanical energy flows from the spar pitch and tower fore aft modes the directly excited modes to the spar yaw and tower torsional modes the indirectly excited modes as shown in fig 7 b the tower torsion is more significantly excited when ω changes from 0 rpm to 5 rpm with the gyroscopic effects fully represented the fourier amplitude spectrum shows that the spectral peaks at the spar pitch and tower fore aft eigenfrequencies are much higher for the 5 rpm case than the 0 rpm case indicating gyroscopic coupling the spectral peak at the spar yaw eigenfrequency is also increased when ω increases to 5 rpm implying that energy also flows from the spar yaw mode to the tower torsional mode mainly due to their indirect coupling through g s their direct coupling through m s and the load vector are the same for both 0 rpm and 5 rpm furthermore the results of the 5 rpm with no gyro model are almost identical to those of the 0 rpm case due to the fact that the no gyro model misses the gyroscopic matrix g s as explained in section 4 actually the two results slightly differ at the higher frequencies i e tower fore aft and blade flapwise related frequencies since the no gyro model partially captures the gyroscopic couplings g b s t and g s b t while they are zero matrices for the 0 rpm case fig 7 c shows the corresponding comparison of the spar yaw motion similarly the spar yaw motion is more significantly excited when ω changes from 0 rpm to 5 rpm with the two spectral peaks corresponding to spar pitch and yaw eigenfrequencies much higher for the 5 rpm case furthermore the results of the 5 rpm with no gyro model agree well with the 0 rpm case indicating the missing gyroscopic matrix g s in the no gyro model fig 8 shows the corresponding comparisons for semi submersible fowts similar to the spar the tower fore aft response shown in fig 8 a is almost unchanged when the rotor speed changes to 5 rpm fig 8 b indicates that the tower torsion of the semi submersible fowt is significantly excited as ω increases from 0 rpm to 5 rpm similar to that in fig 7 b the difference between the results from gyro model and no gyro model are also similar to fig 7 b therefore it is concluded that although the tower torsion amplitudes are smaller for the semi submersible fowt the gyroscopic effects play a similarly important role in the tower torsion for both foundation types contrarily fig 8 c reveals the main difference between the semi submersible and the spar i e the yaw response of the semi submersible is almost unchanged by the gyroscopic effects this is because the semi submersible is much more exposed to wave loads which dominate the yaw motion in addition the yaw mass moment of inertia and added mass are much larger than the spar implying larger resistance to yaw motions and thus less influence from the gyroscopic effects fig 9 shows the comparisons for the tlp fowts as seen the foundation pitch and tower fore aft eigenfrequencies are increased a lot compared with the other two concepts due to the taut mooring lines fig 9 a shows that the frequency distribution of the tower fore aft response is also quite different from the spar and the semi submersible nevertheless the gyroscopic effects have consistently negligible influence on the tower fore aft response fig 9 b confirms the similar observations as in figs 7 b and fig 8 b i e the gyroscopic effects have noticeable influence on the tower torsion the foundation yaw response on the other hand is hardly influenced by the gyroscopic effects which is similar to the semi submersible however it should be noted that this is not always the case for the tlp the misaligned wave β w 30 here directly excites the in plane vibrations that couple to the yaw motion due to the rotor overhang and downwind location of the nacelle cog since the yaw dof of the tlp is undamped without aerodynamic loads the indirect pumping of energy from the misaligned wave significantly excites the yaw eigenvibration resonance and the gyroscopic effects become minor for aligned waves the tower torsion and foundation yaw responses of the tlp turn out to resemble those in fig 7 for the spar and the gyroscopic effects exhibit larger influence on the foundation yaw motion without aerodynamic loads the only dominating excitation for the tower torsion of these three types of fowts is the gyroscopic moment resulted from the terms in gyroscopic matrix g s and the tower fore aft and foundation pitch velocities since the hydrodynamic loads and mooring loads are always absent for this dof normally the generator torque also results in tower torsion and foundation yaw due to the shaft tilt in the present numerical example the tilt angle is set to zero thus eliminating the influence from the generator controller to further reveal the contributions from different excitation sources on the foundation yaw dof of the three foundation concepts fig 10 compares the gyroscopic moment the hydrodynamic moment and the mooring line induced moment on the foundation yaw dof for the 5 rpm case with the accurate gyro model the gyroscopic moment is extracted by moving the relevant terms from the gyroscopic matrices g s g b s t and g s b t and the velocity vector to the right hand side of eq 12 it is seen from fig 10 a that the mooring moment has the most significant contribution to the spar yaw load the gyroscopic moment has a smaller magnitude and is almost out of phase with the mooring moment the hydrodynamic drag induced moment has negligible contribution to the spar yaw response fig 10 b on the other hand shows that the semi submersible yaw motion is excited almost purely by the hydrodynamic moment which also explains the almost identical yaw responses for the three cases shown in fig 8 c finally fig 10 c shows that the dominating moment acting on the tlp yaw dof is the mooring moment resulting from the large yaw eigenvibration that is indirectly excited by the misaligned wave as explained in regard to fig 9 c the hydrodynamic drag moment is almost absent and the gyroscopic moment is slightly visible with the main frequency content at the tlp pitch frequency since the gyroscopic effects influence the spar type fowt most significantly although the tlp fowt will be similarly influenced with aligned wave only results of the spar type fowt are shown in the remaining parts of the paper fig 11 summarizes the influence of gyroscopic effects on the load and response statistics of the spar type fowt with aerodynamic loads turned off by comparing the 0 rpm and 5 rpm cases for each sea state 100 different realizations each with a 1200 s time duration are generated for monte carlo simulation and statistics tower base fore aft moment tower torque as well as spar pitch angle and spar yaw angle are evaluated and shown in fig 11 in terms of both the ultimate loads responses and the fatigue related loads responses in accordance with the time series in fig 7 the results in fig 11 indicate that the tower fore aft and spar pitch responses are almost identical for the 0 rpm and 5 rpm cases even when taking into account the uncertainties in the wave loads on the contrary the tower torsion and spar yaw responses are significantly increased when the rotor speed increases from 0 rpm to 5 rpm due to the gyroscopic effects both in terms of the ultimate response and the fatigue related response the differences in percentage of the response statistics between the 0 rpm and 5 rpm cases are summarized in the first column of table 5 where the minus sign indicates a larger ultimate response or fatigue related response for the 5 rpm case and the plus sign indicates a larger response for the 0 rpm case 5 3 fowt in idling conditions next the spar type fowts in idling conditions are investigated with the aerodynamic loads accounted for the aerodynamic loads are calculated directly using the aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients on the blade sections without the iterations through the bem method the blades are pitched to a constant angle and six different values of the constant pitch angle β between 65 and 90 are considered as shown in table 4 thus the time varying blade pitch controller is turned off the generator torque controller is also turned off the wind speed is chosen as the 50 year extreme of 50 m s with i r e f 0 12 for a class ic site in iec 61400 1 international electrotechnical commission iec 2005 the rotor speed is dependent on the constant pitch angle applied and varies between 5 4 rpm for β 65 and 0 2 rpm for β 90 both the gyro model and no gyro model are used to simulate the responses of the idling spar type fowt for revealing the significance of gyroscopic effects fig 12 compares the results from the gyro model and the no gyro model for the idling fowt subjected to one realization of the high wave condition high in table 3 with the incoming wave angle β w 0 the blade is pitched to an angle of β 65 so that the results with a relatively large rotor speed are shown fig 12 a shows that the tower top fore aft response is very slightly lower for the no gyro model compared with the gyro model although still insignificant the difference in tower fore aft response shown in fig 12 a is more noticeable than that in the no aero load case fig 7 a in section 5 2 it is seen that the spectral peaks at the spar yaw and tower fore aft frequencies are slightly lower for the no gyro model further due to the large blade pitch angle the fore aft aerodynamic damping turns out to be low the fore aft eigenvibration is effectively excited in contrast to the operational load case shown in section 5 4 fig 12 b shows that the difference in the tower torsional response is much less significant than that in fig 7 b from the fourier amplitude spectrum the change in the frequency contents of tower torsion compared with fig 7 b is clear at the blade edgewise backward and forward whirling modes this is due to the change of the blade pitch angle from β 0 to β 65 resulting in changed system matrices for the no gyro model the spectral peak at the spar pitch frequency is slightly higher than that in the gyro model on the other hand the spectral peaks at the wave peak spar yaw and blade edgewise backward and forward whirling frequencies are lower for the no gyro model lastly fig 12 c shows that the spar yaw is only insignificantly influenced by the gyroscopic effects for idling fowts in contrast to the results in fig 7 c for the no gyro model the spectral peak at the wave peak and spar yaw eigenfrequency are slightly lower for better understanding the results in figs 12 and 13 compares the contributions from different excitation sources on the tower torsional dof and spar yaw dof of the idling fowt with the accurate gyro model as shown in fig 13 a the only two torsional moments acting on the tower torsional dof are the aerodynamic moment and the gyroscopic moment the aerodynamic moment is of much larger magnitude than the gyroscopic moment this explains the smaller difference in tower torsion between the gyro model and the no gyro model in fig 12 b than in fig 7 b nevertheless the two spectral peaks at the wave and tower fore aft frequencies in the fourier amplitude of the gyroscopic moment on torsional dof confirm the presence of the gyroscopic coupling next fig 13 b compares the aerodynamic moment the gyroscopic moment the hydrodynamic drag induced moment and the mooring line induced moment on the spar yaw dof the mooring moment is of the largest amplitudes because it is the reaction to the large spar yaw response excited due to resonance as the aerodynamic damping is low here this can be confirmed by the large spectral peak at spar yaw eigenfrequency in the fourier amplitude of the mooring moment the aerodynamic moment is also of much larger amplitudes than the hydrodynamic moment and the gyroscopic moment although smaller than the mooring moment the gyroscopic moment is most insignificant which explains the insignificant difference between the gyro model and no gyro model in fig 12 c it should be emphasized that the aerodynamic loads in fig 12 correspond to the idling fowt with a fixed pitch angle of β 65 and a resulting rotor speed of 5 4 rpm the aerodynamic loads will be much smaller for the idling fowt with fully feathered blades β 90 however in this case the rotor speed is also close to zero and consequently the gyroscopic effects are vanishing fig 14 compares the response statistics of gyro model and no gyro model for the idling spar type fowt in terms of the fatigue equivalent loads for the tower fore aft base moment and tower torque and standard deviations for the spar pitch and yaw responses six blade pitch angles and four different irregular sea states from table 3 are considered for each sea state 10 realizations are generated resulting in 2 4 6 10 480 simulations fig 14 a shows that the difference in the fatigue equivalent tower fore aft moment between the two models is almost zero at β 90 and becomes more significant as the blade pitch angle β decreases due to the increased rotor speed therefore the enhanced gyroscopic effects the no gyro model consistently underestimates the fore aft load although insignificant and the largest difference 1 62 takes place at β 65 the spar yaw standard deviations in fig 14 d exhibit a similar tendency as in fig 14 a with a largest difference being 2 08 at β 65 the fatigue equivalent tower torsional moment and spar pitch standard deviation in fig 14 b and c are hardly influenced by the gyroscopic effects with the largest underestimation by the no gyro model being 1 05 and 1 21 respectively although gyroscopic effect is seen to play a very insignificant role for idling fowts attention may still need to be paid since the results from no gyro model are on the unsafe side 5 4 fowt in operational power production conditions finally fowts in operational conditions are investigated with the aerodynamic loads acting on the rotating blades and wave loads acting on the floating spar both the pitch controller and the generator controller are turnd on for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine the rated rotor spin speed during power production is ω 0 12 1 rpm this is the mean value around which the actual rotor speed ω t slightly fluctuates ω 0 12 1 rpm is used in the following simulations of both the gyro model and the no gyro model the results are then compared to reveal the significance of capturing the full gyroscopic coupling in the linear eoms for operational fowts fig 15 compares the results from the gyro model and the no gyro model for the operational fowt subjected to one realization of the extreme wave condition with the incoming wave angle β w 0 the mean wind speed is v 0 15 m s and the turbulence intensity is i r e f 0 12 wind shear is not considered in the present study tower top fore aft displacement tower torsion and spar yaw motion are evaluated in general the differences between the results from the two models gyro model and no gyro model are less significant comparing with those in fig 7 especially for the tower torsion and spar yaw responses the differences in tower torsion and spar yaw responses are however more significant than those in fig 12 due to the increased rotor speed from 5 4 rpm to 12 1 rpm and thus the enhanced gyroscopic effects the tower fore aft vibration in fig 15 a is almost identical for the two models which is also the case for the spar pitch motion not shown here this is in accordance with the results in fig 7 a due to the same reason that these two modes are directly excited by the wave loads and aerodynamic loads the aerodynamic damping present in the tower fore aft and spar pitch modes of an operational fowt further eliminates the influence from the gyroscopic effects as the aerodynamic damping in an idling fowt is lower the gyroscopic effects on the tower fore aft response are actually slightly less suppressed as already shown in fig 12 a fig 15 b demonstrates that there is obvious difference in the tower torsional response between the two models although much less remarkable comparing with that in fig 7 b as shown in the fourier amplitude spectrum the no gyro model underestimates the spectral peak at the spar pitch eigenfrequency comparing with the gyro model indicating the consequence of the missing gyroscopic matrix g s and thus the gyroscopic coupling between the spar yaw and tower torsional modes in the no gyro model on the other hand the no gyro model slightly overestimates the spectral peak at the wave peak frequency it also overestimates the higher frequency components mainly related to the drivetrain eigenfrequency confirming that the no gyro model only partially incorrectly captures the gyroscopic coupling between the blades that couple to drivetrain and the tower torsional mode the spar yaw responses in fig 15 c from the two models exhibit similar difference as in fig 15 b except that there are no high frequency components in the spar yaw response as shown in the fourier amplitude spectrum the no gyro model slightly underestimates the spectral peak at the spar pitch eigenfrequency and overestimates the spectral peak at the wave peak frequency in order to evaluate the wave misalignment effect fig 16 compares the results from the same two models gyro model and no gyro model as in fig 15 but with a wave misalignment angle of β w 30 the differences between the results from the two models are similar to those in fig 15 indicating a similar influence from the gyroscopic effects the tower fore aft responses in fig 16 a look almost the same as in fig 15 a except that the amplitude is slightly smaller due to the reduced wave energy supplied in the for aft direction in fig 16 b and c the spectral peak at the wave frequency is seen to be higher than in fig 15 b and c due to the coupling between the tower torsion and spar yaw with the fowt in plane vibrations which are excited by the misaligned waves the no gyro model noticeably underestimates this wave induced spectral peak for tower torsion in accordance with figs 10 and 13 fig 17 compares the contributions from different excitation sources on the tower torsional dof and on the spar yaw dof of the operational fowt with the accurate gyro model the environmental conditions are exactly the same as in fig 15 fig 17 a shows that the only two torsional moments acting on the tower torsional dof are the aerodynamic moment and the gyroscopic moment extracted by moving the relevant terms from the left hand side to the right hand side of eq 12 with the aerodynamic moment being much more significant this is somewhat similar to the observations in fig 13 a except that the gyroscopic moment here is of larger magnitudes than that in fig 13 a due to the increased rotor speed for both idling and operational fowts the dominating excitation on tower torsion is the aerodynamic loads and the gyroscopic effects become less important comparing with the no aero load case on the other hand the gyroscopic effects for operational fowts are more significant than for idling fowts as seen from the fourier amplitude spectrum the aerodynamic moment contains frequency components from the turbulence spectrum 1p wave peak frequency and drivetrain eigenfrequency the gyroscopic moment contains frequency components from the spar pitch eigenfrequency and the wave peak frequency which agree with the response spectrum in fig 15 b fig 17 b compares the aerodynamic moment the gyroscopic moment the hydrodynamic moment and the mooring moment on the spar yaw dof it is observed that the aerodynamic moment and the mooring moment dominated by the spar pitch and yaw eigenfrequencies have the most significant contributions to the spar yaw loads on an operational fowt the gyroscopic moment is still much more significant than the hydrodynamic drag induced moment as in fig 10 b but not comparable with the aerodynamic moment even though the rotor speed is increased from 5 rpm at idling to 12 1 rpm at power production figs 18 and 19 compare the response statistics of the no gyro model and the gyro model for an operational fowt six different mean wind speeds and four different sea states as shown in table 3 are considered and 100 realizations each with 1200 s time duration for each environmental condition are generated for monte carlo simulation and response statistics this leads to 2 4 6 100 4800 simulations the fatigue equivalent loads and the ultimate loads responses are obtained using the same methods as in section 5 2 for fig 11 the results in fig 18 a and c indicate that the tower fore aft response is almost identical for the no gyro model and the gyro model even taking into account the load uncertainties this agrees well with the observation from the time series in fig 15 on the other hand the difference in the tower torsional response between the two models are more significant it is seen from fig 18 b and d that the no gyro model consistently overestimates the tower torsional response when the mean wind speed is above 6 m s the differences in percentage of the tower response statistics between the two models are summarized in table 5 where the plus sign indicates a larger ultimate response or fatigue related response from the no gyro model the no gyro model overestimates the tower torsional ultimate response up to 17 00 and the fatigue equivalent tower torsional moment up to 12 76 similar to fig 18 a and c fig 19 a and c indicate that the spar pitch response is almost identical for the no gyro model and the gyro model even accounting for the load uncertainties the difference in the spar yaw response is more significant between the two models as shown in fig 19 b and d for mean wind speed above 9 m s the no gyro model consistently overestimates the spar yaw response in accordance to the findings from fig 18 b and d for low wind speed 6 m s and 9 m s there is no clear tendency which might be due to the more significant influence from the generator controller and the reduced rotor speed in the below rated region the differences in percentage of the spar response statistics between the two models is also summarized in table 5 the no gyro model overestimates the spar yaw ultimate response up to 15 56 and the standard deviation of yaw up to 8 71 6 conclusions this paper investigates the influence of gyroscopic couplings on stochastic dynamic responses of a spar type fowt in both parked and operational conditions a 17 dof fowt model with controllers is rigorously developed using the euler lagrange approach and verified by comparing with fast a state space representation of the radiation loads is established which combined with the 17 dof fowt model results in an extended state space formulation of the coupled mechanical hydrodynamic controller system for very efficient time domain simulations within the euler lagrange framework different strategies for deriving linear system eoms have been investigated and evaluated the system mass matrix is always correctly captured the full gyroscopic coupling of the mechanical model can only be correctly captured when the linearization operation is performed at the last step or at the kinetic energy formulation regardless of formulating in the local or global cs leading to the correct gyro model linearizing all velocity vectors formulated in the local cs before substituting into the kinetic energy provides a significantly simplified and more operable derivation procedure however the gyroscopic matrix of the support structure is missed and some gyroscopic coupling terms between the blades and the support structure are incorrect leading to the no gyro model that partially captures the gyroscopic effects linearizing velocity vectors that are formulated in the global cs results in false diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix and should be avoided in all situations from extensive monte carlo simulations it is found that the gyroscopic effects significantly influence tower torsion of the fowts without aerodynamic loads for all three foundation types considered regardless of the yaw inertia in terms of foundation yaw the spar type fowt is most sensitive to gyroscopic effects while the semi submersible is insensitive and the sensitivity of the tlp fowts depends on the incoming wave direction for idling and operational fowts the responses are dominated by aerodynamic loads and the gyroscopic effects have less significant influence nevertheless the gyroscopic coupling is more important for operational fowts due to the larger rotor speed the no gyro model overestimates tower torsional ultimate response of the operational fowt up to 17 00 and the fatigue equivalent tower torsional moment up to 12 76 which may impact the design of tower top sections on the other hand the tower fore aft response of idling fowts is very slightly underestimated if gyroscopic effects are not considered credit authorship contribution

20891,the present paper investigates the significance of gyroscopic effects on responses of floating offshore wind turbines fowts a 17 degree of freedom dof fowt model is rigorously developed using the euler lagrange approach based on rational approximation of the radiation loads an extended state space formulation is then established for the coupled mechanical hydrodynamic controller system enabling very efficient time domain simulations different strategies for deriving linear system equations of motion eoms within the euler lagrange framework are evaluated with the focus of highlighting the correct procedure for capturing the full gyroscopic couplings in linear eoms monte carlo simulations are performed on three scenarios i e no aerodynamics idling fowts and operational fowts it is observed that gyroscopic couplings significantly influence the tower torsion and possibly foundation yaw depending on the foundation type of fowts without aerodynamic loads and the spar type fowt is most sensitive to gyroscopic effects among the three concepts considered although the tlp can be similarly sensitive the aerodynamic loads are the dominating loads for both idling and operational fowts and the gyroscopic effect becomes less significant although it still plays a more important role in operational fowts than idling fowts excluding the gyroscopic effect leads to non negligible overestimation of the tower torsion of the operational fowt this study unfolds the correct derivation procedure the mathematical formulas the physical mechanism and the influence significance regarding the gyroscopic effects in fowts which also acts as a useful guideline for developing in house reduced order fowt models keywords floating offshore wind turbine coupled system gyroscopic effects gyroscopic matrix efficient time domain model 1 introduction floating offshore wind turbines fowts are believed to be the most cost effective and reasonable solution for far offshore areas with water depth larger than 60 m jonkman 2007 several types of floating foundations have been proposed and are under proof of concept investigations through numerical simulation or scaled model testing bachynski et al 2013 among these four concepts have gained most r d attentions i e spar buoy tension leg platform tlp semi submersible and barge pérez collazo et al 2015 jonkman and matha 2011 prototypes with various foundation concepts have been developed for demonstration purposes including windfloat fukushima floating wind farm floatgen demonstrator and hywind scotland a fowt is subject to combined stochastic wind aerodynamic and wave hydrodynamic loads as well as loads from mooring lines the wind wave induced motions of the floating foundation three translational motions i e surge sway and heave and three rotational motions i e pitch roll and yaw will lead to increased structural responses and thus increased fatigue damage compared with land based wind turbines due to the effect of large inertia and gravity especially for the tower jonkman and matha 2010 this requires a rigorous dynamic model that couples structural dynamics aerodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads controller dynamics and mooring loads for accurately assessing the system behavior butterfield et al 2005 borg et al 2014 several tools are available for simulating aero hydro servo elastic fowt systems and have been bench marked against each other jonkman and musial 2010 robertson et al 2014 some models e g fast jonkman and buhl 2005 hawc2 larsen and hansen 2007 bladed bossanyi 2003 and flex5 øye 2001 are originally onshore wind turbine models that have been expanded to include a floating foundation and others e g simo riflex ormberg et al 2011 have been developed by the offshore engineering community to include a wind turbine system further there are reduced order models developed specifically for fowts such as the simplified low order wind turbine slow model lemmer 2018 and the cambridge model lupton 2015 in fast flex5 and bladed a combined modal multibody dynamics formulation is used which is an efficient way of capturing the global dynamics of the system the high fidelity models e g hawc2 and simo riflex use a mixed multibody dynamics finite element formulation capturing higher modes and geometric non linearities that become important in the design of wind turbines with increasing blade and tower lengths fast also has the option to include a finite element formulation for the blades to get higher fidelity for the response and loads the slow model only involves 6 degrees of freedom dofs capturing the 2d out of plane motions and is quite computationally efficient and robust for controller design and parametric optimization lemmer et al 2020 the cambridge model is a 12 dof model including 6 rigid body dofs of the foundation together with the flapwise and edgewise deformations of the three blades but neglects the tower flexibility the model is linearized and used in the frequency domain for preliminary evaluation of fowts lupton and langley 2019 comparing with the design oriented high fidelity models the reduced order models e g the slow and cambridge models have the advantage of computational efficiency transparency of the formulations and equations as well as flexibility in implementation state space or frequency domain formulation therefore this type of model might be preferred for specific research or application purposes such as preliminary controller design and quick load analysis recently a highly tailored 2 dof model has been developed souza and bachynski 2019 aiming at revealing the mechanism of the changes in surge and pitch decay periods of fowts for varying wind speeds besides the mechanical model both aerodynamic load modelling hansen 2015 de vaal et al 2014 and hydrodynamic load modelling are essential in simulating system responses especially for fowts fluid structure interaction between the water and the moving foundation must be well accounted for morison s equation morison et al 1950 is widely used and represents the hydrodynamic loads well even for complex floating structures such as the semi submersible foundations when comparing with test results van phuc and ishihara 2007 morison s equation has an inertial and a viscous term the inertial term which includes the froude krylov excitation and the zero frequency added mass tends to agree well with potential theory for low frequencies kvittem et al 2012 however for high frequency waves diffraction loads become important and morison s equation starts to deviate from the potential flow theory to incorporate the numerically solved results from the potential flow theory into the time domain fowt model 6 by 6 convolution integrals are needed using the impulse response functions of the radiation loads cummins 1962 which is quite computationally inefficient convolution integrals can be avoided by rational approximations of the frequency response functions as already applied in hydrodynamic modelling for ships kristiansen et al 2005 moored floating structures jordán and beltrán aguedo 2004 wave energy converters nielsen et al 2013 floating bridges xu et al 2018 and floating wind turbines duarte et al 2013 høeg and zhang 2019 this enables the radiation loads to be efficiently solved in the time domain together with the fowt model in terms of an extended state space formulation computational fluid dynamics cfd models have also been used to verify the potential flow theory for floating platforms of wind turbines such as tlp nematbakhsh et al 2015 or to investigate the heave plates for spar heave damping subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 although being a promising alternative cfd models are yet computationally too expensive for running numerous time domain simulations during the structural integrity assessment of fowts from a mechanics point of view a significant difference between fowts and their bottom fixed counterparts is that the gyroscopic effect plays a much more important role for fowts this is due to the low resistance of the system against pitch and yaw movements leading to much larger pitch and yaw motions of the floating foundation the foundation pitch angular velocity combined with the rotor spin speed induces gyroscopic moments acting on the foundation yaw motion and the tower torsional vibration similarly the foundation yaw angular velocity combined with the rotor spin speed induces gyroscopic moments acting on the foundation pitch motion and the tower fore aft vibration due to the gyroscopic effects the above mentioned motions are highly coupled and they are actually also slightly coupled to the blade vibrations to date few studies have investigated the gyroscopic effects on fowts a 7 dof rigid body dynamic model was developed for a spar type fowt and the rotor gyroscopic effects were examined for an idling fowt without aerodynamic loads al solihat et al 2019 however the model fails to capture the elastic tower and blades responses which will also couple to the spar through the gyroscopic effects and the operational fowt was not examined a similar 6 dof rigid body dynamic model was developed in the frequency domain for a vertical axis fowt mounted on a semi submersible foundation and the gyroscopic effects were examined in terms of the response amplitude operators raos blusseau and patel 2012 time domain simulations of the system subjected to realistic wind and wave loads were not performed and flexibility in the tower and blades was again ignored in a real time hybrid testing campaign of a semi submersible fowt bachynski et al 2015 the wave loads and floater response were physically tested in a wave basin while the aerodynamic loads were simulated and applied by an actuator the gyroscopic moments were also calculated in the numerical model and applied to the physical model by the actuator bachynski et al 2015 the inclusion of gyroscopic moments was shown to reduce the standard deviation of the spar yaw response however a deeper insight into the gyroscopic coupling effect and its mechanism was not provided as seen a comprehensive study including modelling quantification and evaluation of the gyroscopic effects on responses of horizontal axis fowts in different conditions parked or operational is still lacking the present paper aims to address this knowledge gap through rigorous modelling and extensive time domain simulations in the first part of the paper sections 2 and 3 an efficient time domain fowt model in terms of an extended state space formulation is established which exhibits the advantages of a reduced order model while incorporating the full coupling between structural dynamics and hydrodynamics this enables performing a large number of monte carlo simulations of the fully coupled fowt system with acceptable computational cost which is needed for evaluating the influence of gyroscopic effects on system responses in different load case scenarios with different environmental conditions the second part of the paper sections 4 and 5 focuses on investigating the significance of gyroscopic effect on responses of fowts different strategies within the euler lagrange framework for deriving linear system eoms are evaluated explicitly highlighting the differences in the gyroscopic matrix and some terms in the stiffness matrix resulting from the different strategies the correct strategy for capturing the full gyroscopic coupling is identified and compared with a more simplified strategy that only partially captures the gyroscopic coupling extensive monte carlo simulations are performed on three different scenarios i e fowts without aerodynamic loads fowts in idling condition and fowts in operational condition and various environmental conditions are considered it is found that the gyroscopic moments dominate the tower torsional and spar yaw responses of the spar type fowt without aerodynamic loads while for the semi submersible fowt only the tower torsion is influenced by the gyroscopic effects the spar type fowt is most sensitive to gyroscopic effects due to its low yaw inertia for idling and operational fowts the responses are dominated by aerodynamic loads and the gyroscopic effects have less remarkable influence nevertheless the gyroscopic coupling still play a more important role in operational fowts than idling fowts tower torsion of the operational fowt is most remarkably influenced by the gyroscopic effects 2 mechanical modelling of the 17 dof fowt system a 17 dof aero hydro servo elastic fowt model is developed using the euler lagrange approach in analytical dynamics where a combined multi body and modal based formulation is used for expressing the system energies the main reasons for developing our own in house model are 1 include the tower torsional dof that is missing in many available soft wares in a fowt model accounting for its full coupling with other dofs in a rigorous manner 2 provide in depth and transparent explanation guidance on how to develop in house reduced order fowt models 3 it will enable examining different derivation strategies for obtaining linear system matrices by comparing the explicitly given system matrices this model includes the coupled blades drivetrain tower foundation vibrations nonlinear aeroelasticity nonlinear quasi static mooring cable model as well as controller dynamics from the collective blade pitch and generator torque controllers 2 1 overview of the model the dofs and

respectively as well as the tower torsional dof q 17 t the tower torsional moment often drives the design of the tower top sections where bending moments are small compared with the bottom sections and thus including the tower torsional dof may be important the drivetrain shown in fig 2 is modelled using st venant torsional theory by the dofs q 9 t and q 10 t denoting the deviations of the angular positions at the hub and at the generator from the rated angular positions ω 0 t and n ω 0 t respectively with ω 0 being the rated rotor spin speed and n being the gear ratio as a result ω t ω

of the first edgewise mode the 3d nature of the blade mode shapes results from the structural pre twist also possibly the blade pitch angle coupling the out of plane and in plane vibrations in the present study however the blade deformation field is simplified by assuming the blade flapwise and edgewise modes to be the pure out of plane and in plane modes respectively that means u b 1 j x 3 t φ

system of the fowt is comprised of both a collective blade pitch and a generator torque controller as defined in jonkman et al 2009 the generator torque controller is dominating at wind speeds below the rated wind speed and the pitch controller is dominating above the rated wind speed a full span collective pitch controller is included in the 17 dof model with time delay due to the inertia of the actuator modelled by a 1st order filter of β t zhang 2015 the pitch demand is specified by a pi controller with feedback from q 9 t and q 9 t a gain scheduled pi controller is used for this model i e the controller gains are dependent on the blade pitch angle jonkman et al 2009 furthermore the variable speed generator torque controller is implemented as in jonkman et al 2009 where the generator torque is computed as a tabulated function of the filtered generator speed incorporating five control regions the two main regions are the optimal power region below the rated wind speed where the tip speed ratio is kept constant at the optimal value and above rated where the generator torque is kept constant according to jonkman 2010 3 loads on the 17 dof fowt model 3 1 aerodynamic gravity and

17 dof model it takes into account the weight and axial stiffness of the cable as well as the seabed friction using the basic catenary equation which is solved by a newton raphson iteration scheme all dynamic effects i e the inertia and structural damping of the cable hydrodynamic drag and added mass and dynamic seabed and anchor interaction are ignored however cable dynamics have been shown to be insignificant for the fowt responses although the cable responses are influenced significantly høeg and zhang 2018 since the present paper focuses on the gyroscopic effect on fowt responses the computationally efficient quasi static mooring model is considered appropriate 3 2 hydrodynamic loads the hydrodynamic load f h t in eq 12 can be composed by contributions from waves diffraction

convolution integrals in eq 18 the radiation load f r i t can be represented by an equivalent system of coupled first order differential equations taghipour et al 2008 perez and fossen 2009 nielsen et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 and be solved along with the fowt equations of motion eq 12 the method is based on a replacement of each entry h i j ω of the frequency response matrix with an approximating

freely with the only restriction m i j n i j each frequency response function h i j ω will be fitted independently and with independent orders m i j n i j of the rational function h i j s different methods for performing the approximation were discussed in taghipour et al 2008 in the present paper the invfreqs function in matlab is used due to its good performance in stability here the difference between m i j and n i j is fixed to be one i e m i j n i j 1 the best integer orders are chosen from the r 2 value by evaluating different values of n i j from 2 to 20 furthermore larger weighing factors are placed on the low frequency part of the frequency response function during the approximation so that the low frequency contents are more accurately represented the input output

auxiliary function without physical interpretation eq 23 is the so called output differential equation and eq 24 is the filter differential equation eq 24 can be written in the state space form as 25 d d t z r t a r z r t b r q f t where z r t is the state vector containing all the auxiliary functions y i j t and their time derivatives a r and b r are the coefficient matrices the detailed expressions of z r t a r and b r are given in appendix b similarly eq 23 can be written in the matrix form 26 f r t c r z r t with the coefficient matrix c r being given in appendix c combining eqs 25 and 26 with the state space form of eq 12 as well as the eom of the pitch controller an extended state space formulation of the coupled mechanical hydrodynamic controller system is established which can be solved by the 4th order runge kutta method 3 2 3 wave loads diffraction loads the diffraction loads on the spar are calculated by summing up the contributions from all frequency components 27 f

the hydrostatic loads are composed of two parts i e the heave buoyancy force and the hydrostatic restoring matrix the heave buoyancy force is simply calculated as 29 f b 0 3 ρ w g v s where ρ w is the mass density of seawater g is the gravitational acceleration and v s is the volume of the submerged part of the spar when it is upright and at the design draft the hydrostatic restoring matrix consists of stiffness coefficients for the heave roll and pitch displacements faltinsen 1990 30 k h s ρ w g 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 π 4 d 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 h b g v s π d 1 4 64 0 0 0 0 0 0 h b g v s

linear eoms of the system in deriving eq 12 all the nonlinear terms in the eoms are kept till the step of using the euler lagrange equation after which linearization is performed on the left hand side of the eoms to extract the system matrices m t g t and k t in principle the established nonlinear eoms can be directly used for simulating system responses however linearized eoms with explicit system matrices are preferred due to its compact format and its significantly improved computational efficiency the nonlinear eoms without any simplifications are actually computationally too heavy for running many simulations in the present paper linearization involves two sequential sub steps 1 assumption of small rotations angles i e cos q 1 and sin q q with q being one of the rotational dofs as well as the tower fore aft and side side top rotations 2 second and higher order terms e g q i q j are numerically smaller than the first order terms thus being neglected it should be noted that in this study the nonlinearities nonlinear dependence on dofs involved in the load vectors are retained since the linearization is performed at the very last step all possible coupling effects in the mechanical model are retained leading to the correct linear eoms correct system matrices of the system with the full gyroscopic coupling in the gyroscopic matrix g t between the blades tower and spar being correctly captured actually it is proved through our derivation that removing third and higher order terms after introducing the small angle assumptions in the system kinetic energy will lead to the same correct eoms as well although in this paper the velocity vectors are described in the global cs as indicated by eq 4 it is also proved that describing them in the local cs will lead to the same correct eoms as long as the linearization operation is performed at the kinetic energy or at the last step in table 1 these two linearization strategies that lead to the correct eoms are summarized in the first two columns in the following the correct linear eoms derived on the basis of the global cs as described in section 2 are denoted the gyro model the system matrices of which have been given in appendix b for the case of θ t θ c β 0 a more straightforward strategy for deriving linear system eoms is to linearize the velocity vectors of all structural components before formulating the system kinetic energy eq 3 which will significantly simplify the derivation procedure this can be further classified into two strategies i e image 2 velocity vectors defined in the local cs or image 3 velocity vectors defined in the global cs however both strategies unfortunately lead to some errors in the obtained gyroscopic matrix g t and stiffness matrix k t although the mass matrix m t is always correct strategy image 4 local cs based formulation with linearized velocity vectors results in an incorrect g t and some missing off diagonal terms in k t as shown in eq 46 in appendix b g t is constructed as a block matrix with four blocks the lower block g s is a skew symmetric gyroscopic matrix of the support structure tower and spar indicating the full gyroscopic couplings between tower fore aft rotation tower torsion spar pitch and spar yaw motions which are especially important for fowts g s is captured by the gyro model but is completely missing in this strategy image 5 as indicated by the red color in eq 46 further the block g b s t represents the gyroscopic couplings from the support structure vibrations to the blade flapwise vibration and strategy image 6 misses a factor of 2 in all the non zero terms in g b s t the other off diagonal block g s b t represents the gyroscopic couplings from the blade edgewise vibrations to the support structure vibrations strategy image 7 falsely results in non zero terms in the first three columns of g s b t which should be zero in the correct matrix as indicated by the grey color in eq 48 as for the stiffness matrix k t it is also constructed as a block matrix as shown in eq 49 strategy image 8 correctly captures the blocks k b ω t and k s but misses the terms in the first three columns of k s b t as indicated by the red color in eq 52 this implies that the stiffness coupling from the blade flapwise vibration to the support structure vibration is missing in strategy image 9 the consequences of this linearization strategy are summarized in the fourth column of table 1 for fixed foundation wind turbines these missing gyroscopic coupling effects are insignificant due to the restrained motion of the foundation as well as the large torsional stiffness of the tower hence this strategy has actually been employed for developing an aero servo elastic model of a fixed foundation wind turbine 38 39 due to its simplified and more operable derivation procedure it should also be noted that in fast the tower torsion dof is not included for the fixed foundation wind turbine model and thus these gyroscopic couplings are not accounted for as well in the following the linear eoms derived using strategy image 10 are denoted the no gyro model in section 5 the fowt responses from the no gyro model will be compared with those from the gyro model under different load cases scenarios on the other hand strategy image 1 global cs based formulation with linearized velocity vectors leads to the correct gyroscopic matrix g s of the support structure however it results in incorrect g b s t g s b t and k s b t as in the case of strategy image 1 more critically additional diagonal terms on the tower and spar dofs in k s are falsely introduced by strategy image 1 which will alter the system eigenfrequencies thus this linearization strategy should be avoided in all situations the consequences of this linearization strategy is summarized in the third column of table 1 an intermediate linearization strategy could be to remove the second and higher order terms in the velocity vectors while keeping the sine and cosine terms from the coordinate transformations unchanged it can be implemented either in the global cs or the local cs resulting in the same linear eoms this strategy corresponds to a partial linearization of the velocity vectors as illustrated in the fifth and sixth columns in table 1 to obtain the linear eoms small angle assumptions cos q 1 and sin q q are introduced at the very last step this strategy provides a slightly more simple and operable derivation procedure than the correct strategies the first and second columns in table 1 but is still much more demanding than strategy image 1 the fourth column in table 1 as indicated in table 1 it turns out that g s and k s are correctly captured but g b s t g s b t and k s b t are incorrect actually the resulting g b s t g s b t and k s b t matrices are identical to those from strategy image 1 and strategy image 1 finally another partial linearization strategy could be to only introduce the small angle assumptions cos q 1 and sin q q in the velocity vectors this strategy when used in the global cs as indicated in the seventh column in table 1 introduces additional incorrect diagonal terms in k s same as in strategy image 1 and should therefore be avoided however when this partial linearization strategy is used in the local cs it actually leads to the correct eoms therefore this simplified derivation procedure in the local cs enables faster derivation of the eoms of large and complex systems while still ensuring the correct gyroscopic couplings and avoiding errors in the diagonal of the stiffness matrix k s this strategy is indicated in the last column of table 1 in addition to table 1 a flowchart figure 20 is provided in appendix d visualizing all the different strategies mentioned in this section additionally two more strategies similar to strategy image 1 and strategy image 1 are shown in appendix d but with the order reversed i e higher order terms e g q i q j are removed first and the small angle assumptions cos q 1 and sin q q are then introduced by simplifying the velocities in this order some higher order terms are kept throughout the derivations however these two strategies still lead to false eoms and are not recommended nevertheless they are included in the flowchart so that all possible strategies with different combinations of simplification steps are presented in figure 20 only the gyro model and the no gyro model are further investigated in section 5 5 results and discussions 5 1 17 dof model verification data from the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 were used to calibrate the wind turbine system and the spar type floating foundation oc3 hywind spar together with the mooring line parameters were taken from jonkman 2010 the mode shapes for the blades and tower are taken from the cert test files in fast which were obtained from the bmodes bir 2005 module of fast table 2 shows the calculated parameters employed in the 17 dof fowt model the expressions of the inertia constants of the blades and tower are given in the beginning of appendix b and the corresponding expressions of the stiffness parameters were given in subsection 2 2 2 the hydrodynamic added mass matrix the potential damping matrix and the transfer functions for the diffraction loads are obtained by linear potential flow theory using the software nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 from nemoh the added mass matrix with element m a i j ω and potential damping matrix with element c h i j ω at discrete frequencies are obtained following the procedure in subsection 3 2 2 rational approximation is performed on each frequency response function h h i j ω eq 20 fig 4 a and b show the rational approximation with the order m n 3 4 for the radiation forces in surge and pitch directions in terms of the added mass and potential damping respectively the fitting goodness of the rational approximation has an r 2 value of 0 991 and 0 996 for the surge and pitch dofs respectively indicating rather good agreement furthermore the poles and zeros of the rational approximation of the frequency response functions h h 11 ω and h h 55 ω are also shown in fig 4 a and b in the upper right corners of the respective graphs as seen the fitted rational functions have negative real parts of the poles leading to stable solutions using the 4th order runge kutta method with a time step of 0 02s simulations of the 17 dof model are performed the fast model is set up with θ t θ c 0 and the yaw controller and yaw dof turned off in order to match the 17 dof model setup additionally the aerodynamics in fast are set to the classical bem model using aerodyn v15 jonkman et al 2015 the inflow wind is steady without wind shear and the tower potential flow and hub loss effects are turned off the skewed wake correction model is set to pitt and peters as in the 17 dof model finally the hydrodynamics are modelled in a similar way as in the 17 dof model but with the convolution integral for the radiation loads the time step is 0 125s with a 4th order adams bashforth adams moulton scheme used for numerical time integration for the model comparisons in this section 5 1 the 17 dof model also uses a convolution integral to calculate the radiation loads with an equal 60s memory time as in fast this setup means that the main differences between the models are the additional second modes for the blade flapwise tower fore aft and side side vibrations as well as the missing tower torsion dof in fast these additional second modes in fast should in principle be switched off for more fair comparison however our simulation results indicate that they have negligible influence on the responses of the spar type fowt and thus they are kept on on the other hand it should be noted that the 2nd tower modes have remarkable influence on the dynamics of the tlp fowt the steady state responses of the model are compared with those from fast jonkman et al 2009 for wind speeds ranging from cut in 3 m s to cut out 25 m s very good agreement were obtained for all responses both structural responses and non structural responses the results of 17 output variables are shown in fig 5 the largest deviation is seen for the blade tip edgewise displacement but as shown if the structural pre twist is turned off in fast the results match again on the other hand this only introduces negligible changes in other responses in fast the blade edgewise response is not of great interest in the present study therefore the simplification made in section 2 2 1 where the structural pre twist has been ignored in the structural matrices is considered acceptable the yaw response also deviates from fast and mostly around the rated wind speed where the displacements and rotations are largest this could be due to the fact that fast is a nonlinear model with up to about 20 rotations jonkman 2007 and that the 17 dof model is linearized at q 0 finally a comparison of the 17 dof model with and without the blade pitch angle β included in the structural matrices are performed the results are almost unchanged except for the blade edgewise response where results above rated with β 0 are slightly lower for the case of neglecting the blade pitch angle in the structural matrices it should be noted that the statistical results in subsections 5 2 and 5 4 do not include the blade pitch angle in the structural matrices in addition to the steady state responses transient responses to a step input i e mean wind speed of 15 m s at t 0 are evaluated and compared with those from fast the initial rotor speed is 12 1 rpm and the pitch and generator torque controllers are turned on wind shear and wave loads are not considered in fig 6 only the blade flapwise vibration tower fore aft vibration spar pitch motion and spar yaw are shown the agreement of the blade flapwise tower fore aft and spar pitch are excellent in both time and frequency domains indicating that the 17 dof model accurately captures the global dynamics of a fowt system the spar yaw response deviates most and like the steady state response in fig 5 this might be due to the fact that some nonlinearities are not accounted for in the 17 dof model furthermore the 17 dof model also includes the tower torsion dof enabling the evaluation of full gyroscopic effects on the fowt responses under different load cases various environmental conditions are considered in the following simulations and are summarized in table 3 for the aerodynamic loads seven different mean wind speeds and one turbulence intensity are considered for the hydrodynamic loads four different irregular sea states with four different combinations of the significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p are considered corresponding to low medium high and extreme wave conditions table 4 summarizes the load cases scenarios simulated in the following subsections the no aero scenario is investigated in subsection 5 2 where the aerodynamic loads are turned off and the rotor speed is either 0 or 5 revolution per minute rpm and both the pitch and generator torque controllers are turned off the idling scenario is investigated in subsection 5 3 it is similar to but not equal to the design load case dlc 6 1a in the iec61400 3 international electrotechnical commission iec 2009 this load case includes a 50 year extreme mean wind speed of 50 m s and an extreme sea state with a significant wave height h s k 2 h s 50 1 09 15 6 m 17 0 m international electrotechnical commission iec 2009 the 15 6 m 50 year significant wave height is taken as the maximum value for a site off the coast of norway with a 200 m water depth li et al 2013 it should be noted that in the present study h s 17 0 m is chosen for the extreme wave condition ext in table 3 that is used for all three load cases as in summarized in table 4 the aerodynamic loads are calculated without using the blade element momentum theory i e no iterations in order to generate gyroscopic loads the blades are pitched to angles between 65 and 90 and the resulting rotor speed varies approximately linearly between 5 4 rpm to 0 2 rpm finally the operational scenario normal power production is investigated subsection 5 4 it is similar to but not equal to the dlc 1 1 or dlc 1 2 in iec61400 3 international electrotechnical commission iec 2009 for evaluating the ultimate or fatigue loads respectively different types of foundations have different natural frequencies and different resistance against pitch and yaw rotations therefore in subsection 5 2 the semi submersible robertson et al 2014 and the tlp matha 2010 are also simulated besides the spar in order to compare the significance of the gyroscopic effects in these three foundations the semi submersible platform for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is chosen as the oc4 semi submersible platform this platform has three offset columns each with a diameter of 12 0 m and one main column with a diameter of 6 5 m at the center to which the wind turbine is mounted the offset columns are spaced 50 0 m between each other for each of them a 24 0 m diameter heave plate is mounted at the bottom the height of the heave plate is 6 0 m and the total draft is 20 0 m the pontoons and cross members connecting the columns were disregarded in the hydrodynamic modelling in the present study the tlp platform for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is chosen as the mit nrel tension leg platform with one 18 0 m diameter column whose draft is 47 9 m the mit nrel tlp has four spokes at the bottom and each of them has two mooring lines attached the four spokes were disregarded in the hydrodynamic modelling the semi submersible and tlp fowt models are also established by using the 17 dof model explained in sections 2 and 3 and are verified by comparing with fast results as well not shown here with the 2nd tower modes of the tlp fowt being switched off in fast for each of the three load cases monte carlo simulations are performed and ultimate and fatigue related loads responses are statistically estimated for the tower fore aft base moment and tower torque a fatigue equivalent load hendriks and bulder 1995 or damage equivalent load is calculated for comparison a fatigue equivalent load is defined as the constant load amplitude at n e q load cycles that leads to the same damage as that caused by time varying load series obtained from rainflow counting rainflow function in matlab the range and number of load cycles are used to estimate the fatigue equivalent loads with n e q 10 7 cycles and an s n slope being m 4 on the other hand the standard deviation is used for spar pitch and yaw responses instead because the foundation is considered to be rigid thus the damage can not be defined as for the ultimate loads responses they are estimated based on the extreme value extrapolation from the obtained time histories with a gumbel distribution and an exceedance probability of 3 8 10 7 as detailed in høeg and zhang 2018 5 2 fowts with aerodynamic loads turned off first aerodynamic loads on the rotor are turned off while the floating platform is subjected to irregular waves in order to isolate the gyroscopic effects two different rotor spin speeds are considered i e 0 rpm and 5 rpm additionally for the 5 rpm case the no gyro model described in section 4 is also evaluated in order to highlight the significance of capturing the full gyroscopic coupling in the linear eoms fig 7 compares the responses from the above mentioned cases of 0 rpm 5 rpm as well as 5 rpm with no gyro model for spar type fowts it is seen from fig 7 a that the tower fore aft vibration is almost unchanged when ω changes from 0 rpm to 5 rpm which is also the case for the spar pitch motion not shown here this is because the dominating excitation is the wave load which directly excites the spar pitch and the tower fore aft responses due to their inertia coupling regardless of ω on the contrary the tower torsion and spar yaw responses are significantly changed as shown in fig 7 b and c this is due to the change of system gyroscopic matrix g t and stiffness matrix k t when ω changes from 0 rpm to 5 rpm where the skew symmetric gyroscopic matrix g s eq 46 of the support structure plays the most important role for the 5 rpm case g s in eq 46 is non zero and the full gyroscopic coupling of the four modes i e tower fore aft tower torsion spar pitch and spar yaw takes place as a result the mechanical energy flows from the spar pitch and tower fore aft modes the directly excited modes to the spar yaw and tower torsional modes the indirectly excited modes as shown in fig 7 b the tower torsion is more significantly excited when ω changes from 0 rpm to 5 rpm with the gyroscopic effects fully represented the fourier amplitude spectrum shows that the spectral peaks at the spar pitch and tower fore aft eigenfrequencies are much higher for the 5 rpm case than the 0 rpm case indicating gyroscopic coupling the spectral peak at the spar yaw eigenfrequency is also increased when ω increases to 5 rpm implying that energy also flows from the spar yaw mode to the tower torsional mode mainly due to their indirect coupling through g s their direct coupling through m s and the load vector are the same for both 0 rpm and 5 rpm furthermore the results of the 5 rpm with no gyro model are almost identical to those of the 0 rpm case due to the fact that the no gyro model misses the gyroscopic matrix g s as explained in section 4 actually the two results slightly differ at the higher frequencies i e tower fore aft and blade flapwise related frequencies since the no gyro model partially captures the gyroscopic couplings g b s t and g s b t while they are zero matrices for the 0 rpm case fig 7 c shows the corresponding comparison of the spar yaw motion similarly the spar yaw motion is more significantly excited when ω changes from 0 rpm to 5 rpm with the two spectral peaks corresponding to spar pitch and yaw eigenfrequencies much higher for the 5 rpm case furthermore the results of the 5 rpm with no gyro model agree well with the 0 rpm case indicating the missing gyroscopic matrix g s in the no gyro model fig 8 shows the corresponding comparisons for semi submersible fowts similar to the spar the tower fore aft response shown in fig 8 a is almost unchanged when the rotor speed changes to 5 rpm fig 8 b indicates that the tower torsion of the semi submersible fowt is significantly excited as ω increases from 0 rpm to 5 rpm similar to that in fig 7 b the difference between the results from gyro model and no gyro model are also similar to fig 7 b therefore it is concluded that although the tower torsion amplitudes are smaller for the semi submersible fowt the gyroscopic effects play a similarly important role in the tower torsion for both foundation types contrarily fig 8 c reveals the main difference between the semi submersible and the spar i e the yaw response of the semi submersible is almost unchanged by the gyroscopic effects this is because the semi submersible is much more exposed to wave loads which dominate the yaw motion in addition the yaw mass moment of inertia and added mass are much larger than the spar implying larger resistance to yaw motions and thus less influence from the gyroscopic effects fig 9 shows the comparisons for the tlp fowts as seen the foundation pitch and tower fore aft eigenfrequencies are increased a lot compared with the other two concepts due to the taut mooring lines fig 9 a shows that the frequency distribution of the tower fore aft response is also quite different from the spar and the semi submersible nevertheless the gyroscopic effects have consistently negligible influence on the tower fore aft response fig 9 b confirms the similar observations as in figs 7 b and fig 8 b i e the gyroscopic effects have noticeable influence on the tower torsion the foundation yaw response on the other hand is hardly influenced by the gyroscopic effects which is similar to the semi submersible however it should be noted that this is not always the case for the tlp the misaligned wave β w 30 here directly excites the in plane vibrations that couple to the yaw motion due to the rotor overhang and downwind location of the nacelle cog since the yaw dof of the tlp is undamped without aerodynamic loads the indirect pumping of energy from the misaligned wave significantly excites the yaw eigenvibration resonance and the gyroscopic effects become minor for aligned waves the tower torsion and foundation yaw responses of the tlp turn out to resemble those in fig 7 for the spar and the gyroscopic effects exhibit larger influence on the foundation yaw motion without aerodynamic loads the only dominating excitation for the tower torsion of these three types of fowts is the gyroscopic moment resulted from the terms in gyroscopic matrix g s and the tower fore aft and foundation pitch velocities since the hydrodynamic loads and mooring loads are always absent for this dof normally the generator torque also results in tower torsion and foundation yaw due to the shaft tilt in the present numerical example the tilt angle is set to zero thus eliminating the influence from the generator controller to further reveal the contributions from different excitation sources on the foundation yaw dof of the three foundation concepts fig 10 compares the gyroscopic moment the hydrodynamic moment and the mooring line induced moment on the foundation yaw dof for the 5 rpm case with the accurate gyro model the gyroscopic moment is extracted by moving the relevant terms from the gyroscopic matrices g s g b s t and g s b t and the velocity vector to the right hand side of eq 12 it is seen from fig 10 a that the mooring moment has the most significant contribution to the spar yaw load the gyroscopic moment has a smaller magnitude and is almost out of phase with the mooring moment the hydrodynamic drag induced moment has negligible contribution to the spar yaw response fig 10 b on the other hand shows that the semi submersible yaw motion is excited almost purely by the hydrodynamic moment which also explains the almost identical yaw responses for the three cases shown in fig 8 c finally fig 10 c shows that the dominating moment acting on the tlp yaw dof is the mooring moment resulting from the large yaw eigenvibration that is indirectly excited by the misaligned wave as explained in regard to fig 9 c the hydrodynamic drag moment is almost absent and the gyroscopic moment is slightly visible with the main frequency content at the tlp pitch frequency since the gyroscopic effects influence the spar type fowt most significantly although the tlp fowt will be similarly influenced with aligned wave only results of the spar type fowt are shown in the remaining parts of the paper fig 11 summarizes the influence of gyroscopic effects on the load and response statistics of the spar type fowt with aerodynamic loads turned off by comparing the 0 rpm and 5 rpm cases for each sea state 100 different realizations each with a 1200 s time duration are generated for monte carlo simulation and statistics tower base fore aft moment tower torque as well as spar pitch angle and spar yaw angle are evaluated and shown in fig 11 in terms of both the ultimate loads responses and the fatigue related loads responses in accordance with the time series in fig 7 the results in fig 11 indicate that the tower fore aft and spar pitch responses are almost identical for the 0 rpm and 5 rpm cases even when taking into account the uncertainties in the wave loads on the contrary the tower torsion and spar yaw responses are significantly increased when the rotor speed increases from 0 rpm to 5 rpm due to the gyroscopic effects both in terms of the ultimate response and the fatigue related response the differences in percentage of the response statistics between the 0 rpm and 5 rpm cases are summarized in the first column of table 5 where the minus sign indicates a larger ultimate response or fatigue related response for the 5 rpm case and the plus sign indicates a larger response for the 0 rpm case 5 3 fowt in idling conditions next the spar type fowts in idling conditions are investigated with the aerodynamic loads accounted for the aerodynamic loads are calculated directly using the aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients on the blade sections without the iterations through the bem method the blades are pitched to a constant angle and six different values of the constant pitch angle β between 65 and 90 are considered as shown in table 4 thus the time varying blade pitch controller is turned off the generator torque controller is also turned off the wind speed is chosen as the 50 year extreme of 50 m s with i r e f 0 12 for a class ic site in iec 61400 1 international electrotechnical commission iec 2005 the rotor speed is dependent on the constant pitch angle applied and varies between 5 4 rpm for β 65 and 0 2 rpm for β 90 both the gyro model and no gyro model are used to simulate the responses of the idling spar type fowt for revealing the significance of gyroscopic effects fig 12 compares the results from the gyro model and the no gyro model for the idling fowt subjected to one realization of the high wave condition high in table 3 with the incoming wave angle β w 0 the blade is pitched to an angle of β 65 so that the results with a relatively large rotor speed are shown fig 12 a shows that the tower top fore aft response is very slightly lower for the no gyro model compared with the gyro model although still insignificant the difference in tower fore aft response shown in fig 12 a is more noticeable than that in the no aero load case fig 7 a in section 5 2 it is seen that the spectral peaks at the spar yaw and tower fore aft frequencies are slightly lower for the no gyro model further due to the large blade pitch angle the fore aft aerodynamic damping turns out to be low the fore aft eigenvibration is effectively excited in contrast to the operational load case shown in section 5 4 fig 12 b shows that the difference in the tower torsional response is much less significant than that in fig 7 b from the fourier amplitude spectrum the change in the frequency contents of tower torsion compared with fig 7 b is clear at the blade edgewise backward and forward whirling modes this is due to the change of the blade pitch angle from β 0 to β 65 resulting in changed system matrices for the no gyro model the spectral peak at the spar pitch frequency is slightly higher than that in the gyro model on the other hand the spectral peaks at the wave peak spar yaw and blade edgewise backward and forward whirling frequencies are lower for the no gyro model lastly fig 12 c shows that the spar yaw is only insignificantly influenced by the gyroscopic effects for idling fowts in contrast to the results in fig 7 c for the no gyro model the spectral peak at the wave peak and spar yaw eigenfrequency are slightly lower for better understanding the results in figs 12 and 13 compares the contributions from different excitation sources on the tower torsional dof and spar yaw dof of the idling fowt with the accurate gyro model as shown in fig 13 a the only two torsional moments acting on the tower torsional dof are the aerodynamic moment and the gyroscopic moment the aerodynamic moment is of much larger magnitude than the gyroscopic moment this explains the smaller difference in tower torsion between the gyro model and the no gyro model in fig 12 b than in fig 7 b nevertheless the two spectral peaks at the wave and tower fore aft frequencies in the fourier amplitude of the gyroscopic moment on torsional dof confirm the presence of the gyroscopic coupling next fig 13 b compares the aerodynamic moment the gyroscopic moment the hydrodynamic drag induced moment and the mooring line induced moment on the spar yaw dof the mooring moment is of the largest amplitudes because it is the reaction to the large spar yaw response excited due to resonance as the aerodynamic damping is low here this can be confirmed by the large spectral peak at spar yaw eigenfrequency in the fourier amplitude of the mooring moment the aerodynamic moment is also of much larger amplitudes than the hydrodynamic moment and the gyroscopic moment although smaller than the mooring moment the gyroscopic moment is most insignificant which explains the insignificant difference between the gyro model and no gyro model in fig 12 c it should be emphasized that the aerodynamic loads in fig 12 correspond to the idling fowt with a fixed pitch angle of β 65 and a resulting rotor speed of 5 4 rpm the aerodynamic loads will be much smaller for the idling fowt with fully feathered blades β 90 however in this case the rotor speed is also close to zero and consequently the gyroscopic effects are vanishing fig 14 compares the response statistics of gyro model and no gyro model for the idling spar type fowt in terms of the fatigue equivalent loads for the tower fore aft base moment and tower torque and standard deviations for the spar pitch and yaw responses six blade pitch angles and four different irregular sea states from table 3 are considered for each sea state 10 realizations are generated resulting in 2 4 6 10 480 simulations fig 14 a shows that the difference in the fatigue equivalent tower fore aft moment between the two models is almost zero at β 90 and becomes more significant as the blade pitch angle β decreases due to the increased rotor speed therefore the enhanced gyroscopic effects the no gyro model consistently underestimates the fore aft load although insignificant and the largest difference 1 62 takes place at β 65 the spar yaw standard deviations in fig 14 d exhibit a similar tendency as in fig 14 a with a largest difference being 2 08 at β 65 the fatigue equivalent tower torsional moment and spar pitch standard deviation in fig 14 b and c are hardly influenced by the gyroscopic effects with the largest underestimation by the no gyro model being 1 05 and 1 21 respectively although gyroscopic effect is seen to play a very insignificant role for idling fowts attention may still need to be paid since the results from no gyro model are on the unsafe side 5 4 fowt in operational power production conditions finally fowts in operational conditions are investigated with the aerodynamic loads acting on the rotating blades and wave loads acting on the floating spar both the pitch controller and the generator controller are turnd on for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine the rated rotor spin speed during power production is ω 0 12 1 rpm this is the mean value around which the actual rotor speed ω t slightly fluctuates ω 0 12 1 rpm is used in the following simulations of both the gyro model and the no gyro model the results are then compared to reveal the significance of capturing the full gyroscopic coupling in the linear eoms for operational fowts fig 15 compares the results from the gyro model and the no gyro model for the operational fowt subjected to one realization of the extreme wave condition with the incoming wave angle β w 0 the mean wind speed is v 0 15 m s and the turbulence intensity is i r e f 0 12 wind shear is not considered in the present study tower top fore aft displacement tower torsion and spar yaw motion are evaluated in general the differences between the results from the two models gyro model and no gyro model are less significant comparing with those in fig 7 especially for the tower torsion and spar yaw responses the differences in tower torsion and spar yaw responses are however more significant than those in fig 12 due to the increased rotor speed from 5 4 rpm to 12 1 rpm and thus the enhanced gyroscopic effects the tower fore aft vibration in fig 15 a is almost identical for the two models which is also the case for the spar pitch motion not shown here this is in accordance with the results in fig 7 a due to the same reason that these two modes are directly excited by the wave loads and aerodynamic loads the aerodynamic damping present in the tower fore aft and spar pitch modes of an operational fowt further eliminates the influence from the gyroscopic effects as the aerodynamic damping in an idling fowt is lower the gyroscopic effects on the tower fore aft response are actually slightly less suppressed as already shown in fig 12 a fig 15 b demonstrates that there is obvious difference in the tower torsional response between the two models although much less remarkable comparing with that in fig 7 b as shown in the fourier amplitude spectrum the no gyro model underestimates the spectral peak at the spar pitch eigenfrequency comparing with the gyro model indicating the consequence of the missing gyroscopic matrix g s and thus the gyroscopic coupling between the spar yaw and tower torsional modes in the no gyro model on the other hand the no gyro model slightly overestimates the spectral peak at the wave peak frequency it also overestimates the higher frequency components mainly related to the drivetrain eigenfrequency confirming that the no gyro model only partially incorrectly captures the gyroscopic coupling between the blades that couple to drivetrain and the tower torsional mode the spar yaw responses in fig 15 c from the two models exhibit similar difference as in fig 15 b except that there are no high frequency components in the spar yaw response as shown in the fourier amplitude spectrum the no gyro model slightly underestimates the spectral peak at the spar pitch eigenfrequency and overestimates the spectral peak at the wave peak frequency in order to evaluate the wave misalignment effect fig 16 compares the results from the same two models gyro model and no gyro model as in fig 15 but with a wave misalignment angle of β w 30 the differences between the results from the two models are similar to those in fig 15 indicating a similar influence from the gyroscopic effects the tower fore aft responses in fig 16 a look almost the same as in fig 15 a except that the amplitude is slightly smaller due to the reduced wave energy supplied in the for aft direction in fig 16 b and c the spectral peak at the wave frequency is seen to be higher than in fig 15 b and c due to the coupling between the tower torsion and spar yaw with the fowt in plane vibrations which are excited by the misaligned waves the no gyro model noticeably underestimates this wave induced spectral peak for tower torsion in accordance with figs 10 and 13 fig 17 compares the contributions from different excitation sources on the tower torsional dof and on the spar yaw dof of the operational fowt with the accurate gyro model the environmental conditions are exactly the same as in fig 15 fig 17 a shows that the only two torsional moments acting on the tower torsional dof are the aerodynamic moment and the gyroscopic moment extracted by moving the relevant terms from the left hand side to the right hand side of eq 12 with the aerodynamic moment being much more significant this is somewhat similar to the observations in fig 13 a except that the gyroscopic moment here is of larger magnitudes than that in fig 13 a due to the increased rotor speed for both idling and operational fowts the dominating excitation on tower torsion is the aerodynamic loads and the gyroscopic effects become less important comparing with the no aero load case on the other hand the gyroscopic effects for operational fowts are more significant than for idling fowts as seen from the fourier amplitude spectrum the aerodynamic moment contains frequency components from the turbulence spectrum 1p wave peak frequency and drivetrain eigenfrequency the gyroscopic moment contains frequency components from the spar pitch eigenfrequency and the wave peak frequency which agree with the response spectrum in fig 15 b fig 17 b compares the aerodynamic moment the gyroscopic moment the hydrodynamic moment and the mooring moment on the spar yaw dof it is observed that the aerodynamic moment and the mooring moment dominated by the spar pitch and yaw eigenfrequencies have the most significant contributions to the spar yaw loads on an operational fowt the gyroscopic moment is still much more significant than the hydrodynamic drag induced moment as in fig 10 b but not comparable with the aerodynamic moment even though the rotor speed is increased from 5 rpm at idling to 12 1 rpm at power production figs 18 and 19 compare the response statistics of the no gyro model and the gyro model for an operational fowt six different mean wind speeds and four different sea states as shown in table 3 are considered and 100 realizations each with 1200 s time duration for each environmental condition are generated for monte carlo simulation and response statistics this leads to 2 4 6 100 4800 simulations the fatigue equivalent loads and the ultimate loads responses are obtained using the same methods as in section 5 2 for fig 11 the results in fig 18 a and c indicate that the tower fore aft response is almost identical for the no gyro model and the gyro model even taking into account the load uncertainties this agrees well with the observation from the time series in fig 15 on the other hand the difference in the tower torsional response between the two models are more significant it is seen from fig 18 b and d that the no gyro model consistently overestimates the tower torsional response when the mean wind speed is above 6 m s the differences in percentage of the tower response statistics between the two models are summarized in table 5 where the plus sign indicates a larger ultimate response or fatigue related response from the no gyro model the no gyro model overestimates the tower torsional ultimate response up to 17 00 and the fatigue equivalent tower torsional moment up to 12 76 similar to fig 18 a and c fig 19 a and c indicate that the spar pitch response is almost identical for the no gyro model and the gyro model even accounting for the load uncertainties the difference in the spar yaw response is more significant between the two models as shown in fig 19 b and d for mean wind speed above 9 m s the no gyro model consistently overestimates the spar yaw response in accordance to the findings from fig 18 b and d for low wind speed 6 m s and 9 m s there is no clear tendency which might be due to the more significant influence from the generator controller and the reduced rotor speed in the below rated region the differences in percentage of the spar response statistics between the two models is also summarized in table 5 the no gyro model overestimates the spar yaw ultimate response up to 15 56 and the standard deviation of yaw up to 8 71 6 conclusions this paper investigates the influence of gyroscopic couplings on stochastic dynamic responses of a spar type fowt in both parked and operational conditions a 17 dof fowt model with controllers is rigorously developed using the euler lagrange approach and verified by comparing with fast a state space representation of the radiation loads is established which combined with the 17 dof fowt model results in an extended state space formulation of the coupled mechanical hydrodynamic controller system for very efficient time domain simulations within the euler lagrange framework different strategies for deriving linear system eoms have been investigated and evaluated the system mass matrix is always correctly captured the full gyroscopic coupling of the mechanical model can only be correctly captured when the linearization operation is performed at the last step or at the kinetic energy formulation regardless of formulating in the local or global cs leading to the correct gyro model linearizing all velocity vectors formulated in the local cs before substituting into the kinetic energy provides a significantly simplified and more operable derivation procedure however the gyroscopic matrix of the support structure is missed and some gyroscopic coupling terms between the blades and the support structure are incorrect leading to the no gyro model that partially captures the gyroscopic effects linearizing velocity vectors that are formulated in the global cs results in false diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix and should be avoided in all situations from extensive monte carlo simulations it is found that the gyroscopic effects significantly influence tower torsion of the fowts without aerodynamic loads for all three foundation types considered regardless of the yaw inertia in terms of foundation yaw the spar type fowt is most sensitive to gyroscopic effects while the semi submersible is insensitive and the sensitivity of the tlp fowts depends on the incoming wave direction for idling and operational fowts the responses are dominated by aerodynamic loads and the gyroscopic effects have less significant influence nevertheless the gyroscopic coupling is more important for operational fowts due to the larger rotor speed the no gyro model overestimates tower torsional ultimate response of the operational fowt up to 17 00 and the fatigue equivalent tower torsional moment up to 12 76 which may impact the design of tower top sections on the other hand the tower fore aft response of idling fowts is very slightly underestimated if gyroscopic effects are not considered credit authorship contribution

governmental commercial and private assets that are vulnerable to water borne intrusion such as liquefied natural gas terminals tankers etc these barriers require additional evaluation in the case of their deployment at significant water depth in offshore environments the seaworthiness of the triton barrier design developed by halo maritime defense systems us was investigated through a combination of field deployment physical testing and numerical simulations the full scale triton barrier deployed and inspected south southwest of white island isles of shoals new hampshire provided important information on its dynamic behavior and the overall structural integrity under monitored environmental conditions physical tests of a froude scaled barrier model were conducted in chase ocean engineering laboratory wave tank at the university of new hampshire to properly measure response of the structure and its mooring to different single frequency waves directed parallel and normal to the model both physical tests and field study load cases were numerically simulated in finite element hydro fe software the comparisons indicated a good correspondence between physical tests and numerical models in terms of heave pitch roll and force response amplitude operators overall the full scale triton barrier has demonstrated robust performance during the offshore field deployment keywords floating barriers wave response finite element analysis physical testing field deployment 1 introduction floating protective barriers can be used to protect naval bases offshore platforms ports nuclear power facilities bridges dams refineries and desalination plants and other assets from terrorist attacks in different marine environments they prevent attacks by a simple boat loaded with explosives which is one of the most popular and dangerous types of the attack due to its relative cheapness and technical simplicity hill 2009 fig 1 illustrates consequences of a small suicide boat attack on m v limburg a french flagged vlcc supertanker off of the port of ash shihr southeast of sana a yemen in october 2002 greenberg et al 2006 the explosion lead to loss of several crewmembers and a spill of over 50 000 barrels of oil carafano 2007 another well known example is that of suicide terrorists exploding a motorboat alongside the uss cole a navy destroyer as it was refueling in the yemen port of aden on october 12 2000 perl and o rourke 2001 the blast ripped a 10 m wide hole near the waterline of the cole killing 17 american sailors and injuring many more in order to effectively prevent such catastrophes the performance of floating protective barriers of different designs are usually investigated through field studies decew and rowell 2013 kalinski et al 2014 although most of the studies have been focused on actual waterborne craft impact testing and corresponding design optimizations which are then proved by u s navy and other military or civilian customers nixon et al 2004 2005 bishop 2013 osienski et al 2017 some numerical investigations have also been conducted since large scale tests are quite expensive and labor intensive for instance a series of full scale finite element simulations and the corresponding real impact tests of foxx barriers were performed by polish naval academy kiciński et al 2019 to the best of the authors knowledge there are no other publicly available publications related to either physical or numerical testing of floating protective barriers in offshore deployments in addition to impact protection the floating barriers and their mooring systems have to be able to withstand high energy environmental loading conditions without experiencing significant damage or even failure the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive approach to the prediction and evaluation of floating barrier offshore performance using the example of a triton floating barrier manufactured by halo maritime defense systems usa fig 2 the approach includes a combination of full scale field studies scaled physical testing and numerical modeling the four month long field deployment of the barrier continued from january to may 2018 near the isles of shoals new hampshire usa and covered a period of the winter storms fig 3 the scaled physical testing 1 20 was conducted in the university of new hampshire unh wave tow tank utilizing techniques previously developed and validated for various offshore aquaculture installations fredriksson et al 2000 decew et al 2005 wang et al 2015 the numerical modeling was performed with the finite element analysis software hydro fe based on the well validated aqua fe program developed at unh gosz et al 1996 tsukrov et al 2000 2003 fredriksson et al 2003 and extensively applied in the marine aquaculture field decew et al 2010 wang et al 2015 knysh et al 2020 the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 1 is dedicated to the field study organization description of the research site and data acquisition manufacturing of the scaled triton barrier and its mooring as well as a description of the experimental facilities and instruments are presented in section 2 2 section 2 3 covers development of the numerical model and its basic parameters the comparisons between single frequency wave results obtained in physical tests and numerical simulations are given in section 3 the section also includes comparison between barrier responses to random waves the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 methods 2 1 field study 2 1 1 description of the barrier system the investigated triton barrier system consists of four 15 m units each unit is 6 m high 3 3 m wide and stands approximately 3 m off the water the units are joined together by dual ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber hinges allowing the segments to contour waves and absorb the loading due to the high energy marine environment fig 4 a schematics of each unit can be seen in fig 4b which depicts the first unit with the mooring line attachment at the left end units consist of two longitudinal pipes connected to transverse and side members with upper and lower pipes all made of high density polyethylene hdpe most of the side and transverse members are attached to the longitudinal upper and lower pipes by butt fusing tees which are held in place by pins and tabs attachment methods also include hangers strapped around the pipe and eyes through bolted to the pipe the stainless steel impact netting is suspended from the upper pipe and attached to the transverse members the first unit of the barrier deployed in the field study also included an instrument box with accelerometer and data pack powered by a solar panel the instrument box is attached to the upper pipe that is supported by side members the longitudinal pipes of neighboring units are connected by hinges at the waterline and additionally secured by limiter cables that ensure structural integrity even if hinge is damaged longitudinal pipes contain closed cell foam flotation whereas the lower pipe is filled with heavy chain ballast providing increased stability the impact netting of each unit is connected to each other by the net joint and placed between the longitudinal and upper pipes so it is present along the whole barrier more information on geometric and mechanical properties of the barrier s components is presented in sections 2 2 and 2 3 2 1 2 offshore deployment site and mooring setup the four unit barrier was deployed at the 52 m deep unh research site located 2 8 km south southwest from white island isles of shoals new hampshire usa see fig 5 it was oriented north south the deployment continued from january to may 2018 to cover the period of the winter for which northeast storms typical of the north atlantic were present an average tidal range seen at gosport harbor at the isle of shoals from the national ocean service tide charts is 2 6 m with the tidal current at the unh research site of roughly 10 cm s the barrier s mooring system was designed based on the seafloor and environmental features of the unh site its schematics is shown in fig 6 there are two 15 m short fiber bridles connecting the barrier to surface buoys of 40 kn buoyancy two 105 m long fiber lines hang from the buoys and are attached to 2800 kg stud link chain which provides damping and prevents excessive mooring line jerking the chain is fixed by a 2000 kg dead weight and secured by drag embedment anchor at its end more information on geometric and mechanical properties of the mooring components is presented in section 2 2 2 1 3 field data acquisition the triton system was equipped with four globalstar smartone c small onboard global positioning system gps tracking devices one on each of the four units these gps devices allowed for the position of the barrier while deployed to be monitored from shore as each triton unit was equipped with a device in the event of a separation or mooring failure each unit could be tracked individually the barrier s motion during the entire deployment including deployment and retrieval as well as the barrier s movement during its time at the research site were tracked and did not cross expected boundaries to measure the gravitational and dynamic accelerations experienced by the barrier a specifically designed system consisting of a 9 axis accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer was utilized the system was powered by arduino atmega328p microcontroller processor and attached to the upper pipe of the first barrier unit in order to determine the barrier s heave response to wave forcing vertical acceleration data was logged hourly in individual files and then analyzed the wave environment of the unh offshore site was characterized using a subsurface wave logger made by rbr this dual channel temperature and depth tide and wave logger device was attached below a taut moored subsurface buoy at the research site each time the instrument was retrieved its data was downloaded processed with ruskin software included with the device and the battery replaced the software derived tidal slope significant wave height significant wave period maximum wave height maximum wave period average wave height average wave period peak period wave energy per area average sea pressure etc a secondary source of wave data was the noaa national data buoy center ndbc station 44098 at jeffrey s ledge new hampshire the station is a wave rider buoy located 40 km east southeast of the unh research area in 76 5 m of water unh owns and operates the buoy while scripps institution of oceanography processes and makes the wave data available the ndbc historical data summaries from station 44098 provided significant wave height peak period and wave direction these correspond well to values observed at the test site as long as the waves are from the east although both sources of wave information were totally valid the ndbc data was chosen for the analysis of random waves heave response in this paper in addition to wave data wind data was available from nearby white island at the isles of shoals where noaa owns and operates the meteorology station iosn3 the station is housed within white island light house and is less than 2 8 km north northeast of the unh research area as seen in fig 5 from the station s historical data and climate summaries wind data was extracted for the months of the barrier s deployment the average wind speed from the anemometer was corrected from 32 2 m to 10 m above sea level an industry standard for all wind averages shown unlike the most common for unh site south east wave direction the typical north west wind of 6 5 m s was registered during the months of deployment the wind data was not implemented in the models presented in this paper however it is available for future research 2 1 4 inspections and observations of the barrier during and after the triton barrier deployment the system was visited by unh and halo teams at the site using two unh vessels the research vessel gulf challenger and the galen j https marine unh edu research centers vessels all of the visits that involved adding instruments downloading data making repairs etc were made on galen j gulf challenger which is a larger vessel was used for the subsurface wave logger retrieval and for visual inspections with the vessel passing close by the barrier as the deployment period ended the barrier was towed in to the unh pier and looked over by unh and halo personnel onshore on june 1 7 2018 fig 7 although triton barrier did not lose structural integrity and its basic hdpe framework was remarkably sound some damage was observed in all four units such as lost pins and fused tabs rotated or cracked transverse members longitudinal pipes and side members swift et al 2019 2 2 physical testing 2 2 1 scaled physical model of the barrier and mooring a scaled physical model of the triton barrier system was used to evaluate its performance in a wave environment the experiments were conducted in the unh 36 6 m long 3 66 m wide 2 44 m deep wave tank as inertia and gravity forces are the most influential factors that the barrier experiences the froude scaling method was chosen for the test chakrabarti 1994 the scaling factor of 1 20 was selected by using the approximate ratio of the depth of the unh offshore research site 52 m and the depth of the wave tank 2 44 m with the scaling factor selected the physical dimensions and weight of the model were calculated to retain geometric similitude the diameter and length of each scaled component was first found then the weight of model components was appropriately scaled and calculated based on their geometry the full scale triton barrier is constructed with hdpe pipes that allow the system to be robust yet compliant to a wave environment an attempt was made to exactly scale the compliance of the pipes in the model many materials were investigated to accomplish the 1 20 froude scaled flexural rigidity as well as the desired weight of each structural component however no appropriate material was discovered since it either gave considerable fabrication issues or just did not exist in the appropriate geometric similitude in addition certain components had some additional requirements unlike the top member the bottom member needed to be hollow to allow ballast to be inserted the main longitudinals had to provide the bulk of the buoyancy therefore the material selected needed to be buoyant hollow pipes were also necessary for the transverse members so an extra weight could be inserted to retain the correct center of gravity thus while the scaling of other physical parameters was precise the stiffness of each model unit was higher than desired however the units were connected by structurally scaled flexural hinges table 1 provides the basic full scale and model scale parameters of the triton barrier the rigorously scaled parameters are presented as desired model scale the actual choice of components is provided as actual model scale at full scale epdm rubber hinges connecting barrier units to each other allowed them to contour to the wave environment and absorb loads applied to the barrier by wave forcing at model scale the rubber tubing that met the scaled flexural rigidity properties was selected however it turned out to be much lighter than the desired scaled weight of the hinge therefore steel washers were attached at connections for the hinges which increased the weight to the desired value fig 8 a the flexural rigidity of the hinge is a proprietary information of halo maritime defense systems so its full scale and model flexural rigidity cannot be provided here in addition to steel washers four steel end plates were attached to both ends of the model allowing mooring lines and a load cell to be installed these plates attached to the barrier model with eye rings provided additional mooring attachment points fig 8b finally the collars connecting full scale horizontal transverse members with the longitudinal pipes were substituted by the cable zip ties as shown in fig 8 the cable tie attachments required presence of holes in transverse members for cables to go through however the members themselves were kept waterproof to not introduce any additional weight and inertia to the system the mooring system was froude scaled for the anchor floats chain dead weight and lines the scaled mooring line was 8 mm monofilament fishing leader while the bridle lines were made of braided fishing line since the scaled buoys needed to provide up to 5 n of buoyancy simple 4 9 n pool floats were chosen for this purpose both scaled chain and clump weight were constructed of zinc plated jack chain see fig 9 the results of froude scaling for the mooring system are summarized in table 2 the embedment anchors were modeled as fixed points 4 5 kg lead weights were used to hold the chain ends stationary on the tank bottom 2 2 2 facility and instruments the scaled model was tested in the unh chase ocean engineering laboratory wave tank under a variety of wave conditions the wave tank is capable of generating waves up to a half meter in height by using a hydraulic wave generator the movable tow carriage that travels the length of the wave tank allowed adjustable motion camera angles and streaming of data from the load cell to the main host computer the unh tank can generate not only single frequency waves but also random waves however most of the conducted tests represented single frequency scenarios before wave testing the futek lsb210 two pound submersible s beam load cell was calibrated in tension with known weights the voltage output was recorded and a linear calibration line calculated it was then entered into the labview software allowing the load from the voltage output to be determined the load cell was end mounted on the model to measure mooring force acting on one of the bridle lines to capture the model s dynamics a gopro hero 3 https gopro com en us shop cameras camera was installed on a pole vertically mounted to the tow carriage the carriage was then moved into place aligning the camera with the target attached to the top of the model in approximately the same location as the data pack that contained the accelerometer at full scale fig 10 to quantify the model s dynamics each video recorded during testing was analyzed using kinovea motion tracking software https www kinovea org the software always tracked the target central point as well as 1 2 additional points on the target or structure to record heave and pitch roll motion of the barrier the black points on the orange target against the white tank background provided enough contrast to allow them to be tracked by the software 2 2 3 mooring configuration of the model the barrier deployment plan included 2224 n full scale of pretension in the mooring bridle line it was decided to scale and implement this pretension 0 28 n model scale by gradually moving away the lead weight until the desired value of tension was achieved as the effect of tension was of interest an additional set of tests with the doubled pretension 4448 n which corresponds to 0 556 n model scale was also performed with the defined pretension the barrier was oriented parallel inline test and perpendicular sideways tests to the wave propagation direction see fig 11 the sideways orientation required the mooring system setup to be altered due to insufficient wave tank width to resolve this issue two smooth vertical directional cylinders were utilized the cylinders made of vertically mounted pvc pipes allowed the scale model and mooring to be installed such that the mooring line was redirected from across the width of the tank to along the length of the tank see fig 11b and c 2 3 numerical simulation 2 3 1 numerical model of the barrier in this study the finite element fe model of the full scale barrier was created in hydro fe software fig 12 hydro fe modernizes the approach previously implemented in the well validated aqua fe program developed at the university of new hampshire gosz et al 1996 tsukrov et al 2000 fredriksson et al 2003 to analyze partially or completely submerged flexible structures in the marine environment the code is written in fortran and uses the commercially available nonlinear finite element solver msc marc with the graphical user interface msc mentat https www mscsoftware com wave environmental conditions in hydro fe are implemented using airy wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 for the triton barrier simulations the finite element solver was prescribed a large strain case implicit dynamic transient operator single step houbolt and lumped mass matrices the total load case time of 500 s with the adaptive time stepping resulted in 15 000 20 000 increments per simulation as the main structural components such as longitudinals hinges side members transverse members upper and lower pipes are not only the major source of drag and inertia forces but also important in providing structural rigidity these components were modeled with 2 node three dimensional beam elements to account for bending moments and torque at the same time mooring chain bridle and mooring lines were modeled with 2 node three dimensional truss elements to preserve their compliance basic material and geometrical properties of the finite elements are given in table 3 note that most of the finite element parameters correspond to the actual properties of the barrier however some of them were recalculated based on reasonable simplifications as follows the weight of small components that cannot be properly modeled tabs bolts impact net etc was uniformly distributed along the longitudinals side and transverse members hinges upper and lower pipes the weight of the ballast chain was added to the weight of lower pipes material density of floats was averaged across the whole floats volume whereas their young s modulus and poisson s ratio were selected as generic plastic values since they do not significantly influence the overall barrier response the diameter of the mooring chain elements was calculated to keep the chain density and overall weight unchanged 2 3 2 morison s equation in order to calculate force exerted by waves on structural components the morison s equation approach morison et al 1950 expanded to the case of a moving cylinder goodman and breslin 1976 was used in this study according to this approach there are two vectors associated with each differential section d l of the submerged cylindrical body of outside diameter d o arbitrarily moving in the water the local fluid velocity vector u and the body velocity vector v both of these vectors can be projected on normal perpendicular to the cylinder axis and tangential parallel to the cylinder axis directions then the normal projection of the force exerted on a differential section d l is 1 d f n ρ w u n t d v c a ρ w u n t v n t d v 1 2 c d ρ w u n v n u n v n d a where u n and v n are the normal projections of fluid and body velocities associated with section d l c a is the added mass coefficient c d is the normal drag coefficient d v 1 4 π d o 2 d l is the differential volume of section d l and d a d o d l is the differential normal projected area of section d l the tangential component of the drag force is taken in the form 2 d f t π 2 c t ρ w u t v t u t v t d a where c t is the tangential drag coefficient u t and v t are the tangential projections of fluid and body velocities associated with section d l in this numerical study all of the barrier components were assumed to be smooth cylinders and assigned normal drag coefficient tangential drag coefficient and added mass coefficient of c d 1 2 c t 0 01 c a 1 respectively the morison s equation formulation assumes that the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structural components are proportional to their relative velocities and accelerations with respect to surrounding fluid particles however it does not contain any direct way to include interference shadowing vortex shedding and other fluid flow effects that usually occur in the marine environment in the morison s equation based numerical models of offshore aquaculture installations subjected to currents and waves these effects are usually included through empirically evaluated shadowing coefficients varying from 0 64 to 0 87 applied to the downstream structural components see for example huang et al 2006 moe føre et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 the truss structure considered in this paper doesn t contain high solidity net panels and is subjected to waves only no current so the overall effect from fluid flow disturbances is expected to be much smaller thus shadowing coefficients in the numerical models were not introduced 2 3 3 response amplitude operator the barrier motion and mooring line tensions resulting from single frequency wave forcing were characterized by response amplitude operators raos common in the field of floating structures design the heave rao represented relative vertical motion of the barrier and was defined as 3 r a o h a m a w where a m is the amplitude of barrier vertical motion and a w is the wave amplitude or half of the wave height pitch and roll raos represented angular motion of the system and were defined as 4 r a o θ a θ a w where a θ is the corresponding barrier s angular motion amplitude in radians in order to analyze force factors in the system force rao for bridle line tension was calculated as follows 5 r a o f a f a w where a f is the amplitude of bridle line tensions it should be noted that during the processing of the load cell data large spikes in tensions were registered at individual points in time if the values of force in these points were more than three times the standard deviation they were simply excluded from the data set the load cell data was than filtered with simple moving average sma technique brown and mac berthouex 2002 to investigate the barrier heave response to a random wave forcing and to make use of field data the random waves heave response amplitude operator r a o h r were utilized sethuraman and venugopal 2013 6 r a o h r f e f b f where f is the frequency in hertz e f is the energy density spectrum of the barrier heave motion or response spectrum b f is the bretschneider or incident wave spectrum the bretschneider wave spectrum was calculated as follows 7 b f 5 16 h 1 3 2 f m f m f 5 e 5 4 f m f 4 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height f m is the modal most probable frequency of any given wave in hertz 3 results and discussion 3 1 free release tests of the scaled physical model pitch roll and heave free release tests were conducted to determine the natural frequencies of the response modes observed during wave excitations the units of the barrier were lifted until their main longitudinal pipes were just above water level and then released as schematically illustrated in fig 13 the target affixed to the top of the first unit was used to track the motion resulting from the free release tests the natural frequencies determined by these tests were used to confirm the choice of parameters in numerical model and obtain an insight into which wave forcing frequencies might excite that particular model response table 4 contains natural frequencies observed in both physical tests rescaled to full scale values and numerical simulations the numerical prediction for pitch natural frequency is 16 higher than in the physical test there are three possible reasons for such a discrepancy 1 approximations used for scaling rigidity in physical models table 1 2 utilization of the averaged mass distributions in numerical models of longitudinal pipes table 3 and 3 loss of energy due to radiated waves generated during the manual releases we attribute this discrepancy to the radiated waves energy loss since there is no mechanism in numerical model that takes it into account which results in higher numerical pitch natural frequency roll and hobby horse release tests demonstrated good correspondence between physical testing and numerical predictions 3 2 single frequency wave testing physical experiment and numerical simulations both physical and numerical single frequency wave tests were conducted for two model orientations inline and sideways and two values of bridle line pretensions 2224 n and 4448 n seven wave frequencies and three different wave heights were investigated however high frequency large waves could not be achieved due to the wave tank physical limitations a full list of waves successfully produced by the tank and recalculated to full scale is presented in table 5 wave frequencies chosen for the single frequency tests are in the range from 0 1 hz to 0 3 hz which spans the range for which there is sufficient wave energy to excite a response from the barrier as the effect of mooring line pretension did not significantly influence neither heave pitch roll nor force raos the results for 4448 n bridle line pretension are not presented in this paper the comparison between heave pitch roll and force raos obtained from physical tests and numerical simulations is shown in figs 14 16 it can be seen in fig 14 that all numerical inline heave results demonstrated similar behavior rao remains around 1 for the lowest wave frequencies wave length is 11 times longer than barrier unit length with the slight increase at about 0 18 hz and significant decline at 0 22 hz and 0 30 hz wave length is about 2 and 1 barrier unit lengths respectively physical testing results follow the same trend with the exception of the high frequency rao value for the 2 m wave for the sideways model orientation the observed heave raos are mostly in the range of 0 95 1 05 however three data points with high values of rao can be seen for tank tests at the low wave frequencies for 2 m and 3 m waves subsequent investigation of the test records conducted after the tests were completed showed that the issue was caused by the shift in camera placement as the barrier clearly contoured waves with the rao around 1 it was decided to include the initial tests results in the figure for consistency pitch and roll raos showed good agreement between physical and numerical values for both inline and sideways model orientations fig 15 the inline pitch raos reach their peak of about 0 10 0 13 rad m and then decay as wave length approaches 1 2 barrier unit lengths the pitch rao peaks however are not due to a match of driving frequency to natural frequency since the pitch natural frequency is at least double the frequencies at the pitch rao peaks note that pitch raos reach their maximum for 1 m and 2 m waves at different frequencies we explain this by the increase in the steepness of the wave slope with the increase of wave height resulting in the change of the rao peak position the sideways roll results follow the pattern of gradual increase in raos with wave frequency the highest inclination angle amplitude registered among all inline tests is 8 5 whereas for sideways tests it is less than 15 5 table 6 heave rao results show that the barrier behaves as a wave follower with two exceptions of 1 m and 2 m inline waves at the highest frequencies where heave rao drops down excluding one physical test at these wave frequencies and heights barrier does not fully contour water surface and faces upcoming waves earlier thus reducing heave and pitch amplitudes fig 15 at the same time roll rao consistently grows with wave frequency regardless of incident wave height we attribute this to the wave slope increase with wave frequency while the barrier width being much smaller than wave lengths such behavior can result in a somewhat excessive inclination of the structure table 6 but does not influence its stability in all of the performed tests none have resulted in the barrier s flip or impact with an upcoming wave all abovementioned considerations are supported by observations in the numerical and physical tests fig 16 presents force raos obtained from numerical modeling and tank testing both numerical and physical test raos for the inline model orientation demonstrated a tendency to rise with increase of wave frequency and had a visible plateau from 0 13 hz to 0 15 hz the major discrepancy is observed for 1 m waves where numerically predicted raos are higher than those from physical tests in the case of sideways orientation good correspondence between numerical models and physical tests is observed with the exception of 0 30 hz 1 m wave the force rao show a pronounced sensitivity to the wave loading frequency rao consistently trends upwards with the increase in the wave frequency we attribute it to the minor mooring line jerking that still occurs due to increasing wave slope and rapid change in the barrier elevation as a result it is worth noting that the increased rao at high frequencies is also partially attributed to the deteriorating quality of the measurement signal increasing signal to noise ratio even though mooring chain provided reasonable damping to the mooring line the jerking effect could not be fully eliminated because the chain itself must be heavy enough to secure barrier s position the maximum tensions of bridle and mooring lines observed in physical and numerical testing were 42 and 35 times lower than their breaking strength respectively as the mooring was intentionally overdesigned in this test field deployment 3 3 random waves testing field study and numerical simulation in the field study both the heave response energy density and the wave forcing bretschneider spectra were obtained for a representative offshore data set recorded from 3 36 a m to 4 00 a m on april 5 2018 the ndbc station at jeffrey s ledge provided values of the significant wave height 2 04 m and the modal wave frequency 0 13 hz needed to calculate the bretschneider wave spectrum as the energy density spectrum required vertical motion of the barrier as a function of time the corresponding vertical acceleration data was double integrated over time the same approach in terms of the energy density spectrum was used for the random waves numerical simulation however the bretschneider wave spectrum considered in the field study was discretized and implemented in hydro fe as a superposition of 22 single frequency waves in the frequency range from 0 10 hz to 0 30 hz a comparison between incident random waves spectrum and response spectra from filed study and numerical simulation is shown in fig 17 note that the barrier was assumed to be oriented inline with the bridle line pretension of 2224 n the correspondence between barrier response spectra is good indicating that hydro fe captures the essential physics of wave barrier interaction under random waves conditions in the field a significant dampening is observed which is attributed to the mooring system configuration interaction effects of line pretension shallow angle of the anchor lines and large reserve of dead weight chain portion of the mooring the numerical simulations and inspections of the barrier conducted during and after deployment were used to compare its performance with the design requirements the data showed that 1 the designed hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stability of the barrier was proven to be adequate 2 the design choice of reducing compliance variations between the structural components pipe versus hinges was proven to be well balanced and performed within the operational bounds 3 the chosen level of barrier pretension provided a good balance between minimizing the barrier surface movement watch circle and alleviating end effects snapping and oversubmerging 4 the designed ratio of buoyancy and ballast delivered a good balance of wave following and dampening overall system was designed for 10 m significant wave height with the period of 12 s and has demonstrated robust performance in the operational and storm field conditions 4 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive approach to predicting and evaluating the seaworthiness of floating protective barriers and their mooring systems for deployment in high energy offshore environments good correspondence between the froude scaled physical models numerical simulation results and field test data has been observed numerical models built in the hydro fe finite element analysis software demonstrated their ability to reproduce most of the results observed in physical testing with the exception of three outlier data points and full scale field data based on the modeling effort it is recommended that mechanical and inertial contribution of small structural components of the barriers is included in the larger structural elements by assigning equivalent effective values to their density geometric parameters and stiffness successful utilization of the scaled physical models included selection of some approximate values for diameter and weight of several components due to unavailability of exactly scaled parts the biggest challenge was implementation of the mooring system in the case of sideways tests when the direction of wave propagation was perpendicular to the barrier and the width of the tank prevented exact modeling this challenge was overcome by a specially built mooring arrangement utilizing smooth vertical directional cylinders to redirect the mooring bridle along the length of the tank field tests demonstrated seaworthiness and robustness of the triton floating barrier developed by halo maritime defense systems and provided an abundant data to develop the best deployment and inspection practices and to evaluate performance of individual barrier components and overall system stability the studies allowed successful validating of the numerical model and engineering approach using physical model and field data the approach was proven to provide a good predictive capability for designing

keywords floating barriers wave response finite element analysis physical testing field deployment 1 introduction floating protective barriers can be used to protect naval bases offshore platforms ports nuclear power facilities bridges dams refineries and desalination plants and other assets from terrorist attacks in different marine environments they prevent attacks by a simple boat loaded with explosives which is one of the most popular and dangerous types of the attack due to its relative cheapness and technical simplicity hill 2009 fig 1 illustrates consequences of a small suicide boat attack on m v limburg a french flagged vlcc supertanker off of the port of ash shihr southeast of sana a yemen in october 2002 greenberg et al 2006 the explosion lead to loss of several crewmembers and a spill of over 50 000 barrels of oil carafano 2007 another well known example is that of suicide terrorists exploding a motorboat alongside the uss cole a navy destroyer as it was refueling in the yemen port of aden on october 12 2000 perl and o rourke 2001 the blast ripped a 10 m wide hole near the waterline of the cole killing 17 american sailors and injuring many more in order to effectively prevent such catastrophes the performance of floating protective barriers of different designs are usually investigated through field studies decew and rowell 2013 kalinski et al 2014 although most of the studies have been focused on actual waterborne craft impact testing and corresponding design optimizations which are then proved by u s navy and other military or civilian customers nixon et al 2004 2005 bishop 2013 osienski et al 2017 some numerical investigations have also been conducted since large scale tests are quite expensive and labor intensive for instance a series of full scale finite element simulations and the corresponding real impact tests of foxx barriers were performed by polish naval academy kiciński et al 2019 to the best of the authors knowledge there are no other publicly available publications related to either physical or numerical testing of floating protective barriers in offshore deployments in addition to impact protection the floating barriers and their mooring systems have to be able to withstand high energy environmental loading conditions without experiencing significant damage or even failure the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive approach to the prediction and evaluation of floating barrier offshore performance using the example of a triton floating barrier manufactured by halo maritime defense systems usa fig 2 the approach includes a combination of full scale field studies scaled physical testing and numerical modeling the four month long field deployment of the barrier continued from january to may 2018 near the isles of shoals new hampshire usa and covered a period of the winter storms fig 3 the scaled physical testing 1 20 was conducted in the university of new hampshire unh wave tow tank utilizing techniques previously developed and validated for various offshore aquaculture installations fredriksson et al 2000 decew et al 2005 wang et al 2015 the numerical modeling was performed with the finite element analysis software hydro fe based on the well validated aqua fe program developed at unh gosz et al 1996 tsukrov et al 2000 2003 fredriksson et al 2003 and extensively applied in the marine aquaculture field decew et al 2010 wang et al 2015 knysh et al 2020 the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 1 is dedicated to the field study organization description of the research site and data acquisition manufacturing of the scaled triton barrier and its mooring as well as a description of the experimental facilities and instruments are presented in section 2 2 section 2 3 covers development of the numerical model and its basic parameters the comparisons between single frequency wave results obtained in physical tests and numerical simulations are given in section 3 the section also includes comparison between barrier responses to random waves the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 methods 2 1 field study 2 1 1 description of the barrier system the investigated triton barrier system consists of four 15 m units each unit is 6 m high 3 3 m wide and stands approximately 3 m off the water the units are joined together by dual ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber hinges allowing the segments to contour waves and absorb the loading due to the high energy marine environment fig 4 a schematics of each unit can be seen in fig 4b which depicts the first unit with the mooring line attachment at the left end units consist of two longitudinal pipes connected to transverse and side members with upper and lower pipes all made of high density polyethylene hdpe most of the side and transverse members are attached to the longitudinal upper and lower pipes by butt fusing tees which are held in place by pins and tabs attachment methods also include hangers strapped around the pipe and eyes through bolted to the pipe the stainless steel impact netting is suspended from the upper pipe and attached to the transverse members the first unit of the barrier deployed in the field study also included an instrument box with accelerometer and data pack powered by a solar panel the instrument box is attached to the upper pipe that is supported by side members the longitudinal pipes of neighboring units are connected by hinges at the waterline and additionally secured by limiter cables that ensure structural integrity even if hinge is damaged longitudinal pipes contain closed cell foam flotation whereas the lower pipe is filled with heavy chain ballast providing increased stability the impact netting of each unit is connected to each other by the net joint and placed between the longitudinal and upper pipes so it is present along the whole barrier more information on geometric and mechanical properties of the barrier s components is presented in sections 2 2 and 2 3 2 1 2 offshore deployment site and mooring setup the four unit barrier was deployed at the 52 m deep unh research site located 2 8 km south southwest from white island isles of shoals new hampshire usa see fig 5 it was oriented north south the deployment continued from january to may 2018 to cover the period of the winter for which northeast storms typical of the north atlantic were present an average tidal range seen at gosport harbor at the isle of shoals from the national ocean service tide charts is 2 6 m with the tidal current at the unh research site of roughly 10 cm s the barrier s mooring system was designed based on the seafloor and environmental features of the unh site its schematics is shown in fig 6 there are two 15 m short fiber bridles connecting the barrier to surface buoys of 40 kn buoyancy two 105 m long fiber lines hang from the buoys and are attached to 2800 kg stud link chain which provides damping and prevents excessive mooring line jerking the chain is fixed by a 2000 kg dead weight and secured by drag embedment anchor at its end more information on geometric and mechanical properties of the mooring components is presented in section 2 2 2 1 3 field data acquisition the triton system was equipped with four globalstar smartone c small onboard global positioning system gps tracking devices one on each of the four units these gps devices allowed for the position of the barrier while deployed to be monitored from shore as each triton unit was equipped with a device in the event of a separation or mooring failure each unit could be tracked individually the barrier s motion during the entire deployment including deployment and retrieval as well as the barrier s movement during its time at the research site were tracked and did not cross expected boundaries to measure the gravitational and dynamic accelerations experienced by the barrier a specifically designed system consisting of a 9 axis accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer was utilized the system was powered by arduino atmega328p microcontroller processor and attached to the upper pipe of the first barrier unit in order to determine the barrier s heave response to wave forcing vertical acceleration data was logged hourly in individual files and then analyzed the wave environment of the unh offshore site was characterized using a subsurface wave logger made by rbr this dual channel temperature and depth tide and wave logger device was attached below a taut moored subsurface buoy at the research site each time the instrument was retrieved its data was downloaded processed with ruskin software included with the device and the battery replaced the software derived tidal slope significant wave height significant wave period maximum wave height maximum wave period average wave height average wave period peak period wave energy per area average sea pressure etc a secondary source of wave data was the noaa national data buoy center ndbc station 44098 at jeffrey s ledge new hampshire the station is a wave rider buoy located 40 km east southeast of the unh research area in 76 5 m of water unh owns and operates the buoy while scripps institution of oceanography processes and makes the wave data available the ndbc historical data summaries from station 44098 provided significant wave height peak period and wave direction these correspond well to values observed at the test site as long as the waves are from the east although both sources of wave information were totally valid the ndbc data was chosen for the analysis of random waves heave response in this paper in addition to wave data wind data was available from nearby white island at the isles of shoals where noaa owns and operates the meteorology station iosn3 the station is housed within white island light house and is less than 2 8 km north northeast of the unh research area as seen in fig 5 from the station s historical data and climate summaries wind data was extracted for the months of the barrier s deployment the average wind speed from the anemometer was corrected from 32 2 m to 10 m above sea level an industry standard for all wind averages shown unlike the most common for unh site south east wave direction the typical north west wind of 6 5 m s was registered during the months of deployment the wind data was not implemented in the models presented in this paper however it is available for future research 2 1 4 inspections and observations of the barrier during and after the triton barrier deployment the system was visited by unh and halo teams at the site using two unh vessels the research vessel gulf challenger and the galen j https marine unh edu research centers vessels all of the visits that involved adding instruments downloading data making repairs etc were made on galen j gulf challenger which is a larger vessel was used for the subsurface wave logger retrieval and for visual inspections with the vessel passing close by the barrier as the deployment period ended the barrier was towed in to the unh pier and looked over by unh and halo personnel onshore on june 1 7 2018 fig 7 although triton barrier did not lose structural integrity and its basic hdpe framework was remarkably sound some damage was observed in all four units such as lost pins and fused tabs rotated or cracked transverse members longitudinal pipes and side members swift et al 2019 2 2 physical testing 2 2 1 scaled physical model of the barrier and mooring a scaled physical model of the triton barrier system was used to evaluate its performance in a wave environment the experiments were conducted in the unh 36 6 m long 3 66 m wide 2 44 m deep wave tank as inertia and gravity forces are the most influential factors that the barrier experiences the froude scaling method was chosen for the test chakrabarti 1994 the scaling factor of 1 20 was selected by using the approximate ratio of the depth of the unh offshore research site 52 m and the depth of the wave tank 2 44 m with the scaling factor selected the physical dimensions and weight of the model were calculated to retain geometric similitude the diameter and length of each scaled component was first found then the weight of model components was appropriately scaled and calculated based on their geometry the full scale triton barrier is constructed with hdpe pipes that allow the system to be robust yet compliant to a wave environment an attempt was made to exactly scale the compliance of the pipes in the model many materials were investigated to accomplish the 1 20 froude scaled flexural rigidity as well as the desired weight of each structural component however no appropriate material was discovered since it either gave considerable fabrication issues or just did not exist in the appropriate geometric similitude in addition certain components had some additional requirements unlike the top member the bottom member needed to be hollow to allow ballast to be inserted the main longitudinals had to provide the bulk of the buoyancy therefore the material selected needed to be buoyant hollow pipes were also necessary for the transverse members so an extra weight could be inserted to retain the correct center of gravity thus while the scaling of other physical parameters was precise the stiffness of each model unit was higher than desired however the units were connected by structurally scaled flexural hinges table 1 provides the basic full scale and model scale parameters of the triton barrier the rigorously scaled parameters are presented as desired model scale the actual choice of components is provided as actual model scale at full scale epdm rubber hinges connecting barrier units to each other allowed them to contour to the wave environment and absorb loads applied to the barrier by wave forcing at model scale the rubber tubing that met the scaled flexural rigidity properties was selected however it turned out to be much lighter than the desired scaled weight of the hinge therefore steel washers were attached at connections for the hinges which increased the weight to the desired value fig 8 a the flexural rigidity of the hinge is a proprietary information of halo maritime defense systems so its full scale and model flexural rigidity cannot be provided here in addition to steel washers four steel end plates were attached to both ends of the model allowing mooring lines and a load cell to be installed these plates attached to the barrier model with eye rings provided additional mooring attachment points fig 8b finally the collars connecting full scale horizontal transverse members with the longitudinal pipes were substituted by the cable zip ties as shown in fig 8 the cable tie attachments required presence of holes in transverse members for cables to go through however the members themselves were kept waterproof to not introduce any additional weight and inertia to the system the mooring system was froude scaled for the anchor floats chain dead weight and lines the scaled mooring line was 8 mm monofilament fishing leader while the bridle lines were made of braided fishing line since the scaled buoys needed to provide up to 5 n of buoyancy simple 4 9 n pool floats were chosen for this purpose both scaled chain and clump weight were constructed of zinc plated jack chain see fig 9 the results of froude scaling for the mooring system are summarized in table 2 the embedment anchors were modeled as fixed points 4 5 kg lead weights were used to hold the chain ends stationary on the tank bottom 2 2 2 facility and instruments the scaled model was tested in the unh chase ocean engineering laboratory wave tank under a variety of wave conditions the wave tank is capable of generating waves up to a half meter in height by using a hydraulic wave generator the movable tow carriage that travels the length of the wave tank allowed adjustable motion camera angles and streaming of data from the load cell to the main host computer the unh tank can generate not only single frequency waves but also random waves however most of the conducted tests represented single frequency scenarios before wave testing the futek lsb210 two pound submersible s beam load cell was calibrated in tension with known weights the voltage output was recorded and a linear calibration line calculated it was then entered into the labview software allowing the load from the voltage output to be determined the load cell was end mounted on the model to measure mooring force acting on one of the bridle lines to capture the model s dynamics a gopro hero 3 https gopro com en us shop cameras camera was installed on a pole vertically mounted to the tow carriage the carriage was then moved into place aligning the camera with the target attached to the top of the model in approximately the same location as the data pack that contained the accelerometer at full scale fig 10 to quantify the model s dynamics each video recorded during testing was analyzed using kinovea motion tracking software https www kinovea org the software always tracked the target central point as well as 1 2 additional points on the target or structure to record heave and pitch roll motion of the barrier the black points on the orange target against the white tank background provided enough contrast to allow them to be tracked by the software 2 2 3 mooring configuration of the model the barrier deployment plan included 2224 n full scale of pretension in the mooring bridle line it was decided to scale and implement this pretension 0 28 n model scale by gradually moving away the lead weight until the desired value of tension was achieved as the effect of tension was of interest an additional set of tests with the doubled pretension 4448 n which corresponds to 0 556 n model scale was also performed with the defined pretension the barrier was oriented parallel inline test and perpendicular sideways tests to the wave propagation direction see fig 11 the sideways orientation required the mooring system setup to be altered due to insufficient wave tank width to resolve this issue two smooth vertical directional cylinders were utilized the cylinders made of vertically mounted pvc pipes allowed the scale model and mooring to be installed such that the mooring line was redirected from across the width of the tank to along the length of the tank see fig 11b and c 2 3 numerical simulation 2 3 1 numerical model of the barrier in this study the finite element fe model of the full scale barrier was created in hydro fe software fig 12 hydro fe modernizes the approach previously implemented in the well validated aqua fe program developed at the university of new hampshire gosz et al 1996 tsukrov et al 2000 fredriksson et al 2003 to analyze partially or completely submerged flexible structures in the marine environment the code is written in fortran and uses the commercially available nonlinear finite element solver msc marc with the graphical user interface msc mentat https www mscsoftware com wave environmental conditions in hydro fe are implemented using airy wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 for the triton barrier simulations the finite element solver was prescribed a large strain case implicit dynamic transient operator single step houbolt and lumped mass matrices the total load case time of 500 s with the adaptive time stepping resulted in 15 000 20 000 increments per simulation as the main structural components such as longitudinals hinges side members transverse members upper and lower pipes are not only the major source of drag and inertia forces but also important in providing structural rigidity these components were modeled with 2 node three dimensional beam elements to account for bending moments and torque at the same time mooring chain bridle and mooring lines were modeled with 2 node three dimensional truss elements to preserve their compliance basic material and geometrical properties of the finite elements are given in table 3 note that most of the finite element parameters correspond to the actual properties of the barrier however some of them were recalculated based on reasonable simplifications as follows the weight of small components that cannot be properly modeled tabs bolts impact net etc was uniformly distributed along the longitudinals side and transverse members hinges upper and lower pipes the weight of the ballast chain was added to the weight of lower pipes material density of floats was averaged across the whole floats volume whereas their young s modulus and poisson s ratio were selected as generic plastic values since they do not significantly influence the overall barrier response the diameter of the mooring chain elements was calculated to keep the chain density and overall weight unchanged 2 3 2 morison s equation in order to calculate force exerted by waves on structural components the morison s equation approach morison et al 1950 expanded to the case of a moving cylinder goodman and breslin 1976 was used in this study according to this approach there are two vectors associated with each differential section d l of the submerged cylindrical body of outside diameter d o arbitrarily moving in the water the local fluid velocity vector u and the body velocity vector v both of these vectors can be projected on normal perpendicular to the cylinder axis and tangential parallel to the cylinder axis directions then the normal projection of the force exerted on a differential section d l is 1 d f n ρ w u n t d v c a ρ w u n t v n t d v 1 2 c d ρ w u n v n u n v n d a where u n and v n are the normal projections of fluid and body velocities associated with section d l c a is the added mass coefficient c d is the normal drag coefficient d v 1 4 π d o 2 d l is the differential volume of section d l and d a d o d l is the differential normal projected area of section d l the tangential component of the drag force is taken in the form 2 d f t π 2 c t ρ w u t v t u t v t d a where c t is the tangential drag coefficient u t and v t are the tangential projections of fluid and body velocities associated with section d l in this numerical study all of the barrier components were assumed to be smooth cylinders and assigned normal drag coefficient tangential drag coefficient and added mass coefficient of c d 1 2 c t 0 01 c a 1 respectively the morison s equation formulation assumes that the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structural components are proportional to their relative velocities and accelerations with respect to surrounding fluid particles however it does not contain any direct way to include interference shadowing vortex shedding and other fluid flow effects that usually occur in the marine environment in the morison s equation based numerical models of offshore aquaculture installations subjected to currents and waves these effects are usually included through empirically evaluated shadowing coefficients varying from 0 64 to 0 87 applied to the downstream structural components see for example huang et al 2006 moe føre et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 the truss structure considered in this paper doesn t contain high solidity net panels and is subjected to waves only no current so the overall effect from fluid flow disturbances is expected to be much smaller thus shadowing coefficients in the numerical models were not introduced 2 3 3 response amplitude operator the barrier motion and mooring line tensions resulting from single frequency wave forcing were characterized by response amplitude operators raos common in the field of floating structures design the heave rao represented relative vertical motion of the barrier and was defined as 3 r a o h a m a w where a m is the amplitude of barrier vertical motion and a w is the wave amplitude or half of the wave height pitch and roll raos represented angular motion of the system and were defined as 4 r a o θ a θ a w where a θ is the corresponding barrier s angular motion amplitude in radians in order to analyze force factors in the system force rao for bridle line tension was calculated as follows 5 r a o f a f a w where a f is the amplitude of bridle line tensions it should be noted that during the processing of the load cell data large spikes in tensions were registered at individual points in time if the values of force in these points were more than three times the standard deviation they were simply excluded from the data set the load cell data was than filtered with simple moving average sma technique brown and mac berthouex 2002 to investigate the barrier heave response to a random wave forcing and to make use of field data the random waves heave response amplitude operator r a o h r were utilized sethuraman and venugopal 2013 6 r a o h r f e f b f where f is the frequency in hertz e f is the energy density spectrum of the barrier heave motion or response spectrum b f is the bretschneider or incident wave spectrum the bretschneider wave spectrum was calculated as follows 7 b f 5 16 h 1 3 2 f m f m f 5 e 5 4 f m f 4 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height f m is the modal most probable frequency of any given wave in hertz 3 results and discussion 3 1 free release tests of the scaled physical model pitch roll and heave free release tests were conducted to determine the natural frequencies of the response modes observed during wave excitations the units of the barrier were lifted until their main longitudinal pipes were just above water level and then released as schematically illustrated in fig 13 the target affixed to the top of the first unit was used to track the motion resulting from the free release tests the natural frequencies determined by these tests were used to confirm the choice of parameters in numerical model and obtain an insight into which wave forcing frequencies might excite that particular model response table 4 contains natural frequencies observed in both physical tests rescaled to full scale values and numerical simulations the numerical prediction for pitch natural frequency is 16 higher than in the physical test there are three possible reasons for such a discrepancy 1 approximations used for scaling rigidity in physical models table 1 2 utilization of the averaged mass distributions in numerical models of longitudinal pipes table 3 and 3 loss of energy due to radiated waves generated during the manual releases we attribute this discrepancy to the radiated waves energy loss since there is no mechanism in numerical model that takes it into account which results in higher numerical pitch natural frequency roll and hobby horse release tests demonstrated good correspondence between physical testing and numerical predictions 3 2 single frequency wave testing physical experiment and numerical simulations both physical and numerical single frequency wave tests were conducted for two model orientations inline and sideways and two values of bridle line pretensions 2224 n and 4448 n seven wave frequencies and three different wave heights were investigated however high frequency large waves could not be achieved due to the wave tank physical limitations a full list of waves successfully produced by the tank and recalculated to full scale is presented in table 5 wave frequencies chosen for the single frequency tests are in the range from 0 1 hz to 0 3 hz which spans the range for which there is sufficient wave energy to excite a response from the barrier as the effect of mooring line pretension did not significantly influence neither heave pitch roll nor force raos the results for 4448 n bridle line pretension are not presented in this paper the comparison between heave pitch roll and force raos obtained from physical tests and numerical simulations is shown in figs 14 16 it can be seen in fig 14 that all numerical inline heave results demonstrated similar behavior rao remains around 1 for the lowest wave frequencies wave length is 11 times longer than barrier unit length with the slight increase at about 0 18 hz and significant decline at 0 22 hz and 0 30 hz wave length is about 2 and 1 barrier unit lengths respectively physical testing results follow the same trend with the exception of the high frequency rao value for the 2 m wave for the sideways model orientation the observed heave raos are mostly in the range of 0 95 1 05 however three data points with high values of rao can be seen for tank tests at the low wave frequencies for 2 m and 3 m waves subsequent investigation of the test records conducted after the tests were completed showed that the issue was caused by the shift in camera placement as the barrier clearly contoured waves with the rao around 1 it was decided to include the initial tests results in the figure for consistency pitch and roll raos showed good agreement between physical and numerical values for both inline and sideways model orientations fig 15 the inline pitch raos reach their peak of about 0 10 0 13 rad m and then decay as wave length approaches 1 2 barrier unit lengths the pitch rao peaks however are not due to a match of driving frequency to natural frequency since the pitch natural frequency is at least double the frequencies at the pitch rao peaks note that pitch raos reach their maximum for 1 m and 2 m waves at different frequencies we explain this by the increase in the steepness of the wave slope with the increase of wave height resulting in the change of the rao peak position the sideways roll results follow the pattern of gradual increase in raos with wave frequency the highest inclination angle amplitude registered among all inline tests is 8 5 whereas for sideways tests it is less than 15 5 table 6 heave rao results show that the barrier behaves as a wave follower with two exceptions of 1 m and 2 m inline waves at the highest frequencies where heave rao drops down excluding one physical test at these wave frequencies and heights barrier does not fully contour water surface and faces upcoming waves earlier thus reducing heave and pitch amplitudes fig 15 at the same time roll rao consistently grows with wave frequency regardless of incident wave height we attribute this to the wave slope increase with wave frequency while the barrier width being much smaller than wave lengths such behavior can result in a somewhat excessive inclination of the structure table 6 but does not influence its stability in all of the performed tests none have resulted in the barrier s flip or impact with an upcoming wave all abovementioned considerations are supported by observations in the numerical and physical tests fig 16 presents force raos obtained from numerical modeling and tank testing both numerical and physical test raos for the inline model orientation demonstrated a tendency to rise with increase of wave frequency and had a visible plateau from 0 13 hz to 0 15 hz the major discrepancy is observed for 1 m waves where numerically predicted raos are higher than those from physical tests in the case of sideways orientation good correspondence between numerical models and physical tests is observed with the exception of 0 30 hz 1 m wave the force rao show a pronounced sensitivity to the wave loading frequency rao consistently trends upwards with the increase in the wave frequency we attribute it to the minor mooring line jerking that still occurs due to increasing wave slope and rapid change in the barrier elevation as a result it is worth noting that the increased rao at high frequencies is also partially attributed to the deteriorating quality of the measurement signal increasing signal to noise ratio even though mooring chain provided reasonable damping to the mooring line the jerking effect could not be fully eliminated because the chain itself must be heavy enough to secure barrier s position the maximum tensions of bridle and mooring lines observed in physical and numerical testing were 42 and 35 times lower than their breaking strength respectively as the mooring was intentionally overdesigned in this test field deployment 3 3 random waves testing field study and numerical simulation in the field study both the heave response energy density and the wave forcing bretschneider spectra were obtained for a representative offshore data set recorded from 3 36 a m to 4 00 a m on april 5 2018 the ndbc station at jeffrey s ledge provided values of the significant wave height 2 04 m and the modal wave frequency 0 13 hz needed to calculate the bretschneider wave spectrum as the energy density spectrum required vertical motion of the barrier as a function of time the corresponding vertical acceleration data was double integrated over time the same approach in terms of the energy density spectrum was used for the random waves numerical simulation however the bretschneider wave spectrum considered in the field study was discretized and implemented in hydro fe as a superposition of 22 single frequency waves in the frequency range from 0 10 hz to 0 30 hz a comparison between incident random waves spectrum and response spectra from filed study and numerical simulation is shown in fig 17 note that the barrier was assumed to be oriented inline with the bridle line pretension of 2224 n the correspondence between barrier response spectra is good indicating that hydro fe captures the essential physics of wave barrier interaction under random waves conditions in the field a significant dampening is observed which is attributed to the mooring system configuration interaction effects of line pretension shallow angle of the anchor lines and large reserve of dead weight chain portion of the mooring the numerical simulations and inspections of the barrier conducted during and after deployment were used to compare its performance with the design requirements the data showed that 1 the designed hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stability of the barrier was proven to be adequate 2 the design choice of reducing compliance variations between the structural components pipe versus hinges was proven to be well balanced and performed within the operational bounds 3 the chosen level of barrier pretension provided a good balance between minimizing the barrier surface movement watch circle and alleviating end effects snapping and oversubmerging 4 the designed ratio of buoyancy and ballast delivered a good balance of wave following and dampening overall system was designed for 10 m significant wave height with the period of 12 s and has demonstrated robust performance in the operational and storm field conditions 4 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive approach to predicting and evaluating the seaworthiness of floating protective barriers and their mooring systems for deployment in high energy offshore environments good correspondence between the froude scaled physical models numerical simulation results and field test data has been observed numerical models built in the hydro fe finite element analysis software demonstrated their ability to reproduce most of the results observed in physical testing with the exception of three outlier data points and full scale field data based on the modeling effort it is recommended that mechanical and inertial contribution of small structural components of the barriers is included in the larger structural elements by assigning equivalent effective values to their density geometric parameters and stiffness successful utilization of the scaled physical models included selection of some approximate values for diameter and weight of several components due to unavailability of exactly scaled parts the biggest challenge was implementation of the mooring system in the case of sideways tests when the direction of wave propagation was perpendicular to the barrier and the width of the tank prevented exact modeling this challenge was overcome by a specially built mooring arrangement utilizing smooth vertical directional cylinders to redirect the mooring bridle along the length of the tank field tests demonstrated seaworthiness and robustness of the triton floating barrier developed by halo maritime defense systems and provided an abundant data to develop the best deployment and inspection practices and to evaluate performance of individual barrier components and overall system stability the studies allowed successful validating of the numerical model and engineering approach using physical model and field data the approach was proven to provide a good predictive capability for designing

20893,mutriku is a wave farm on the spanish coast of the bay of biscay that has now been continuously supplying electricity for more than nine years since 1979 there has been a growing trend in wave energy flux for the whole bay of biscay era5 data at the grid point nearest to mutriku indicate an increase of 0 146 kw m per decade for the 1979 2019 period in this paper a self organizing map som with a 2x5 architecture has been fitted to identify ten major sea state types each with a distinctive electricity generation pattern at a daily scale this rendered it possible to reconstruct the daily electric power that would have been generated if the mutriku wave farm had been operational over the entire 1979 2019 period and accordingly evaluate the impact that the observed changes in the wave climate and associated wave energy flux would have had on the electricity production the results indicate that the electricity production or power flow would have remained constant during that period despite the increasing trend in wave energy flux this is due to the regulation procedures and mechanisms used in the operation of mutriku s oscillating water column owc wave energy converters which dampen the effect of the increasing trend observed the main conclusion is that the power flow levels off above a given threshold making it more stable than the wave energy flux graphical abstract image 1 keywords mutriku wave farm self organizing maps bay of biscay wave climate owc fluid mechanics 1 introduction the mutriku wave farm is located on the spanish coast of the bay of biscay fig 1 an area long known for its wave energy po tential iglesias and carballo 2010 this facility came into operation in 2011 pérez collazo et al 2015 it is a breakwater integrated wave farm consisting of 14 oscillating water column owc wave energy converters pereiras et al 2015 lópez et al 2016 zheng et al 2019 zheng et al 2020a zheng et al 2020b mutriku is the only wave farm in the world continuously supplying electricity to the grid o hagan et al 2016 and its major operational aspects have been reported in this journal by the authors ibarra berastegi et al 2018 serras et al 2019 previous studies for the area indicate that the energy carried by waves has been increasing in the bay of biscay since 1900 ulazia et al 2017 the effect that wef increasing trends have on the electric output of the different types of wave energy converters wec is yet to be studied in detail much of the literature on wave energy has used the standardized wave energy transport flux however the power flow from a wave farm is clearly quite different from the flux the wave energy flux increases as a function of the squared wave height and the period in most wec converters the power initially rises as a function of the period and then levels off as the period increases as a result the power flow is much more stable antonio 2010 reikard et al 2015 in the particular case of oyster type wecs antonio 2010 some works for the same area suggest folley et al 2007 ulazia et al 2019 that the wec s efficiency at transforming wave energy into electric power would be reduced in these studies the trends were calculated by combining era interim and era 20c reanalyses ecmwf 2020 to extend the calculation period back to 1900 now the bay of biscay s wave climate trends corresponding to the 1979 2019 period have been calculated here using homogeneous monthly data from the more recent era5 reanalysis alone hersbach 2016 the impact these wave energy trends have on the electric power generated at a fully operational wave farm like mutriku will be analysed here for the same period however this wave farm only came into operation in 2011 and operational data have only been intermittently available since then learning how mutriku and wave climate relate using the few common years of the whole 1979 2019 period can therefore be used to estimate the power generated throughout the entire period the idea is that if some common years are available with both types of data i wave data ii electric yield from mutriku it is possible to learn and mathematically describe how the energy transfer takes place from waves input hydraulic energy to wire output electric power this mathematical description if accurate can be used to estimate the electricity generated in mutriku for the years in which only wave data input are available this can reveal the impact of wave climate trends in the bay of biscay on the power generated at the mutriku wave farm the objectives of this paper are as follows 1 to calculate the wave climate trends in the bay of biscay over the 1979 2019 period 2 to design a data driven statistical model to relate wave energy in the area and electric power generation at the mutriku wave farm 3 to reconstruct the power generation series at mutriku for the 1979 2019 period using this model applied to the historical era5 wave energy records 4 to evaluate the impact that wave climate trends have on the electric power trends at mutriku for the 1979 2019 period the paper is structured as follows the next section describes the data used and the research methodology the results are then presented in section 3 section 4 discusses the results and the final section provides the conclusions and future outlook 2 data and methodology 2 1 data two different data sources have been used for this study on the one hand era5 wave hourly data for the 1979 2019 period have been downloaded from the copernicus climate data store copernicus climate data store 2020 era5 provides a spatial resolution of 0 5 for oceanic variables the geographical boundaries here cover the bay of biscay and include 176 grid points with 16 positions in longitude 9 e 1 5 e and 11 in latitude 43 5 n 48 5 n for this study the following variables from the era5 reanalysis have been downloaded 1 significant wave height h s 2 mean wave direction m wd 3 energy mean wave period t m 4 wave peak period t p the wave energy flux wef per unit of wave crest length in deep waters with units of kw m has been calculated bidlot 2020 multon 2013 as follows 1 wef 0 49 t m h 2 wef is a vectorial magnitude and its zonal wef u and meridional wef v components were derived by combining wef and the mean wave direction m wd the operational data used have been retrieved from the supervisory control and data acquisition scada at the mutriku wave farm which is run by the basque regional government through the biscay marine energy platform 2020 hourly data from 2014 to 2016 were disclosed in 2017 and used to characterise this farm s most relevant aspects ibarra berastegi et al 2018 serras et al 2019 a new dataset belonging to the august 2018 july 2019 period has recently been released by the basque energy agency 2020 this dataset includes records of the power generated by the facility s second turbine t02 taken by scada with a sampling interval of 0 5 s following our previous works ibarra berastegi et al 2018 serras et al 2019 the average electric power in kw generated by t02 over the preceding 5 min at hourly time steps each calculated on 2x60x5 600 scada instantaneous power records has been adopted as the reference variable and it will be referred to here simply as the electric power daily averages of the electric power generated by t02 corresponding to both periods have been used and this variable will be denoted as t02pow 2 2 methodology this paper s first objective was to calculate the wave climate trends for the bay of biscay so 492 monthly wef averages were computed for the 1979 2019 period at the 176 grid points in the area and trends were calculated on their anomalies by subtracting their seasonal cycle a theil sen robust estimation of trends was carried out siegel 1982 sen 1968 theil 1950 and their significance was assessed at a 95 confidence level the second objective involved building a data driven statistical model to relate waves and electric power generated by mutriku s t02 turbine at this initial stage to that purpose it was decided that two major types of statistical models needed to be tested on the one hand a non linear regression approach with different types of algorithms on the other hand several classes of classification techniques in all cases the candidate models needed to be built on a training dataset and their performance assessed on an independent test dataset at this point it is important to note that the electricity generated at the mutriku wave farm exhibits a clear seasonality ibarra berastegi et al 2018 with significantly higher values in winter than in summer however at the preliminary stages of this study the simple replication of the seasonal cycle observed at the training stage could not successfully represent the monthly seasonal and annual ob servations of the test dataset this implied that a specific model was needed to override the seasonal cycle this research used hourly values from era5 wave data at mutriku s nearest grid point 2 5 e 43 5 n and 3262 hourly power records corresponding to the 2014 2016 period were used to fit the candidate models this was the training database the test dataset was constituted by 8760 records of the same variables corresponding to the august 2018 july 2019 period the performance of all the candidate models was evaluated on these test cases reserved from the beginning for this purpose the general aim was to analyse the impact of wave climate trends on the electric power at mutriku the time scale for the wave trends was monthly so the model should also be able to successfully reproduce the observed monthly averages of the electric power generated at mutriku corresponding to the test dataset additionally the model should also accurately capture seasonal and annual averages using generally accepted criteria camus et al 2019 reguero et al 2015 the year was divided into the northern hemisphere four seasons winter wi running from december to february djf spring sp from march to may mam summer su from june to august jja and autumn au from september to november son for the three time scales monthly seasonal and yearly the null hypothesis should be satisfied that is the differences between observations and model predictions on the test dataset should not be different from 0 at a 95 confidence level these confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrap resampling a regression approach was initially used to build a model that could mathematically relate the waves observed near the mutriku wave farm and the electricity produced wave data belong to the nearest era5 grid point 2 5 e 43 5 n to mutriku 22 km regardless the specific algorithm employed under this regression scheme the inputs would be the wave data and the output the electric power at mutriku random forest is a machine learning type regression algorithm that is good at capturing non linear relationships between a set of inputs and outputs due to the authors experience serras et al 2019 ibarra berastegi et al 2015 2016 using this type of algorithm and the nonlinearities that could be expected to be present an initial attempt to use random forest applied to daily data was made this approach proved unsuccessful at reproducing turbine t02 s observed monthly seasonal and annual power averages for the test period this prompted an alternative approach based on a classification scheme for identifying a number of sea state types when mutriku was designed lab scale tests were also carried out for a certain number of sea states using the limited information available at that time torre enciso et al 2009 certain classification techniques like simulated annealing or k means have already been used to identify sea state types for the entire bay of biscay le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 butel et al 2002 extended areas camus et al 2014 perez et al 2015 and at global level fairley et al 2020 large scale wave climate studies have also used principal components analysis to identify sea states at a global level camus et al 2019 the field of study here covers a small area of the bay of biscay near mutriku and self organizing maps soms have been adopted as a classification tool soms are a type of neural network intended for classification purposes that have been widely used in geophysical applications gibson et al 2017 vilibic et al 2016 ezcurra et al 2008 ibarra berastegi et al 2009 more specifically soms have been used in oceanography to identify sea state types camus et al 2011 liu et al 2006 including extreme wave climate patterns barbariol et al 2016 soms can operate either in supervised or unsupervised mode in the former case a classification of at least some cases is known beforehand and these cases are presented to the som which is fitted to capture the underlying classification rules in the latter unsupervised mode classification examples are not available and cases are mapped onto the different nodes by preserving nearness starting from random initial values som parameters are fitted using a competitive learning algorithm that preserves the topological properties of the input space once fitted the som will be able to classify new cases presented to it details of the more mathematical aspects of this type of neural networks can be found in the literature kohonen 1982 kohonen 1991 kohonen 1997 kohonen and somervuo 2002 wehrens buydenset al 2007 soms have been applied here to 1 identify the most relevant sea state types for the area around mutriku 2 classify each day by sea state types using wave data soms can also be understood as a technique that projects or maps a set of cases defined in a multidimensional space onto a regular 2d grid while maximizing the preservation of their original distances in other words those cases close to each other in the original hyperspace similar sea states in our study will also cluster together in the different nodes of the 2d lattice the projected 2d grid has a limited number of nodes which in our case represent sea states obtained as the combination of all the similar types projected onto the same node all the observed daily sea states can therefore be grouped into a reduced number of sea state types or nodes on the som see appendix a for further details additionally each node or sea state type belonging to every candidate som has been assigned a characteristic daily value for the electric power generated by mutriku s second turbine this value is denoted in this paper as t02pow it has been calculated as the median of the daily average power generated by t02 in the days belonging to a particular sea state type in the training database once a som has been fitted with the training data it can classify a sequence of new daily sea states presented to it as belonging to one of the logged sea state types since a characteristic value of the electric power t02pow has already been assigned to each sea state type a series of daily power values generated by t02 can be easily derived from the classification provided by the som we did not have any data on the layout and number of nodes or sea state types of the optimal som and the algebraic definition of the original hyperspace based on wave variables so a large number of candidate som networks needed to be fitted in unsupervised mode all these candidate networks would have a different number of sea state types nodes and associated t02pow values a wave farm like mutriku is a facility that converts hydraulic energy from waves into electric power the candidate oceanic variables were therefore those that concentrate the directional information on wave energy wef u and wef v and the frequency associated with the maximum energy t p the appropriate som here would be one in which the sequence of t02pow values derived from the test dataset s classification by sea state types could successfully predict the monthly seasonal and yearly means the number of nodes would also represent the optimal division of wave data into the representative sea state types needed to accurately describe the power generated this approach is different from previous works in which soms have been applied to identify sea states characterized by the wave energy flux barbariol et al 2016 to identify this optimal som an iterative process was designed in which more than 1000 soms with different architectures were fitted on the training dataset this also involved evaluating a number of different options to correctly select the input wave variables that constitute the hyperspace in which each daily sea state is defined the first stage of this iterative process involved fitting each candidate som on the training dataset allowing a maximum of 10 000 iterations the som obtained was then used to classify the test dataset s wave data by daily sea state types this classification used the assigned power values for each sea state type to easily derive a time series of daily electric power averages for t02 the last stage involved evaluating the capability of the daily power predictions obtained in this way to reproduce the t02 s electric power at monthly seasonal and yearly scales the means observed and predicted for these timeframes were compared at a 95 confidence level using bootstrap resampling the result of these iterations led to the definition of each daily sea state in an 18 dimension hyperspace constituted by the standardized era5 values at the nearest grid point every 4 h corresponding to wef u wef v and t p that is on a given day the hourly values of the zonal and meridional wave energy flux and the peak wave period at 00 h 04 h 08 h 12 h 16 h 20 h constitute an 18 dimensional hyperspace and that particular day s sea state appears as a point on it the optimal som had 10 nodes displayed in a 2x5 lattice this som was used to build the series of daily power values obtained from the daily sequence of sea state types the daily values of t02pow predicted in this way were compared to the 365 observations of the test data set yielding a determination coefficient r 2 of 0 72 a rmse value of 1 51 and a mean absolute error of 1 01 kw however as mentioned above the time scale of interest on which results needed to be evaluated was monthly not daily this daily time series was used to compute monthly and seasonal averages for the test data set and compared to observations using 95 confidence level intervals obtained by bootstrap resampling fig 2 shows that the final som obtained successfully reproduced all the monthly and seasonal averages in all cases the confidence intervals of ob servations and predictions overlap thus confirming that at a 95 confidence level the null hypothesis of equal values for predictions and observations is attained the same can be concluded about the 95 confidence interval of the yearly average t02pow observations 2 2 2 8 kw and predictions 2 1 2 7 kw it is important to stress that this particular combination of 18 dimensions and a 2x5 grid was the only one among all the candidates tested to successfully predict all the power averages in the test dataset at monthly seasonal and yearly time scales to meet the third objective this som was used to classify the sea states for all the days corresponding to the 1979 2019 period this sequence of daily sea states was used to estimate the 14 975 daily t02pow values generated by t02 at mutriku for the same period finally to comply with the fourth objective the trends in monthly power values for the 1979 2019 period were computed to evaluate the impact that wave energy changes in the bay of biscay have on the electric power generation at mutriku this included calculating trends in the frequency of occurrence and in the average distance to ideal sea state types in all cases robust theil sen trends were calculated and their significance was assessed at a 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 wef trends in the bay of biscay fig 3 shows the theil sen trends in the wave energy flux in the bay of biscay in kw m per decade they are significant at all the grid points at a 95 confidence level there are positive trends in the whole area for the 1979 2019 period albeit with a significant spatial gradient the trends record a value of around 0 1 kw m per decade in the innermost parts of the bay of biscay with average values below 15 kw m more specifically the observed trend at the era5 pixel including mutriku centered at 2 5 e 43 5 n is 0 14 kw m per decade with an average wef value of 13 9 kw m as we move out into open sea the positive trend strengthens to a maximum of 1 8 kw m per decade in areas where the average values of wef are below 40 kw m these values are consistent with previous studies for wef h s and t m ulazia et al 2017 le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 charles et al 2012 which also indicate that wave heights and the wave energy flux in the bay of biscay have been increasing in recent decades 3 2 sea state types characterization and trends as mentioned above these trends have been correlated with the electricity generated at mutriku through a classification approach and accordingly an optimal som with a 2x5 architecture was finally fitted each of the 10 nodes represents a sea state type at a daily scale obtained in the training dataset the sea states are defined for the area near mutriku as they provide the best information for the waves that reach it table 1 provides a summary of the characteristic values corresponding to the different sea state types nodes it includes data on wind and waves as well as the representative t02pow associated with each sea state type the incoming direction of waves in all sea state types is nw nnw the first two types correspond to highly or extreme sea states with a low occurrence and average values that are substantially different to all the rest a more visual representation of the final som s main characteristics and its associated sea state types can be seen in appendix b table 1 also features each sea state s frequency of occurrence and distribution by seasons in the case of wind the incoming direction is ssw for type 5 and sse for sea state type 8 for all the other types the prevailing wind directions are w nw the waves at the nearest grid point to mutriku record a small but significant positive trend as can be seen in table 2 in the case of wef the meridional component wef v accounts for this trend thus indicating a shift northwards in the incoming wave direction the significant wave height mean wave period and peak wave period also exhibit small but significant positive trends the wave energy flux wef records significant positive trends for the 1979 2019 period as calculated from monthly means this evolution could be explained le cozannet et al 2011 either by an increase of the wef average of certain sea state types or and by a change in the relative frequency of occurrence of certain sea state types in this study the evolution of the sea state types obtained have been analysed also from these two points of view 1 changes within the 10 sea state types as defined in the training period were detected by calculating trends in the distance of cases to the ideal 2x5 som for the whole 1979 2019 period additionally trends were calculated for wef values within each node the results show that both distance and wef trends within each sea state type are not significant thus indicating that they remain constant for the whole period 2 trends in the frequency of occurrence for the different sea state types have also been calculated only in three sea state types were significant changes detected with a positive increase of 0 33 and 0 25 per decade in the frequency of occurrence of sea state types 3 and 7 during the 1979 2019 period type 9 records a negative trend in frequency of 0 28 decade table 2 the conclusion is that the small increase in the frequency of a highly energetic sea state type like 3 along with the decrease of 9 accounts in the area around mutriku for the upward trend found in the monthly values of wef during the 1979 2019 period 3 3 t02pow monthly trends for 1979 2019 era5 data at the nearest grid point were used to classify the final 2x5 som for all the days corresponding to the 1979 2019 period by sea state types the daily time series of t02pow for the 1979 2019 was reconstructed by assigning the t02pow value in table 1 derived from the training data set to each sea state type the monthly averages for t02pow and wef for the whole period were 2 4 kw and 13 9 kw m respectively table 1 shows that the sea state types 1 to 6 correspond to above average wef and t02pow values these more energetic types represent 29 of the cases and some of them such as 1 2 4 and 6 mainly occur in winter types from 7 to 10 record characteristic below average values of wef and t02pow and account for 71 of the cases the trend in the daily time series of t02pow for the 1979 2019 period was also calculated due to its marked seasonality this trend was calculated both on anomalies and original data and in both cases was non significant at a 95 confidence level table 2 4 discussion self organizing maps have been used here to classify the waves observed near mutriku into ten sea state types using a 2x5 som prior studies le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 butel et al 2002 charles et al 2012 have used different classification algorithms applied to broader areas of the bay of biscay to divide the observed waves into twelve major sea state types although prior studies have used other databases following a completely different methodological approach and with a purely oceanic and not energetic focus they also report an increase in wave energy and a shift northwards in the incoming direction similarly the sea state types are reported to remain constant and changes are attributed to the evolution in their frequency of occurrence these important features were also apparent in our results which confirms that they are key aspects for showing how wave energy potential has evolved in the bay of biscay in recent decades our classification approach here made it possible to estimate the evolution of the wave energy flux during the 1979 2019 period and the electric power that would have been generated by the second turbine in mutriku over the same period the joint analysis of the evolution of both variables for that period indicates that the small changes detected in the wave trends near mutriku have not involved significant changes in the electricity production this result can be explained by two factors 1 the rather small trends in waves for the period 1979 2019 have been calculated at the nearest era5 grid point 22 km off the mutriku wave farm mutriku is a breakwater wave farm located on the shoreline and probably as can be deduced from the general behaviour of waves in the bay of biscay fig 3 the trends in the waves actually reaching mutriku s air chambers are even less marked 2 the regulation and control of the wells turbines in mutriku are based on different adaptive models based on the instantaneous values of each generator s torque as input variable and have been amply reported in the literature faÿ et al 2020a amundarain et al 2012 amundarain et al 2010 lekube et al 2018a lekube et al 2018b a secondary regulatory element includes a butterfly valve located in the duct connecting the air chamber and the wells turbine depending on the energy of the incoming waves and in order to regulate the incoming flow from the air chamber this butterfly valve may close totally or partially but its response is not instantaneous see appendix c although turbine control is implemented instantaneously a graphical representation of the wef and t02pow on the same daily scale used here can describe how the regulation system acts to dampen the energy from incoming waves fig 4 a shows that as the wef increases to 45 kw m the generated power increases linearly to a peak value of around 8 5 kw wef values above 45 kw m do not lead to t02pow above values 8 5 kw as the regulation mechanisms tend to dampen the increase in wave energy flux the sea state types obtained in this study are also aligned according to this general behaviour see fig 4 b table 1 shows that the changes in wef are concentrated in three sea state types 3 7 and 9 positive trends in sea state type 3 and negative trends in 9 increase the wave energy flux positive trends in the occurrence of sea state type 7 reduce the average wave energy flux the combined trends for the 1979 2019 period have meant a positive trend of 0 146 kw m per decade for wef and no trend for t02pow other effects gathered in the literature such as the sea level rise at regional caballero et al 2008 gonzález et al 2013 and global scale kulp and strauss 2019 do not seem to have any impact on mutriku s electricity production in order to estimate the conditions conducive to changes in the electric power generated a number of synthetic time series for the 1979 2019 period were built increasing decreasing the decadal trends in the frequency of occurrence of sea state types 3 7 and 9 the results indicate that at least a joint decadal increase of 2 in sea state type 3 and a corresponding decrease of 2 in 9 would be needed to generate a small but significant increase for t02pow of 0 05 kw decade this would be associated with an overall positive trend of wef of 0 321 kw m per decade such a sharp increase in wef can only be found in the central area of the bay of biscay fig 3 and would represent a growing trend more than twice as strong as that observed near mutriku as stated in the first section of this paper the focus of our study was to identify the number of sea state types needed to reproduce the observed electric power generated at mutriku rather than to classify waves into clusters with a purely oceanic significance according to this approach the profile of the ten sea state types for the 1979 2019 period remained constant and the increasing energy flux observed in the waves near mutriku can be attributed to minor albeit significant changes in the frequency of occurrence of some sea state types the result is a small positive wef trend mainly affecting its meridional component and resulting in a northward reorientation of the incoming direction the reasons for this increase are beyond the scope of this work but some complementary results such as the steady or even declining trends detected for wind speed in many areas of the bay of biscay see appendix d suggest that the growing wef trend observed may be due to an increase in the swell component of waves a recent study for the north atlantic has used satellite data to confirm the absence of significant changes in wind speed trends in this area young and ribal 2019 besides it is to be noted atmospheric data shows significant amounts of variability at different time scales beyond the ones corresponding to the obvious regular cycles daily or seasonal since waves are driven by wind these atmospheric oscillations also have an impact on ocean waves in extratropical regions such as the one covered in this paper it is known that some of this variability is associated to the development and decay of synoptic perturbations although variability at longer time scales still exists blackmon 1976 the variability associated to time scales longer than 10 days is commonly referred to as teleconnection patterns since it is usually apparent in robust correlations between points located far away in the northern hemisphere wallace and gutzler 1981 these results have been corroborated by means of rotated principal component analysis barnston and livezey 1987 which is the technique currently commonly used to identify the teleconnection indices over the northern hemisphere among the northern hemisphere teleconnection patterns is to be mentioned the north atlantic oscillation nao which is known to affect synoptic activity over the study area rogers 1997 and is one of the major drivers of climate variations over the european sector hurrell 1995 hurrel and van loon 1997 a second teleconnection pattern also relevant for this study is the east atlantic ea index an important player in the area the ea affects the intensity of advections of southern origin over the area acting according to a different mechanism of action if compared with the nao sáenz et al 2001 the wave changes observed in the previous studies commented above on the bay of biscay le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 butel et al 2002 charles et al 2012 seem to be driven by changes precisely in the nao and ea indexes and are reported to concentrate on the swell component a more general study for the whole northern hemisphere has also pointed out the relevance that nao and ea indexes have at explaining the long term changes in wave energy reguero et al 2015 in the same study authors also suggest that these trends are far less important for coastal wave farms than those driven by annual seasonality this statement is particularly relevant for mutriku where the strong seasonal pattern observed means that electric power generation in winter is roughly four times higher than in summer ibarra berastegi et al 2018 fig 2 b if analysed at a monthly scale the oscillations are even more intense reaching a proportion of 1 10 between the maximum and minimum values fig 5 as a conclusion despite some minor differences our results above on the evolution of waves are in agreement with those previous studies for the bay of biscay carried out using other classification methods and applied to different databases periods areas and physical models no significant trend was detected in the electric power generated in the second turbine at mutriku whereby it may be concluded that the overall electricity generated at mutriku wave farm would also have remained constant during the 1979 2019 period if the same set of control operational and management protocols had been applied however these protocols may vary over the years and furthermore mutriku occasionally acts as a test facility for different types of wave energy converters that need to be trialled under real operating conditions faÿ et al 2020a faÿ et al 2020b rusu and onea 2016 a prior paper ibarra berastegi et al 2018 has shown that an an average of 10 wells turbines were working under the regulation and maintenance protocols in place over the 2014 2016 period without any additional device being tested for these conditions the annual average electricity sold to the grid was 246468 7 kwh under similar steady conditions the wave farm would have generated a total amount of 10 1 gwh over the 41 years of the 1979 2019 period assuming an average emission factor for the spanish electric mix of 0 3 kg of co2 kwh european environment agency 2018 carbon footprint ltd 2019 idae 2011 ministry for ecological transition 2020 if the mutriku wave farm had been working since 1979 the emission of 3032 tons of co2 would have been avoided mutriku is the only wave farm continuously generating electricity and may also continue contributing in the future to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions the technology readiness level trl is an indicator ranging from 1 to 9 to indicate how mature a technological development is heder 2017 1 corresponds to a basic or initial level while 9 represents a fully commercial and operational level it is important to mention that although wave energy is at a trl stage of 7 mutriku is the only facility that has already reached a trl of 8 strategic research and innovation agenda for ocean energy 2020 a deeper understanding of the impact of long term changes in a fully operational wave farm may therefore help in selecting locations rusu and onea 2013 2019a 2019b rusu and guedes soares 2012 for different wecs in a dynamic context of constantly evolving wave climate 5 conclusions and future outlook mutriku is the only wave farm in the world continuously generating electricity since 2011 era5 data reveal a generally positive trend in the bay of biscay s wave climate over the 1979 2019 period operational data from mutriku were used to fit an optimal som and classify observational wave data into ten major sea state types defined on a daily scale these types were defined from an energy generation perspective and not from a purely oceanic point of view this allowed reconstructing the hypothetical electric power that would have been generated by the mutriku wave farm had it been operational over the entire 1979 2019 period although the wave climate presents an increasing trend in wave power the results indicate that this trend would not have meant an increase in electricity production be cause mutriku s owc turbines dampen the effect of the observed positive trends in wave energy it may therefore be concluded that moderate long term changes in wave energy may not have a direct impact on the electricity generated at owc wave farms it may be inferred that in the context of climate change economic and feasibility studies for prospective wave farms can be conducted with a high degree of reliability as future uncertainties in the resource itself are not to have a significant impact on the electric yield during the facility s life cycle a new climate change law is set to be enacted in spain in the coming months and 70 of the power generated in the country is expected to be renewable by 2030 similarly the european green deal 2020 provides a roadmap with actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reach a climate neutral eu by 2050 renewable energies will therefore play an important role although the optimistic projections for wave energy made only a few years ago magagna and uihlein 2015 oecd 2016 have now been moderated zappa et al 2019 within the context of these general plans towards a greener economy and after nine years operat ing safely a wave farm like mutriku is a facility that can provide a regular and predictable horizon of electricity production the authors are currently conducting further research to estimate future wave climate trends in the bay of biscay cmip5 wave projections using the saw model have recently been released by the ecmwf copernicus cmip5 dataset 2020 for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios csiro commonwealth scientific a 2020 has also published 21st century wave projections for the same scenarios derived from 10 cmip5 models morim et al 2020 csiro cmip5 2020 likewise cmip6 projections are likely to have been fully disclosed by the end of 2021 these projections will provide estimations of the future wave climate in the bay of biscay which will be used to feed the som obtained here and obtain estimations of future electricity generation at mutriku these results can help to better define the role that wave farms and particularly owc technology can play in meeting the objective of a climate neutral energy generation system credit authorship contribution statement gabriel ibarra berastegi

mode and finally selected under the condition that the observed electric power generated in the test dataset could be succesfully reproduced in the absence of previous examples of som applications for similar purposes a classical approach kohonen 1982 1991 was implemented to fit the appropriate som leading to the identification and characterization of the optimum number of sea states however it is to be noted that although not necessary for our study further developments in the implementation of self organizing maps like the two steps som tsom may be needed in the future to address more complex challenges like the identification of wave extremes barbariol et al 2016 here each daily sea state has been defined in an 18 dimension hyperspace constituted by the standardized era5 values at the nearest grid point every 4 h corresponding to wef u wef v and t p that is on a given day the hourly values at 00 h 04 h 08 h 12 h 16 h 20 h of the zonal and meridional wave energy flux and the peak wave period constitute an 18 dimensional hyperspace a particular day s sea state can be seen as a point in it and the final som had a 2x5 architecture this optimal som was fitted after 10 000 iterations starting from random values see fig a1a as the input variables have different operating ranges and units they are standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 the fitting process progresses until a minimum value of the average distance is reached in our case of 0 012 fig a1b shows the number of cases belonging to the training database mapped onto the different nodes with the final 2 5 som in a som the neighbour nodes in the layout are the ones expected to be more similar to a given node in other words neighbouring units hold cases that in the original hyperspace are expected to be closer to each other than to cases belonging to non neighbouring nodes the average distance between each unit and their neighbouring nodes in the 2x5 lattice indicates how different each sea state type can be from the nearest most similar types a graphical representation of this can be seen in fig a2a indicating that the nodes sea state types 1 2 and 3 are the ones with the highest distances thus reinforcing the notion of representing extreme highly energetic cases with a low frequency as shown in table 1 in the main text as mentioned in the paper the input space has 18 dimensions corresponding to the hourly values at 00 h 04 h 08 h 12 h 16 h 20 h of the zonal and meridional wave energy flux and the peak wave period after fitting the fig a1 a evolution of the average

below sea level and push an upwards air flow that moves the turbine as waves withdraw they generate suction and the air flow is reversed fig c1 each of the 14 operational turbines includes two wells

the period 1979 2019 in the bay of biscay have also been calculated fig d1 there are areas near the french coast with negative trends and some of the areas with the highest positive trends in wef do not have significant trends in ws this suggests that waves generated by local winds can be expected to remain constant and in these areas the positive wef trends in the bay of biscay may be driven by the growing trends of the wave swell component something already pointed out in previous works on the area le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 butel et al 2002 charles et al 2012 finally in the western part of the bay of biscay in latitudes between 44 and 46 n ws records positive trends that may also contribute to the increasing evolution of wef that has been observed image 12 
20893,mutriku is a wave farm on the spanish coast of the bay of biscay that has now been continuously supplying electricity for more than nine years since 1979 there has been a growing trend in wave energy flux for the whole bay of biscay era5 data at the grid point nearest to mutriku indicate an increase of 0 146 kw m per decade for the 1979 2019 period in this paper a self organizing map som with a 2x5 architecture has been fitted to identify ten major sea state types each with a distinctive electricity generation pattern at a daily scale this rendered it possible to reconstruct the daily electric power that would have been generated if the mutriku wave farm had been operational over the entire 1979 2019 period and accordingly evaluate the impact that the observed changes in the wave climate and associated wave energy flux would have had on the electricity production the results indicate that the electricity production or power flow would have remained constant during that period despite the increasing trend in wave energy flux this is due to the regulation procedures and mechanisms used in the operation of mutriku s oscillating water column owc wave energy converters which dampen the effect of the increasing trend observed the main conclusion is that the power flow levels off above a given threshold making it more stable than the wave energy flux graphical abstract image 1 keywords mutriku wave farm self organizing maps bay of biscay wave climate owc fluid mechanics 1 introduction the mutriku wave farm is located on the spanish coast of the bay of biscay fig 1 an area long known for its wave energy po tential iglesias and carballo 2010 this facility came into operation in 2011 pérez collazo et al 2015 it is a breakwater integrated wave farm consisting of 14 oscillating water column owc wave energy converters pereiras et al 2015 lópez et al 2016 zheng et al 2019 zheng et al 2020a zheng et al 2020b mutriku is the only wave farm in the world continuously supplying electricity to the grid o hagan et al 2016 and its major operational aspects have been reported in this journal by the authors ibarra berastegi et al 2018 serras et al 2019 previous studies for the area indicate that the energy carried by waves has been increasing in the bay of biscay since 1900 ulazia et al 2017 the effect that wef increasing trends have on the electric output of the different types of wave energy converters wec is yet to be studied in detail much of the literature on wave energy has used the standardized wave energy transport flux however the power flow from a wave farm is clearly quite different from the flux the wave energy flux increases as a function of the squared wave height and the period in most wec converters the power initially rises as a function of the period and then levels off as the period increases as a result the power flow is much more stable antonio 2010 reikard et al 2015 in the particular case of oyster type wecs antonio 2010 some works for the same area suggest folley et al 2007 ulazia et al 2019 that the wec s efficiency at transforming wave energy into electric power would be reduced in these studies the trends were calculated by combining era interim and era 20c reanalyses ecmwf 2020 to extend the calculation period back to 1900 now the bay of biscay s wave climate trends corresponding to the 1979 2019 period have been calculated here using homogeneous monthly data from the more recent era5 reanalysis alone hersbach 2016 the impact these wave energy trends have on the electric power generated at a fully operational wave farm like mutriku will be analysed here for the same period however this wave farm only came into operation in 2011 and operational data have only been intermittently available since then learning how mutriku and wave climate relate using the few common years of the whole 1979 2019 period can therefore be used to estimate the power generated throughout the entire period the idea is that if some common years are available with both types of data i wave data ii electric yield from mutriku it is possible to learn and mathematically describe how the energy transfer takes place from waves input hydraulic energy to wire output electric power this mathematical description if accurate can be used to estimate the electricity generated in mutriku for the years in which only wave data input are available this can reveal the impact of wave climate trends in the bay of biscay on the power generated at the mutriku wave farm the objectives of this paper are as follows 1 to calculate the wave climate trends in the bay of biscay over the 1979 2019 period 2 to design a data driven statistical model to relate wave energy in the area and electric power generation at the mutriku wave farm 3 to reconstruct the power generation series at mutriku for the 1979 2019 period using this model applied to the historical era5 wave energy records 4 to evaluate the impact that wave climate trends have on the electric power trends at mutriku for the 1979 2019 period the paper is structured as follows the next section describes the data used and the research methodology the results are then presented in section 3 section 4 discusses the results and the final section provides the conclusions and future outlook 2 data and methodology 2 1 data two different data sources have been used for this study on the one hand era5 wave hourly data for the 1979 2019 period have been downloaded from the copernicus climate data store copernicus climate data store 2020 era5 provides a spatial resolution of 0 5 for oceanic variables the geographical boundaries here cover the bay of biscay and include 176 grid points with 16 positions in longitude 9 e 1 5 e and 11 in latitude 43 5 n 48 5 n for this study the following variables from the era5 reanalysis have been downloaded 1 significant wave height h s 2 mean wave direction m wd 3 energy mean wave period t m 4 wave peak period t p the wave energy flux wef per unit of wave crest length in deep waters with units of kw m has been calculated bidlot 2020 multon 2013 as follows 1 wef 0 49 t m h 2 wef is a vectorial magnitude and its zonal wef u and meridional wef v components were derived by combining wef and the mean wave direction m wd the operational data used have been retrieved from the supervisory control and data acquisition scada at the mutriku wave farm which is run by the basque regional government through the biscay marine energy platform 2020 hourly data from 2014 to 2016 were disclosed in 2017 and used to characterise this farm s most relevant aspects ibarra berastegi et al 2018 serras et al 2019 a new dataset belonging to the august 2018 july 2019 period has recently been released by the basque energy agency 2020 this dataset includes records of the power generated by the facility s second turbine t02 taken by scada with a sampling interval of 0 5 s following our previous works ibarra berastegi et al 2018 serras et al 2019 the average electric power in kw generated by t02 over the preceding 5 min at hourly time steps each calculated on 2x60x5 600 scada instantaneous power records has been adopted as the reference variable and it will be referred to here simply as the electric power daily averages of the electric power generated by t02 corresponding to both periods have been used and this variable will be denoted as t02pow 2 2 methodology this paper s first objective was to calculate the wave climate trends for the bay of biscay so 492 monthly wef averages were computed for the 1979 2019 period at the 176 grid points in the area and trends were calculated on their anomalies by subtracting their seasonal cycle a theil sen robust estimation of trends was carried out siegel 1982 sen 1968 theil 1950 and their significance was assessed at a 95 confidence level the second objective involved building a data driven statistical model to relate waves and electric power generated by mutriku s t02 turbine at this initial stage to that purpose it was decided that two major types of statistical models needed to be tested on the one hand a non linear regression approach with different types of algorithms on the other hand several classes of classification techniques in all cases the candidate models needed to be built on a training dataset and their performance assessed on an independent test dataset at this point it is important to note that the electricity generated at the mutriku wave farm exhibits a clear seasonality ibarra berastegi et al 2018 with significantly higher values in winter than in summer however at the preliminary stages of this study the simple replication of the seasonal cycle observed at the training stage could not successfully represent the monthly seasonal and annual ob servations of the test dataset this implied that a specific model was needed to override the seasonal cycle this research used hourly values from era5 wave data at mutriku s nearest grid point 2 5 e 43 5 n and 3262 hourly power records corresponding to the 2014 2016 period were used to fit the candidate models this was the training database the test dataset was constituted by 8760 records of the same variables corresponding to the august 2018 july 2019 period the performance of all the candidate models was evaluated on these test cases reserved from the beginning for this purpose the general aim was to analyse the impact of wave climate trends on the electric power at mutriku the time scale for the wave trends was monthly so the model should also be able to successfully reproduce the observed monthly averages of the electric power generated at mutriku corresponding to the test dataset additionally the model should also accurately capture seasonal and annual averages using generally accepted criteria camus et al 2019 reguero et al 2015 the year was divided into the northern hemisphere four seasons winter wi running from december to february djf spring sp from march to may mam summer su from june to august jja and autumn au from september to november son for the three time scales monthly seasonal and yearly the null hypothesis should be satisfied that is the differences between observations and model predictions on the test dataset should not be different from 0 at a 95 confidence level these confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrap resampling a regression approach was initially used to build a model that could mathematically relate the waves observed near the mutriku wave farm and the electricity produced wave data belong to the nearest era5 grid point 2 5 e 43 5 n to mutriku 22 km regardless the specific algorithm employed under this regression scheme the inputs would be the wave data and the output the electric power at mutriku random forest is a machine learning type regression algorithm that is good at capturing non linear relationships between a set of inputs and outputs due to the authors experience serras et al 2019 ibarra berastegi et al 2015 2016 using this type of algorithm and the nonlinearities that could be expected to be present an initial attempt to use random forest applied to daily data was made this approach proved unsuccessful at reproducing turbine t02 s observed monthly seasonal and annual power averages for the test period this prompted an alternative approach based on a classification scheme for identifying a number of sea state types when mutriku was designed lab scale tests were also carried out for a certain number of sea states using the limited information available at that time torre enciso et al 2009 certain classification techniques like simulated annealing or k means have already been used to identify sea state types for the entire bay of biscay le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 butel et al 2002 extended areas camus et al 2014 perez et al 2015 and at global level fairley et al 2020 large scale wave climate studies have also used principal components analysis to identify sea states at a global level camus et al 2019 the field of study here covers a small area of the bay of biscay near mutriku and self organizing maps soms have been adopted as a classification tool soms are a type of neural network intended for classification purposes that have been widely used in geophysical applications gibson et al 2017 vilibic et al 2016 ezcurra et al 2008 ibarra berastegi et al 2009 more specifically soms have been used in oceanography to identify sea state types camus et al 2011 liu et al 2006 including extreme wave climate patterns barbariol et al 2016 soms can operate either in supervised or unsupervised mode in the former case a classification of at least some cases is known beforehand and these cases are presented to the som which is fitted to capture the underlying classification rules in the latter unsupervised mode classification examples are not available and cases are mapped onto the different nodes by preserving nearness starting from random initial values som parameters are fitted using a competitive learning algorithm that preserves the topological properties of the input space once fitted the som will be able to classify new cases presented to it details of the more mathematical aspects of this type of neural networks can be found in the literature kohonen 1982 kohonen 1991 kohonen 1997 kohonen and somervuo 2002 wehrens buydenset al 2007 soms have been applied here to 1 identify the most relevant sea state types for the area around mutriku 2 classify each day by sea state types using wave data soms can also be understood as a technique that projects or maps a set of cases defined in a multidimensional space onto a regular 2d grid while maximizing the preservation of their original distances in other words those cases close to each other in the original hyperspace similar sea states in our study will also cluster together in the different nodes of the 2d lattice the projected 2d grid has a limited number of nodes which in our case represent sea states obtained as the combination of all the similar types projected onto the same node all the observed daily sea states can therefore be grouped into a reduced number of sea state types or nodes on the som see appendix a for further details additionally each node or sea state type belonging to every candidate som has been assigned a characteristic daily value for the electric power generated by mutriku s second turbine this value is denoted in this paper as t02pow it has been calculated as the median of the daily average power generated by t02 in the days belonging to a particular sea state type in the training database once a som has been fitted with the training data it can classify a sequence of new daily sea states presented to it as belonging to one of the logged sea state types since a characteristic value of the electric power t02pow has already been assigned to each sea state type a series of daily power values generated by t02 can be easily derived from the classification provided by the som we did not have any data on the layout and number of nodes or sea state types of the optimal som and the algebraic definition of the original hyperspace based on wave variables so a large number of candidate som networks needed to be fitted in unsupervised mode all these candidate networks would have a different number of sea state types nodes and associated t02pow values a wave farm like mutriku is a facility that converts hydraulic energy from waves into electric power the candidate oceanic variables were therefore those that concentrate the directional information on wave energy wef u and wef v and the frequency associated with the maximum energy t p the appropriate som here would be one in which the sequence of t02pow values derived from the test dataset s classification by sea state types could successfully predict the monthly seasonal and yearly means the number of nodes would also represent the optimal division of wave data into the representative sea state types needed to accurately describe the power generated this approach is different from previous works in which soms have been applied to identify sea states characterized by the wave energy flux barbariol et al 2016 to identify this optimal som an iterative process was designed in which more than 1000 soms with different architectures were fitted on the training dataset this also involved evaluating a number of different options to correctly select the input wave variables that constitute the hyperspace in which each daily sea state is defined the first stage of this iterative process involved fitting each candidate som on the training dataset allowing a maximum of 10 000 iterations the som obtained was then used to classify the test dataset s wave data by daily sea state types this classification used the assigned power values for each sea state type to easily derive a time series of daily electric power averages for t02 the last stage involved evaluating the capability of the daily power predictions obtained in this way to reproduce the t02 s electric power at monthly seasonal and yearly scales the means observed and predicted for these timeframes were compared at a 95 confidence level using bootstrap resampling the result of these iterations led to the definition of each daily sea state in an 18 dimension hyperspace constituted by the standardized era5 values at the nearest grid point every 4 h corresponding to wef u wef v and t p that is on a given day the hourly values of the zonal and meridional wave energy flux and the peak wave period at 00 h 04 h 08 h 12 h 16 h 20 h constitute an 18 dimensional hyperspace and that particular day s sea state appears as a point on it the optimal som had 10 nodes displayed in a 2x5 lattice this som was used to build the series of daily power values obtained from the daily sequence of sea state types the daily values of t02pow predicted in this way were compared to the 365 observations of the test data set yielding a determination coefficient r 2 of 0 72 a rmse value of 1 51 and a mean absolute error of 1 01 kw however as mentioned above the time scale of interest on which results needed to be evaluated was monthly not daily this daily time series was used to compute monthly and seasonal averages for the test data set and compared to observations using 95 confidence level intervals obtained by bootstrap resampling fig 2 shows that the final som obtained successfully reproduced all the monthly and seasonal averages in all cases the confidence intervals of ob servations and predictions overlap thus confirming that at a 95 confidence level the null hypothesis of equal values for predictions and observations is attained the same can be concluded about the 95 confidence interval of the yearly average t02pow observations 2 2 2 8 kw and predictions 2 1 2 7 kw it is important to stress that this particular combination of 18 dimensions and a 2x5 grid was the only one among all the candidates tested to successfully predict all the power averages in the test dataset at monthly seasonal and yearly time scales to meet the third objective this som was used to classify the sea states for all the days corresponding to the 1979 2019 period this sequence of daily sea states was used to estimate the 14 975 daily t02pow values generated by t02 at mutriku for the same period finally to comply with the fourth objective the trends in monthly power values for the 1979 2019 period were computed to evaluate the impact that wave energy changes in the bay of biscay have on the electric power generation at mutriku this included calculating trends in the frequency of occurrence and in the average distance to ideal sea state types in all cases robust theil sen trends were calculated and their significance was assessed at a 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 wef trends in the bay of biscay fig 3 shows the theil sen trends in the wave energy flux in the bay of biscay in kw m per decade they are significant at all the grid points at a 95 confidence level there are positive trends in the whole area for the 1979 2019 period albeit with a significant spatial gradient the trends record a value of around 0 1 kw m per decade in the innermost parts of the bay of biscay with average values below 15 kw m more specifically the observed trend at the era5 pixel including mutriku centered at 2 5 e 43 5 n is 0 14 kw m per decade with an average wef value of 13 9 kw m as we move out into open sea the positive trend strengthens to a maximum of 1 8 kw m per decade in areas where the average values of wef are below 40 kw m these values are consistent with previous studies for wef h s and t m ulazia et al 2017 le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 charles et al 2012 which also indicate that wave heights and the wave energy flux in the bay of biscay have been increasing in recent decades 3 2 sea state types characterization and trends as mentioned above these trends have been correlated with the electricity generated at mutriku through a classification approach and accordingly an optimal som with a 2x5 architecture was finally fitted each of the 10 nodes represents a sea state type at a daily scale obtained in the training dataset the sea states are defined for the area near mutriku as they provide the best information for the waves that reach it table 1 provides a summary of the characteristic values corresponding to the different sea state types nodes it includes data on wind and waves as well as the representative t02pow associated with each sea state type the incoming direction of waves in all sea state types is nw nnw the first two types correspond to highly or extreme sea states with a low occurrence and average values that are substantially different to all the rest a more visual representation of the final som s main characteristics and its associated sea state types can be seen in appendix b table 1 also features each sea state s frequency of occurrence and distribution by seasons in the case of wind the incoming direction is ssw for type 5 and sse for sea state type 8 for all the other types the prevailing wind directions are w nw the waves at the nearest grid point to mutriku record a small but significant positive trend as can be seen in table 2 in the case of wef the meridional component wef v accounts for this trend thus indicating a shift northwards in the incoming wave direction the significant wave height mean wave period and peak wave period also exhibit small but significant positive trends the wave energy flux wef records significant positive trends for the 1979 2019 period as calculated from monthly means this evolution could be explained le cozannet et al 2011 either by an increase of the wef average of certain sea state types or and by a change in the relative frequency of occurrence of certain sea state types in this study the evolution of the sea state types obtained have been analysed also from these two points of view 1 changes within the 10 sea state types as defined in the training period were detected by calculating trends in the distance of cases to the ideal 2x5 som for the whole 1979 2019 period additionally trends were calculated for wef values within each node the results show that both distance and wef trends within each sea state type are not significant thus indicating that they remain constant for the whole period 2 trends in the frequency of occurrence for the different sea state types have also been calculated only in three sea state types were significant changes detected with a positive increase of 0 33 and 0 25 per decade in the frequency of occurrence of sea state types 3 and 7 during the 1979 2019 period type 9 records a negative trend in frequency of 0 28 decade table 2 the conclusion is that the small increase in the frequency of a highly energetic sea state type like 3 along with the decrease of 9 accounts in the area around mutriku for the upward trend found in the monthly values of wef during the 1979 2019 period 3 3 t02pow monthly trends for 1979 2019 era5 data at the nearest grid point were used to classify the final 2x5 som for all the days corresponding to the 1979 2019 period by sea state types the daily time series of t02pow for the 1979 2019 was reconstructed by assigning the t02pow value in table 1 derived from the training data set to each sea state type the monthly averages for t02pow and wef for the whole period were 2 4 kw and 13 9 kw m respectively table 1 shows that the sea state types 1 to 6 correspond to above average wef and t02pow values these more energetic types represent 29 of the cases and some of them such as 1 2 4 and 6 mainly occur in winter types from 7 to 10 record characteristic below average values of wef and t02pow and account for 71 of the cases the trend in the daily time series of t02pow for the 1979 2019 period was also calculated due to its marked seasonality this trend was calculated both on anomalies and original data and in both cases was non significant at a 95 confidence level table 2 4 discussion self organizing maps have been used here to classify the waves observed near mutriku into ten sea state types using a 2x5 som prior studies le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 butel et al 2002 charles et al 2012 have used different classification algorithms applied to broader areas of the bay of biscay to divide the observed waves into twelve major sea state types although prior studies have used other databases following a completely different methodological approach and with a purely oceanic and not energetic focus they also report an increase in wave energy and a shift northwards in the incoming direction similarly the sea state types are reported to remain constant and changes are attributed to the evolution in their frequency of occurrence these important features were also apparent in our results which confirms that they are key aspects for showing how wave energy potential has evolved in the bay of biscay in recent decades our classification approach here made it possible to estimate the evolution of the wave energy flux during the 1979 2019 period and the electric power that would have been generated by the second turbine in mutriku over the same period the joint analysis of the evolution of both variables for that period indicates that the small changes detected in the wave trends near mutriku have not involved significant changes in the electricity production this result can be explained by two factors 1 the rather small trends in waves for the period 1979 2019 have been calculated at the nearest era5 grid point 22 km off the mutriku wave farm mutriku is a breakwater wave farm located on the shoreline and probably as can be deduced from the general behaviour of waves in the bay of biscay fig 3 the trends in the waves actually reaching mutriku s air chambers are even less marked 2 the regulation and control of the wells turbines in mutriku are based on different adaptive models based on the instantaneous values of each generator s torque as input variable and have been amply reported in the literature faÿ et al 2020a amundarain et al 2012 amundarain et al 2010 lekube et al 2018a lekube et al 2018b a secondary regulatory element includes a butterfly valve located in the duct connecting the air chamber and the wells turbine depending on the energy of the incoming waves and in order to regulate the incoming flow from the air chamber this butterfly valve may close totally or partially but its response is not instantaneous see appendix c although turbine control is implemented instantaneously a graphical representation of the wef and t02pow on the same daily scale used here can describe how the regulation system acts to dampen the energy from incoming waves fig 4 a shows that as the wef increases to 45 kw m the generated power increases linearly to a peak value of around 8 5 kw wef values above 45 kw m do not lead to t02pow above values 8 5 kw as the regulation mechanisms tend to dampen the increase in wave energy flux the sea state types obtained in this study are also aligned according to this general behaviour see fig 4 b table 1 shows that the changes in wef are concentrated in three sea state types 3 7 and 9 positive trends in sea state type 3 and negative trends in 9 increase the wave energy flux positive trends in the occurrence of sea state type 7 reduce the average wave energy flux the combined trends for the 1979 2019 period have meant a positive trend of 0 146 kw m per decade for wef and no trend for t02pow other effects gathered in the literature such as the sea level rise at regional caballero et al 2008 gonzález et al 2013 and global scale kulp and strauss 2019 do not seem to have any impact on mutriku s electricity production in order to estimate the conditions conducive to changes in the electric power generated a number of synthetic time series for the 1979 2019 period were built increasing decreasing the decadal trends in the frequency of occurrence of sea state types 3 7 and 9 the results indicate that at least a joint decadal increase of 2 in sea state type 3 and a corresponding decrease of 2 in 9 would be needed to generate a small but significant increase for t02pow of 0 05 kw decade this would be associated with an overall positive trend of wef of 0 321 kw m per decade such a sharp increase in wef can only be found in the central area of the bay of biscay fig 3 and would represent a growing trend more than twice as strong as that observed near mutriku as stated in the first section of this paper the focus of our study was to identify the number of sea state types needed to reproduce the observed electric power generated at mutriku rather than to classify waves into clusters with a purely oceanic significance according to this approach the profile of the ten sea state types for the 1979 2019 period remained constant and the increasing energy flux observed in the waves near mutriku can be attributed to minor albeit significant changes in the frequency of occurrence of some sea state types the result is a small positive wef trend mainly affecting its meridional component and resulting in a northward reorientation of the incoming direction the reasons for this increase are beyond the scope of this work but some complementary results such as the steady or even declining trends detected for wind speed in many areas of the bay of biscay see appendix d suggest that the growing wef trend observed may be due to an increase in the swell component of waves a recent study for the north atlantic has used satellite data to confirm the absence of significant changes in wind speed trends in this area young and ribal 2019 besides it is to be noted atmospheric data shows significant amounts of variability at different time scales beyond the ones corresponding to the obvious regular cycles daily or seasonal since waves are driven by wind these atmospheric oscillations also have an impact on ocean waves in extratropical regions such as the one covered in this paper it is known that some of this variability is associated to the development and decay of synoptic perturbations although variability at longer time scales still exists blackmon 1976 the variability associated to time scales longer than 10 days is commonly referred to as teleconnection patterns since it is usually apparent in robust correlations between points located far away in the northern hemisphere wallace and gutzler 1981 these results have been corroborated by means of rotated principal component analysis barnston and livezey 1987 which is the technique currently commonly used to identify the teleconnection indices over the northern hemisphere among the northern hemisphere teleconnection patterns is to be mentioned the north atlantic oscillation nao which is known to affect synoptic activity over the study area rogers 1997 and is one of the major drivers of climate variations over the european sector hurrell 1995 hurrel and van loon 1997 a second teleconnection pattern also relevant for this study is the east atlantic ea index an important player in the area the ea affects the intensity of advections of southern origin over the area acting according to a different mechanism of action if compared with the nao sáenz et al 2001 the wave changes observed in the previous studies commented above on the bay of biscay le cozannet et al 2011 abadie et al 2006 butel et al 2002 charles et al 2012 seem to be driven by changes precisely in the nao and ea indexes and are reported to concentrate on the swell component a more general study for the whole northern hemisphere has also pointed out the relevance that nao and ea indexes have at explaining the long term changes in wave energy reguero et al 2015 in the same study authors also suggest that these trends are far less important for coastal wave farms than those driven by annual seasonality this statement is particularly relevant for mutriku where the strong seasonal pattern observed means that electric power generation in winter is roughly four times higher than in summer ibarra berastegi et al 2018 fig 2 b if analysed at a monthly scale the oscillations are even more intense reaching a proportion of 1 10 between the maximum and minimum values fig 5 as a conclusion despite some minor differences our results above on the evolution of waves are in agreement with those previous studies for the bay of biscay carried out using other classification methods and applied to different databases periods areas and physical models no significant trend was detected in the electric power generated in the second turbine at mutriku whereby it may be concluded that the overall electricity generated at mutriku wave farm would also have remained constant during the 1979 2019 period if the same set of control operational and management protocols had been applied however these protocols may vary over the years and furthermore mutriku occasionally acts as a test facility for different types of wave energy converters that need to be trialled under real operating conditions faÿ et al 2020a faÿ et al 2020b rusu and onea 2016 a prior paper ibarra berastegi et al 2018 has shown that an an average of 10 wells turbines were working under the regulation and maintenance protocols in place over the 2014 2016 period without any additional device being tested for these conditions the annual average electricity sold to the grid was 246468 7 kwh under similar steady conditions the wave farm would have generated a total amount of 10 1 gwh over the 41 years of the 1979 2019 period assuming an average emission factor for the spanish electric mix of 0 3 kg of co2 kwh european environment agency 2018 carbon footprint ltd 2019 idae 2011 ministry for ecological transition 2020 if the mutriku wave farm had been working since 1979 the emission of 3032 tons of co2 would have been avoided mutriku is the only wave farm continuously generating electricity and may also continue contributing in the future to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions the technology readiness level trl is an indicator ranging from 1 to 9 to indicate how mature a technological development is heder 2017 1 corresponds to a basic or initial level while 9 represents a fully commercial and operational level it is important to mention that although wave energy is at a trl stage of 7 mutriku is the only facility that has already reached a trl of 8 strategic research and innovation agenda for ocean energy 2020 a deeper understanding of the impact of long term changes in a fully operational wave farm may therefore help in selecting locations rusu and onea 2013 2019a 2019b rusu and guedes soares 2012 for different wecs in a dynamic context of constantly evolving wave climate 5 conclusions and future outlook mutriku is the only wave farm in the world continuously generating electricity since 2011 era5 data reveal a generally positive trend in the bay of biscay s wave climate over the 1979 2019 period operational data from mutriku were used to fit an optimal som and classify observational wave data into ten major sea state types defined on a daily scale these types were defined from an energy generation perspective and not from a purely oceanic point of view this allowed reconstructing the hypothetical electric power that would have been generated by the mutriku wave farm had it been operational over the entire 1979 2019 period although the wave climate presents an increasing trend in wave power the results indicate that this trend would not have meant an increase in electricity production be cause mutriku s owc turbines dampen the effect of the observed positive trends in wave energy it may therefore be concluded that moderate long term changes in wave energy may not have a direct impact on the electricity generated at owc wave farms it may be inferred that in the context of climate change economic and feasibility studies for prospective wave farms can be conducted with a high degree of reliability as future uncertainties in the resource itself are not to have a significant impact on the electric yield during the facility s life cycle a new climate change law is set to be enacted in spain in the coming months and 70 of the power generated in the country is expected to be renewable by 2030 similarly the european green deal 2020 provides a roadmap with actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reach a climate neutral eu by 2050 renewable energies will therefore play an important role although the optimistic projections for wave energy made only a few years ago magagna and uihlein 2015 oecd 2016 have now been moderated zappa et al 2019 within the context of these general plans towards a greener economy and after nine years operat ing safely a wave farm like mutriku is a facility that can provide a regular and predictable horizon of electricity production the authors are currently conducting further research to estimate future wave climate trends in the bay of biscay cmip5 wave projections using the saw model have recently been released by the ecmwf copernicus cmip5 dataset 2020 for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios csiro commonwealth scientific a 2020 has also published 21st century wave projections for the same scenarios derived from 10 cmip5 models morim et al 2020 csiro cmip5 2020 likewise cmip6 projections are likely to have been fully disclosed by the end of 2021 these projections will provide estimations of the future wave climate in the bay of biscay which will be used to feed the som obtained here and obtain estimations of future electricity generation at mutriku these results can help to better define the role that wave farms and particularly owc technology can play in meeting the objective of a climate neutral energy generation system credit authorship contribution statement gabriel ibarra berastegi

mode and finally selected under the condition that the observed electric power generated in the test dataset could be succesfully reproduced in the absence of previous examples of som applications for similar purposes a classical approach kohonen 1982 1991 was implemented to fit the appropriate som leading to the identification and characterization of the optimum number of sea states however it is to be noted that although not necessary for our study further developments in the implementation of self organizing maps like the two steps som tsom may be needed in the future to address more complex challenges like the identification of wave extremes barbariol et al 2016 here each daily sea state has been defined in an 18 dimension hyperspace constituted by the standardized era5 values at the nearest grid point every 4 h corresponding to wef u wef v and t p that is on a given day the hourly values at 00 h 04 h 08 h 12 h 16 h 20 h of the zonal and meridional wave energy flux and the peak wave period constitute an 18 dimensional hyperspace a particular day s sea state can be seen as a point in it and the final som had a 2x5 architecture this optimal som was fitted after 10 000 iterations starting from random values see fig a1a as the input variables have different operating ranges and units they are standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 the fitting process progresses until a minimum value of the average distance is reached in our case of 0 012 fig a1b shows the number of cases belonging to the training database mapped onto the different nodes with the final 2 5 som in a som the neighbour nodes in the layout are the ones expected to be more similar to a given node in other words neighbouring units hold cases that in the original hyperspace are expected to be closer to each other than to cases belonging to non neighbouring nodes the average distance between each unit and their neighbouring nodes in the 2x5 lattice indicates how different each sea state type can be from the nearest most similar types a graphical representation of this can be seen in fig a2a indicating that the nodes sea state types 1 2 and 3 are the ones with the highest distances thus reinforcing the notion of representing extreme highly energetic cases with a low frequency as shown in table 1 in the main text as mentioned in the paper the input space has 18

20894,nile river is considered as an auspicious area in particular along with upper egypt to produce electrical energy from the water current which called hydrokinetic energy this sort of renewable energy is admitted deeply as a unique and uncommon solution for the electric power demand in the remote areas on the rivers sides the hydrokinetic energy of the river stream can be extracted by a submerged vertical axis turbine due to its specific advantages the main objective of this work is to investigate experimentally the performance of two different savonius rotor profiles inside an irrigation canal in toshka aswan egypt furthermore the rotor with the optimum performance is investigated numerically by adding two shielding plates to further enhancements the results indicate that the rotor with better fullness has better operating characteristics with a power coefficient 0 1285 at a tip speed ratio of 0 61 that is higher than the other rotor profile by 12 moreover the two shielding plates increased the net average power coefficient at a tip speed ratio at 0 7 for the optimum rotor profile by 84 compared with the conventional design keywords river current vertical axis turbine hydrokinetic energy cfd 1 introduction 1 1 hydrokinetic energy the extracted energy from the river stream is a pivotal source of renewable energy the vertical axis turbine system is a new and emerging category of renewable energy technology it is an unconventional solution in remote areas for electric power production the water stream energy conversion system is considered as the first proposed station conducted in egypt these types of power stations contribute to the development of upper egypt in many fields like agriculture tourism and industry the strategy for the wave energy and hydrokinetic energy conversion to generate electric power in egypt must be taken into consideration however this article motivates and conducting this type of renewable energy that draws attention to its use shapes of water turbines are born out from the wind turbine to with both types of vertical and horizontal axis turbines antheaume et al 2008 the high performance with high power production was introduced by a sleek linear flow of water at high speed abs alaskan inc 2010 the flow options and characteristics of any water stream had some variation seasonal and daily the installation of the hydrokinetic turbine ought to be indeed considered a positive issue of the water flow is that it s one direction flow which eliminates the necessity for rotor yawing the hydrokinetic convertor and also the level of power output are directly influenced by the water speed the situation and also the position of the hydrokinetic turbine had respect to the crosswise of the flow channel moreover it s an extremely necessary and significant factor for two essential reasons first the energy flux at the surface of the water is higher than the energy flux of the stream at the bottom of the river as expected additionally this amount takes various values looking at the space from the shore in an exceedingly sleek channel the water current is quickest in the middle however in an exceeding water stream this might vary looking on the depth of the water therefore the water speed includes a sure site specific and localized profile wherever the out their quantity of energy flux which will be obtained and made depends on the rotor location antheaume et al 2008 second the competitor within the river users of the water flow like boats fishing vessels bridges etc and these may cut back the potency and effectiveness of the useable space for a turbine installation abs alaskan inc 2010 additionally alternative varieties of suspended and hanged particles and materials like rock fish etc within the water stream might even be variable khan et al 1823 the statistical data of the water speed vs the space behind the aswan dam is illustrated in fig 1 raslan and salama 2015 the info was foretold for one hundred twenty days because of the flow rate are remarkable and maximum in this period of year summer and spring days at these locations as illustrated in fig 2 the available power density javil out their power rotor space and captured power density jcap javil cp of water flow this kind of stand alone power grid may be the core of development within the rare space in the territorial division because of the simplicity of the turbine in each producing and installation this type of energy can be extracted by vertical axis turbine such as savonius turbine which is very simple in design and installation 1 2 savonius turbine principles savonius turbine is classified as a drag type vertical axis turbine it depends primarily on the difference between the drag force that generated on the concave side and the convex side of the rotor this difference in drag force creates the torque which rotates the turbine as shown in fig 3 the vertical axis turbine is used as water stream energy conversion systems and devices for near surface placement compared to the other types of the hydro turbines according to the followings subtitle aspects energy flux has a high value at the near surface of the river the effect and influence of competing users from fishing and boating are avoided footprint any trenching pilling at the bottom may become subject to environmental scrutiny low cost and high durability the manufacturing of this type especially the s shaped is available locally in egypt the power production is continuous around the year with just a small adaptation to the turbine with the water level tutar and veci 2015 investigated the impact of water depths with totally different wave boundary conditions on the performance of savonius turbine with single and turbine arrays 3 turbines with 3 numerous positions of arrays however these arrays were conducted at many distances between them the submersion depth of the turbine blade underwater line affects the rotor efficiency the submersion level was 5 0 and 5 cm with a rotor diameter of 25 cm they designed the experimental model and tested it for a particular condition of water current they reached to that the 3 blades rotor with zero level submersions had the most potency of 18 compared to 8 at 5 cm yaakob et al 2013 studied the impact of the deflectors on the savonius turbine as a hydrokinetic turbine within a duct the model had two different designs of deflectors the primary one had one deflector and therefore the second had 2 deflectors the three dimensional cfd analysis was chosen by the authors to check and investigate the power and torque coefficient the cp 0 27 in 2 deflectors compared to that equals 0 21 for one deflector this increase within the cp indicated the influence of those deflectors on the entire performance of the savonius turbine sharma et al 2014 reported the improvement of the conventional savonius hydrokinetic turbine s efficiency of 21 as a maximum by controlling its design parameters the performance and characteristics of a two stage two bladed configuration of the savonius rotor had been inspected whole experiments had been conducted in a wind tunnel which has low wind speed the studied parameters were the overlap ratio tip speed ratio power coefficient cp and torque coefficient cm the experiments showed that a maximum cp of 0 517 was obtained at 9 37 overlap condition schleicher et al 2013 investigated numerically as a 3d simulation to generate 500 watt from the water current the turbine had a captured efficiency of 0 45 at a rotor diameter of 0 5334 m with a water speed of less than 2 2 m s where zaidi et al 2013 studied the effect of the chord length of the helical blade 3d numerical simulation on the performance of the turbine grolov turbine this study was conducted and carried out by utilizing the commercial code fluent of ansys this investigation was performed by employing the shear stress transport sst k ω model they used the hydrofoil of naca 0012 with a rotor radius of 0 15 m with chord lengths 0 006 0 0983 and 0 0988 m the data output from the 3d numerical simulation showed that the maximum cp was 58 at chord length 0 0983 m hantoro et al 2018 performed experimental studies at an open channel to investigate an innovative design for the darrieus type to be a hydrokinetic turbine they compared the convention one with 3 straight blades and two designs with 6 and 9 blades sbc where the swept area was the same for all the power coefficient for the 9 blades design was 0 42 at tsr 2 91 which was the maximum could be reached for the system kumar and saini 2017 carried out an enhancement on the performance of the savonius hydrokinetic turbine using cfd analysis the simulation and calculations of the twisted savonius hydrokinetic turbine had been introduced and carried out by the commercial unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver in conjunction with a realizable k ε turbulence model it had been found that the savonius hydrokinetic turbine having a twist angle of 12 5 which produces an optimum power coefficient equals 0 39 at speed ratio equals to 0 9 with a water velocity of 2 m s ramadan et al 2018 developed a numerical model to compare conventional two blades three blades and modified s shape blade savonious rotors and investigated experimentally the performance of each rotor in the air as a working medium they found that the s shape rotor consummated the higher performance with a power coefficient of 0 28 whereas the traditional two blade and the three blade savonius rotors had the most power coefficients 0 14 and 0 1 respectively hayashi et al 2005 studied the performance of a single stage and 3 stages savonius rotor with and without guide vanes they concluded that guide vanes augmented was increased the torque coefficient within the low tip speed ratio however attenuates torque coefficient within the high tip speed ratio moreover they discovered that the three stage rotor without guide vanes increased the torque coefficient characteristics than one stage rotor with guide vanes for tip speed ratio larger than 0 8 mahmoud et al 2012 conducted experiments about the effect of some design parameters on the performance of a savonious wind turbine they found that the 2 blades rotor was efficient than 3 and 4 ones the rotor with end plates offers higher potency than those while no endplates double stage rotors have higher performance compared to single stage rotors the rotors without overlap ratio were better in operation than those with overlap the results show also that the power coefficient increases with raising the aspect ratio 1 3 work objectives and novelty from the previous survey blade profile flow speed and angular velocity of the rotor are the foremost necessary parameters that management the rotor performance in terms of power and torque coefficients the blade profile contains a direct impact on the vortices formation around the rotor which is considered as lost power from the mean flow the objectives of the article analysis are as follows investigate experimentally the influence of the blade fullness on the performance of 2 different blade profiles in an irrigation canal in aswan egypt the impact of shielding plates setup within the upstream of the rotor with the most effective performance characteristics is numerically investigated using commercial cfd package fluent to get the optimum shielding plates orientation 2 experimental set up and procedure 2 1 flow facility experimental

flow rate the average width of the canal is 90 cm and the average depth is 30 cm the length of the canal is approximately 2 km so the start and end effects of the canal may be neglected fig 4 2 2 experimental apparatus the main objective of this study is to compare two blade profiles using water as the working fluid the first blade profile is the profile obtained by kamoji et al 2008 which is

drawing for the 2 rotor profiles and illustrates the distinction between the fullness of every rotor however the test rig is shown in fig 8 consists of 2 steel sheet plates with thickness 6 mm length 80 cm and width 50 cm connected with threaded bars with 16 mm in diameter and 1 m in length blade and end plates are made from steel sheet plates with a thickness of 2 mm the two rotors have the same height rotor diameter and end plates diameter as 14 cm 20 cm and 22 cm respectively each endplate has 4 holes which connect the rotating shaft into the turbine by a flange that is welded into the end of the shaft centers of rotation of the shafts are kept in alignment with two bearings uc 204 each bearing is connected to the steel sheet plate by four bolts blockage ratio is the ratio between the model and the test section cross section areas hd hww 0 1037 10 37 moffat 1988 the average width of the canal is w 90 cm and the average depth is hw 30 cm the turbine diameter is d 20 cm and height h 14 cm this value is considered a reasonable ratio which is less than golecha et al of 15 golecha et al 2011 the rotational speed of the rotor is measured by a non contact tachometer lutron create with accuracy 0 05 a special tool is put in within the tachometer which is mounted by a clearance match into the tachometer water speed within the canal is measured by employing a flat skinny picket board that moves within the direction of water flow 1 pulley 2 nylon string 3 weighting pan 4 shaft 5 steel rods 6 savonious rotary engine 7 spring balance 8 bearing by direct contact between them moving board and the setup tool water speed is recorded within the tachometer s memory the dimension of the canal varies from 88 cm to 90 cm so that the water speed is measured in numerous positions through the canal the typical recorded water speed within the canal is 0 64125 m s torque is determined by a rope brake dynamometer the turbine is allowed to rotate freely with no load at the start of the experiment it s then loaded step by step by applying loads on the weighting pan readings of digital balance and tachometer are recorded friction is a crucial parameter that affects the measuring of the tension of the rotating turbine friction within the bearings and 1 mm inelastic fishing nylon wire wound on the rotor shaft is decreased as much as possible the seals are eliminated from the bearings and bearings are washed in gasoline to get rid of the grease and sprayed with w d forty rust remover before every reading to remove any contaminants or sludge particles which could be collected within the bearing throughout the experiment leads to the reduction of friction fig 9 kamoji et al 2008 mahmoud et al 2012 golecha et al 2011 uncertainties of 3 calculated parameters tip

ƒ 1 4 blockage ratio model frontal area test section area 0 025 the correction is taken into consideration in the results output during the test to get the final results correctly moffat 1988 3 influence of the deflector plate and obstacle plate on the turbine performance the main goal of the two guiding plates at the entrance of the turbine is the improvement of the performance of the rotor this improvement is obtained by 1 increasing the positive drag forces acting on the advancing blade by increasing the flow velocity at the entrance of this blade this will increase the positive moment of the rotor 2 decreasing the negative forces acting on the returning blade by shielding the flow from the returning blade therefore the negative moment acts in the adverse direction of rotation will decrease the optimum orientation of the two deflector plates is obtained by investigating the performance of the rotor without deflector plates at different tip speed ratios the rotor with the highest power coefficient at a specific tip speed ratio is investigated at this tip speed ratio by placing the obstacle plate only at the entrance of the returning plate cartesian coordinates of this plate as shown in fig 10 are measured from the center of rotation of the rotor the coordinate of point a and the length of the obstacle plate is fixed and this plate is rotated around point a in clockwise and counterclockwise directions to get the best angle of the obstacle θ with this position of the obstacle plate the deflector plate will be inspected by fixing point b coordinate and the length of the deflector plate and rotating the plate in clockwise and counterclockwise directions around point b to get the optimum angle of the deflector ϕ finally the rotor with the two plates positioned at their optimum orientation will be examined at different tip speed ratios to obtain the optimum operating conditions of the rotor 4 numerical analysis in the present work fluent commercial software is used as computational fluid dynamics cfd program to simulate the savonius rotor fluent ansys version 14 is a cfd software using the finite element method to solve the flow problems in or around complex geometries in the fluent program the physical properties of the flow are specified the analysis technique and the turbulence model are chosen it is found that the two dimensional analysis has acceptable accuracy so it is used to conduct the numerical analysis in a shorter time gambit is a software program which used to generate the mesh of the required domains that are exported to the fluent program for the numerical analysis quad tri pave scheme was used for mesh generation of the model this scheme specifies that the mesh is composed primarily of quadrilateral mesh elements but includes triangular corner elements at user specified the overall domain is divided into two subdomains to facilitate simulation of the rotor rotation the highest resolution subdomain contains the grid elements surrounding the rotor referred to as the rotating domain the lowest resolution subdomain is the outer domain referred to as the stationary domain as shown in figs 10 and 11 dimensions of the stationary domain and generated mesh of the rotating domain they were chosen to be quietly large to minimize the blockage effect without increasing computing time ramadan 2016 and the diameter of the rotating domain is 1 2d boundary conditions bcs define the appropriate flow properties on faces of boundaries for the chosen model therefore they are the corner stone of any simulation and it is important to specify the bcs properly many kinds of underlying bcs are employed in the present simulations i e velocity inlet pressure outlet symmetry non conformal interface and no slip condition for both stationary and moving walls as shown in fig 11 boundary conditions are defined in mesh generator then the values implemented in the solver the velocity inlet to the turbine equals 0 64 m s and the pressure outlet is equal the atmospheric pressure approximately because the turbine is not submerged in deep under the water the model is analyzed and solved using unsteady flow with a sliding mesh model smm which is a recommended model in the rotating zones the realizable k ε model with enhanced wall function is adopted the enhanced wall function method is applied to include and ensure the precise resolution of the boundaries layer predication the wall function approach needs the dimensionless distance of the first layer from the wall y to be less than 5 which is used in this paper 4 1 governing equations 4 1 1 computational fluid dynamics equations to calculate the different forces acting on the blades numerically the continuity and the momentum equations should be solved after that the instantaneous forces can be calculated on the blades to obtain the net torque and net power of the turbine under these conditions of canals water flow in the present study the realizable k ε model was used as model to solve these equations the standard k ε model is improved by using variable c μ value for computing the turbulent viscosity instead of the constant value in the realizable k

constants used in this research are shown in table 2 4 1 2 performance parameters the torque and the power outputs are the main parameters which are introduce the quality of turbine design however these parameters should be in dimensionless form to illuminate the effect of dimensions therefore the torque and power coefficients are generated as in equations 15 and 17 to as a base in the judgment of the different design performance these two parameters have an influence on the performance of any turbine the torque coefficient cm and the power coefficient cp that is written as follows 15 c m t 0 5 ρ v 2 a r t is the average aerodynamic torque acting on the rotor shaft and may be calculated from the following relation 16 t m s r s h a f t r r o p e g 1000 where m is the load s is spring balance load rshaft is the radius of the shaft rrope is the radius of the nylon string ρ is the density of the water v is the approaching water speed a is the frontal area of the turbine and finally r

experimental investigation is performed at constant reynolds number 1 105 based on the approaching water speed v with kinematic viscosity υ and d is the blade diameter 20 re d v υ the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations pressure velocity coupling method is used in all simulations a second order up flow spatial discretization scheme is used for the equations of momentum turbulent kinetic energy pressure and turbulent dissipation rate and a least squares cell based scheme is used for the gradients ansys 2011 the analysis is performed using a turbine diameter of 0 2 m and re 1 105 the height of the turbine is taken 0 14 m in the transverse direction of the turbine the value of the torque coefficient at every time step is integrated over the projected area of the rotor which may be expressed in the form 21 a d h this value is averaged overflow time every torque coefficient is multiplied by a tip speed ratio to get the power coefficient at every tip speed ratio 5 results and discussion 5 1 numerical results a numerical analysis is conducted for rotor 1 and 2 to detect the best design for experimental and site tests table 3 illustrates the effect of a number of cells on the performance of the rotor at a tip speed equals 0 7 based on the torque coefficient the number of cells ranged from 50 000 to 147 000 the torque coefficient is getting stable and constant after 130 000 cells and whatever the increase in several cells moreover the time step size is considered as in el baz et al 2016 every simulation takes ten cycles to allow for convergence state this convergence can be seen after 6 cycles and the result can be taken from 6th to 10th as shown in fig 12 the convergence criterion is determined by neglecting all residuals which are below 10 5 fig 13 shows the adopted time step size it was equivalent to 0 5 degree of turbine rotation this corresponds to time step 0 002 s reducing the time step size to be equivalent to 0 1 was found to produce 1 deviation of the average moment coefficient of the rotor compared to 0 5 as shown in fig 14 the torque coefficient is obtained from cfd analysis that calculates the net torque from the drag force difference between the concave side and the convex side the torque coefficient value changes with flow time so that for every tip speed ratio performance analysis is done to get the value of the torque coefficient after 5 s the instantaneous torque coefficient will be similar for every cycle as shown in fig 14 5 1 1 model validation the numerical model is validated by comparing the obtained experimental results from golecha and et al rotor 1 golecha et al 2011 with the results obtained from the numerical model with the above configuration for kamoji and et al blade rotor 1 kamoji et al 2008 fig 15 shows the variation of torque coefficient with tip speed ratio for numerical investigation which seems to be in good agreement with the experimental research the maximum error value is 10 and the average error value is 4 8 marlap 5 1 2 rotor performance characteristics figs 16 19 show the pressure contours and velocity contours of the flow around rotor 1 and rotor 2 respectively as shown in figs 16 e and 17 e for rotor 1 the pressure in the downstream decreased to minimum value 2 38 pa at the tip of the upper half of the turbine it is then increased to 0 9 pa before the center and decreased again to 1 1 pa at the center on the other side the downstream pressure of rotor 2 reached minimum value 2 59 pa at the tip of the upper half of the turbine and increased to constant value 0 96 pa with little decrease near the tip of the lower half of the turbine moreover the deceleration effect of the convex side of rotor 1 appears in the pressure contours of the upstream high pressure region is formed at the upstream of the turbine 0 7 pa and this region acts as a brake on the turbine velocity contours of the flow around rotor 1 and rotor 2 are shown in figs 18 f and 19 e the intensity of vortices at the downstream of rotor 1 dark blue areas with velocity 0 00228 m s is higher than the intensity at the downstream of rotor 2 velocity 0 013 which represents more flow energy lost from rotor 1 due to the larger amount of trapped water at the downstream of the turbine fig 20 shows power coefficient variation with rotor angle of rotation at the last revolution for rotor 1 and rotor 2 at tip speed ratio 0 63 and 0 6 respectively this tip speed ratio represents the maximum value of power coefficient for the two rotors as shown in the figure the minimum value of power coefficient at an angle 180 for the two rotors so that performance analysis will be introduced at this position to show the effect of negative torque on the performance of the turbine figs 21 and 22 show total pressure distribution static and dynamic pressures along the upstream and downstream of rotor 1 and rotor 2 diameters respectively as shown in the figures the difference between the total upstream pressure and total downstream pressure represents the harnessed power by the turbine and the area between the lines represents the total pressure difference which converted into mechanical power by the turbine by subtraction the total downstream pressure from the total upstream pressure for the two rotor profiles total pressure difference distribution along blade diameter may be plotted for each turbine as shown in fig 23 the pressure difference along rotor 2 is more uniform than the pressure difference along rotor 1 on the other hand the back pressure effect on the lower tip of rotor 2 may be noticed in fig 23 this back pressure may be considered as more extracted power from the flow because it affects in the direction of the positive torque of the turbine and this increases the net averaged torque from the turbine and this is an additional advantage of rotor 2 the effect of pressure distribution on the performance of the turbine is illustrated in power and torque coefficients for each rotor at different tip speed ratios as shown in fig 24 it is obvious that a torque performance characteristic of rotor 2 is higher than that of rotor 1 and this increase in torque coefficient of rotor 2 leads to the increase of power coefficient of rotor 2 as shown in fig 25 the maximum power coefficient of rotor 2 is 0 15 at tip speed ratio 0 6 and for rotor 1 is 0 137 at a tip speed ratio 0 63 with 10 percent increase of power coefficient the increase in power coefficient resulted from the effective action of pressure difference distribution on the more uniform area of the blade profile which is appeared in more power extraction from the water flow and increased power coefficient and torque coefficient based on the previous results rotor 2 showed better performance characteristics than rotor 1 moreover numerical model showed the importance of pressure difference distribution on rotor performance and how it increases power coefficient by decreasing vortices formation around the rotor 5 2 experimental results according to the previous section of simulation an experimental investigation is performed to compare the two different blade profiles for verifying and insure from the simulation output experiments are performed inlined irrigation canal at constant reynolds number 1 105 the torque coefficient and power coefficient of the two rotor profiles are plotted versus tip speed ratio as shown in figs 26 and 27 the maximum power coefficient of rotor 2 is 0 1285 at a tip speed ratio 0 61 and the maximum power coefficient of rotor 1 is 0 1157 at a tip speed ratio 0 62 with a relative increase of power coefficient rotor 2 by nearly 12 to simplify these results assume the two blades are fixed in the water stream as shown in fig 28 and every blade is opened in the concave side in the transverse direction of the blade in the furthest point from the diameter in the blade therefore the flow will pass freely in the bucket the effect of acceleration inside the bucket is illustrated by applying continuity equation between two planes the first plane at the inlet of the concave side of the blade and the second plane at the last plane before the exit from the concave side 22 a 1 v 1 a 2 v 2 x 1 h v 1 x 2 h v 2 where h is the height of the turbine in the transverse direction x 1 represents the width of the concave side at the inlet which is the bucket diameter and will be constant for the two blades v1 represents the velocity inlet into the concave side and may be considered the same for the two blades if the deceleration effect of the convex side is considered the same for the two blades x2 is the width of the concave side at the last plane before the exit from the bucket this value will be 0 45 times of bucket diameter d for rotor 2 and 0 52 times of bucket diameter for rotor 1 the exit velocity from the concave side will be expressed in the form v 2 v 1 x 1 x 2 v d 0 45 d 2 22 v for rotor 2 v d 0 52 d 1 92 v for rotor 1 the second effect is shifting planes of torque action from the center of rotation if the drag force in the concave side works in parallel planes the first plane is the plane crosses the diameter of the bucket and the drag force is summited in each plane to act in the center of each plane the action line of drag force in the first plane is the center of the bucket diameter for the two blades at a distance 0 5 d from the center of rotation and the action line of drag force in the second plane which is the same plane studied in the continuity equation for rotor 1 is 0 5 d from the center of rotation and for rotor 2 is 0 75 d from the center of rotation the overlapped effect of these two parameters may be illustrated in the momentum equation between the inlet and exit from the concave side assume the mass flow rate passes in the two buckets is the same the momentum equation may be expressed in the form 23 t m r 2 v 2 r 1 v 1 m 0 75 d 2 22 v 0 5 d v 1 165 m v d for rotor 2 m 0 5 d 1 92 v 0 5 d v 0 46 m v d for rotor 1 the increase in the obtained torque may be expressed in the form 24 t r o t o r 2 t r o t o r 1 1 165 m v d 0 46 m v d 2 53 this result shows the effect of blade fullness on the performance of the savonious rotor in actual this value will be smaller due to the effect of rotation and turbulence and the net average torque is the difference between the drag force acting on the concave side and the convex side which may be illustrated as follows 25 c m 2 c m 1 c p 2 λ 2 c p 1 λ 1 1 13 5 3 effect of shielding plates on the performance of the rotor 2 from the obtained experimental results rotor 2 has higher performance characteristics than rotor 1 this is the kick off point to find a way to maximums the power coefficient using a deflector in front of the turbine mohamed et al mohamed 2011 investigated the effect the two of shielding plates in the upstream of the modified savonius rotor in the air as the working fluid he obtained the following coordinates of the shielding plates which are shown in fig 10 for optimum performance xd1 d 0 41882 yd1 d 1 24505 xd2 d 0 3433 yd2 d 2 29074 xo1 d 1 2828 yo1 d 0 4037 xo2 d 1 27654 yo2 d 1 16339 length of deflector plate l d d 1 048 length of obstacle plate l o d 0 7597 the main goal of the two guiding plates at the entrance of the turbine is the improvement of performance of the rotor this improvement is obtained by increasing the positive drag forces acting on the advancing blade by increasing the flow velocity at the entrance of this blade which increases the positive moment of the rotor decreasing the negative forces acting on the returning blade by shielding the flow from the returning blade so the negative moment acts in the adverse direction of rotation will decrease in this part rotor 2 with deflectors is inspected in water as working fluid with the same procedure explained in section 4 figs 29 and 30 show pressure distribution along the upstream and downstream of the rotor without deflectors and rotor with deflectors respectively as shown in the figures the difference between the upstream pressure and downstream pressure represents the harnessed power by the turbine and the area between the lines represents the pressure difference which is converted into mechanical power by the turbine as shown in the two cases the fluctuation of the upstream pressure at the lower half of the turbine and the downstream pressure at the upper half of the turbine may be noticed this fluctuation for the rotor with deflectors is less than that of the rotor without deflectors moreover the downstream pressure at the upper half of the turbine with deflectors is more uniform than the turbine without deflectors this is due to the flow concentration effect of the two deflector plates at the entrance of the turbine however the back pressure effect on the lower tip of the two cases may be noticed in figs 29 and 30 this back pressure may be considered as more extracted power from the flow because it affects in the direction of the positive torque of the turbine and this increases the net averaged torque from the turbine and this is an additional advantage of rotor 2 on the other hand the backpressure effect on the lower tip of the two cases may be noticed in figs 29 and 30 this back pressure may be considered as lost power because it affects the adverse direction of the mean flow and this minimizes the net averaged torque from the turbine in addition it is found that the magnitude of the angle θ is 100 in a clockwise direction and for angle ϕ is 50 in a counterclockwise direction measured from the vertical axis for the optimum orientation of the two deflector plates fig 31 figs 32 35 show velocity contours and pressure contours for rotor 2 with and without the two shielding plates at the entrance of the rotor as shown in figs 32 and 33 the velocity distribution is more uniform in the upstream of the rotor with guiding plates than the rotor without guiding plates this is coming from increasing the flow intensity by guiding the flow with the plates as shown in figs 34 and 35 the pressure distribution in the downstream of the rotor with two guiding plates is more uniform than the rotor without guiding plates and this resulted in the uniform pressure difference distribution along the blade diameter shown in figs 29 and 30 uniform pressure difference distribution on the upstream and the downstream of the turbine with the deflector plates may be considered as the reason of the increase of performance of the rotor this uniform pressure difference permitted better momentum exchange between the rotor and water flow without attenuations of pressure difference effect on the rotor due to reduction of vortices formation around the rotor moreover the rotor with deflectors can operate on larger velocities range near the best efficiency point and this gives an important feature to operate the turbine at different angular speeds without great reduction in efficiency fig 36 shows the variation of the torque coefficient of the turbine with and without shielding plates and compared with golecha et al 2011 and ramadan et al 2020 with the tip speed ratio it is obvious that a torque performance characteristic of the turbine with two deflectors is higher than that of the turbine without deflectors the power coefficient also compared with same work of ramadan et al and golecha et al 2011 ramadan et al 2020 for the variation with the tip speed ratio is shown in fig 37 the maximum power coefficient of the turbine without deflectors is 0 13 at a tip speed ratio of 0 6 and for the turbine with two deflectors is 0 24 at a tip speed ratio at 0 7 with 84 percent increase of power coefficient than without deflector this is due to the uniform pressure distribution on the upstream and the downstream of the turbine with the deflector plates table 4 is summarizing the data out from figs 36 and 37 6 conclusion the current paper investigates experimentally and numerically two different savonius rotor profiles inline irrigation canal in toshka aswan egypt and the performance of conducting shield plates the results indicate the following experimentally the maximum power coefficient of rotor 2 is 0 1285 at a tip speed ratio 0 61 and the maximum power coefficient of rotor 1 is 0 1157 at a tip speed ratio 0 62 with a relative increase of power coefficient rotor 2 by nearly 12 numerically the maximum power coefficient of the turbine without deflectors is 0 13 at a tip speed ratio of 0 6 the velocity distribution is enhanced more by the uniform in the upstream of the rotor with guiding plates than the rotor without guiding plates and lead to increasing the flow intensity the rotor with deflectors can operate on larger velocities range near the best efficiency point and this gives an important feature to operate the turbine at different angular speeds without great reduction in efficiency it is found that the obstacle angle θ is 100 in a clockwise direction and for deflector angle ϕ is 50 in a counterclockwise direction measured from the vertical axis for the optimum orientation of the two deflector plates the performance is enhanced for the turbine with two deflectors to be 0 24 at a tip speed ratio at 0 7 with 84 percent increase of power coefficient than without deflector these

20894,nile river is considered as an auspicious area in particular along with upper egypt to produce electrical energy from the water current which called hydrokinetic energy this sort of renewable energy is admitted deeply as a unique and uncommon solution for the electric power demand in the remote areas on the rivers sides the hydrokinetic energy of the river stream can be extracted by a submerged vertical axis turbine due to its specific advantages the main objective of this work is to investigate experimentally the performance of two different savonius rotor profiles inside an irrigation canal in toshka aswan egypt furthermore the rotor with the optimum performance is investigated numerically by adding two shielding plates to further enhancements the results indicate that the rotor with better fullness has better operating characteristics with a power coefficient 0 1285 at a tip speed ratio of 0 61 that is higher than the other rotor profile by 12 moreover the two shielding plates increased the net average power coefficient at a tip speed ratio at 0 7 for the optimum rotor profile by 84 compared with the conventional design keywords river current vertical axis turbine hydrokinetic energy cfd 1 introduction 1 1 hydrokinetic energy the extracted energy from the river stream is a pivotal source of renewable energy the vertical axis turbine system is a new and emerging category of renewable energy technology it is an unconventional solution in remote areas for electric power production the water stream energy conversion system is considered as the first proposed station conducted in egypt these types of power stations contribute to the development of upper egypt in many fields like agriculture tourism and industry the strategy for the wave energy and hydrokinetic energy conversion to generate electric power in egypt must be taken into consideration however this article motivates and conducting this type of renewable energy that draws attention to its use shapes of water turbines are born out from the wind turbine to with both types of vertical and horizontal axis turbines antheaume et al 2008 the high performance with high power production was introduced by a sleek linear flow of water at high speed abs alaskan inc 2010 the flow options and characteristics of any water stream had some variation seasonal and daily the installation of the hydrokinetic turbine ought to be indeed considered a positive issue of the water flow is that it s one direction flow which eliminates the necessity for rotor yawing the hydrokinetic convertor and also the level of power output are directly influenced by the water speed the situation and also the position of the hydrokinetic turbine had respect to the crosswise of the flow channel moreover it s an extremely necessary and significant factor for two essential reasons first the energy flux at the surface of the water is higher than the energy flux of the stream at the bottom of the river as expected additionally this amount takes various values looking at the space from the shore in an exceedingly sleek channel the water current is quickest in the middle however in an exceeding water stream this might vary looking on the depth of the water therefore the water speed includes a sure site specific and localized profile wherever the out their quantity of energy flux which will be obtained and made depends on the rotor location antheaume et al 2008 second the competitor within the river users of the water flow like boats fishing vessels bridges etc and these may cut back the potency and effectiveness of the useable space for a turbine installation abs alaskan inc 2010 additionally alternative varieties of suspended and hanged particles and materials like rock fish etc within the water stream might even be variable khan et al 1823 the statistical data of the water speed vs the space behind the aswan dam is illustrated in fig 1 raslan and salama 2015 the info was foretold for one hundred twenty days because of the flow rate are remarkable and maximum in this period of year summer and spring days at these locations as illustrated in fig 2 the available power density javil out their power rotor space and captured power density jcap javil cp of water flow this kind of stand alone power grid may be the core of development within the rare space in the territorial division because of the simplicity of the turbine in each producing and installation this type of energy can be extracted by vertical axis turbine such as savonius turbine which is very simple in design and installation 1 2 savonius turbine principles savonius turbine is classified as a drag type vertical axis turbine it depends primarily on the difference between the drag force that generated on the concave side and the convex side of the rotor this difference in drag force creates the torque which rotates the turbine as shown in fig 3 the vertical axis turbine is used as water stream energy conversion systems and devices for near surface placement compared to the other types of the hydro turbines according to the followings subtitle aspects energy flux has a high value at the near surface of the river the effect and influence of competing users from fishing and boating are avoided footprint any trenching pilling at the bottom may become subject to environmental scrutiny low cost and high durability the manufacturing of this type especially the s shaped is available locally in egypt the power production is continuous around the year with just a small adaptation to the turbine with the water level tutar and veci 2015 investigated the impact of water depths with totally different wave boundary conditions on the performance of savonius turbine with single and turbine arrays 3 turbines with 3 numerous positions of arrays however these arrays were conducted at many distances between them the submersion depth of the turbine blade underwater line affects the rotor efficiency the submersion level was 5 0 and 5 cm with a rotor diameter of 25 cm they designed the experimental model and tested it for a particular condition of water current they reached to that the 3 blades rotor with zero level submersions had the most potency of 18 compared to 8 at 5 cm yaakob et al 2013 studied the impact of the deflectors on the savonius turbine as a hydrokinetic turbine within a duct the model had two different designs of deflectors the primary one had one deflector and therefore the second had 2 deflectors the three dimensional cfd analysis was chosen by the authors to check and investigate the power and torque coefficient the cp 0 27 in 2 deflectors compared to that equals 0 21 for one deflector this increase within the cp indicated the influence of those deflectors on the entire performance of the savonius turbine sharma et al 2014 reported the improvement of the conventional savonius hydrokinetic turbine s efficiency of 21 as a maximum by controlling its design parameters the performance and characteristics of a two stage two bladed configuration of the savonius rotor had been inspected whole experiments had been conducted in a wind tunnel which has low wind speed the studied parameters were the overlap ratio tip speed ratio power coefficient cp and torque coefficient cm the experiments showed that a maximum cp of 0 517 was obtained at 9 37 overlap condition schleicher et al 2013 investigated numerically as a 3d simulation to generate 500 watt from the water current the turbine had a captured efficiency of 0 45 at a rotor diameter of 0 5334 m with a water speed of less than 2 2 m s where zaidi et al 2013 studied the effect of the chord length of the helical blade 3d numerical simulation on the performance of the turbine grolov turbine this study was conducted and carried out by utilizing the commercial code fluent of ansys this investigation was performed by employing the shear stress transport sst k ω model they used the hydrofoil of naca 0012 with a rotor radius of 0 15 m with chord lengths 0 006 0 0983 and 0 0988 m the data output from the 3d numerical simulation showed that the maximum cp was 58 at chord length 0 0983 m hantoro et al 2018 performed experimental studies at an open channel to investigate an innovative design for the darrieus type to be a hydrokinetic turbine they compared the convention one with 3 straight blades and two designs with 6 and 9 blades sbc where the swept area was the same for all the power coefficient for the 9 blades design was 0 42 at tsr 2 91 which was the maximum could be reached for the system kumar and saini 2017 carried out an enhancement on the performance of the savonius hydrokinetic turbine using cfd analysis the simulation and calculations of the twisted savonius hydrokinetic turbine had been introduced and carried out by the commercial unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver in conjunction with a realizable k ε turbulence model it had been found that the savonius hydrokinetic turbine having a twist angle of 12 5 which produces an optimum power coefficient equals 0 39 at speed ratio equals to 0 9 with a water velocity of 2 m s ramadan et al 2018 developed a numerical model to compare conventional two blades three blades and modified s shape blade savonious rotors and investigated experimentally the performance of each rotor in the air as a working medium they found that the s shape rotor consummated the higher performance with a power coefficient of 0 28 whereas the traditional two blade and the three blade savonius rotors had the most power coefficients 0 14 and 0 1 respectively hayashi et al 2005 studied the performance of a single stage and 3 stages savonius rotor with and without guide vanes they concluded that guide vanes augmented was increased the torque coefficient within the low tip speed ratio however attenuates torque coefficient within the high tip speed ratio moreover they discovered that the three stage rotor without guide vanes increased the torque coefficient characteristics than one stage rotor with guide vanes for tip speed ratio larger than 0 8 mahmoud et al 2012 conducted experiments about the effect of some design parameters on the performance of a savonious wind turbine they found that the 2 blades rotor was efficient than 3 and 4 ones the rotor with end plates offers higher potency than those while no endplates double stage rotors have higher performance compared to single stage rotors the rotors without overlap ratio were better in operation than those with overlap the results show also that the power coefficient increases with raising the aspect ratio 1 3 work objectives and novelty from the previous survey blade profile flow speed and angular velocity of the rotor are the foremost necessary parameters that management the rotor performance in terms of power and torque coefficients the blade profile contains a direct impact on the vortices formation around the rotor which is considered as lost power from the mean flow the objectives of the article analysis are as follows investigate experimentally the influence of the blade fullness on the performance of 2 different blade profiles in an irrigation canal in aswan egypt the impact of shielding plates setup within the upstream of the rotor with the most effective performance

flow rate the average width of the canal is 90 cm and the average depth is 30 cm the length of the canal is approximately 2 km so the start and end effects of the canal may be neglected fig 4 2 2 experimental apparatus the main objective of this study is to compare two blade profiles using water as the working fluid the first blade profile is the profile obtained by kamoji et al 2008 which is

drawing for the 2 rotor profiles and illustrates the distinction between the fullness of every rotor however the test rig is shown in fig 8 consists of 2 steel sheet plates with thickness 6 mm length 80 cm and width 50 cm connected with threaded bars with 16 mm in diameter and 1 m in length blade and end plates are made from steel sheet plates with a thickness of 2 mm the two rotors have the same height rotor diameter and end plates diameter as 14 cm 20 cm and 22 cm respectively each endplate has 4 holes which connect the rotating shaft into the turbine by a flange that is welded into the end of the shaft centers of rotation of the shafts are kept in alignment with two bearings uc 204 each bearing is connected to the steel sheet plate by four bolts blockage ratio is the ratio between the

board and the setup tool water speed is recorded within the tachometer s memory the dimension of the canal varies from 88 cm to 90 cm so that the water speed is measured in numerous positions through the canal the typical recorded water speed within the canal is 0 64125 m s torque is determined by a rope brake dynamometer the turbine is allowed to rotate freely with no load at the start of the experiment it s then loaded step by step by applying loads on the weighting pan readings of digital balance and tachometer are recorded friction is a crucial parameter that affects the measuring of the tension of the rotating turbine friction within the bearings and 1 mm inelastic fishing nylon wire wound on the rotor shaft is decreased as much as possible the seals are eliminated from the bearings and bearings are washed in gasoline to get rid of the grease and sprayed with w d forty rust remover before every reading to remove any contaminants or sludge particles which could be collected within the bearing throughout the experiment leads to the reduction of friction fig 9 kamoji et al 2008 mahmoud et al 2012 golecha et al 2011 uncertainties of 3 calculated parameters tip

ƒ 1 4 blockage ratio model frontal area test section area 0 025 the correction is taken into consideration in the results output during the test to get the final results correctly moffat 1988 3 influence of the deflector plate and obstacle plate on the turbine performance the main goal of the two guiding plates at the entrance of the turbine is the improvement of the performance of the rotor this improvement is obtained by 1 increasing the positive drag forces acting on the advancing blade by increasing the flow velocity at the entrance of this blade this will increase the positive moment of the rotor 2 decreasing the negative forces acting on the returning blade by shielding the flow from the returning blade therefore the negative moment acts in the adverse direction of rotation will decrease the optimum orientation of the two deflector plates is obtained by investigating the performance of the rotor without deflector plates at different tip speed ratios the rotor with the highest power coefficient at a specific tip speed ratio is investigated at this tip speed ratio by placing the obstacle plate only at the entrance of the returning plate cartesian coordinates of this plate as shown in fig 10 are measured from the center of rotation of the rotor the coordinate of point a and the length of the obstacle plate is fixed and this plate is rotated around point a in clockwise and counterclockwise directions to get the best angle of the obstacle θ with this position of the obstacle plate the deflector plate will be inspected by fixing point b coordinate and the length of the deflector plate and rotating the plate in clockwise and counterclockwise directions around point b to get the optimum angle of the deflector ϕ finally the rotor with the two plates positioned at their optimum orientation will be examined at different tip speed ratios to obtain the optimum operating conditions of the rotor 4 numerical analysis in the present work fluent commercial software is used as computational fluid dynamics cfd program to simulate the savonius rotor fluent ansys version 14 is a cfd software using the finite element method to solve the flow problems in or around complex geometries in the fluent program the physical properties of the flow are specified the analysis technique and the turbulence model are chosen it is found that the two dimensional analysis has acceptable accuracy so it is used to conduct the numerical analysis in a shorter time gambit is a software program which used to generate the mesh of the required domains that are exported to the fluent program for the numerical analysis quad tri pave scheme was used for mesh generation of the model this scheme specifies that the mesh is composed primarily of quadrilateral mesh elements but includes triangular corner elements at user specified the overall domain is divided into two subdomains to facilitate simulation of the rotor rotation the highest resolution subdomain contains the grid elements surrounding the rotor referred to as the rotating domain the lowest resolution subdomain is the outer domain referred to as the stationary domain as shown in figs 10 and 11 dimensions of the stationary domain and generated mesh of the rotating domain they were chosen to be quietly large to minimize the blockage effect without increasing computing time ramadan 2016 and the diameter of the rotating domain is 1 2d boundary conditions bcs define the appropriate flow properties on faces of boundaries for the chosen model therefore they are the corner stone of any simulation and it is important to specify the bcs properly many kinds of underlying bcs are employed in the present simulations i e velocity inlet pressure outlet symmetry non conformal interface and no slip condition for both stationary and moving walls as shown in fig 11 boundary conditions are defined in mesh generator then the values implemented in the solver the velocity inlet to the turbine equals 0 64 m s and the pressure outlet is equal the atmospheric pressure approximately because the turbine is not submerged in deep under the water the model is analyzed and solved using unsteady flow with a sliding mesh model smm which is a recommended model in the rotating zones the realizable k ε model with enhanced wall function is adopted the enhanced wall function method is applied to include and ensure the precise resolution of the boundaries layer predication the wall function approach needs the dimensionless distance of the first layer from the wall y to be less than 5 which is used in this paper 4 1 governing equations 4 1 1 computational fluid dynamics equations to calculate the different forces acting on the blades numerically the continuity and the momentum equations should be solved after that the instantaneous forces can be calculated on the blades to obtain the net torque and net power of the turbine under these conditions of canals water flow in the present study the realizable k ε model was used as model to solve these equations the standard k ε model is improved by using variable c μ value for computing the turbulent viscosity instead of the constant value in the realizable k

0 5 ρ v 2 a r t is the average aerodynamic torque acting on the rotor shaft and may be calculated from the following relation 16 t m s r s h a f t r r o p e g 1000 where m is the load s is spring balance load rshaft is the radius of the shaft rrope is the radius of the nylon string ρ is the density of the water v is the approaching water speed a is the frontal area of the turbine and finally r is the rotor radius 17 c p t ω 0 5 ρ v 3 a ω is the angular speed of the rotor the tip speed ratio of the turbine is defined as 18 λ rω v equation 2 can be rewritten as follows 19 cp λ cm an experimental investigation is performed at constant reynolds number 1 105 based on the approaching water speed v with kinematic viscosity υ and d is the blade diameter 20 re d v υ the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations pressure velocity coupling method is used in all simulations a second order up flow spatial discretization scheme is used for the equations of momentum turbulent kinetic energy pressure and turbulent dissipation rate and a least squares cell based scheme is used for the gradients ansys 2011 the analysis is performed using a turbine diameter of 0 2 m and re 1 105 the height of the turbine is taken 0 14 m in the transverse direction of the turbine the value of the torque coefficient at every time step is integrated over the projected area of the rotor which may be expressed in the form 21 a d h this value is averaged overflow time every torque coefficient is multiplied by a tip speed ratio to get the power coefficient at every tip speed ratio 5 results and discussion 5 1 numerical results a numerical analysis is conducted for rotor 1 and 2 to detect the best design for experimental and site tests table 3 illustrates the effect of a number of cells on the performance of the rotor at a tip speed equals 0 7 based on the torque coefficient the number of cells ranged from 50 000 to 147 000 the torque coefficient is getting stable and constant after 130 000 cells and whatever the increase in several cells moreover the time step size is considered as in el baz et al 2016 every simulation takes ten cycles to allow for convergence state this convergence can be seen after 6 cycles and the result can be taken from 6th to 10th as shown in fig 12 the convergence criterion is determined by neglecting all residuals which are below 10 5 fig 13 shows the adopted time step size it was equivalent to 0 5 degree of turbine rotation this corresponds to time step 0 002 s reducing the time step size to be equivalent to 0 1 was found to produce 1 deviation of the average moment coefficient of the rotor compared to 0 5 as shown in fig 14 the torque coefficient is obtained from cfd analysis that calculates the net torque from the drag force difference between the concave side and the convex side the torque coefficient value changes with flow time so that for every tip speed ratio performance analysis is done to get the value of the torque coefficient after 5 s the instantaneous torque coefficient will be similar for every cycle as shown in fig 14 5 1 1 model validation the numerical model is validated by comparing the obtained experimental results from golecha and et al rotor 1 golecha et al 2011 with the results obtained from the numerical model with the above configuration for kamoji and et al blade rotor 1 kamoji et al 2008 fig 15 shows the variation of torque coefficient with tip speed ratio for numerical investigation which seems to be in good agreement with the experimental research the maximum error value is 10 and the average error value is 4 8 marlap 5 1 2 rotor performance characteristics figs 16 19 show the pressure contours and velocity contours of the flow around rotor 1 and rotor 2 respectively as shown in figs 16 e and 17 e for rotor 1 the pressure in the downstream decreased to minimum value 2 38 pa at the tip of the upper half of the turbine it is then increased to 0 9 pa before the center and decreased again to 1 1 pa at the center on the other side the downstream pressure of rotor 2 reached minimum value 2 59 pa at the tip of the upper half of the turbine and increased to constant value 0 96 pa with little decrease near the tip of the lower half of the turbine moreover the deceleration effect of the convex side of rotor 1 appears in the pressure contours of the upstream high pressure region is formed at the upstream of the turbine 0 7 pa and this region acts as a brake on the turbine velocity contours of the flow around rotor 1 and rotor 2 are shown in figs 18 f and 19 e the intensity of vortices at the downstream of rotor 1 dark blue areas with velocity 0 00228 m s is higher than the intensity at the downstream of rotor 2 velocity 0 013 which represents more flow energy lost from rotor 1 due to the larger amount of trapped water at the downstream of the turbine fig 20 shows power coefficient variation with rotor angle of rotation at the last revolution for rotor 1 and rotor 2 at tip speed ratio 0 63 and 0 6 respectively this tip speed ratio represents the maximum value of power coefficient for the two rotors as shown in the figure the minimum value of power coefficient at an angle 180 for the two rotors so that performance analysis will be introduced at this position to show the effect of negative torque on the performance of the turbine figs 21 and 22 show total pressure distribution static and dynamic pressures along the upstream and downstream of rotor 1 and rotor 2 diameters respectively as shown in the figures the difference between the total upstream pressure and total downstream pressure represents the harnessed power by the turbine and the area between the lines represents the total pressure difference which converted into mechanical power by the turbine by subtraction the total downstream pressure from the total upstream pressure for the two rotor profiles total pressure difference distribution along blade diameter may be plotted for each turbine as shown in fig 23 the pressure difference along rotor 2 is more uniform than the pressure difference along rotor 1 on the other hand the back pressure effect on the lower tip of rotor 2 may be noticed in fig 23 this back pressure may be considered as more extracted power from the flow because it affects in the direction of the positive torque of the turbine and this increases the net averaged torque from the turbine and this is an additional advantage of rotor 2 the effect of pressure distribution on the performance of the turbine is illustrated in power and torque coefficients for each rotor at different tip speed ratios as shown in fig 24 it is obvious that a torque performance characteristic of rotor 2 is higher than that of rotor 1 and this increase in torque coefficient of rotor 2 leads to the increase of power coefficient of rotor 2 as shown in fig 25 the maximum power coefficient of rotor 2 is 0 15 at tip speed ratio 0 6 and for rotor 1 is 0 137 at a tip speed ratio 0 63 with 10 percent increase of power coefficient the increase in power coefficient resulted from the effective action of pressure difference distribution on the more uniform area of the blade profile which is appeared in more power extraction from the water flow and increased power coefficient and torque coefficient based on the previous results rotor 2 showed better performance characteristics than rotor 1 moreover numerical model showed the importance of pressure difference distribution on rotor performance and how it increases power coefficient by decreasing vortices formation around the rotor 5 2 experimental results according to the previous section of simulation an experimental investigation is performed to compare the two different blade profiles for verifying and insure from the simulation output experiments are performed inlined irrigation canal at constant reynolds number 1 105 the torque coefficient and power coefficient of the two rotor profiles are plotted versus tip speed ratio as shown in figs 26 and 27 the maximum power coefficient of rotor 2 is 0 1285 at a tip speed ratio 0 61 and the maximum power coefficient of rotor 1 is 0 1157 at a tip speed ratio 0 62 with a relative increase of power coefficient rotor 2 by nearly 12 to simplify these results assume the two blades are fixed in the water stream as shown in fig 28 and every blade is opened in the concave side in the transverse direction of the blade in the furthest point from the diameter in the blade therefore the flow will pass freely in the bucket the effect of acceleration inside the bucket is illustrated by applying continuity equation between two planes the first plane at the inlet of the concave side of the blade and the second plane at the last plane before the exit from the concave side 22 a 1 v 1 a 2 v 2 x 1 h v 1 x 2 h v 2 where h is the height of the turbine in the transverse direction x 1 represents the width of the concave side at the inlet which is the bucket diameter and will be constant for the two blades v1 represents the velocity inlet into the concave side and may be considered the same for the two blades if the deceleration effect of the convex side is considered the same for the two blades x2 is the width of the concave side at the last plane before the exit from the bucket this value will be 0 45 times of bucket diameter d for rotor 2 and 0 52 times of bucket diameter for rotor 1 the exit velocity from the concave side will be expressed in the form v 2 v 1 x 1 x 2 v d 0 45 d 2 22 v for rotor 2 v d 0 52 d 1 92 v for rotor 1 the second effect is shifting planes of torque action from the center of rotation if the drag force in the concave side works in parallel planes the first plane is the plane crosses the diameter of the bucket and the drag force is summited in each plane to act in the center of each plane the action line of drag force in the first plane is the center of the bucket diameter for the two blades at a distance 0 5 d from the center of rotation and the action line of drag force in the second plane which is the same plane studied in the continuity equation for rotor 1 is 0 5 d from the center of rotation and for rotor 2 is 0 75 d from the center of rotation the overlapped effect of these two parameters may be illustrated in the momentum equation between the inlet and exit from the concave side assume the mass flow rate passes in the two buckets is the same the momentum equation may be expressed in the form 23 t m r 2 v 2 r 1 v 1 m 0 75 d 2 22 v 0 5 d v 1 165 m v d for rotor 2 m 0 5 d 1 92 v 0 5 d v 0 46 m v d for rotor 1 the increase in the obtained torque may be expressed in the form 24 t r o t o r 2 t r o t o r 1 1 165 m v d 0 46 m v d 2 53 this result shows the effect of blade fullness on the performance of the savonious rotor in actual this value will be smaller due to the effect of rotation and turbulence and the net average torque is the difference between the drag force acting on the concave side and the convex side which may be illustrated as follows 25 c m 2 c m 1 c p 2 λ 2 c p 1 λ 1 1 13 5 3 effect of shielding plates on the performance of the rotor 2 from the obtained experimental results rotor 2 has higher performance characteristics than rotor 1 this is the kick off point to find a way to maximums the power coefficient using a deflector in front of the turbine mohamed et al mohamed 2011 investigated the effect the two of shielding plates in the upstream of the modified savonius rotor in the air as the working fluid he obtained the following coordinates of the shielding plates which are shown in fig 10 for optimum performance xd1 d 0 41882 yd1 d 1 24505 xd2 d 0 3433 yd2 d 2 29074 xo1 d 1 2828 yo1 d 0 4037 xo2 d 1 27654 yo2 d 1 16339 length of deflector plate l d d 1 048 length of obstacle plate l o d 0 7597 the main goal of the two guiding plates at the entrance of the turbine is the improvement of performance of the rotor this improvement is obtained by increasing the positive drag forces acting on the advancing blade by increasing the flow velocity at the entrance of this blade which increases the positive moment of the rotor decreasing the negative forces acting on the returning blade by shielding the flow from the returning blade so the negative moment acts in the adverse direction of rotation will decrease in this part rotor 2 with deflectors is inspected in water as working fluid with the same procedure explained in section 4 figs 29 and 30 show pressure distribution along the upstream and downstream of the rotor without deflectors and rotor with deflectors respectively as shown in the figures the difference between the upstream pressure and downstream pressure represents the harnessed power by the turbine and the area between the lines represents the pressure difference which is converted into mechanical power by the turbine as shown in the two cases the fluctuation of the upstream pressure at the lower half of the turbine and the downstream pressure at the upper half of the turbine may be noticed this fluctuation for the rotor with deflectors is less than that of the rotor without deflectors moreover the downstream pressure at the upper half of the turbine with deflectors is more uniform than the turbine without deflectors this is due to the flow concentration effect of the two deflector plates at the entrance of the turbine however the back pressure effect on the lower tip of the two cases may be noticed in figs 29 and 30 this back pressure may be considered as more extracted power from the flow because it affects in the direction of the positive torque of the turbine and this increases the net averaged torque from the turbine and this is an additional advantage of rotor 2 on the other hand the backpressure effect on the lower tip of the two cases may be noticed in figs 29 and 30 this back pressure may be considered as lost power because it affects the adverse direction of the mean flow and this minimizes the net averaged torque from the turbine in addition it is found that the magnitude of the angle θ is 100 in a clockwise direction and for angle ϕ is 50 in a counterclockwise direction measured from the vertical axis for the optimum orientation of the two deflector plates fig 31 figs 32 35 show velocity contours and pressure contours for rotor 2 with and without the two shielding plates at the entrance of the rotor as shown in figs 32 and 33 the velocity distribution is more uniform in the upstream of the rotor with guiding plates than the rotor without guiding plates this is coming from increasing the flow intensity by guiding the flow with the plates as shown in figs 34 and 35 the pressure distribution in the downstream of the rotor with two guiding plates is more uniform than the rotor without guiding plates and this resulted in the uniform pressure difference distribution along the blade diameter shown in figs 29 and 30 uniform pressure difference distribution on the upstream and the downstream of the turbine with the deflector plates may be considered as the reason of the increase of performance of the rotor this uniform pressure difference permitted better momentum exchange between the rotor and water flow without attenuations of pressure difference effect on the rotor due to reduction of vortices formation around the rotor moreover the rotor with deflectors can operate on larger velocities range near the best efficiency point and this gives an important feature to operate the turbine at different angular speeds without great reduction in efficiency fig 36 shows the variation of the torque coefficient of the turbine with and without shielding plates and compared with golecha et al 2011 and ramadan et al 2020 with the tip speed ratio it is obvious that a torque performance characteristic of the turbine with two deflectors is higher than that of the turbine without deflectors the power coefficient also compared with same work of ramadan et al and golecha et al 2011 ramadan et al 2020 for the variation with the tip speed ratio is shown in fig 37 the maximum power coefficient of the turbine without deflectors is 0 13 at a tip speed ratio of 0 6 and for the turbine with two deflectors is 0 24 at a tip speed ratio at 0 7 with 84 percent increase of power coefficient than without deflector this is due to the uniform pressure distribution on the upstream and the downstream of the turbine with the deflector plates table 4 is summarizing the data out from figs 36 and 37 6 conclusion the current paper investigates experimentally and numerically two different savonius rotor profiles inline irrigation canal in toshka aswan egypt and the performance of conducting shield plates the results indicate the following experimentally the maximum power coefficient of rotor 2 is 0 1285 at a tip speed ratio 0 61 and the maximum power coefficient of rotor 1 is 0 1157 at a tip speed ratio 0 62 with a relative increase of power coefficient rotor 2 by nearly 12 numerically the maximum power coefficient of the turbine without deflectors is 0 13 at a tip speed ratio of 0 6 the velocity distribution is enhanced more by the uniform in the upstream of the rotor with guiding plates than the rotor without guiding plates and lead to increasing the flow intensity the rotor with deflectors can operate on larger velocities range near the best efficiency point and this gives an important feature to operate the turbine at different angular speeds without great reduction in efficiency it is found that the obstacle angle θ is 100 in a clockwise direction and for deflector angle ϕ is 50 in a counterclockwise direction measured from the vertical axis for the optimum orientation of the two deflector plates the performance is enhanced for the turbine with two deflectors to be 0 24 at a tip speed ratio at 0 7 with 84 percent increase of power coefficient than without deflector these premium results are the motivation to work more to enhance and optimize the efficiency to get the optimum profile and efficiency for this turbine credit authorship contribution statement a ramadan
