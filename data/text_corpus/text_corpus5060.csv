25300,in this paper we examine how progress on ecosystem service indicators could contribute to ecosystem accounting within the scope of environmental economic accounting in finland we propose an integration framework and examine the integration of ecosystem service indicators into environmental economic accounting with two case studies relevant for finland 1 water related ecosystem services and 2 the ecosystem services of fish provisioning in marine ecosystems in light of these case studies we evaluate the relevance of existing finnish ecosystem service indicators the data availability for ecosystem accounting in finland and the applicability of the system of environmental economic accounting ö experimental ecosystem accounting seea eea framework to integrate finnish ecosystem service indicators and other relevant data into environmental economic accounts the results indicate that the present ecosystem service indicators can assist in creating a basis for ecosystem accounting but the indicators require further elaboration to be more compatible with the existing environmental economic accounting system keywords seea eea natural capital accounting fegs cs cices aquatic ecosystem services marine ecosystem 1 introduction in recent years various disciplines have worked to improve the sustainability of coupled human environment systems one such contribution is literature in the field of accounting that acknowledges the insufficiency of the system of national accounting sna in measuring the negative environmental impacts of economic activities bartelmus et al 1991 boyd and banzhaf 2007 la notte et al 2017a repetto 1992 indicators such as gross domestic product gdp should be adjusted or supplemented with additional accounts to record the extent development and possible overconsumption of natural resources and to consider negative environmental impacts such as pollution and detrimental use see e g bartelmus 2009 nordhaus 2006 obst et al 2016 to achieve this goal two statistical frameworks have been developed to supplement the sna 1 the system of environmental economic accounting central framework seea cf and 2 the system of environmental economic accounting experimental ecosystem accounting seea eea un et al 2014a b both frameworks include accounting for biological natural resources but the former system treats environmental assets individually and the latter one applies a system approach un et al 2014b fig a1 in appendix a presents the scope and differences between seea cf and seea eea in this paper environmental economic accounting refers to a broad concept that covers the scope of accounting under both seea cf and seea eea ecosystem accounting in turn is defined here as the accounting for ecosystem assets and ecosystem services ess as in hein et al 2015 further following hein et al 2015 we define natural capital as environmental assets that provide benefits to humans ecosystem assets are thus considered as a type of natural capital on the european level two major initiatives the mapping and assessment of the ecosystems and their services maes and the knowledge implementation project on the integrated system for natural capital and ecosystem services accounting kip inca play an integral role in developing ecosystem accounting they attempt to implement the eu biodiversity strategy for 2020 by improving the visibility of ess and by providing support for es valuation and the integration of ess into existing environmental economic accounting and reporting systems kip inca report 2016 maes et al 2016 as part of the national maes process finland has recently taken the first steps toward the identification and monitoring of the state and development of ess and biodiversity by developing national ecosystem services indicators finnish es indicators www biodiversity fi ecosystemservices home see mononen et al 2016 environmental economic accounting however has deeper roots in finland autio et al 2013 hoffrén and salomaa 2014 existing environmental economic accounts include data on raw material consumption energy supply and use waste generation greenhouse gas emissions business activities of the environmental goods and services sector and environmental protection expenditures statistics finland 2017a ecosystem assets and services however are not yet part of the finnish environmental economic accounting scheme operated by statistics finland therefore this paper explores how finnish es indicators could be integrated into ecosystem accounting and how future work related to such integration could support the final goal of including ess into finnish environmental economic accounts for this purpose two case studies following the approaches provided by seea eea are elaborated ecosystem accounting for 1 water related ess and 2 fish provisioning services from marine ecosystems the latter case study can be regarded as a subset of water related ess but is presented separately for the sake of clarity and due to the different methodological approaches used the motivations for the choice of these particular case study topics were their high relevance to the economy and the fairly good availability of data related to them methodologically seea cf and seea water un 2012 provide guidelines for asset surface water and groundwater stocks supply and use accounts for water resources unep et al 2017 by contrast seea eea is applicable to ecosystem accounting which can consider comprehensive aquatic ecosystems and other water related ess in a systematic way earlier studies have applied seea eea to incorporate es mapping and quantification data into ecosystem accounting from the regional to the continental scale khan et al 2015 la notte et al 2017a office for national statistic 2016 remme et al 2014 2015 schröter et al 2014 waves 2017 according to hein et al 2015 no case studies existed at the time of publication that would have compiled an es use account in practice later la notte et al 2017a provided data on actual es flows of nitrogen retention used by two types of beneficiaries however the results from la notte et al 2017a are too aggregated to be integrated into the sna in the waves project 2017 physical supply and use accounts for the ess of carbon sequestration and storage water supply in guatemala were compiled but monetary use accounts were still missing khan et al 2015 provided an outline of use accounts for freshwater ess in the uk by identifying the beneficiaries which can be regarded as the first step toward compiling es use accounts the first case study of the present paper aims to take one step forward by developing physical and monetary water es use accounts compatible with the sna our second case study demonstrates the provisioning services of three commercially important fish species in the baltic sea herring clupea harengus membras sprat sprattus sprattus and cod gadus morhua luke 2017 regarding fish provisioning services some countries have already compiled asset accounts for fishery resources based on the well developed seea cf approach abs 2012 statistics south africa 2012 anna 2017 these accounts contain data on fish stock fish catch and economic activities within the fishery sector however understanding their links to whole marine ecosystems requires the application of ecosystem accounting and seea eea the literature on marine ecosystem accounting is still scarce most of the existing papers focus on coastal ecosystems and emphasize experiments on compiling ecosystem extent and condition accounts abs 2015 eigenraam et al 2016 weber 2014 eigenraam et al 2016 and abs 2015 included fish provisioning services in their ecosystem accounting but neither of them estimated the capacity for the ecosystem to provide this es in principle ecosystem capacity connects an ecosystem asset with ess as it represents the ability of an ecosystem asset to generate a set of ess in a sustainable way un et al 2014b unep et al 2017 in practice however seea eea does not instruct how ecosystem capacity should be measured unep et al 2017 and the best way to define and measure ecosystem capacity has remained a somewhat controversial issue in the case of terrestrial ecosystems hein et al 2016 and la notte et al 2017a use ecosystem capacity contradictorily the former defines ecosystem capacity as a flow of an es that is generated at sustainable level and the latter defines ecosystem capacity as a stock that provides a sustainable es stock quantifies the state of an ecosystem at one point in time while flow always has a temporal dimension with several time points this paper thus reviews both approaches to ecosystem capacity and proposes an operational measurement of this metric for marine fish provisioning services to sum up ecosystem accounting is still at the experimental stage and many concepts have not yet been operationalized this study with its two case studies serves as a pilot for the evaluation of data availability and the potential ways to integrate finnish es indicators into national environmental economic accounts methodologically seea eea approaches and the outcomes from the common international classification of ecosystem services cices and maes processes are evaluated this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a general framework to integrate finnish es indicators and environmental economic accounts through ecosystem accounting procedures with a basic description of ecosystem accounting and the finnish es indicators section 3 presents the two case studies section 4 discusses how the finnish es indicators could be improved to facilitate ecosystem accounting and the implementation of the integration framework 2 material and methods this section briefly reviews the finnish es indicators and the relevant seea eea accounts fig 1 illustrates our schematic framework for the integration of finnish es indicators into environmental economic accounts and table 1 lists definitions of ecosystem accounts that appear in fig 1 the finnish es indicators follow the cices classification system and the so called cascade model mononen et al 2016 the use of the cascade model structured the resulting indicators into four different categories 1 1 in the original cascade model there is a fifth category ess between the function and benefit indicators 1 structure 2 function 3 benefit and 4 value haines young and potschin 2010 2 1 use of structure and function indicators to develop ecosystem extent and condition accounts structure indicators fig 1 define and measure the biophysical prerequisites for functioning ecosystems various land cover statistics have been used to link habitat type and ess in finnish es indicators especially the extent of these habitats across finland mononen et al 2016 when available habitat condition data are included in the structure indicators e g water quality or species assemblage and function indicators e g productivity of an area in a certain unit of time although spatial ecosystem condition data are still rare geographical information system gis tools and spatial format data are commonly used but are not compulsory for ecosystem extent and condition accounts hein et al 2015 unep et al 2017 thus the structure and function indicators in finnish es indicators can provide direct input to the ecosystem extent and condition accounts for some types of ess the natural resource stock information in existing environmental economic accounts can act as an indicator for condition accounts see the example of water stocks in section 3 1 2 2 2 use of structure and function indicators to develop ecosystem capacity accounts table 2 summarizes ecosystem capacity definitions from the recent literature all these publications measured capacity based on a single es but only hein et al 2016 calls for sustainability assessment at the ecosystem level the definition of capacity from hein et al 2015 is based on the degradation of ecosystem conditions which complicates its use the approach from hein et al 2016 creates different possibilities for capacity which may hamper the sustainability assessment of actual es flows la notte et al 2017a followed villamagna et al 2013 to treat capacity as a stock but also provided a flow indicator sustainable flow that serves a similar function to capacity as used in the other literature summarized in table 2 to determine whether capacity should be treated as a flow or stock we clarify the relations between capacity and ecosystem assets presented in the literature in the case study from la notte et al 2017a the physical term of the capacity was measured as the total area of constructed wetlands that was required therefore it is unclear how these imaginary wetlands are linked to real ecosystem extent and how they reflect the ability of the existing ecosystem asset to provide sustainable flows however the flow concept of capacity in other publications hein et al 2015 2016 schröter et al 2014 is clearly represented as the sustainable level of an es flow provided by an existing ecosystem in this paper we follow hein et al 2016 and hein et al 2015 and define ecosystem capacity as a flow that is the sustainable level of an es generated by a given ecosystem asset under current ecosystem management and es use and the sustainable level is the maximum level of es used that does not negatively affect the future supply of that or other ess thus when the actual es use is above the ecosystem capacity es use that results in ecosystem degradation and decreases the capacity in the next accounting period is not sustainable hein et al 2016 the capacity is subject to changes in the management system and in other factors affecting ecosystem condition hein et al 2015 2016 la notte et al 2017a schröter et al 2014 in finnish es indicators function indicators fig 1 define the ability of an ecosystem to produce ess within a certain timeframe this delivery of ess representing the total ess that are generated from an ecosystem follows the supply definition of ess from burkhard et al 2012 supply of ess refers to the capacity of a particular area to provide a specific bundle of ecosystem goods and services within a given time period the capacity and definition in burkhard et al 2012 neither indicates whether the ess are used nor whether the potential use has been sustainable therefore the application of such function indicators in ecosystem accounting requires an estimate for the sustainable level of es use in the given timeframe in addition a change in ecosystem extent influences the level of function indicators and thus ecosystem extent should also be considered when estimating ecosystem capacity since sustainability levels are not available in finnish es indicators at this moment we explore the potential candidates of capacity indicators from fishery sciences although sustainable catch was defined as the capacity for fish provisioning in un et al 2014b and un et al 2014a demonstrated an example of the sustainable yield of fish resources for a simple single species case the definition of sustainable catch is still manifold in fisheries management literature piet et al 2017 tested several single species based sustainable indicators including surplus production single species maximum sustainable yield msy and reproductive capacity to be used as capacity indicators for fish provisioning services however we decided to use multispecies msy which considers food web interactions as an input for our capacity account for three reasons 1 research has found evidence for interactions among herring sprat and cod in the baltic sea and multispecies biological reference points for sustainable harvest have been advised for fishery management objectives collie and gislason 2001 gislason 1999 ices 2013 walters et al 2005 2 in national accounts the account structure is divided by sectors e g fishery sector or aquaculture sector but not by species statistics finland 2017b 3 the latest kip inca report la notte et al 2017b mentioned that the final process for accounting fish provisioning services should consider food web interactions although the report currently follows the surplus production method from piet et al 2017 for single species 2 3 use of benefit indicators to develop physical es supply accounts benefit indicators fig 1 express the used share of total ess generated from an ecosystem mononen et al 2016 e g the share of wild berry yields that have been harvested by people or the volume of groundwater extracted for human purposes this indicator has the same meaning as the actual es flows in ecosystem accounting schröter et al 2014 thus benefit indicators can be used to compile physical es supply accounts 2 4 development of the physical es use account the current finnish es indicators can contribute little to a physical es use account compiling es use accounts requires detailed data about the users of ess but finnish es indicators lack such data es user data relies on the collection of social economic statistics existing information about sectors in the sna could also help in understanding the sectors use of some ess unep et al 2017 even though the data sources for supply and use accounts may be different compiling es supply and use accounts should occur at the same time and in an iterative fashion so that the data for both accounts can be complemented or fine tuned to balance the two accounts according to the principles of sna unep et al 2017 this balance between supply and use accounts means that the total domestic supply of an es is either used by domestic beneficiaries or exported to the rest of the world hein et al 2016 unep et al 2017 2 5 use of value indicators to develop monetary es supply accounts the value indicators fig 1 in finnish es indicators are divided into four categories 1 economic 2 social 3 health and 4 intrinsic values this approach was modified from the uk national ecosystem assessment 2011 economic value reflects the economic statistics of monitored or observed values social value relates to metrics such as the number of jobs the data for economic and social values are usually estimated or collected from other socio economic statistics health value is poorly developed but it has been noted that the degradation of some ess will lead to negative impacts on human health and thus to increased societal costs e g lampi et al 1992 intrinsic value is mainly qualitative and especially reflects cultural values such as national identity and historical relevance and it can be attributed to every living system within these four types of value social value does not need to be incorporated into ecosystem accounting since sna data already include social value among labor inputs eu et al 2009 among the remaining value types economic value representing a middle transaction step in a value chain from nature to humans is the only value type that meets the valuation standard for accounting depending on the es type the procedures required to apply economic value indicators to supply accounts are different in the finnish es indicators the economic indicators of provisioning services and some cultural services like recreational services that have market prices are estimated by producer income in this case the monetary value of an es supply is measured as a resource rent which is derived by deducting the operational costs from the producer income and then adjusting the result with taxes or subsidies un et al 2014a 2014b remme et al 2015 the operational costs include intermediate costs labor costs and user costs of fixed capital which are all itemized in the sna data eu et al 2009 most regulation services and some cultural services do not have markets in finnish es indicators some such ess are valued by methods compatible with seea eea e g the avoided cost approach for water retention or erosion control un et al 2014b in such cases the economic value from finnish es indicators can be used directly in the compilation of monetary es supply accounts in all cases the monetary and physical es supply accounts need to correspond to each other in a given year 2 6 development of the monetary es use account the monetary es use account is compiled based on 1 sectors use from the physical es use accounts and 2 the unit value of ess from monetary es supply accounts as in the physical account monetary use and supply need to follow the balance rule in addition like ess supply the monetary and physical terms of the es use account need to correspond 2 7 development of the monetary ecosystem asset account compiling the monetary ecosystem asset account requires three steps 2 7 1 step 1 estimate the physical term of expected es flows estimating the patterns of ess that an ecosystem asset can provide in the future the so called physical terms of expected es flows un et al 2014b is challenging due to the complex dynamic and non linear changes in ecosystems hein et al 2016 such an estimation requires information about the possible es demand in the future which could be based on but may not necessarily equal current actual es flows as the sustainability of both current ess and possible future es demand influences the pattern of future ess an ecosystem capacity account is also needed to estimate the expected es flows fig 1 un et al 2014b hein et al 2016 in our marine fish provisioning case we used a multispecies bio economic model from nieminen et al 2016 and nieminen et al 2012 to estimate physical expected es flows the model not only follows the multispecies assumption from the capacity account but also has the ability to consider ecosystem condition factors such as salinity to increase the accuracy of stock estimations the applied model is an age structured model describing the food web interactions of cod herring and sprat the economics of the fishery sector and the impacts of fishing on the stocks of the three fish species 2 7 2 step 2 estimate the monetary term of expected es flows this estimation requires the results of physical expected es flows and the monetary value of the es supply account the unit value of ess calculated from the es supply account has to also incorporate the inflation rate before being multiplied with the physical expected es flows un et al 2014a 2 7 3 step 3 estimate the monetary value of an ecosystem asset by discounting the monetary value of expected es flows each ecosystem asset is valued as the net present value npv of the expected es flows of multiple ess that the ecosystem can provide multiple ess are required to estimate the value of an ecosystem asset comprehensively the length of expected es flows that an ecosystem asset can provide is called asset life if the current and expected use of the es is sustainable asset life can be forever in the accounting sense however a maximum asset life e g 25 or 30 years is determined to value ecosystem assets since the npv usually becomes very low after this period un et al 2014b unep et al 2017 the results of ecosystem accounts can be further integrated into existing environmental economic accounts in many different ways un et al 2014a 2014b fig 1 shows two examples of integrating monetary ecosystem accounts the current finnish es indicators provide an overview of the key ess although there is a lack of detailed data in many of the indicators the collection of spatial data for mapping structure and function indicators is progressing via the on going maes process at the same time there is an ongoing demand for the development of benefit and value indicators in the case studies section 3 some of the lacking data are supplemented by alternative data sources to make the ecosystem account testing in this paper as comprehensive as possible 3 case studies in this section we present two examples water related ess and fish provisioning in marine ecosystems to implement the integration framework proposed in section 2 in both cases we begin with an overview of the whole ecosystem however when compiling es supply and use accounts and estimating the expected es flows we focus only on the selected ess in order to test the implementation of the integration framework 3 1 ecosystem accounts for water related ess in this case study we propose how services provided by aquatic ecosystems and the different uses of water in its various forms and from different sources could be incorporated into ecosystem accounting the focus is on open water ecosystems wetlands atmospheric water and water in terrestrial ecosystems are not analyzed in detail we start by defining the system boundaries of our analysis and then continue by testing the compilation of physical ecosystem asset accounts as well as es supply and use accounts by following the integration framework fig 1 and seea eea accounts for capacity expected es flows and ecosystem monetary assets are not tested in this case study asset accounts comprising ecosystem extent and condition accounts for open water ecosystems build mainly on previous work conducted with the finnish es indicators es supply and use accounts are tested for water abstraction for other types of water related provisioning regulating and cultural services we outline potential formats and data sources for their supply and use accounts fig 2 describes the ecosystems functions and services of water related ess 3 1 1 system boundaries water is present in all three major compartments of the planet aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere they all provide water related services that should be acknowledged in accounts rainfall including snowfall is part of the hydrological cycle which unep et al 2017 recommends considering in ecosystem accounting soil and groundwater are elements of terrestrial ecosystems freshwater ecosystems include open waters e g river ecosystems and lake ecosystems and wetlands khan et al 2015 wetlands include swamps mires and peatlands shallow lakes and riparian zones which together make up to 25 of the total land area of finland biodiversity fi 2014 wijesingha 2016 this case study however focuses on open freshwaters and on freshwater itself in various ecosystems as illustrated in fig 2 3 1 2 ecosystem extent and condition accounts 3 1 2 1 inland waters the extent of the open water ecosystems in finland is summarized in table 3 the total area of inland water bodies is 11 4 of the total land area of the country the finnish national land survey updates data on the total area of inland water bodies annually in ecosystem accounting the stock of water resources is treated as a characteristic indicator in the ecosystem condition account khan et al 2015 unep et al 2017 the total volume of the inland water bodies in table 3 is calculated by multiplying the total surface water area by the average depth of approximately 7 m for finnish inland lakes kettunen et al 2008 finnish es indicators have several species related indicators for inland waters including threatened inland water species and the conservation status of species identified in the eu habitats directive in table 3 the proportions of inland water species with favorable status in two climatic regions boreal and alpine are given together with data on inland surface water quality 3 1 2 2 groundwater finland has 6 020 classified aquifers approximately 3 800 of which are classified as important or potentially applicable for water supply purposes syke 2016 next to these aquifers groundwater is present practically everywhere in the subsurface and the bedrock but its volume and chemical status are difficult to assess in general groundwater quality and productivity vary greatly outside the classified aquifers an asset account for groundwater is presented in table 4 following a similar structure to that for inland open waters in this case however the ecosystem extent represents the aquifer area classified as important for or applicable to water supply rather than the overall total classified aquifers 2 2 finnish es indicators include the extent and water productivity for total classified aquifers however to keep the data range consistent throughout the account we chose an alternative data source or a specific ecosystem type condition indicators are also presented for the same range of data the ecosystem condition indicators reflect the connections between groundwater quality and terrestrial ecosystems including the human activities and management practices affecting them groundwater quality is adversely affected primarily by chemical or microbiological contamination caused by contaminated sites of various kinds and origin e g agriculture industry and small scale businesses molarius and poussa 2001 syke 2016 and on going activities such as road deicing 3 1 3 supply and use accounts 3 1 3 1 abstracted water in finland surface water uptake 2 0 km3 including artificial recharge accounted for approximately 1 4 of the total surface water stock in 2010 and groundwater uptake 0 2 km3 from aquifers classified valuable for water supply was approximately 10 of their annual groundwater productivity salminen et al 2017 surface water and groundwater are also used for cooling of the total 8 1 km3 used for this purpose 20 1 8 km3 is fresh surface water the shares of groundwater and brackish water are 0 1 and 80 respectively salminen et al 2017 even though the rates of abstraction are well below the rate of formation of groundwater and the stock of surface water evaluating whether the rates are locally safe or sustainable requires additional analysis on their local long term effects kløve et al 2011 a summary of the flow volumes from the environment to the economy sectors es use accounts is presented in table a2 in appendix a which shows that 20 sectors out of the 26 abstract water from the environment the total groundwater use 0 3 km3 in table a2 is higher than the groundwater uptake mentioned above the reason is that the groundwater abstraction volume in table a2 includes groundwater uptake outside the aquifers classified valuable for water supply of the abstracted fresh surface water and groundwater approximately 0 4 km3 is used by the water supply sector nace 3 3 nace is statistical classification of economic activities in the european community which classify the industries in different sectors eurostat 2008 36 to produce mains water table a2 also shows the aggregate mains water volumes delivered within the 26 economy sectors in finland in 2010 we use the volume of water abstracted by the water supply sector to estimate the resource rent as mains water reflects market pricing based on the input output data from finnish national statistics statistics finland 2017c the total production of the water supply sector is 588 million eur based on the valuation approach described in section 2 5 the operational surplus 75 million eur in the input output data can be regarded as resource rent for the ess used 403 472 465 m3 by the water supply sector the unit resource rent of ess thus is 0 186 eur for 1 m3 of abstracted water the resource rent that each sector should pay for its water abstraction from groundwater and surface water can be seen in table a2 3 1 3 2 return flows from the economy to the environment water flows from the economy to the environment generally consist of abstracted water that is returned after use the physical and chemical composition however changes during the use phase depending on the purpose for which it has been used for cooling water thermal load is generally the most relevant impact for other waters e g at a wastewater treatment plant the removal or recovery of various aqueous substances such as nutrients organic compounds and particles is required prior to introduction back to the water body in many cases the abstracted water is returned to another water body rather than its original water source for instance abstracted groundwater is returned to a surface water body and abstracted freshwaters are introduced into the sea even though nutrient removal rates have significantly improved over the years in finland säylä and vilpas 2012 the natural biological and physicochemical processes in the receiving bodies or said regulating services are still needed to buffer the impacts of the remaining substances in addition to the returned water flows described above various substances are also washed out from land areas to groundwater and surface water bodies by precipitated water in the receiving water bodies various physical chemical and microbial attenuating processes remove aqueous substances and reduce their concentrations the emission accounts tattari et al 2015 for phosphorus p and nitrogen n also provide data for p loading from airborne deposits and natural leaching to inland water which is useful for the estimation of relations among human activities p cycling and water quality the data provided by tattari et al 2015 were recently improved in salminen et al 2017 but they remain rather general with only 16 aggregated sectors for substances other than n and p emission accounts are still missing how much and how effectively water bodies can dilute remove or immobilize various emissions and how these emissions affect them and the ess they provide remain open questions 3 1 3 3 ess from in situ water and rainfall while recent improvements in water accounting for abstracted water and emissions to water in finland provide a solid basis for the careful assessment of water flow accounts from the environment to the economy within the economy and from the economy to the environment many more data related challenges are encountered in other forms of water use from an accounting perspective however it is evident that a vast majority of economic sectors depend solely on abstracted water subsequently the number of individual sectors which use other provisioning regulating and cultural services is quite limited table 5 the sectors of the finnish economy for which atmospheric water rainfall and in situ use passive use of open waters are relevant are summarized in table 5 first crop growth mainly depends on precipitation as only 3 of the fields in finland are equipped with irrigation facilities tike 2013 and not all of these fields are irrigated each year depending on the weather conditions during the growing season for instance in 2010 19 of the 68 600 ha with irrigation facilities was indeed irrigated tike 2013 occasional irrigation is limited to open air cultivation of vegetables berries and fruits and potatoes the remaining crops including cereals are watered with rain similarly forests i e forestry in finland depend fully on rainwater as do natural products such as berries mushrooms and other wild growing non wood products water in the form of snow is also essential for many skiing centers and other winter sports activities other relevant sectors for provisioning services are fishing aquaculture the production of electricity with hydropower and water transport for these industries the economic value they produce is indicated in table 5 together with examples of the various types of ess these sectors use 3 2 ecosystem accounts for marine ecosystems and fish provisioning services in this section we present an example compilation of a full set of accounts for marine fish provisioning for herring sprat and cod for this case we compile the accounts for 2012 herring and sprat constituted over 90 of the finnish marine landings in 2012 luke 2017 cod was selected as an example for measuring sustainable use and for testing the capacity account compilation as cod has been overfished and its populations are still low ices 2013 2015a 3 2 1 ecosystem asset accounts the ecosystem extent of marine ecosystems for a country is defined as the country s exclusive economic zone eez un et al 2014b the eez helps to identify local marine resources that should be included in national ecosystem accounts but the species we focus on migrates across the baltic sea therefore we first dealt with fish provisioning services from the perspective of the whole baltic sea and then considered the finnish share of the catch to integrate the es data into finnish accounts for fish provisioning services and for fish stock formation in particular water temperature oxygen and salinity are important factors e g koster et al 2005 and ottersen et al 2006 and the fish stock level further determines the capacity to provide fish thus such factors are advised to be included in ecosystem accounts un et al 2014b however finnish es indicators only provide information on the overall status of coastal waters and the concentrations of n and p table 6 shows the asset accounts of finnish marine ecosystems which include the ecosystem extent and condition indicators from finnish es indicators unlike in accounting for water current seea eea and related documents un et al 2014b unep et al 2017 do not clarify how to link the seea cf asset account of fish stock to ecosystem accounting recall that in the water example water stock serves as a condition indicator in ecosystem accounting in addition species related indicators e g species richness are considered as ecosystem condition indicators un et al 2014b therefore we also present the spawning stock biomass ssb of the fish stocks in the ecosystem condition account the finnish es indicators use ssb data from the international council for the exploration of the sea ices as a function indicator so we also used ices as one of our data sources the finnish share of the ssb is estimated based on the ssbs of the three species in the baltic sea and the finnish catch share see table a3 in appendix a 3 2 2 es supply and use accounts the finnish es indicators define fish catch as a benefit indicator thus we also use fish catch data to populate the es use and supply accounts table 7 the total supply of fish should include commercial fisheries together with recreational and household catch un et al 2014b without further division of data between recreational and household catch we place commercial and recreational catch into the es supply and use accounts recreational fish catch should be allocated to the recreational sector nace 93 and all commercial catch should be considered as the es use from fishery sectors nace 031 based on eurostat 2008 unlike abstracted water which can be acquired from different ecosystems all marine fish catch is provided by marine ecosystems the landing value of these three species totaled 26 6 million eur in 2012 luke 2015 based on the input output data from finnish national statistics statistics finland 2017c an operating surplus without a net mixed income in the fishery sector accounted for 13 5 of the total income of the whole fishery sector in 2012 the operating surplus was calculated by subtracting all operational costs from the total production value in the fishery sector this calculation considered the effects of taxes subsidies and mixed income without further information about the cost structure we use this operating surplus percentage of the total production value 13 5 as a proxy for the resource rent percentage of the landing value 26 6 million eur thus the resource rent of the three species in 2012 was approximately 3 6 million eur table 7 and the unit resource rent was 28 eur per ton recreational fishing is commonly identified as a cultural service ahtiainen and öhman 2013 magnussen and kettunen 2013 pope et al 2016 and thus the approach for valuing recreational services should be used for recreational catch un et al 2014b 3 2 3 ecosystem capacity accounts to use multispecies msy as a capacity indicator we multiplied the total multispecies msy estimated by ices 2013 with the finnish catch share table 8 by comparing the finnish multispecies msy with actual es use table 7 the results show that the sprat harvest slightly exceeded the sustainable level while herring and cod were harvested sustainably 3 2 4 the expected es flows and ecosystem monetary asset account to demonstrate the estimation of physical expected es flows with updated parameters we apply the model from nieminen et al 2016 and nieminen et al 2012 salinity often used as an ecosystem condition parameter affects cod stock development nieminen et al 2012 as no salinity information is available in the current ecosystem condition account we chose the current salinity level as bad condition for cod recruitment based on ices 2015a in addition the average values for 2011 2013 were used for the biological parameters in the model nieminen et al 2016 corresponding to the accounting year 2012 of our case study for the expected es demand we assumed that the future demand of this es remains similar to the demand in the accounting year hence for human related parameters such as prices and fishing mortality the average values for 2011 2013 were chosen since the model was designed to simulate the fish stock of the whole baltic sea the updated price was determined as the average for the countries surrounding the baltic sea by using data from the eu 2015 the updated fishing mortality data were from ices 2015a as in other accounts the finnish catch share was used to calculate the physical expected es flows for finland table a4 the expected es flows of cod follow a decreasing trend until the end of asset life this implies that the determined fishing mortality of cod is higher than the fishing mortality for cod harvested at capacity level in the model which means that expected es flows are higher than the capacity by contrast the expected harvests estimated for herring and sprat are anticipated to increase in the later years of the asset life so the expected es flows for these two species are anticipated to be within the capacity next we use the resource rent of current es use 28 eur per tons of fish to estimate the resource rent of expected es flows the inflation rate in 2012 2013 was 2 2 eurostat 2017 and thus we assumed that the unit resource rent will increase by 2 2 every year by multiplying the total physical expected es by the unit resource rent we get the value of expected es flows table a4 further by discounting the value of expected es flows by a 2 discount rate 4 4 this discount rate was determined to be same as the discount rate used in the model for estimating the physical expected es flows the estimated npv of the expected es flows totals 90 million eur the sum can also be regarded as a partial value of finnish marine ecosystems the total value of finnish marine ecosystems can be estimated only when all current use types of ess are considered 4 discussion the two case studies provide evidence that finnish es indicators can contribute to ecosystem accounting particularly in regard to ecosystem extent and condition accounts asset accounts data in finnish es indicators however are not updated regularly a limitation already identified during the indicator development process mononen et al 2016 therefore a single year compilation of accounts cannot be used to evaluate sustainability issues and potential environmental degradation such degradation can only be revealed when the ecosystem condition or capacity decreases unep et al 2017 and observing such a change requires data from more than one year to serve as a source of input data for ecosystem accounting finnish es indicators should be collected and updated on a regular basis in this paper some of the ecosystem condition indicators were selected based on their data format and the completeness of the database ideally ecosystem condition indicators should reflect the services in question for example salinity plays a key role in determining the capacity of marine ecosystems to provide fish however a salinity indicator is currently missing from the finnish es indicator database and therefore cannot be used to populate the condition account for the marine fish provisioning service because the contents of finnish es indicators are not updated regularly and do not provide all relevant data this paper uses alternative sources to populate the ecosystem accounts however in the case of water related ess the data used were not strictly from one particular year this results in some methodological inconsistency and minor inaccuracy when the data are combined with economic data representing one particular year groundwater productivity table 4 for instance is based on the average infiltration rate over several years rather than that for one year in spite of this the case study still demonstrates the principles of how ecosystem account compilation for water related ess could be accomplished in present finnish es indicators undetermined thresholds of sustainability levels for es provisioning create a challenge in compiling capacity accounts due to this challenge the physical expected es flows and monetary ecosystem asset accounts could not be compiled for the two case studies by using finnish es indicators developing approaches and models to overcome these shortcomings and challenges is paramount for using the indicators in accounting and even more importantly for using accounting in sustainability assessments in the marine fish provisioning case we first used multispecies msy as the sustainability indicator and then used a multispecies bio economic model to estimate the expected es flows in our application the capacity that was used for estimating expected es flows was determined by the model rather than using the value from capacity accounts however the results in section 3 2 3 and section 3 2 4 do not conflict one identified the sustainability of current es use but the other showed the sustainability of potential future es use we recommend that these two stages be reconciled in future accounting systems nevertheless this example still provides a starting point for future work in both developing the sustainability indicators and capacity accounts and estimating the expected ecosystem service flows in summary the present finnish es indicators could be used in their current form to compile ecosystem extent condition and es supply accounts for some ess e g the supply of fish provisioning is available in finnish es indicators furthermore finnish es indicators have the potential to be used in the development of capacity accounts if the sustainability levels for function indicators can be estimated the effects of ecosystem condition change on the capacity of an ecosystem can be identified this will help to attain the ideal of capacity accounts being closely linked to ecosystem condition accounts hein et al 2015 unep et al 2017 the water case study recognized the various water related ess provided by aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere as stated in the case study water related accounting should cover the entire hydrological cycle and the various forms water snow and ice and sources of water since they all provide relevant services for the economy that is environment economy interactions moreover the accounts could also be used to study the interactions and dependencies among the various ecosystems to answer questions about how using a particular es may affect the ability of other ecosystems to provide particular services an essential question regarding the compatibility of ecosystem accounting with sna is whether various ess are identified in frameworks such as cices and the final ecosystem goods and services classification system fegs cs and how explicitly they are defined the finnish es indicators were compiled using the current version of cices 4 3 in which precipitation rainfall is categorized as surface water for non drinking purposes in the fegs cs documentation bordt 2016 precipitation and its various uses beneficiaries within the economy are explicitly expressed as the forest sector managed forest is highly dependent on precipitation and is the major contributor to the finnish economy considering fegs cs in the future development of finnish es indicators might increase the accuracy of the accounts and their relevance in decision making this study indicates that cices classification v 4 3 as such would not be explicit enough for the sna which poses a risk that the outcomes from the application of cices classification do not meet the needs of environmental economic accounts if this is the case integration of ess into the sna may prove problematic hence we call for closer collaboration between ecologists working with es classification and sna experts to guarantee that the documentation produced supports the integration of ess into the present structures of economic accounting the output from ecosystem accounts can be used as input to an integrated account that unifies ecosystem accounting data with standard national account data for instance the results of ecosystem monetary asset accounts can be incorporated into a balance sheet another example is that the results of es supply and use accounts can be used as inputs to extended supply and use tables or input output tables and they can further be used in input output or computable general equilibrium models to support decision making unep et al 2017 in economic studies the outcomes from such models traditionally reveal the interactions among various sectors as well as the supply and use of intermediary and final products populating these various tables with ecosystem accounting data can help acknowledge the relations between ess and sectors currently present in the sna the integration framework fig 1 implies the importance of integrating the two systems for decision making changes in structure and function indicators affect the extent condition and capacity accounts es supply and use accounts reflect human activities by comparing these accounting data across several years or by applying the account data to an input output or computable general equilibrium model it is possible to analyze the impacts of economic activities and specific policies on ecosystems 5 conclusions halting the alarming deterioration of the environment and enhancing the integration of environmental and socio economic indicators are both defined as motivations in the eu s biodiversity strategy and the 7th environment action programme the practical measures of the maes working group and kip inca project aim at integrating an environmental perspective into national accounting systems this paper serves as a pilot to test how data from finnish es indicators can be used for ecosystem accounting the two case studies show that although the es indicators were not originally designed from an accounting perspective they could be used in compiling ecosystem accounts following the seea eea statistical framework the pilot also noted data gaps

25300,in this paper we examine how progress on ecosystem service indicators could contribute to ecosystem accounting within the scope of environmental economic accounting in finland we propose an integration framework and examine the integration of ecosystem service indicators into environmental economic accounting with two case studies relevant for finland 1 water related ecosystem services and 2 the ecosystem services of fish provisioning in marine ecosystems in light of these case studies we evaluate the relevance of existing finnish ecosystem service indicators the data availability for ecosystem accounting in finland and the applicability of the system of environmental economic accounting ö experimental ecosystem accounting seea eea framework to integrate finnish ecosystem service indicators and other relevant data into environmental economic accounts the results indicate that the present ecosystem service indicators can assist in creating a basis for ecosystem accounting but the indicators require further elaboration to be more compatible with the existing environmental economic accounting system keywords seea eea natural capital accounting fegs cs cices aquatic ecosystem services marine ecosystem 1 introduction in recent years various disciplines have worked to improve the sustainability of coupled human environment systems one such contribution is literature in the field of accounting that acknowledges the insufficiency of the system of national accounting sna in measuring the negative environmental impacts of economic activities bartelmus et al 1991 boyd and banzhaf 2007 la notte et al 2017a repetto 1992 indicators such as gross domestic product gdp should be adjusted or supplemented with additional accounts to record the extent development and possible overconsumption of natural resources and to consider negative environmental impacts such as pollution and detrimental use see e g bartelmus 2009 nordhaus 2006 obst et al 2016 to achieve this goal two statistical frameworks have been developed to supplement the sna 1 the system of environmental economic accounting central framework seea cf and 2 the system of environmental economic accounting experimental ecosystem accounting seea eea un et al 2014a b both frameworks include accounting for biological natural resources but the former system treats environmental assets individually and the latter one applies a system approach un et al 2014b fig a1 in appendix a presents the scope and differences between seea cf and seea eea in this paper environmental economic accounting refers to a broad concept that covers the scope of accounting under both seea cf and seea eea ecosystem accounting in turn is defined here as the accounting for ecosystem assets and ecosystem services ess as in hein et al 2015 further following hein et al 2015 we define natural capital as environmental assets that provide benefits to humans ecosystem assets are thus considered as a type of natural capital on the european level two major initiatives the mapping and assessment of the ecosystems and their services maes and the knowledge implementation project on the integrated system for natural capital and ecosystem services accounting kip inca play an integral role in developing ecosystem accounting they attempt to implement the eu biodiversity strategy for 2020 by improving the visibility of ess and by providing support for es valuation and the integration of ess into existing environmental economic accounting and reporting systems kip inca report 2016 maes et al 2016 as part of the national maes process finland has recently taken the first steps toward the identification and monitoring of the state and development of ess and biodiversity by developing national ecosystem services indicators finnish es indicators www biodiversity fi ecosystemservices home see mononen et al 2016 environmental economic accounting however has deeper roots in finland autio et al 2013 hoffrén and salomaa 2014 existing environmental economic accounts include data on raw material consumption energy supply and use waste generation greenhouse gas emissions business activities of the environmental goods and services sector and environmental protection expenditures statistics finland 2017a ecosystem assets and services however are not yet part of the finnish environmental economic accounting scheme operated by statistics finland therefore this paper explores how finnish es indicators could be integrated into ecosystem accounting and how future work related to such integration could support the final goal of including ess into finnish environmental economic accounts for this purpose two case studies following the approaches provided by seea eea are elaborated ecosystem accounting for 1 water related ess and 2 fish provisioning services from marine ecosystems the latter case study can be regarded as a subset of water related ess but is presented separately for the sake of clarity and due to the different methodological approaches used the motivations for the choice of these particular case study topics were their high relevance to the economy and the fairly good availability of data related to them methodologically seea cf and seea water un 2012 provide guidelines for asset surface water and groundwater stocks supply and use accounts for water resources unep et al 2017 by contrast seea eea is applicable to ecosystem accounting which can consider comprehensive aquatic ecosystems and other water related ess in a systematic way earlier studies have applied seea eea to incorporate es mapping and quantification data into ecosystem accounting from the regional to the continental scale khan et al 2015 la notte et al 2017a office for national statistic 2016 remme et al 2014 2015 schröter et al 2014 waves 2017 according to hein et al 2015 no case studies existed at the time of publication that would have compiled an es use account in practice later la notte et al 2017a provided data on actual es flows of nitrogen retention used by two types of beneficiaries however the results from la notte et al 2017a are too aggregated to be integrated into the sna in the waves project 2017 physical supply and use accounts for the ess of carbon sequestration and storage water supply in guatemala were compiled but monetary use accounts were still missing khan et al 2015 provided an outline of use accounts for freshwater ess in the uk by identifying the beneficiaries which can be regarded as the first step toward compiling es use accounts the first case study of the present paper aims to take one step forward by developing physical and monetary water es use accounts compatible with the sna our second case study demonstrates the provisioning services of three commercially important fish species in the baltic sea herring clupea harengus membras sprat sprattus sprattus and cod gadus morhua luke 2017 regarding fish provisioning services some countries have already compiled asset accounts for fishery resources based on the well developed seea cf approach abs 2012 statistics south africa 2012 anna 2017 these accounts contain data on fish stock fish catch and economic activities within the fishery sector however understanding their links to whole marine ecosystems requires the application of ecosystem accounting and seea eea the literature on marine ecosystem accounting is still scarce most of the existing papers focus on coastal ecosystems and emphasize experiments on compiling ecosystem extent and condition accounts abs 2015 eigenraam et al 2016 weber 2014 eigenraam et al 2016 and abs 2015 included fish provisioning services in their ecosystem accounting but neither of them estimated the capacity for the ecosystem to provide this es in principle ecosystem capacity connects an ecosystem asset with ess as it represents the ability of an ecosystem asset to generate a set of ess in a sustainable way un et al 2014b unep et al 2017 in practice however seea eea does not instruct how ecosystem capacity should be measured unep et al 2017 and the best way to define and measure ecosystem capacity has remained a somewhat controversial issue in the case of terrestrial ecosystems hein et al 2016 and la notte et al 2017a use ecosystem capacity contradictorily the former defines ecosystem capacity as a flow of an es that is generated at sustainable level and the latter defines ecosystem capacity as a stock that provides a sustainable es stock quantifies the state of an ecosystem at one point in time while flow always has a temporal dimension with several time points this paper thus reviews both approaches to ecosystem capacity and proposes an operational measurement of this metric for marine fish provisioning services to sum up ecosystem accounting is still at the experimental stage and many concepts have not yet been operationalized this study with its two case studies serves as a pilot for the evaluation of data availability and the potential ways to integrate finnish es indicators into national environmental economic accounts methodologically seea eea approaches and the outcomes from the common international classification of ecosystem services cices and maes processes are evaluated this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a general framework to integrate finnish es indicators and environmental economic accounts through ecosystem accounting procedures with a basic description of ecosystem accounting and the finnish es indicators section 3 presents the two case studies section 4 discusses how the finnish es indicators could be improved to facilitate ecosystem accounting and the implementation of the integration framework 2 material and methods this section briefly reviews the finnish es indicators and the relevant seea eea accounts fig 1 illustrates our schematic framework for the integration of finnish es indicators into environmental economic accounts and table 1 lists definitions of ecosystem accounts that appear in fig 1 the finnish es indicators follow the cices classification system and the so called cascade model mononen et al 2016 the use of the cascade model structured the resulting indicators into four different categories 1 1 in the original cascade model there is a fifth category ess between the function and benefit indicators 1 structure 2 function 3 benefit and 4 value haines young and potschin 2010 2 1 use of structure and function indicators to develop ecosystem extent and condition accounts structure indicators fig 1 define and measure the biophysical prerequisites for functioning ecosystems various land cover statistics have been used to link habitat type and ess in finnish es indicators especially the extent of these habitats across finland mononen et al 2016 when available habitat condition data are included in the structure indicators e g water quality or species assemblage and function indicators e g productivity of an area in a certain unit of time although spatial ecosystem condition data are still rare geographical information system gis tools and spatial format data are commonly used but are not compulsory for ecosystem extent and condition accounts hein et al 2015 unep et al 2017 thus the structure and function indicators in finnish es indicators can provide direct input to the ecosystem extent and condition accounts for some types of ess the natural resource stock information in existing environmental economic accounts can act as an indicator for condition accounts see the example of water stocks in section 3 1 2 2 2 use of structure and function indicators to develop ecosystem capacity accounts table 2 summarizes ecosystem capacity definitions from the recent literature all these publications measured capacity based on a single es but only hein et al 2016 calls for sustainability assessment at the ecosystem level the definition of capacity from hein et al 2015 is based on the degradation of ecosystem conditions which complicates its use the approach from hein et al 2016 creates different possibilities for capacity which may hamper the sustainability assessment of actual es flows la notte et al 2017a followed villamagna et al 2013 to treat capacity as a stock but also provided a flow indicator sustainable flow that serves a similar function to capacity as used in the other literature summarized in table 2 to determine whether capacity should be treated as a flow or stock we clarify the relations between capacity and ecosystem assets presented in the literature in the case study from la notte et al 2017a the physical term of the capacity was measured as the total area of constructed wetlands that was required therefore it is unclear how these imaginary wetlands are linked to real ecosystem extent and how they reflect the ability of the existing ecosystem asset to provide sustainable flows however the flow concept of capacity in other publications hein et al 2015 2016 schröter et al 2014 is clearly represented as the sustainable level of an es flow provided by an existing ecosystem in this paper we follow hein et al 2016 and hein et al 2015 and define ecosystem capacity as a flow that is the sustainable level of an es generated by a given ecosystem asset under current ecosystem management and es use and the sustainable level is the maximum level of es used that does not negatively affect the future supply of that or other ess thus when the actual es use is above the ecosystem capacity es use that results in ecosystem degradation and decreases the capacity in the next accounting period is not sustainable hein et al 2016 the capacity is subject to changes in the management system and in other factors affecting ecosystem condition hein et al 2015 2016 la notte et al 2017a schröter et al 2014 in finnish es indicators function indicators fig 1 define the ability of an ecosystem to produce ess within a certain timeframe this delivery of ess representing the total ess that are generated from an ecosystem follows the supply definition of ess from burkhard et al 2012 supply of ess refers to the capacity of a particular area to provide a specific bundle of ecosystem goods and services within a given time period the capacity and definition in burkhard et al 2012 neither indicates whether the ess are used nor whether the potential use has been sustainable therefore the application of such function indicators in ecosystem accounting requires an estimate for the sustainable level of es use in the given timeframe in addition a change in ecosystem extent influences the level of function indicators and thus ecosystem extent should also be considered when estimating ecosystem capacity since sustainability levels are not available in finnish es indicators at this moment we explore the potential candidates of capacity indicators from fishery sciences although sustainable catch was defined as the capacity for fish provisioning in un et al 2014b and un et al 2014a demonstrated an example of the sustainable yield of fish resources for a simple single species case the definition of sustainable catch is still manifold in fisheries management literature piet et al 2017 tested several single species based sustainable indicators including surplus production single species maximum sustainable yield msy and reproductive capacity to be used as capacity indicators for fish provisioning services however we decided to use multispecies msy which considers food web interactions as an input for our capacity account for three reasons 1 research has found evidence for interactions among herring sprat and cod in the baltic sea and multispecies biological reference points for sustainable harvest have been advised for fishery management objectives collie and gislason 2001 gislason 1999 ices 2013 walters et al 2005 2 in national accounts the account structure is divided by sectors e g fishery sector or aquaculture sector but not by species statistics finland 2017b 3 the latest kip inca report la notte et al 2017b mentioned that the final process for accounting fish provisioning services should consider food web interactions although the report currently follows the surplus production method from piet et al 2017 for single species 2 3 use of benefit indicators to develop physical es supply accounts benefit indicators fig 1 express the used share of total ess generated from an ecosystem mononen et al 2016 e g the share of wild berry yields that have been harvested by people or the volume of groundwater extracted for human purposes this indicator has the same meaning as the actual es flows in ecosystem accounting schröter et al 2014 thus benefit indicators can be used to compile physical es supply accounts 2 4 development of the physical es use account the current finnish es indicators can contribute little to a physical es use account compiling es use accounts requires detailed data about the users of ess but finnish es indicators lack such data es user data relies on the collection of social economic statistics existing information about sectors in the sna could also help in understanding the sectors use of some ess unep et al 2017 even though the data sources for supply and use accounts may be different compiling es supply and use accounts should occur at the same time and in an iterative fashion so that the data for both accounts can be complemented or fine tuned to balance the two accounts according to the principles of sna unep et al 2017 this balance between supply and use accounts means that the total domestic supply of an es is either used by domestic beneficiaries or exported to the rest of the world hein et al 2016 unep et al 2017 2 5 use of value indicators to develop monetary es supply accounts the value indicators fig 1 in finnish es indicators are divided into four categories 1 economic 2 social 3 health and 4 intrinsic values this approach was modified from the uk national ecosystem assessment 2011 economic value reflects the economic statistics of monitored or observed values social value relates to metrics such as the number of jobs the data for economic and social values are usually estimated or collected from other socio economic statistics health value is poorly developed but it has been noted that the degradation of some ess will lead to negative impacts on human health and thus to increased societal costs e g lampi et al 1992 intrinsic value is mainly qualitative and especially reflects cultural values such as national identity and historical relevance and it can be attributed to every living system within these four types of value social value does not need to be incorporated into ecosystem accounting since sna data already include social value among labor inputs eu et al 2009 among the remaining value types economic value representing a middle transaction step in a value chain from nature to humans is the only value type that meets the valuation standard for accounting depending on the es type the procedures required to apply economic value indicators to supply accounts are different in the finnish es indicators the economic indicators of provisioning services and some cultural services like recreational services that have market prices are estimated by producer income in this case the monetary value of an es supply is measured as a resource rent which is derived by deducting the operational costs from the producer income and then adjusting the result with taxes or subsidies un et al 2014a 2014b remme et al 2015 the operational costs include intermediate costs labor costs and user costs of fixed capital which are all itemized in the sna data eu et al 2009 most regulation services and some cultural services do not have markets in finnish es indicators some such ess are valued by methods compatible with seea eea e g the avoided cost approach for water retention or erosion control un et al 2014b in such cases the economic value from finnish es indicators can be used directly in the compilation of monetary es supply accounts in all cases the monetary and physical es supply accounts need to correspond to each other in a given year 2 6 development of the monetary es use account the monetary es use account is compiled based on 1 sectors use from the physical es use accounts and 2 the unit value of ess from monetary es supply accounts as in the physical account monetary use and supply need to follow the balance rule in addition like ess supply the monetary and physical terms of the es use account need to correspond 2 7 development of the monetary ecosystem asset account compiling the monetary ecosystem asset account requires three steps 2 7 1 step 1 estimate the physical term of expected es flows estimating the patterns of ess that an ecosystem asset can provide in the future the so called physical terms of expected es flows un et al 2014b is challenging due to the complex dynamic and non linear changes in ecosystems hein et al 2016 such an estimation requires information about the possible es demand in the future which could be based on but may not necessarily equal current actual es flows as the sustainability of both current ess and possible future es demand influences the pattern of future ess an ecosystem capacity account is also needed to estimate the expected es flows fig 1 un et al 2014b hein et al 2016 in our marine fish provisioning case we used a multispecies bio economic model from nieminen et al 2016 and nieminen et al 2012 to estimate physical expected es flows the model not only follows the multispecies assumption from the capacity account but also has the ability to consider ecosystem condition factors such as salinity to increase the accuracy of stock estimations the applied model is an age structured model describing the food web interactions of cod herring and sprat the economics of the fishery sector and the impacts of fishing on the stocks of the three fish species 2 7 2 step 2 estimate the monetary term of expected es flows this estimation requires the results of physical expected es flows and the monetary value of the es supply account the unit value of ess calculated from the es supply account has to also incorporate the inflation rate before being multiplied with the physical expected es flows un et al 2014a 2 7 3 step 3 estimate the monetary value of an ecosystem asset by discounting the monetary value of expected es flows each ecosystem asset is valued as the net present value npv of the expected es flows of multiple ess that the ecosystem can provide multiple ess are required to estimate the value of an ecosystem asset comprehensively the length of expected es flows that an ecosystem asset can provide is called asset life if the current and expected use of the es is sustainable asset life can be forever in the accounting sense however a maximum asset life e g 25 or 30 years is determined to value ecosystem assets since the npv usually becomes very low after this period un et al 2014b unep et al 2017 the results of ecosystem accounts can be further integrated into existing environmental economic accounts in many different ways un et al 2014a 2014b fig 1 shows two examples of integrating monetary ecosystem accounts the current finnish es indicators provide an overview of the key ess although there is a lack of detailed data in many of the indicators the collection of spatial data for mapping structure and function indicators is progressing via the on going maes process at the same time there is an ongoing demand for the development of benefit and value indicators in the case studies section 3 some of the lacking data are supplemented by alternative data sources to make the ecosystem account testing in this paper as comprehensive as possible 3 case studies in this section we present two examples water related ess and fish provisioning in marine ecosystems to implement the integration framework proposed in section 2 in both cases we begin with an overview of the whole ecosystem however when compiling es supply and use accounts and estimating the expected es flows we focus only on the selected ess in order to test the implementation of the integration framework 3 1 ecosystem accounts for water related ess in this case study we propose how services provided by aquatic ecosystems and the different uses of water in its various forms and from different sources could be incorporated into ecosystem accounting the focus is on open water ecosystems wetlands atmospheric water and water in terrestrial ecosystems are not analyzed in detail we start by defining the system boundaries of our analysis and then continue by testing the compilation of physical ecosystem asset accounts as well as es supply and use accounts by following the integration framework fig 1 and seea eea accounts for capacity expected es flows and ecosystem monetary assets are not tested in this case study asset accounts comprising ecosystem extent and condition accounts for open water ecosystems build mainly on previous work conducted with the finnish es indicators es supply and use accounts are tested for water abstraction for other types of water related provisioning regulating and cultural services we outline potential formats and data sources for their supply and use accounts fig 2 describes the ecosystems functions and services of water related ess 3 1 1 system boundaries water is present in all three major compartments of the planet aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere they all provide water related services that should be acknowledged in accounts rainfall including snowfall is part of the hydrological cycle which unep et al 2017 recommends considering in ecosystem accounting soil and groundwater are elements of terrestrial ecosystems freshwater ecosystems include open waters e g river ecosystems and lake ecosystems and wetlands khan et al 2015 wetlands include swamps mires and peatlands shallow lakes and riparian zones which together make up to 25 of the total land area of finland biodiversity fi 2014 wijesingha 2016 this case study however focuses on open freshwaters and on freshwater itself in various ecosystems as illustrated in fig 2 3 1 2 ecosystem extent and condition accounts 3 1 2 1 inland waters the extent of the open water ecosystems in finland is summarized in table 3 the total area of inland water bodies is 11 4 of the total land area of the country the finnish national land survey updates data on the total area of inland water bodies annually in ecosystem accounting the stock of water resources is treated as a characteristic indicator in the ecosystem condition account khan et al 2015 unep et al 2017 the total volume of the inland water bodies in table 3 is calculated by multiplying the total surface water area by the average depth of approximately 7 m for finnish inland lakes kettunen et al 2008 finnish es indicators have several species related indicators for inland waters including threatened inland water species and the conservation status of species identified in the eu habitats directive in table 3 the proportions of inland water species with favorable status in two climatic regions boreal and alpine are given together with data on inland surface water quality 3 1 2 2 groundwater finland has 6 020 classified aquifers approximately 3 800 of which are classified as important or potentially applicable for water supply purposes syke 2016 next to these aquifers groundwater is present practically everywhere in the subsurface and the bedrock but its volume and chemical status are difficult to assess in general groundwater quality and productivity vary greatly outside the classified aquifers an asset account for groundwater is presented in table 4 following a similar structure to that for inland open waters in this case however the ecosystem extent represents the aquifer area classified as important for or applicable to water supply rather than the overall total classified aquifers 2 2 finnish es indicators include the extent and water productivity for total classified aquifers however to keep the data range consistent throughout the account we chose an alternative data source or a specific ecosystem type condition indicators are also presented for the same range of data the ecosystem condition indicators reflect the connections between groundwater quality and terrestrial ecosystems including the human activities and management practices affecting them groundwater quality is adversely affected primarily by chemical or microbiological contamination caused by contaminated sites of various kinds and origin e g agriculture industry and small scale businesses molarius and poussa 2001 syke 2016 and on going activities such as road deicing 3 1 3 supply and use accounts 3 1 3 1 abstracted water in finland surface water uptake 2 0 km3 including artificial recharge accounted for approximately 1 4 of the total surface water stock in 2010 and groundwater uptake 0 2 km3 from aquifers classified valuable for water supply was approximately 10 of their annual groundwater productivity salminen et al 2017 surface water and groundwater are also used for cooling of the total 8 1 km3 used for this purpose 20 1 8 km3 is fresh surface water the shares of groundwater and brackish water are 0 1 and 80 respectively salminen et al 2017 even though the rates of abstraction are well below the rate of formation of groundwater and the stock of surface water evaluating whether the rates are locally safe or sustainable requires additional analysis on their local long term effects kløve et al 2011 a summary of the flow volumes from the environment to the economy sectors es use accounts is presented in table a2 in appendix a which shows that 20 sectors out of the 26 abstract water from the environment the total groundwater use 0 3 km3 in table a2 is higher than the groundwater uptake mentioned above the reason is that the groundwater abstraction volume in table a2 includes groundwater uptake outside the aquifers classified valuable for water supply of the abstracted fresh surface water and groundwater approximately 0 4 km3 is used by the water supply sector nace 3 3 nace is statistical classification of economic activities in the european community which classify the industries in different sectors eurostat 2008 36 to produce mains water table a2 also shows the aggregate mains water volumes delivered within the 26 economy sectors in finland in 2010 we use the volume of water abstracted by the water supply sector to estimate the resource rent as mains water reflects market pricing based on the input output data from finnish national statistics statistics finland 2017c the total production of the water supply sector is 588 million eur based on the valuation approach described in section 2 5 the operational surplus 75 million eur in the input output data can be regarded as resource rent for the ess used 403 472 465 m3 by the water supply sector the unit resource rent of ess thus is 0 186 eur for 1 m3 of abstracted water the resource rent that each sector should pay for its water abstraction from groundwater and surface water can be seen in table a2 3 1 3 2 return flows from the economy to the environment water flows from the economy to the environment generally consist of abstracted water that is returned after use the physical and chemical composition however changes during the use phase depending on the purpose for which it has been used for cooling water thermal load is generally the most relevant impact for other waters e g at a wastewater treatment plant the removal or recovery of various aqueous substances such as nutrients organic compounds and particles is required prior to introduction back to the water body in many cases the abstracted water is returned to another water body rather than its original water source for instance abstracted groundwater is returned to a surface water body and abstracted freshwaters are introduced into the sea even though nutrient removal rates have significantly improved over the years in finland säylä and vilpas 2012 the natural biological and physicochemical processes in the receiving bodies or said regulating services are still needed to buffer the impacts of the remaining substances in addition to the returned water flows described above various substances are also washed out from land areas to groundwater and surface water bodies by precipitated water in the receiving water bodies various physical chemical and microbial attenuating processes remove aqueous substances and reduce their concentrations the emission accounts tattari et al 2015 for phosphorus p and nitrogen n also provide data for p loading from airborne deposits and natural leaching to inland water which is useful for the estimation of relations among human activities p cycling and water quality the data provided by tattari et al 2015 were recently improved in salminen et al 2017 but they remain rather general with only 16 aggregated sectors for substances other than n and p emission accounts are still missing how much and how effectively water bodies can dilute remove or immobilize various emissions and how these emissions affect them and the ess they provide remain open questions 3 1 3 3 ess from in situ water and rainfall while recent improvements in water accounting for abstracted water and emissions to water in finland provide a solid basis for the careful assessment of water flow accounts from the environment to the economy within the economy and from the economy to the environment many more data related challenges are encountered in other forms of water use from an accounting perspective however it is evident that a vast majority of economic sectors depend solely on abstracted water subsequently the number of individual sectors which use other provisioning regulating and cultural services is quite limited table 5 the sectors of the finnish economy for which atmospheric water rainfall and in situ use passive use of open waters are relevant are summarized in table 5 first crop growth mainly depends on precipitation as only 3 of the fields in finland are equipped with irrigation facilities tike 2013 and not all of these fields are irrigated each year depending on the weather conditions during the growing season for instance in 2010 19 of the 68 600 ha with irrigation facilities was indeed irrigated tike 2013 occasional irrigation is limited to open air cultivation of vegetables berries and fruits and potatoes the remaining crops including cereals are watered with rain similarly forests i e forestry in finland depend fully on rainwater as do natural products such as berries mushrooms and other wild growing non wood products water in the form of snow is also essential for many skiing centers and other winter sports activities other relevant sectors for provisioning services are fishing aquaculture the production of electricity with hydropower and water transport for these industries the economic value they produce is indicated in table 5 together with examples of the various types of ess these sectors use 3 2 ecosystem accounts for marine ecosystems and fish provisioning services in this section we present an example compilation of a full set of accounts for marine fish provisioning for herring sprat and cod for this case we compile the accounts for 2012 herring and sprat constituted over 90 of the finnish marine landings in 2012 luke 2017 cod was selected as an example for measuring sustainable use and for testing the capacity account compilation as cod has been overfished and its populations are still low ices 2013 2015a 3 2 1 ecosystem asset accounts the ecosystem extent of marine ecosystems for a country is defined as the country s exclusive economic zone eez un et al 2014b the eez helps to identify local marine resources that should be included in national ecosystem accounts but the species we focus on migrates across the baltic sea therefore we first dealt with fish provisioning services from the perspective of the whole baltic sea and then considered the finnish share of the catch to integrate the es data into finnish accounts for fish provisioning services and for fish stock formation in particular water temperature oxygen and salinity are important factors e g koster et al 2005 and ottersen et al 2006 and the fish stock level further determines the capacity to provide fish thus such factors are advised to be included in ecosystem accounts un et al 2014b however finnish es indicators only provide information on the overall status of coastal waters and the concentrations of n and p table 6 shows the asset accounts of finnish marine ecosystems which include the ecosystem extent and condition indicators from finnish es indicators unlike in accounting for water current seea eea and related documents un et al 2014b unep et al 2017 do not clarify how to link the seea cf asset account of fish stock to ecosystem accounting recall that in the water example water stock serves as a condition indicator in ecosystem accounting in addition species related indicators e g species richness are considered as ecosystem condition indicators un et al 2014b therefore we also present the spawning stock biomass ssb of the fish stocks in the ecosystem condition account the finnish es indicators use ssb data from the international council for the exploration of the sea ices as a function indicator so we also used ices as one of our data sources the finnish share of the ssb is estimated based on the ssbs of the three species in the baltic sea and the finnish catch share see table a3 in appendix a 3 2 2 es supply and use accounts the finnish es indicators define fish catch as a benefit indicator thus we also use fish catch data to populate the es use and supply accounts table 7 the total supply of fish should include commercial fisheries together with recreational and household catch un et al 2014b without further division of data between recreational and household catch we place commercial and recreational catch into the es supply and use accounts recreational fish catch should be allocated to the recreational sector nace 93 and all commercial catch should be considered as the es use from fishery sectors nace 031 based on eurostat 2008 unlike abstracted water which can be acquired from different ecosystems all marine fish catch is provided by marine ecosystems the landing value of these three species totaled 26 6 million eur in 2012 luke 2015 based on the input output data from finnish national statistics statistics finland 2017c an operating surplus without a net mixed income in the fishery sector accounted for 13 5 of the total income of the whole fishery sector in 2012 the operating surplus was calculated by subtracting all operational costs from the total production value in the fishery sector this calculation considered the effects of taxes subsidies and mixed income without further information about the cost structure we use this operating surplus percentage of the total production value 13 5 as a proxy for the resource rent percentage of the landing value 26 6 million eur thus the resource rent of the three species in 2012 was approximately 3 6 million eur table 7 and the unit resource rent was 28 eur per ton recreational fishing is commonly identified as a cultural service ahtiainen and öhman 2013 magnussen and kettunen 2013 pope et al 2016 and thus the approach for valuing recreational services should be used for recreational catch un et al 2014b 3 2 3 ecosystem capacity accounts to use multispecies msy as a capacity indicator we multiplied the total multispecies msy estimated by ices 2013 with the finnish catch share table 8 by comparing the finnish multispecies msy with actual es use table 7 the results show that the sprat harvest slightly exceeded the sustainable level while herring and cod were harvested sustainably 3 2 4 the expected es flows and ecosystem monetary asset account to demonstrate the estimation of physical expected es flows with updated parameters we apply the model from nieminen et al 2016 and nieminen et al 2012 salinity often used as an ecosystem condition parameter affects cod stock development nieminen et al 2012 as no salinity information is available in the current ecosystem condition account we chose the current salinity level as bad condition for cod recruitment based on ices 2015a in addition the average values for 2011 2013 were used for the biological parameters in the model nieminen et al 2016 corresponding to the accounting year 2012 of our case study for the expected es demand we assumed that the future demand of this es remains similar to the demand in the accounting year hence for human related parameters such as prices and fishing mortality the average values for 2011 2013 were chosen since the model was designed to simulate the fish stock of the whole baltic sea the updated price was determined as the average for the countries surrounding the baltic sea by using data from the eu 2015 the updated fishing mortality data were from ices 2015a as in other accounts the finnish catch share was used to calculate the physical expected es flows for finland table a4 the expected es flows of cod follow a decreasing trend until the end of asset life this implies that the determined fishing mortality of cod is higher than the fishing mortality for cod harvested at capacity level in the model which means that expected es flows are higher than the capacity by contrast the expected harvests estimated for herring and sprat are anticipated to increase in the later years of the asset life so the expected es flows for these two species are anticipated to be within the capacity next we use the resource rent of current es use 28 eur per tons of fish to estimate the resource rent of expected es flows the inflation rate in 2012 2013 was 2 2 eurostat 2017 and thus we assumed that the unit resource rent will increase by 2 2 every year by multiplying the total physical expected es by the unit resource rent we get the value of expected es flows table a4 further by discounting the value of expected es flows by a 2 discount rate 4 4 this discount rate was determined to be same as the discount rate used in the model for estimating the physical expected es flows the estimated npv of the expected es flows totals 90 million eur the sum can also be regarded as a partial value of finnish marine ecosystems the total value of finnish marine ecosystems can be estimated only when all current use types of ess are considered 4 discussion the two case studies provide evidence that finnish es indicators can contribute to ecosystem accounting particularly in regard to ecosystem extent and condition accounts asset accounts data in finnish es indicators however are not updated regularly a limitation already identified during the indicator development process mononen et al 2016 therefore a single year compilation of accounts cannot be used to evaluate sustainability issues and potential environmental degradation such degradation can only be revealed when the ecosystem condition or capacity decreases unep et al 2017 and observing such a change requires data from more than one year to serve as a source of input data for ecosystem accounting finnish es indicators should be collected and updated on a regular basis in this paper some of the ecosystem condition indicators were selected based on their data format and the completeness of the database ideally ecosystem condition indicators should reflect the services in question for example salinity plays a key role in determining the capacity of marine ecosystems to provide fish however a salinity indicator is currently missing from the finnish es indicator database and therefore cannot be used to populate the condition account for the marine fish provisioning service because the contents of finnish es indicators are not updated regularly and do not provide all relevant data this paper uses alternative sources to populate the ecosystem accounts however in the case of water related ess the data used were not strictly from one particular year this results in some methodological inconsistency and minor inaccuracy when the data are combined with economic data representing one particular year groundwater productivity table 4 for instance is based on the average infiltration rate over several years rather than that for one year in spite of this the case study still demonstrates the principles of how ecosystem account compilation for water related ess could be accomplished in present finnish es indicators undetermined thresholds of sustainability levels for es provisioning create a challenge in compiling capacity accounts due to this challenge the physical expected es flows and monetary ecosystem asset accounts could not be compiled for the two case studies by using finnish es indicators developing approaches and models to overcome these shortcomings and challenges is paramount for using the indicators in accounting and even more importantly for using accounting in sustainability assessments in the marine fish provisioning case we first used multispecies msy as the sustainability indicator and then used a multispecies bio economic model to estimate the expected es flows in our application the capacity that was used for estimating expected es flows was determined by the model rather than using the value from capacity accounts however the results in section 3 2 3 and section 3 2 4 do not conflict one identified the sustainability of current es use but the other showed the sustainability of potential future es use we recommend that these two stages be reconciled in future accounting systems nevertheless this example still provides a starting point for future work in both developing the sustainability indicators and capacity accounts and estimating the expected ecosystem service flows in summary the present finnish es indicators could be used in their current form to compile ecosystem extent condition and es supply accounts for some ess e g the supply of fish provisioning is available in finnish es indicators furthermore finnish es indicators have the potential to be used in the development of capacity accounts if the sustainability levels for function indicators can be estimated the effects of ecosystem condition change on the capacity of an ecosystem can be identified this will help to attain the ideal of capacity accounts being closely linked to ecosystem condition accounts hein et al 2015 unep et al 2017 the water case study recognized the various water related ess provided by aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere as stated in the case study water related accounting should cover the entire hydrological cycle and the various forms water snow and ice and sources of water since they all provide relevant services for the economy that is environment economy interactions moreover the accounts could also be used to study the interactions and dependencies among the various ecosystems to answer questions about how using a particular es may affect the ability of other ecosystems to provide particular services an essential question regarding the compatibility of ecosystem accounting with sna is whether various ess are identified in frameworks such as cices and the final ecosystem goods and services classification system fegs cs and how explicitly they are defined the finnish es indicators were compiled using the current version of cices 4 3 in which precipitation rainfall is categorized as surface water for non drinking purposes in the fegs cs documentation bordt 2016 precipitation and its various uses beneficiaries within the economy are explicitly expressed as the forest sector managed forest is highly dependent on precipitation and is the major contributor to the finnish economy considering fegs cs in the future development of finnish es indicators might increase the accuracy of the accounts and their relevance in decision making this study indicates that cices classification v 4 3 as such would not be explicit enough for the sna which poses a risk that the outcomes from the application of cices classification do not meet the needs of environmental economic accounts if this is the case integration of ess into the sna may prove problematic hence we call for closer collaboration between ecologists working with es classification and sna experts to guarantee that the documentation produced supports the integration of ess into the present structures of economic accounting the output from ecosystem accounts can be used as input to an integrated account that unifies ecosystem accounting data with standard national account data for instance the results of ecosystem monetary asset accounts can be incorporated into a balance sheet another example is that the results of es supply and use accounts can be used as inputs to extended supply and use tables or input output tables and they can further be used in input output or computable general equilibrium models to support decision making unep et al 2017 in economic studies the outcomes from such models traditionally reveal the interactions among various sectors as well as the supply and use of intermediary and final products populating these various tables with ecosystem accounting data can help acknowledge the relations between ess and sectors currently present in the sna the integration framework fig 1 implies the importance of integrating the two systems for decision making changes in structure and function indicators affect the extent condition and capacity accounts es supply and use accounts reflect human activities by comparing these accounting data across several years or by applying the account data to an input output or computable general equilibrium model it is possible to analyze the impacts of economic activities and specific policies on ecosystems 5 conclusions halting the alarming deterioration of the environment and enhancing the integration of environmental and socio economic indicators are both defined as motivations in the eu s biodiversity strategy and the 7th environment action programme the practical measures of the maes working group and kip inca project aim at integrating an environmental perspective into national accounting systems this paper serves as a pilot to test how data from finnish es indicators can be used for ecosystem accounting the two case studies show that although the es indicators were not originally designed from an accounting perspective they could be used in compiling ecosystem accounts following the seea eea statistical framework the pilot also noted data gaps

25301,we analyzed the main factors that controlled the prey predator dynamics of two invasive ctenophores mnemiopsis leidyi and beroe ovata in the black sea using a demographic model we assessed the bottom up cascading effect from edible zooplankton to its consumer m leidyi and its predator b ovata for these purposes we used life cycles of both ctenophores ova larva juvenile transitional and adult stages variability of annual phenology and physiological features obtained from our field observations and experiments made in the north eastern black sea over 27 years combined with a long term change in temperature and food availability for both ctenophores model outputs were compared with field observations then model scenarios were tested to understand which environmental conditions control m leidyi and b ovata development using our model we found that the maximum annual abundances of m leidyi and b ovata increased with mean springtime temperature and development of spring early summer zooplankton which is important for creation of m leidyi abundance and consequently development of b ovata an assessment with changing concentration of the m leidyi food i e zooplankton at the time of its annual development changed the maximum annual values reached by m leidyi and consequently b ovata it was found that time of appearance of b ovata had changed to may since 2012 with increasing temperature and as a result m leidyi did not have time to reach high abundance being grazed by b ovata already since may model results were qualitatively the same as those from long term field observations as a result we obtained a model of two ctenophores interacting with total life structure duration and scale of reproduction growing from stage to stage mortality seasonal disappearance from water depending on temperature and prey availability similar analyses have never been done in the black sea and can be used for other seas where m leidyi or both ctenophores invaded keywords ctenophores invasion black sea mnemiopsis leidyi beroe ovata population dynamics long term data ecophysiology model assessment 1 introduction the invasion of the carnivorous ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi a agassiz 1865 in the black sea in the early 1980s vinogradov et al 1989 and its dispersal to other seas of the mediterranean basin and the caspian sea caused major negative perturbations in these basins this was a most dramatic example of non native species effects on pelagic ecosystems shiganova et al 2004 finenko et al 2003 a decade after the m leidyi invasion the arrival of its predator ctenophore beroe ovata sensu mayer 1912 in the black sea reversed the situation and the ecosystem started to recover shiganova et al 2014 understanding the mechanisms that control the size of the m leidyi population in the black sea is especially important because m leidyi is rapidly expanding around european seas and b ovata follows it in many cases shiganova et al in press we analyzed field data for 27 years of observations of m leidyi before b ovata and after its arrival and edible zooplankton in the black sea the same combined reproductive sequence of m leidyi and b ovata took place every year but with differences in value of abundance time and duration of seasonal development of two species determined by food concentration edible zooplankton for m leidyi and m leidyi for b ovata temperature and other environmental parameters wind created different scale patchiness of distribution shiganova et al 2014 to better understand these processes we used a population dynamics model to assess the mechanism of interaction at three trophic levels of the black sea ecosystem the carnivorous ctenophores mnemiopsis leidyi and beroe ovata which are strong drivers of ecosystem state now edible zooplankton and temperature in the model we analyze annual and seasonal variability of both invaders as well as their relationships and bottom up cascading effects from edible zooplankton to its consumer mnemiopsis leidyi and to beroe ovata based on experimental and long term field data from the north eastern black sea previous modelling assessments have been based mainly on published parameters obtained from mnemiopsis leidyi in its native habitats while beroe ovata has never before been included in a modelling assessment kremer and kremer 1982 oguz et al 2008 2012 salihoglu et al 2011 in addition there was no comprehensive study which describes bottom up effects of the two main drivers of the black sea mnemiopsis leidyi and beroe ovata which include their population capacity dynamics phenology interactions and control of m leidyi development by b ovata we assess the most important driving functions and test hypotheses that the availability of food i e zooplankton for m leidyi and m leidyi for b ovata and temperature have control over the duration of annual development and variability of interannual abundances our population dynamics model takes into account the life cycles and physiological features of the two ctenophores as a synthesis of field observations and eco physiological laboratory experiments obtained in the north eastern black sea over 27 years 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the main ctenophore habitat is the coastal waters from where they spread with the current to open areas our observations were conducted in the north eastern black sea with a starting sight in the coastal area of blue bay and offshore blue bay is a small semi enclosed and shallow water body depth between 7 and 14 m there temperature varies from 6 c in winter to 27 c and sometimes 30 c in summer in last years and salinity from 17 to 18 the major driving force for the black sea rim current is cyclonic contour current on the continental slope of the black sea which forms the two rings in the western and eastern parts of the sea meandering of the rim current frontal zone causes the formation of eddies mainly anticyclonic which migrate offshore and exchange waters and their fauna between the coastal and offshore areas in addition wind driven ekman transport which is in a direction normal to the coastline affects the concentration numerical abundance and biomass of plankton in the coastal zone zatsepin et al 2010 shiganova et al 2014 2 2 field data most of the data on mesozoo and gelatinous plankton were collected during expeditions of the p p shirshov institute of oceanology of russian academy of sciences in the northeastern black sea from 1992 to 2004 in addition in 2000 and up to the present time 2017 samples were collected within the blue bay and offshore in the north eastern black sea along a transect from the blue bay up to 1000 m for present estimations we took into consideration the inshore waters where water depths ranged from 7 to 100 m in the blue bay and outside it fig 1 in addition samples of zooplankton and ctenophores were collected regularly around a year at monitoring station 7 m depth in blue bay the data for present model assessment were collected from stations 100 m depth some data for previous years were taken from pasternak 1983 khoroshilov and lukasheva 1999 and vinogradov et al 2002 2005 2006 in the present study temperature and salinity data were measured vertically with a ctd profiler zooplankton including eggs and larvae of ctenophores were collected with a juday plankton net 0 1 m2 opening 180 μm mesh size and gelatinous plankton with a bogorov rass br net 1 m2 opening 500 μm mesh size and a smaller size modification 0 2 m2 opening 500 μm mesh size all samples were collected using vertical hauls from the bottom to the surface in the area where there was not anoxic layer yet we did not use coefficient for insignificance catchability in our estimations which was used by vinogradov et al 2002 2005 2006 3 demographic model 3 1 model structure we developed a model to explore the processes involved in the coupling of the prey m leidyi and its predator b ovata these processes are included interactions between two species and forcing environmental variables we designed the model incorporating the known characteristics of the life cycles of two species the timing and amplitude of the seasonal abundances depended on biological rates such as spawning development growth and mortality in addition we used forcing environmental variables such as temperature and food concentration effect on these biological rates of the two ctenophores among them timing of appearance ctenophores in the water column start of reproduction maximal reproduction rate which coincided with maximum abundances of both ctenophores within the range of observations as usual in modelling the calibration of processes feeding spawning growing mortality was based on the known ranges of parameters which were either taken from unpublished field data and experiments conducted by one of the authors t a shiganova or came from the literature the model considered the ontogenic development of the species i e a period of time necessary for ovae to develop into larvae for the latter to develop the characteristic features and properties of juveniles and for juveniles to become adults this period of time from hatching to mature spawning is the generation time and it depended on the development rate at each step which is influenced by temperature and food this property is usually not considered in ecosystem models based on biomasses of species shiganova 2009 our field and experimental data taken into consideration were compared and verified with published data finenko et al 2003 kremer and kremer 1982 kremer 1976 1979 1994 kremer and reeve 1989 kremer et al 1986 reeve et al 1989 salihoglu et al 2011 thus our model considered four life cycle stages for each of the two ctenophore species i e ova larva juvenile and adult and each stage comprised several age classes a developmental time is ascribed to each stage which set the average time required for an individual to acquire the characteristics of the next stage the sum of time spent in each developmental stage gives the generation time this is summarized in fig 2 on fig 2 each line corresponds to ctenophore life stages which are aging age classes are schematically represented by rectangles the life stages of black sea m leidyi were defined on the base of experimental data as follows egg stage larvae hatched larva 03 04 mm growing cydippid larvae 2 10 mm larvae transition from cydippid to lobate juvenile 11 20 mm aging juvenile to maturity 21 30 mm adult beginning of maturity and beginning of reproduction 31 40 mm accepted as adult and 40 mm adult for b ovata life stages are egg stage 0 8 1 0 mm hatched larva 0 4 0 8 mm larva 8 mm juvenile 8 40 mm and adult 40 mm

increased which is more characteristic for july august the development rate was the proportion of individuals able to change stage that were effectively changing the rate of change is constant for ova

all stages were affected by the mortality rate which had two components the first was predation mortality which depended on the abundance of predators i e b ovata for m leidyi the second was natural mortality which combined all other causes natural mortality usually includes physiological disorders and diseases in the present model the rate of natural mortality was taken as constant within each stage except for adults where it was assumed to vary according to seasons in the model mortality was lower during winter when reproduction stopped and when temperature was 10 c making the hypothesis

function of the ingestion rate assuming that a proportion of the ingested and assimilated matter is converted into gametes also stimulated by temperature and food amount a minimum feeding rate was required to initiate reproduction assuming that this minimum amount of matter was necessary to cover the minimum metabolic requirements the predator b ovata ate exclusively m leidyi in the model the different stages of b ovata were assumed to have different ability to catch different m leidyi stages with exception the larvae of b ovata which fed exclusively the larvae of m leidyi fig 3 that defined a predation efficiency or predation preference the total biomass of m leidyi caught during one unit of time defined the volume of water which was swept clear of m leidyi the feeding rate of b ovata stages was not directly dependent on the biomass of m leidyi but on the fraction of that biomass which was available to each stage according to their predation efficiency the available food

simplifications were taken in model assessment other components than two species temperature and food were either ignored i e their influence on ctenophore species was assumed not important in general but had only local effect or were defined a priori i e taken as forcing functions micro and mesozooplankton were not considered separately and it was assumed that their proportions in zooplankton biomass were constant 3 7 model calibration the parameters used in the model were taken from laboratory experiments and subsequently modified to obtain time variations of abundances that correspond to observations we used seasonal development criteria for each species i e the period of presence during the year i e days from appearance to disappearance for m leidyi and the same for b ovata time of

main forcings temperature and zooplankton biomass were considered is presented in fig 5 this figure showed how model worked in the theoretical case for example from the fig 5 it was seen that the m leidyi reproduction became to be significant at the day 150 when zooplankton biomass reached the springtime bloom peak of about 15 mgc m 3 and water temperature reached 18 c fig 4 after the spring bloom zooplankton biomass decreased what induced the increase of m leidyi reproduction the second zooplankton bloom occurred in summer is the major factor in at the day 220 there were about 4000 ind m 3 of eggs and 5000 ind m 3 of larva these abundances of eggs and larva produced about 800 ind m 3 of juveniles and 100 ind m 3 of adults it is seen in fig 5 that approximately after day 200 larval stock became higher than egg stock what could be explained by the higher matter inflow from the previous stage ova transfer from ova to larva stage takes about 24h than its outflow due to mortality and transfer to juvenile stage such a high matter inflow is related to the highest spawning 4 results 4 1 interannual variability of m leidyi and b ovata in the black sea field observations with the arrival of b ovata in the black sea in 1997 in 1999 in the north eastern area considered here the period of the year during which m leidyi was present changed drastically until 1998 m leidyi occurred in sizable concentrations during spring summer and autumn and in warm years also in winters shiganova 1998 before b ovata arrival from 1999 m leidyi occurred in sizable concentrations only during one two or maximal three warm months of summer i e depending the seasonal appearance in water column and beginning of b ovata development shiganova et al 2014 their dynamics was determined by temperature and food availability zooplankton for m leidyi and m leidyi for b ovata therefore abundances of adult m leidyi and b ovata varied from year to year in the black sea fig 6 with great decreasing during last years the maximum annual abundances ranged over more than one order of magnitude for the two species i e adult m leidyi from 15 to 254 ind m 3 in 2003 and 2001 respectively and adult b ovata from 6 to 68 ind m 3 in 2009 and 2001 respectively during last years abundance of both species dropped and ranged from 3 4 ind m 3 to 1 56 ind m 3 of m leidyi and b ovata from 1 4 ind m 3 to 1 8 ind m 3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the observed succession of peaks of m leidyi and b ovata within each year suggested that the maximum annual abundance of the b ovata predator was related to that of its m leidyi prey from the beginning of year the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi depends on springtime temperature average of march to may with a threshold effect of temperature at 11 8 c see shiganova et al 2014 on the maximum annual abundance of adult m leidyi in previous observations we tested this effect by assigning the data to a 2 2 contingency table where the cells contained the number of observations corresponding to two temperatures i e 11 8 and 11 8 c and two maximum annual abundances of m leidyi i e 33 and 33 ind m 3 shiganova et al 2014 this is a first crucial period for the creation of m leidyi annual abundance in population in addition the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi depends on spring and particularly in early summer june july zooplankton biomass with a significant positive linear relationship between the two variables this is second crucial period for creation of m leidyi population foods based on optimal temperature stimulate the beginning of reproduction and its intensity the same combined reproductive sequence of m leidyi and b ovata took place year after year from 1999 until 2005 fig 8 the initial step in the sequence is the beginning of reproduction of adult m leidyi which reached its annual peak one to a few weeks later shortly after m leidyi reached its annual reproduction peak adult b ovata appeared in the sampling area on the second half of august from 1999 to 2003 but later in 2004 september and earlier from 2005 june july one or two weeks after b ovata started to reproduce and reproduction reached its annual peak value 10 to 14 days later but intensity of b ovata development depended on ambient temperature finally the larvae of m leidyi and b ovata disappeared from the sampling area time of disappearance depended on intensity of b ovata development and consequently grazing rate on m leidyi and its larvae after 2005 with increase temperature in spring m leidyi started to reproduce earlier and reached peak of reproduction earlier b ovata appeared also earlier in july fig 8 since 2012 seasonal dynamics of also b ovata has changed it began to appear in water column in may june and even single individuals were recorded in march in 2015 as a result seasonal dynamics of both ctenophores began to coincide fig 8 consequently m leidyi did not reach high abundance being grazed by b ovata from the beginning of developed m leidyi population and due to lower its reproduction rate additional factor which effected decrease of m leidyi abundance has been continuous increasing temperature higher than 27 c in july august since 2012 according to our experimental data m leidyi stops reproduction when temperature higher than 27 c shiganova et al in press 4 2 modeled seasonal changes in species abundances using our model we simulated seasonal changes in abundances of two interacting ctenophores we compared changes in abundances of adult ctenophores using relevant temperature conditions observed in 2001 2003 2006 and 2015 to understand with our model facilities the main features of the seasonal dynamics of two species fig 9a c four modeled years have been chosen in order to represent contrasting situations i the years 2001 warm and 2003 cold in the period 1999 2005 when the appearance of b ovata in field have been observed later in august ii next two modelling years 2006 and 2015 represented the period of the changed sequences of the both ctenophores the appearance of b ovata controlling the population of m leidyi became earlier in july since 2006 and may june since 2012 for all modelled years the increase in m leidyi abundance facilitated by zooplankton increase food for m leidyi next increase of b ovata abundance facilitated increase m leidyi abundance to its maximum after which it decreased corresponding to the decline in biomass of its m leidyi food fig 9 according to the model results from the year 2001 to 2015 m leidyi abundance maximum tended to decrease from about 150 ind m 3 in 2001 to about 3 4 ind m 3 in 2015 fig 9 in the model among four modelled years the highest m leidyi abundances in the range 150 200 ind m 3 were obtained in years 2001 and 2006 in the years 2003 and last years including 2015 its abundance was low below 50 ind m 3 in 2003 and below 10 ind m 3 in 2015 the modelled maximum abundance of b ovata also decreased but slower from the year 2001 to 2015 b ovata abundance maximum tended to decrease from about 68 ind m 3 in 2001 to 1 4 ind m 3 in 2015 the ratio between the both modelled abundances of ctenophores m leidyi b ovata decreased from about 7 in 2001 to 1 2 4 in 2015 that means that b ovata almost exceeded abundance of m leidyi so m leidyi and b ovata maximum abundance decreased and their ratio decrease was observed in field observations fig 6 4 3 environmental controls of ctenophores abundances after model result comparison with the field observations for the different years an additional modelling scenario was used to understand which environmental factors control the seasonal dynamics of both ctenophores among the possible factors which included into consideration were the residual ctenophore abundances during over wintering as well as the two environmental forcings such as water temperature and zooplankton biomass in this section each factor impact was studied separately and analyzed for the first factor winter residual abundances of the both ctenophores four different modelling scenarios were performed a two cases in the absence of b ovata but with two different overwintering abundances of m leidyi 5 ind m 3 and 10 ind m 3 and b two cases with a presence of b ovata of 1 ind m 3 with two different overwintering abundances of m leidyi 5 ind m 3 and 10 ind m 3 in the model when temperature was below 10 c it was assumed that two species were over wintering with low mortality and without spawning fig 10 shows the impact of the residual winter abundances of m leidyi in absence or presence of b ovata the predation by b ovata was low while the m leidyi population was building up and high after the latter reaching its maximum annual abundance from this figure it was seen how b ovata presence affected the population of m leidyi the main effect of the predation exerted by b ovata on m leidyi versus absence of b ovata was to accelerate the decline in numbers of m leidyi after its annual maximum as a result the duration of the period during which m leidyi was present in significant numbers i e more than overwintering abundance was shorter after b ovata appeared in the model than without that predator i e 60 compared to 80 days which is approximately 25 decrease there was a sharp increase on approximately on 243 day in maximal abundance of adult m leidyi without predation by b ovata and decreased with predation by b ovata for the scenarios with b ovata presence the period between the maximum annual abundances of adult m leidyi and b ovata was about 25 days the initial overwintering abundance level of m leidyi played also significant role in the ctenophores successions it reached the maximum abundance and then b ovata by grazing sharply decreased it fig 10 two environmental conditions which could control m leidyi and b ovata population dynamics have been further analyzed the annual cycles of temperature and zooplankton biomass several modelling scenarios with different levels of the temperature and zooplankton biomass have been performed in this work in our simulations the maximum annual abundance of both m leidyi and b ovata depended positively on springtime temperature fig 11a through its effects on spawning and the timing of development i e age of 50 transfer also the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi depended positively on the maximum abundance of its food zooplankton fig 11b in this figure we also added the abundances of eldest juvenile b ovata which were at the age of maturation ready for spawning and which could be also considered as adults in situ observations due to their large enough size fig 11a shows how the maximum m leidyi abundance changed in the presence or absence of b ovata for different spring temperature levels in the absence of b ovata m leidyi population increased on about 10 for the higher spring temperatures of 13 c and more vertical line represented a mean temperature level of 11 8 c which was observed to be a limiting factor for the ctenophore s spawning beginning shiganova et al 2014 see its fig 5 according to shiganova et al 2014 this limiting temperature level corresponds to m leidyi abundance of statistical line 33 ind m 3 2014 fig 5a however according to this figure m leidyi abundance at 11 8 c seems to vary in a range of 10 50 ind m 3 in the modelling this temperature level corresponded to a value of 15 ind m 3 which was lower than 33 ind m 3 but stayed in the range of 10 50 ind m 3 for the highest mean spring temperature case the m leidyi abundance reached 120 ind m 3 in the b ovata absence case and 110 ind m 3 in b ovata presence what laid in the range showed in shiganova et al b ovata abundance reached 30 ind m 3 in that case the impact of the zooplankton biomass maximum is shown in fig 11b zooplankton biomass maximum induced growth of m leidyi abundance in presence and absence of b ovata for example at 300 mg c m 3 of zooplankton biomass we obtained 340 ind m 3 of m leidyi without b ovata and 300 m leidyi with b ovata what was more than 10 of difference such a small difference in the maximum of adult m leidyi in the presence of b ovata came from the delay of development of b ovata adult b ovata were certainly increasing the slope curve of decrease in m leidyi abundance when zooplankton biomass is 300 mg c m 3 the seasonal dynamics of the both ctenophores in model appeared to be affected the two environmental conditions spring temperature variation and zooplankton biomass dynamics especially by the period of bloom occurrence and particularly its maximum results of different scenarios are presented on fig 12a c with the theoretical forcing functions built on the basis of field information of 2001 fig 4 on fig 12a is shown an effect of the spring early summer temperature change on the seasonal dynamics of m leidyi and b ovata for the case of the warmer spring temperature overpassed the spawning limit condition of 11 8 c at the day 102 whereas at the coldest spring spawning started at the day 122 20 days of the favorable conditions for spawning caused the difference in the maximums for m leidyi of about 40 ind m 3 and for b ovata of about 20 ind m 3 which could correspond to 40 difference in m leidyi abundance and 50 difference in b ovata abundance thus spring early summer temperature played a significant role in the intensity of the both ctenophore s blooms another important factor zooplankton biomass is shown in fig 12b according to fig 12b the time and the level of zooplankton development in summer strongly determined the seasonal dynamics of the both ctenophores however in that time temperature also determined their dynamics fig 4 therefore the most favorable conditions for the m leidyi growth were when zooplankton biomass maximal and it was closer to the period of the high temperature day 220 fig 4 thus for the stronger m leidyi bloom on the day 243 zooplankton bloom had to reach its maximum at the day 220 blue line what took 23 days of time delay b ovata dynamics was directly impacted by the m leidyi maximum occurrence the closer to the higher temperature it was the higher b ovata abundance was obtained thus for b ovata maximum was occurring at the day 247 m leidyi maximum was occurring at the day 223 what took 24 days of time delay orange line according to our previous results obtained from the in situ observations since 2009 the seasonal dynamics of the both ctenophores was changed the ctenophores occurrence and reproduction start became earlier and their abundances became much lower the same behavior was found in the modeled cases shown on the fig 12b blue line vs orange line on fig 12c is shown the zooplankton biomass maximum impact the seasonal dynamics of ctenophores the relation was direct between these variables more zooplankton biomass we had more m leidyi abundance and then more b ovata abundance we had at the end the difference in 30 mgc m 3 of zooplankton biomass produced 47 ind m 3 difference in m leidyi abundance and 18 ind m 3 difference produced in b ovata abundance the peak of occurrence for m leidyi was slightly shifted from the day 242 to the day 244 5 and for b ovata from the day 266 to the day 270 4 4 model sensibility tests various sensibility tests have been performed in order to understand the impact of different parameters on the

adult age class population dynamics have been chosen to be plotted in order to compare model sensibility to all tested parameters fig 13a f shows results of model sensibility to described parameters for adult m leidyi as it was expected m leidyi dynamics change has been found during the period of the favorable conditions in water temperature and food availability zooplankton therefore only this period has been shown in this figure 10 change of all selected parameters brings more than 10 change in resulting adult m leidyi population except the impact of the food concentration threshold old the highest changes are found at days 260 265 when b ovata population achieves its maximal abundance see fig 10 the most impacting parameter is mortality rate fig 13a which can bring about 30 40 of difference in this case the most impacting mortality rate is of the larval age class mortality rate changes of adult juvenile and ovae give about 20 adult m leidyi population change 10 changes of the maximal spawning rate maximal ingestion rate half saturation constant and transfer rate fig 13b c e and f bring changes which are generally below 20 the smallest impact on the m leidyi dynamics change is by the parameter of food concentration threshold fig 14a f show changes in adult b ovata population induced by 10 changes in its physiological parameters difference is maximal at the period when b ovata population is maximal as well as for m leidyi the most impacting b ovata adult population is mortality rate fig 14a the maximal impact about 80 b ovata adult population decrease is due to larval mortality rate decrease on 10 the minimal impact below 10 change is due to b ovata food concentration threshold fig 14d the other parameters impact shown on the fig 14b c e and give about 20 30 b ovata adult population change 5 discussion in order to fit the model simulations to the seasonal dynamics and abundances of m leidyi and b ovata observed during field investigations it was necessary to use some biological processes values that were different from those from laboratory experiments according to shiganova 2009 the experimental fecundity of m leidyi varied between 17 and 6200 eggs ind 1 day 1 average 2534 eggs ind 1 day 1 depending on ctenophore size food availability and temperature the corresponding values for b ovata were 24 and 7000 eggs ind 1 day 1 average 1989 eggs ind 1 day 1 depending on the same three factors we used in the model maximum spawning rates of 6200 and 7200 eggs adult 1 day 1 for m leidyi and b ovata respectively two ctenophores are hermaphrodites and fecundation is external in most of cases but can sometimes be internal shiganova et al 2004 oliveira and migotto 2006 during external fecundation about 50 of the eggs were not fertilized in addition mortality of fertilized eggs can sometimes be high under natural conditions experimental data of shiganova 2009 the most sensitive times for embryonic and postembryonic development are hatching and the beginning of external feeding in absence of available food larvae mortality can be very high up to 90 shiganova 2009 quantitative observations on the dynamics of early stages in the laboratory would be necessary to assess whether the oocytes and ovae have low viability or the ovae have high mortality given the objectives of our work we did not put in our model all known biological properties of the two species e g their ability to survive and spawn when food was low by using energy stored in their mesoglea reeve et al 1989 including this mechanism in the model might modify the species dependence on the forcing variables we used i e temperature and zooplankton food despite this and other simplifications above our model reproduced quite well the time changes in abundances of adults of the two species observed at sea in different years 2001 2003 2006 and 2015 fig 9 which considered that these two factors were the main factors driving the variability of these species dynamics these qualitatively validated the model simulations our model reproduced such overall field features as the absence or very low abundance of m leidyi in early spring the very rapid its increase in summer with summer development and bloom of zooplankton and decline in later summer in presence and predation of b ovata however our model did not generate the late summer increase in m leidyi that was in the data of 2001 and 2003 after the decline of b ovata suggesting that this second field maximum might reflect spatial heterogeneity of species distribution in the sampling area we used the model to explore mechanistic relationships between the abundances of m leidyi and b ovata the modelled seasonal development of adult m leidyi was different without and with b ovata fig 10 all other variables and parameters in the model were the same for m leidyi in both cases predation by b ovata fig 10 caused major differences in the duration of the period during which it was present in significant numbers levels of m leidyi abundance exceeding corresponding initial condition which was shorter by 30 these model results supported the interpretation of field data in term of an effect of b ovata on m leidyi abundance and were consistent that the population dynamics of b ovata significantly shortened the period of the year during which m leidyi was present year after year since arrival of b ovata in the black sea our model simulations indicated how b ovata s predation regulated the abundance of m leidyi in spring m leidyi mortality was not affected by b ovata because the latter was absent in surface layer in spring until last years as the season progressed the number of adult m leidyi increased with increasing temperature and zooplankton biomass since they became sufficient for high spawning rate progressively adult b ovata arrived in water column and fed on the increasing numbers of m leidyi which allowed the predators to spawn eggs in turn however their numbers did not immediately increase because of the development time lag between eggs and adults 5 20 days depending on temperature fig 8 b ovata and m leidyi continued to co exist in northeastern black sea after 1999 the same sequence of predator prey mechanisms led b ovata to take control of m leidyi year after year irrespective of the interannual environmental variability this is supported by the field repetition year after year since 1999 of the same combined reproductive sequence for m leidyi and b ovata figs 6 and 8 the reproductive sequence comprised 7 steps i adult m leidyi started to reproduce ii reproduction of m leidyi reached its annual peak value iii adult b ovata appeared in the sampling area iv adult b ovata started to reproduce v reproduction of b ovata reached its annual peak value vi m leidyi larvae disappeared from the sampling area vii b ovata larvae disappeared from the sampling area in one year out of thirteen step vii occurred slightly before step vi a few larvae of the two species steps vi and vii above occurred at sea several weeks after the abundance maxima of adults fig 8 this phenomenon which was not represented in our model simulations suggested that the few surviving adults continued to reproduce larvae developed two species of new generations survived during winter at low abundances without reproduction but with a low mortality rate if temperature was not too low field observation by anninsky et al 2005 zaika 2005 the minimum and maximum duration of the reproductive sequences varied from year to year i e it ranged between 73 days in 1999 and 203 days in 2009 and from 24 days in 2011 and 119 days in 2014 but the sequence itself i e the order of events remained unchanged over the 16 year period repetition of the same 7 step sequence over 16 years was a remarkable characteristic of the b ovata m leidyi predator prey relationship especially that it was independent of the maximum numbers reached by the two species in different years fig 8 or the interannual changes in surface water temperature fig 7 or food concentration see data in fig 9 which was examined above the yearly repetition of the reproductive sequence of m leidyi and b ovata at sea gave evidence that b ovata took control of m leidyi year after year through the same sequence of predator prey mechanisms this suggested that there was some independence of the dynamics of the two invading species from the dynamics of the other components of the pelagic ecosystem food was necessary to fuel the m leidyi b ovata dynamics but m leidyi appeared to use any zooplankton species as food source which explain its success in any areas where it was transported in our case the black sea we used the model to explore the mechanisms that controlled the combined reproductive sequence of the two species the modelled sequence fig 9 was essentially the same as that observed in the field during the 16 years that followed the arrival of b ovata population dynamics of the two species from the model were as follows m leidyi started to develop when the temperature and food conditions allowed it after which it reached its annual maximum within a few weeks during the same period m leidyi spawned and its larvae developed in simulations without predation by b ovata the abundance of m leidyi remained high during several weeks after reaching its annual maximum fig 9 the decline in the m leidyi abundance connected with the decline in zooplankton biomass either depending on the natural dynamics of zooplankton species and their food resources phytoplankton or depending on the high predation power of m leidyi in simulations with predation by b ovata which developed in significant numbers when the abundance of their m leidyi prey increased the numbers of m leidyi decreased sharply as the abundance of their b ovata predator increased once b ovata seasonally developed its abundance rapidly reduced of m leidyi abundance to a value under the threshold for spawning and latter started to decline because temperature and food were not optimal for m leidyi in autumn and its population greatly grazed by b ovata a few individuals of new generation of both species left in late autumn for overwintering the tight dependence of b ovata abundance on that of m leidyi reflects the fact that the b ovata predator exclusively feeds on ctenophores in our study b ovata feeds on m leidyi but it could feed on other ctenophore than m leidyi in the black sea e g pleurobrachia pileus which is a native ctenophore to the black sea and can be an alternative prey for b ovata shiganova et al 2001a the reason why this does not seem to occur was that p pileus generally inhabits the cold waters under the seasonal thermocline in the open black sea whereas b ovata feeds in the warm surface layer to which m leidyi is more or less confined mutlu 1999 shiganova et al 2001a the modelled reproductive sequence of m leidyi and b ovata clearly resulted from the predation of the latter on the former that indicated the robust reproductive sequence observed in the field for 16 years reflected the annual control of m leidyi by b ovata through the same sequence of predator prey mechanisms year after year however it was clear that b ovata could not eliminate m leidyi from the area because of this predator prey interaction because there were strong interannually variations in the abundances of both m leidyi and b ovata environmental conditions determined the joint abundances of the two species there was strong covariability between the numbers of m leidyi and b ovata year after year after the arrival of the latter in the northeastern black sea in 1999 fig 6 with a significant positive relationship between the maximum yearly numbers of the two species during the period 1999 2016 in our 27 year dataset the rather high abundance of m leidyi could be formed already in spring with its appearance in surface layer from the lower layer or from near bottom where specimens spent unfavorable temperature lower than 5 c its abundance significantly related to springtime temperature i e the value of 33 ind m 3 was exceeded only in the 11 years when springtime temperature 11 8 c this was consistent with the field based observation of shiganova et al 2014 that high spring temperatures elicited intense reproduction in summer and rapid population growth of m leidyi temperature was also related to the beginning of m leidyi reproduction in early summer i e june fig 8 the latter when temperature was higher since 2005 than before may have stimulated the earlier start of reproduction of m leidyi than before fig 7 in addition the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi was positively related to the summer biomass of its zooplankton food i e average concentration in june and july before the annual appearance of b ovata fig 7 b ovata seasonal variations also changed since 2012 due to increasing temperature in may up to 17 18 c b ovata started to appear in water column in may june and its seasonal dynamics in high degree coincides now with dynamics of m leidyi figs 6 and 7 which led to decreasing values of both ctenophores additional factor which contributed decreasing ctenophores is increasing temperature in july august higher than 27 c unfavorable for m leidyi reproduction the above field results were consistent with conclusions from previous observations and laboratory experiments for example shiganova et al 2001b assumed that the interannual variability in m leidyi was especially linked with changes in surface water temperature and food concentration i e edible micro and mesozooplankton likewise kremer 1994 suggested based on laboratory experiments on m leidyi from native waters that temperature was the most important factor in the development of m leidyi and that food came second shiganova et al 2004 derived a similar conclusion from laboratory experiments on m leidyi from black sea waters the above field results were also consistent with our model results where the maximum annual abundances of both m leidyi and b ovata were positively related to springtime temperature fig 11a and the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi was positively related to the maximum abundance of its food fig 11b 6 summary using our model we explored the effects of surface water temperature and zooplankton concentration on the development of m leidyi and consequently of b ovata we found that the maximum annual abundances of m leidyi and b ovata increased with increasing mean springtime temperature and earlier development of spring early summer zooplankton which is important for creation of m leidyi abundance and consequently for future development of b ovata we also found that changing the concentration of the m leidyi food i e zooplankton at the time of the annual development of that species mostly changed the maximum annual values reached by m leidyi and consequently b ovata in addition we found that time of appearance of b ovata was changed for as early as may with increasing temperature in may and as a result m leidyi did not have time to reach high abundance grazed by b ovata already since may we also found that m leidyi rate of reproduction decreased with increasing temperature higher than 27 c in july august model results were qualitatively the same as those from long term field observations in our model the environmental conditions that mostly influenced the joint abundances of the two species and determined the annual development of both species were for m leidyi springtime temperature and

25301,we analyzed the main factors that controlled the prey predator dynamics of two invasive ctenophores mnemiopsis leidyi and beroe ovata in the black sea using a demographic model we assessed the bottom up cascading effect from edible zooplankton to its consumer m leidyi and its predator b ovata for these purposes we used life cycles of both ctenophores ova larva juvenile transitional and adult stages variability of annual phenology and physiological features obtained from our field observations and experiments made in the north eastern black sea over 27 years combined with a long term change in temperature and food availability for both ctenophores model outputs were compared with field observations then model scenarios were tested to understand which environmental conditions control m leidyi and b ovata development using our model we found that the maximum annual abundances of m leidyi and b ovata increased with mean springtime temperature and development of spring early summer zooplankton which is important for creation of m leidyi abundance and consequently development of b ovata an assessment with changing concentration of the m leidyi food i e zooplankton at the time of its annual development changed the maximum annual values reached by m leidyi and consequently b ovata it was found that time of appearance of b ovata had changed to may since 2012 with increasing temperature and as a result m leidyi did not have time to reach high abundance being grazed by b ovata already since may model results were qualitatively the same as those from long term field observations as a result we obtained a model of two ctenophores interacting with total life structure duration and scale of reproduction growing from stage to stage mortality seasonal disappearance from water depending on temperature and prey availability similar analyses have never been done in the black sea and can be used for other seas where m leidyi or both ctenophores invaded keywords ctenophores invasion black sea mnemiopsis leidyi beroe ovata population dynamics long term data ecophysiology model assessment 1 introduction the invasion of the carnivorous ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi a agassiz 1865 in the black sea in the early 1980s vinogradov et al 1989 and its dispersal to other seas of the mediterranean basin and the caspian sea caused major negative perturbations in these basins this was a most dramatic example of non native species effects on pelagic ecosystems shiganova et al 2004 finenko et al 2003 a decade after the m leidyi invasion the arrival of its predator ctenophore beroe ovata sensu mayer 1912 in the black sea reversed the situation and the ecosystem started to recover shiganova et al 2014 understanding the mechanisms that control the size of the m leidyi population in the black sea is especially important because m leidyi is rapidly expanding around european seas and b ovata follows it in many cases shiganova et al in press we analyzed field data for 27 years of observations of m leidyi before b ovata and after its arrival and edible zooplankton in the black sea the same combined reproductive sequence of m leidyi and b ovata took place every year but with differences in value of abundance time and duration of seasonal development of two species determined by food concentration edible zooplankton for m leidyi and m leidyi for b ovata temperature and other environmental parameters wind created different scale patchiness of distribution shiganova et al 2014 to better understand these processes we used a population dynamics model to assess the mechanism of interaction at three trophic levels of the black sea ecosystem the carnivorous ctenophores mnemiopsis leidyi and beroe ovata which are strong drivers of ecosystem state now edible zooplankton and temperature in the model we analyze annual and seasonal variability of both invaders as well as their relationships and bottom up cascading effects from edible zooplankton to its consumer mnemiopsis leidyi and to beroe ovata based on experimental and long term field data from the north eastern black sea previous modelling assessments have been based mainly on published parameters obtained from mnemiopsis leidyi in its native habitats while beroe ovata has never before been included in a modelling assessment kremer and kremer 1982 oguz et al 2008 2012 salihoglu et al 2011 in addition there was no comprehensive study which describes bottom up effects of the two main drivers of the black sea mnemiopsis leidyi and beroe ovata which include their population capacity dynamics phenology interactions and control of m leidyi development by b ovata we assess the most important driving functions and test hypotheses that the availability of food i e zooplankton for m leidyi and m leidyi for b ovata and temperature have control over the duration of annual development and variability of interannual abundances our population dynamics model takes into account the life cycles and physiological features of the two ctenophores as a synthesis of field observations and eco physiological laboratory experiments obtained in the north eastern black sea over 27 years 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the main ctenophore habitat is the coastal waters from where they spread with the current to open areas our observations were conducted in the north eastern black sea with a starting sight in the coastal area of blue bay and offshore blue bay is a small semi enclosed and shallow water body depth between 7 and 14 m there temperature varies from 6 c in winter to 27 c and sometimes 30 c in summer in last years and salinity from 17 to 18 the major driving force for the black sea rim current is cyclonic contour current on the continental slope of the black sea which forms the two rings in the western and eastern parts of the sea meandering of the rim current frontal zone causes the formation of eddies mainly anticyclonic which migrate offshore and exchange waters and their fauna between the coastal and offshore areas in addition wind driven ekman transport which is in a direction normal to the coastline affects the concentration numerical abundance and biomass of plankton in the coastal zone zatsepin et al 2010 shiganova et al 2014 2 2 field data most of the data on mesozoo and gelatinous plankton were collected during expeditions of the p p shirshov institute of oceanology of russian academy of sciences in the northeastern black sea from 1992 to 2004 in addition in 2000 and up to the present time 2017 samples were collected within the blue bay and offshore in the north eastern black sea along a transect from the blue bay up to 1000 m for present estimations we took into consideration the inshore waters where water depths ranged from 7 to 100 m in the blue bay and outside it fig 1 in addition samples of zooplankton and ctenophores were collected regularly around a year at monitoring station 7 m depth in blue bay the data for present model assessment were collected from stations 100 m depth some data for previous years were taken from pasternak 1983 khoroshilov and lukasheva 1999 and vinogradov et al 2002 2005 2006 in the present study temperature and salinity data were measured vertically with a ctd profiler zooplankton including eggs and larvae of ctenophores were collected with a juday plankton net 0 1 m2 opening 180 μm mesh size and gelatinous plankton with a bogorov rass br net 1 m2 opening 500 μm mesh size and a smaller size modification 0 2 m2 opening 500 μm mesh size all samples were collected using vertical hauls from the bottom to the surface in the area where there was not anoxic layer yet we did not use coefficient for insignificance catchability in our estimations which was used by vinogradov et al 2002 2005 2006 3 demographic model 3 1 model structure we developed a model to explore the processes involved in the coupling of the prey m leidyi and its predator b ovata these processes are included interactions between two species and forcing environmental variables we designed the model incorporating the known characteristics of the life cycles of two species the timing and amplitude of the seasonal abundances depended on biological rates such as spawning development growth and mortality in addition we used forcing environmental variables such as temperature and food concentration effect on these biological rates of the two ctenophores among them timing of appearance ctenophores in the water column start of reproduction maximal reproduction rate which coincided with maximum abundances of both ctenophores within the range of observations as usual in modelling the calibration of processes feeding spawning growing mortality was based on the known ranges of parameters which were either taken from unpublished field data and experiments conducted by one of the authors t a shiganova or came from the literature the model considered the ontogenic development of the species i e a period of time necessary for ovae to develop into larvae for the latter to develop the characteristic features and properties of juveniles and for juveniles to become adults this period of time from hatching to mature spawning is the generation time and it depended on the development rate at each step which is influenced by temperature and food this property is usually not considered in ecosystem models based on biomasses of species shiganova 2009 our field and experimental data taken into consideration were compared and verified with published data finenko et al 2003 kremer and kremer 1982 kremer 1976 1979 1994 kremer and reeve 1989 kremer et al 1986 reeve et al 1989 salihoglu et al 2011 thus our model considered four life cycle stages for each of the two ctenophore species i e ova larva juvenile and adult and each stage comprised several age classes a developmental time is ascribed to each stage which set the average time required for an individual to acquire the characteristics of the next stage the sum of time spent in each developmental stage gives the generation time this is summarized in fig 2 on fig 2 each line corresponds to ctenophore life stages which are aging age classes are schematically represented by rectangles the life stages of black sea m leidyi were defined on the base of experimental data as follows egg stage larvae hatched larva 03 04 mm growing cydippid larvae 2 10 mm larvae transition from cydippid to lobate juvenile 11 20 mm aging juvenile to maturity 21 30 mm adult beginning of maturity and beginning of reproduction 31 40 mm accepted as adult and 40 mm adult for b ovata life stages are egg stage 0 8 1 0 mm hatched larva 0 4 0 8 mm larva 8 mm juvenile 8 40 mm and adult 40 mm

increased which is more characteristic for july august the development rate was the proportion of individuals able to change stage that were effectively changing the rate of change is constant for ova

all stages were affected by the mortality rate which had two components the first was predation mortality which depended on the abundance of predators i e b ovata for m leidyi the second was natural mortality which combined all other causes natural mortality usually includes physiological disorders and diseases in the present model the rate of natural mortality was taken as constant within each stage except for adults where it was assumed to vary according to seasons in the model mortality was lower during winter when reproduction stopped and when temperature was 10 c making the hypothesis

stops 3 mgc m 3 tzikhon lukanina et al 1991 table 1 the feeding rate i e amount of food ingested per unit time determined the rate of development the spawning rate was computed as a hyperbolic function of the ingestion rate assuming that a proportion of the ingested and assimilated matter is converted into gametes also stimulated by temperature and food amount a minimum feeding rate was required to initiate reproduction assuming that this minimum amount of matter was necessary to cover the minimum metabolic requirements the predator b ovata ate exclusively m leidyi in the model the different stages of b ovata were assumed to have different ability to catch different m leidyi stages with exception the larvae of b ovata which fed exclusively the larvae of m leidyi fig 3 that defined a predation efficiency or predation preference the total biomass of m leidyi caught during one unit of time defined the volume of water which was swept clear of m leidyi the feeding rate of b ovata stages was not directly dependent on the biomass of m leidyi but on the fraction of that biomass which was available to each stage according to their predation efficiency the available food biomass for b ovata was computed as follows 10 b a j i e i j n m i w i where baj was the food biomass available to stage j of b ovata mg c m 3 eij is the predation efficiency or preference of b ovata

value of eij made it possible to model the observed fact that b ovata adults were unable to feed on m leidyi larvae but b ovata larvae could harvest m leidyi larvae fig 3 showed the interactions

surface layer where ctenophores mainly occurred and zooplankton biomass i e food of m leidyi expressed in mgc m 3 these forcings have been estimated from the field and experimental own observations shiganova 2009 for the theoretical studies of impact of environmental conditions on the ctenophores blooms as theoretical functions of these forcings characteristic of the black sea was considered fig

simplifications were taken in model assessment other components than two species temperature and food were either ignored i e their influence on ctenophore species was assumed not important in general but had only local effect or were defined a priori i e taken as forcing functions micro and mesozooplankton were not considered separately and it was assumed that their proportions in zooplankton biomass were constant 3 7 model calibration the parameters used in the model were taken from laboratory experiments and subsequently modified to obtain time variations of abundances that correspond to observations we used seasonal development criteria for each species i e the period of presence during the year i e days from appearance to disappearance for m leidyi and the same for b ovata time of reproduction start for m leidyi from 125 till 220 day for b ovata from 185 till 265 day fig 5 and the maximum abundance of adults and i e up to 254 ind m 3 for m leidyi and 68 ind m 3 for b ovata fig

coefficient index m m leidyi b b ovata a adult j juvenile l larva o ova 3 9 modeled m leidyi dynamics m leidyi life stages dynamics obtained in the theoretical case when theoretical functions of two main forcings temperature and zooplankton biomass were considered is presented in fig 5 this figure showed how model worked in the theoretical case for example from the fig 5 it was seen that the m leidyi reproduction became to be significant at the day 150 when zooplankton biomass reached the springtime bloom peak of about 15 mgc m 3 and water temperature reached 18 c fig 4 after the spring bloom zooplankton biomass decreased what induced the increase of m leidyi reproduction the second zooplankton bloom occurred in summer is the major factor in at the day 220 there were about 4000 ind m 3 of eggs and 5000 ind m 3 of larva these abundances of eggs and larva produced about 800 ind m 3 of juveniles and 100 ind m 3 of adults it is seen in fig 5 that approximately after day 200 larval stock became higher than egg stock what could be explained by the higher matter inflow from the previous stage ova transfer from ova to larva stage takes about 24h than its outflow due to mortality and transfer to juvenile stage such a high matter inflow is related to the highest spawning 4 results 4 1 interannual variability of m leidyi and b ovata in the black sea field observations with the arrival of b ovata in the black sea in 1997 in 1999 in the north eastern area considered here the period of the year during which m leidyi was present changed drastically until 1998 m leidyi occurred in sizable concentrations during spring summer and autumn and in warm years also in winters shiganova 1998 before b ovata arrival from 1999 m leidyi occurred in sizable concentrations only during one two or maximal three warm months of summer i e depending the seasonal appearance in water column and beginning of b ovata development shiganova et al 2014 their dynamics was determined by temperature and food availability zooplankton for m leidyi and m leidyi for b ovata therefore abundances of adult m leidyi and b ovata varied from year to year in the black sea fig 6 with great decreasing during last years the maximum annual abundances ranged over more than one order of magnitude for the two species i e adult m leidyi from 15 to 254 ind m 3 in 2003 and 2001 respectively and adult b ovata from 6 to 68 ind m 3 in 2009 and 2001 respectively during last years abundance of both species dropped and ranged from 3 4 ind m 3 to 1 56 ind m 3 of m leidyi and b ovata from 1 4 ind m 3 to 1 8 ind m 3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the observed succession of peaks of m leidyi and b ovata within each year suggested that the maximum annual abundance of the b ovata predator was related to that of its m leidyi prey from the beginning of year the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi depends on springtime temperature average of march to may with a threshold effect of temperature at 11 8 c see shiganova et al 2014 on the maximum annual abundance of adult m leidyi in previous observations we tested this effect by assigning the data to a 2 2 contingency table where the cells contained the number of observations corresponding to two temperatures i e 11 8 and 11 8 c and two maximum annual abundances of m leidyi i e 33 and 33 ind m 3 shiganova et al 2014 this is a first crucial period for the creation of m leidyi annual abundance in population in addition the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi depends on spring and particularly in early summer june july zooplankton biomass with a significant positive linear relationship between the two variables this is second crucial period for creation of m leidyi population foods based on optimal temperature stimulate the beginning of reproduction and its intensity the same combined reproductive sequence of m leidyi and b ovata took place year after year from 1999 until 2005 fig 8 the initial step in the sequence is the beginning of reproduction of adult m leidyi which reached its annual peak one to a few weeks later shortly after m leidyi reached its annual reproduction peak adult b ovata appeared in the sampling area on the second half of august from 1999 to 2003 but later in 2004 september and earlier from 2005 june july one or two weeks after b ovata started to reproduce and reproduction reached its annual peak value 10 to 14 days later but intensity of b ovata development depended on ambient temperature finally the larvae of m leidyi and b ovata disappeared from the sampling area time of disappearance depended on intensity of b ovata development and consequently grazing rate on m leidyi and its larvae after 2005 with increase temperature in spring m leidyi started to reproduce earlier and reached peak of reproduction earlier b ovata appeared also earlier in july fig 8 since 2012 seasonal dynamics of also b ovata has changed it began to appear in water column in may june and even single individuals were recorded in march in 2015 as a result seasonal dynamics of both ctenophores began to coincide fig 8 consequently m leidyi did not reach high abundance being grazed by b ovata from the beginning of developed m leidyi population and due to lower its reproduction rate additional factor which effected decrease of m leidyi abundance has been continuous increasing temperature higher than 27 c in july august since 2012 according to our experimental data m leidyi stops reproduction when temperature higher than 27 c shiganova et al in press 4 2 modeled seasonal changes in species abundances using our model we simulated seasonal changes in abundances of two interacting ctenophores we compared changes in abundances of adult ctenophores using relevant temperature conditions observed in 2001 2003 2006 and 2015 to understand with our model facilities the main features of the seasonal dynamics of two species fig 9a c four modeled years have been chosen in order to represent contrasting situations i the years 2001 warm and 2003 cold in the period 1999 2005 when the appearance of b ovata in field have been observed later in august ii next two modelling years 2006 and 2015 represented the period of the changed sequences of the both ctenophores the appearance of b ovata controlling the population of m leidyi became earlier in july since 2006 and may june since 2012 for all modelled years the increase in m leidyi abundance facilitated by zooplankton increase food for m leidyi next increase of b ovata abundance facilitated increase m leidyi abundance to its maximum after which it decreased corresponding to the decline in biomass of its m leidyi food fig 9 according to the model results from the year 2001 to 2015 m leidyi abundance maximum tended to decrease from about 150 ind m 3 in 2001 to about 3 4 ind m 3 in 2015 fig 9 in the model among four modelled years the highest m leidyi abundances in the range 150 200 ind m 3 were obtained in years 2001 and 2006 in the years 2003 and last years including 2015 its abundance was low below 50 ind m 3 in 2003 and below 10 ind m 3 in 2015 the modelled maximum abundance of b ovata also decreased but slower from the year 2001 to 2015 b ovata abundance maximum tended to decrease from about 68 ind m 3 in 2001 to 1 4 ind m 3 in 2015 the ratio between the both modelled abundances of ctenophores m leidyi b ovata decreased from about 7 in 2001 to 1 2 4 in 2015 that means that b ovata almost exceeded abundance of m leidyi so m leidyi and b ovata maximum abundance decreased and their ratio decrease was observed in field observations fig 6 4 3 environmental controls of ctenophores abundances after model result comparison with the field observations for the different years an additional modelling scenario was used to understand which environmental factors control the seasonal dynamics of both ctenophores among the possible factors which included into consideration were the residual ctenophore abundances during over wintering as well as the two environmental forcings such as water temperature and zooplankton biomass in this section each factor impact was studied separately and analyzed for the first factor winter residual abundances of the both ctenophores four different modelling scenarios were performed a two cases in the absence of b ovata but with two different overwintering abundances of m leidyi 5 ind m 3 and 10 ind m 3 and b two cases with a presence of b ovata of 1 ind m 3 with two different overwintering abundances of m leidyi 5 ind m 3 and 10 ind m 3 in the model when temperature was below 10 c it was assumed that two species were over wintering with low mortality and without spawning fig 10 shows the impact of the residual winter abundances of m leidyi in absence or presence of b ovata the predation by b ovata was low while the m leidyi population was building up and high after the latter reaching its maximum annual abundance from this figure it was seen how b ovata presence affected the population of m leidyi the main effect of the predation exerted by b ovata on m leidyi versus absence of b ovata was to accelerate the decline in numbers of m leidyi after its annual maximum as a result the duration of the period during which m leidyi was present in significant numbers i e more than overwintering abundance was shorter after b ovata appeared in the model than without that predator i e 60 compared to 80 days which is approximately 25 decrease there was a sharp increase on approximately on 243 day in maximal abundance of adult m leidyi without predation by b ovata and decreased with predation by b ovata for the scenarios with b ovata presence the period between the maximum annual abundances of adult m leidyi and b ovata was about 25 days the initial overwintering abundance level of m leidyi played also significant role in the ctenophores successions it reached the maximum abundance and then b ovata by grazing sharply decreased it fig 10 two environmental conditions which could control m leidyi and b ovata population dynamics have been further analyzed the annual cycles of temperature and zooplankton biomass several modelling scenarios with different levels of the temperature and zooplankton biomass have been performed in this work in our simulations the maximum annual abundance of both m leidyi and b ovata depended positively on springtime temperature fig 11a through its effects on spawning and the timing of development i e age of 50 transfer also the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi depended positively on the maximum abundance of its food zooplankton fig 11b in this figure we also added the abundances of eldest juvenile b ovata which were at the age of maturation ready for spawning and which could be also considered as adults in situ observations due to their large enough size fig 11a shows how the maximum m leidyi abundance changed in the presence or absence of b ovata for different spring temperature levels in the absence of b ovata m leidyi population increased on about 10 for the higher spring temperatures of 13 c and more vertical line represented a mean temperature level of 11 8 c which was observed to be a limiting factor for the ctenophore s spawning beginning shiganova et al 2014 see its fig 5 according to shiganova et al 2014 this limiting temperature level corresponds to m leidyi abundance of statistical line 33 ind m 3 2014 fig 5a however according to this figure m leidyi abundance at 11 8 c seems to vary in a range of 10 50 ind m 3 in the modelling this temperature level corresponded to a value of 15 ind m 3 which was lower than 33 ind m 3 but stayed in the range of 10 50 ind m 3 for the highest mean spring temperature case the m leidyi abundance reached 120 ind m 3 in the b ovata absence case and 110 ind m 3 in b ovata presence what laid in the range showed in shiganova et al b ovata abundance reached 30 ind m 3 in that case the impact of the zooplankton biomass maximum is shown in fig 11b zooplankton biomass maximum induced growth of m leidyi abundance in presence and absence of b ovata for example at 300 mg c m 3 of zooplankton biomass we obtained 340 ind m 3 of m leidyi without b ovata and 300 m leidyi with b ovata what was more than 10 of difference such a small difference in the maximum of adult m leidyi in the presence of b ovata came from the delay of development of b ovata adult b ovata were certainly increasing the slope curve of decrease in m leidyi abundance when zooplankton biomass is 300 mg c m 3 the seasonal dynamics of the both ctenophores in model appeared to be affected the two environmental conditions spring temperature variation and zooplankton biomass dynamics especially by the period of bloom occurrence and particularly its maximum results of different scenarios are presented on fig 12a c with the theoretical forcing functions built on the basis of field information of 2001 fig 4 on fig 12a is shown an effect of the spring early summer temperature change on the seasonal dynamics of m leidyi and b ovata for the case of the warmer spring temperature overpassed the spawning limit condition of 11 8 c at the day 102 whereas at the coldest spring spawning started at the day 122 20 days of the favorable conditions for spawning caused the difference in the maximums for m leidyi of about 40 ind m 3 and for b ovata of about 20 ind m 3 which could correspond to 40 difference in m leidyi abundance and 50 difference in b ovata abundance thus spring early summer temperature played a significant role in the intensity of the both ctenophore s blooms another important factor zooplankton biomass is shown in fig 12b according to fig 12b the time and the level of zooplankton development in summer strongly determined the seasonal dynamics of the both ctenophores however in that time temperature also determined their dynamics fig 4 therefore the most favorable conditions for the m leidyi growth were when zooplankton biomass maximal and it was closer to the period of the high temperature day 220 fig 4 thus for the stronger m leidyi bloom on the day 243 zooplankton bloom had to reach its maximum at the day 220 blue line what took 23 days of time delay b ovata dynamics was directly impacted by the m leidyi maximum occurrence the closer to the higher temperature it was the higher b ovata abundance was obtained thus for b ovata maximum was occurring at the day 247 m leidyi maximum was occurring at the day 223 what took 24 days of time delay orange line according to our previous results obtained from the in situ observations since 2009 the seasonal dynamics of the both ctenophores was changed the ctenophores occurrence and reproduction start became earlier and their abundances became much lower the same behavior was found in the modeled cases shown on the fig 12b blue line vs orange line on fig 12c is shown the zooplankton biomass maximum impact the seasonal dynamics of ctenophores the relation was direct between these variables more zooplankton biomass we had more m leidyi abundance and then more b ovata abundance we had at the end the difference in 30 mgc m 3 of zooplankton biomass produced 47 ind m 3 difference in m leidyi abundance and 18 ind m 3 difference produced in b ovata abundance the peak of occurrence for m leidyi was slightly shifted from the day 242 to the day 244 5 and for b ovata from the day 266 to the day 270 4 4 model sensibility tests various sensibility tests have been performed in order to understand the impact of different parameters on the

adult age class population dynamics have been chosen to be plotted in order to compare model sensibility to all tested parameters fig 13a f shows results of model sensibility to described parameters for adult m leidyi as it was expected m leidyi dynamics change has been found during the period of the favorable conditions in water temperature and food availability zooplankton therefore only this period has been shown in this figure 10 change of all selected parameters brings more than 10 change in resulting adult m leidyi population except the impact of the food concentration threshold old the highest changes are found at days 260 265 when b ovata population achieves its maximal abundance see fig 10 the most impacting parameter is mortality rate fig 13a which can bring about 30 40 of difference in this case the most impacting mortality rate is of the larval age class mortality rate changes of adult juvenile and ovae give about 20 adult m leidyi population change 10 changes of the maximal spawning rate maximal ingestion rate half saturation constant and transfer rate fig 13b c e and f bring changes which are generally below 20 the smallest impact on the m leidyi dynamics change is by the parameter of food concentration threshold fig 14a f show changes in adult b ovata population induced by 10 changes in its physiological parameters difference is maximal at the period when b ovata population is maximal as well as for m leidyi the most impacting b ovata adult population is mortality rate fig 14a the maximal impact about 80 b ovata adult population decrease is due to larval mortality rate decrease on 10 the minimal impact below 10 change is due to b ovata food concentration threshold fig 14d the other parameters impact shown on the fig 14b c e and give about 20 30 b ovata adult population change 5 discussion in order to fit the model simulations to the seasonal dynamics and abundances of m leidyi and b ovata observed during field investigations it was necessary to use some biological processes values that were different from those from laboratory experiments according to shiganova 2009 the experimental fecundity of m leidyi varied between 17 and 6200 eggs ind 1 day 1 average 2534 eggs ind 1 day 1 depending on ctenophore size food availability and temperature the corresponding values for b ovata were 24 and 7000 eggs ind 1 day 1 average 1989 eggs ind 1 day 1 depending on the same three factors we used in the model maximum spawning rates of 6200 and 7200 eggs adult 1 day 1 for m leidyi and b ovata respectively two ctenophores are hermaphrodites and fecundation is external in most of cases but can sometimes be internal shiganova et al 2004 oliveira and migotto 2006 during external fecundation about 50 of the eggs were not fertilized in addition mortality of fertilized eggs can sometimes be high under natural conditions experimental data of shiganova 2009 the most sensitive times for embryonic and postembryonic development are hatching and the beginning of external feeding in absence of available food larvae mortality can be very high up to 90 shiganova 2009 quantitative observations on the dynamics of early stages in the laboratory would be necessary to assess whether the oocytes and ovae have low viability or the ovae have high mortality given the objectives of our work we did not put in our model all known biological properties of the two species e g their ability to survive and spawn when food was low by using energy stored in their mesoglea reeve et al 1989 including this mechanism in the model might modify the species dependence on the forcing variables we used i e temperature and zooplankton food despite this and other simplifications above our model reproduced quite well the time changes in abundances of adults of the two species observed at sea in different years 2001 2003 2006 and 2015 fig 9 which considered that these two factors were the main factors driving the variability of these species dynamics these qualitatively validated the model simulations our model reproduced such overall field features as the absence or very low abundance of m leidyi in early spring the very rapid its increase in summer with summer development and bloom of zooplankton and decline in later summer in presence and predation of b ovata however our model did not generate the late summer increase in m leidyi that was in the data of 2001 and 2003 after the decline of b ovata suggesting that this second field maximum might reflect spatial heterogeneity of species distribution in the sampling area we used the model to explore mechanistic relationships between the abundances of m leidyi and b ovata the modelled seasonal development of adult m leidyi was different without and with b ovata fig 10 all other variables and parameters in the model were the same for m leidyi in both cases predation by b ovata fig 10 caused major differences in the duration of the period during which it was present in significant numbers levels of m leidyi abundance exceeding corresponding initial condition which was shorter by 30 these model results supported the interpretation of field data in term of an effect of b ovata on m leidyi abundance and were consistent that the population dynamics of b ovata significantly shortened the period of the year during which m leidyi was present year after year since arrival of b ovata in the black sea our model simulations indicated how b ovata s predation regulated the abundance of m leidyi in spring m leidyi mortality was not affected by b ovata because the latter was absent in surface layer in spring until last years as the season progressed the number of adult m leidyi increased with increasing temperature and zooplankton biomass since they became sufficient for high spawning rate progressively adult b ovata arrived in water column and fed on the increasing numbers of m leidyi which allowed the predators to spawn eggs in turn however their numbers did not immediately increase because of the development time lag between eggs and adults 5 20 days depending on temperature fig 8 b ovata and m leidyi continued to co exist in northeastern black sea after 1999 the same sequence of predator prey mechanisms led b ovata to take control of m leidyi year after year irrespective of the interannual environmental variability this is supported by the field repetition year after year since 1999 of the same combined reproductive sequence for m leidyi and b ovata figs 6 and 8 the reproductive sequence comprised 7 steps i adult m leidyi started to reproduce ii reproduction of m leidyi reached its annual peak value iii adult b ovata appeared in the sampling area iv adult b ovata started to reproduce v reproduction of b ovata reached its annual peak value vi m leidyi larvae disappeared from the sampling area vii b ovata larvae disappeared from the sampling area in one year out of thirteen step vii occurred slightly before step vi a few larvae of the two species steps vi and vii above occurred at sea several weeks after the abundance maxima of adults fig 8 this phenomenon which was not represented in our model simulations suggested that the few surviving adults continued to reproduce larvae developed two species of new generations survived during winter at low abundances without reproduction but with a low mortality rate if temperature was not too low field observation by anninsky et al 2005 zaika 2005 the minimum and maximum duration of the reproductive sequences varied from year to year i e it ranged between 73 days in 1999 and 203 days in 2009 and from 24 days in 2011 and 119 days in 2014 but the sequence itself i e the order of events remained unchanged over the 16 year period repetition of the same 7 step sequence over 16 years was a remarkable characteristic of the b ovata m leidyi predator prey relationship especially that it was independent of the maximum numbers reached by the two species in different years fig 8 or the interannual changes in surface water temperature fig 7 or food concentration see data in fig 9 which was examined above the yearly repetition of the reproductive sequence of m leidyi and b ovata at sea gave evidence that b ovata took control of m leidyi year after year through the same sequence of predator prey mechanisms this suggested that there was some independence of the dynamics of the two invading species from the dynamics of the other components of the pelagic ecosystem food was necessary to fuel the m leidyi b ovata dynamics but m leidyi appeared to use any zooplankton species as food source which explain its success in any areas where it was transported in our case the black sea we used the model to explore the mechanisms that controlled the combined reproductive sequence of the two species the modelled sequence fig 9 was essentially the same as that observed in the field during the 16 years that followed the arrival of b ovata population dynamics of the two species from the model were as follows m leidyi started to develop when the temperature and food conditions allowed it after which it reached its annual maximum within a few weeks during the same period m leidyi spawned and its larvae developed in simulations without predation by b ovata the abundance of m leidyi remained high during several weeks after reaching its annual maximum fig 9 the decline in the m leidyi abundance connected with the decline in zooplankton biomass either depending on the natural dynamics of zooplankton species and their food resources phytoplankton or depending on the high predation power of m leidyi in simulations with predation by b ovata which developed in significant numbers when the abundance of their m leidyi prey increased the numbers of m leidyi decreased sharply as the abundance of their b ovata predator increased once b ovata seasonally developed its abundance rapidly reduced of m leidyi abundance to a value under the threshold for spawning and latter started to decline because temperature and food were not optimal for m leidyi in autumn and its population greatly grazed by b ovata a few individuals of new generation of both species left in late autumn for overwintering the tight dependence of b ovata abundance on that of m leidyi reflects the fact that the b ovata predator exclusively feeds on ctenophores in our study b ovata feeds on m leidyi but it could feed on other ctenophore than m leidyi in the black sea e g pleurobrachia pileus which is a native ctenophore to the black sea and can be an alternative prey for b ovata shiganova et al 2001a the reason why this does not seem to occur was that p pileus generally inhabits the cold waters under the seasonal thermocline in the open black sea whereas b ovata feeds in the warm surface layer to which m leidyi is more or less confined mutlu 1999 shiganova et al 2001a the modelled reproductive sequence of m leidyi and b ovata clearly resulted from the predation of the latter on the former that indicated the robust reproductive sequence observed in the field for 16 years reflected the annual control of m leidyi by b ovata through the same sequence of predator prey mechanisms year after year however it was clear that b ovata could not eliminate m leidyi from the area because of this predator prey interaction because there were strong interannually variations in the abundances of both m leidyi and b ovata environmental conditions determined the joint abundances of the two species there was strong covariability between the numbers of m leidyi and b ovata year after year after the arrival of the latter in the northeastern black sea in 1999 fig 6 with a significant positive relationship between the maximum yearly numbers of the two species during the period 1999 2016 in our 27 year dataset the rather high abundance of m leidyi could be formed already in spring with its appearance in surface layer from the lower layer or from near bottom where specimens spent unfavorable temperature lower than 5 c its abundance significantly related to springtime temperature i e the value of 33 ind m 3 was exceeded only in the 11 years when springtime temperature 11 8 c this was consistent with the field based observation of shiganova et al 2014 that high spring temperatures elicited intense reproduction in summer and rapid population growth of m leidyi temperature was also related to the beginning of m leidyi reproduction in early summer i e june fig 8 the latter when temperature was higher since 2005 than before may have stimulated the earlier start of reproduction of m leidyi than before fig 7 in addition the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi was positively related to the summer biomass of its zooplankton food i e average concentration in june and july before the annual appearance of b ovata fig 7 b ovata seasonal variations also changed since 2012 due to increasing temperature in may up to 17 18 c b ovata started to appear in water column in may june and its seasonal dynamics in high degree coincides now with dynamics of m leidyi figs 6 and 7 which led to decreasing values of both ctenophores additional factor which contributed decreasing ctenophores is increasing temperature in july august higher than 27 c unfavorable for m leidyi reproduction the above field results were consistent with conclusions from previous observations and laboratory experiments for example shiganova et al 2001b assumed that the interannual variability in m leidyi was especially linked with changes in surface water temperature and food concentration i e edible micro and mesozooplankton likewise kremer 1994 suggested based on laboratory experiments on m leidyi from native waters that temperature was the most important factor in the development of m leidyi and that food came second shiganova et al 2004 derived a similar conclusion from laboratory experiments on m leidyi from black sea waters the above field results were also consistent with our model results where the maximum annual abundances of both m leidyi and b ovata were positively related to springtime temperature fig 11a and the maximum annual abundance of m leidyi was positively related to the maximum abundance of its food fig 11b 6 summary using our model we explored the effects of surface water temperature and zooplankton concentration on the development of m leidyi and consequently of b ovata we found that the maximum annual abundances of m leidyi and b ovata increased with increasing mean springtime temperature and earlier development of spring early summer zooplankton which is important for creation of m leidyi abundance and consequently for future development of b ovata we also found that changing the concentration of the m leidyi food i e zooplankton at the time of the annual development of that species mostly changed the maximum annual values reached by m leidyi and consequently b ovata in addition we found that time of appearance of b ovata was changed for as early as may with increasing temperature in may and as a result m leidyi did not have time to reach high abundance grazed by b ovata already since may we also found that m leidyi rate of reproduction decreased with increasing temperature higher than 27 c in july august model results were qualitatively the same as those from long term field observations in our model the environmental conditions that mostly influenced the joint abundances of the two species and determined the annual development of both species were for m leidyi springtime temperature and late july august biomass of zooplankton in june and for b ovata temperature in may and late july august and abundance of m leidyi in that time when m leidyi reached a peak of abundance and value of this peak but other environmental factors might also influence the joint abundances of m leidyi and b ovata in the natural environment acknowledgements this research was performed in the framework of

25302,we employ monte carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis techniques to describe the population dynamics of pesticide exposure to a honey bee colony using the varroapop pesticide model simulations are performed of hive population trajectories with and without pesticide exposure to determine the effects of weather queen strength foraging activity colony resources and varroa populations on colony growth and survival the daily resolution of the model allows us to conditionally identify sensitivity metrics simulations indicate queen strength and forager lifespan are consistent critical inputs for colony dynamics in both the control and exposed conditions adult contact toxicity application rate and nectar load become critical parameters for colony dynamics within exposed simulations daily sensitivity analysis also reveals that the relative importance of these parameters fluctuates throughout the simulation period according to the status of other inputs

nutrition and pesticide exposure goulson et al 2015 pettis and delaplane 2010 insecticide effects on honey bee colonies can be through direct mortality but sublethal exposures leading to adverse outcomes at the hive level also occur johnson 2015 generally from a pesticide regulatory perspective short term experiments are used to derive ecological exposure levels that are protective of direct mortality steeger et al 2015 however sublethal effects can have a lower threshold for significant colony level effects and regulatory processes are adapting to address these effects for pollinators epa 2012 regulatory agencies assess potential risks to honey bees from pesticides through a tiered process that includes individual based effects data colony based assessments under controlled test conditions and less controlled but more environmentally relevant conditions where bees forage freely model implementation is also tiered since extrapolating short term exposures to colony level

important component of pollinator risk management becher et al 2013 there is a need for a more detailed colony model to inform the design and interpretation of higher tier studies interpret the relevance of sublethal and lethal effects and estimate the effect of pesticides in conjunction with other known honey bee stressors e g varroa mites detailed honey bee simulations for pesticides must consider the structure of the colony which includes different life stages and castes i e eggs larvae pupae drones workers foragers queen as well as environmentally relevant magnitudes of exposure

pesticides used either directly within a hive or for agricultural uses unintentional exposure to agriculturally applied pesticides was high with a detection rate of 40 honey bees can be lethally impacted by exposure to pesticides but are most likely exposed to concentrations lower than lethal limits at sublethal levels pesticide exposure has been associated with changes in individual bee

screening assessment more realistic and taxa specific lines of evidence can be requested and evaluated before making a final registration decision for instance additional empirical exposure and effects data requirements for a higher tier honey bee colony model were identified in fischer and moriarty 2014 with a goal of addressing questions that cannot be answered with individual level tests semi field and field studies in addition sponsler and johnson 2016 identify key components of exposure modeling that are often lacking in population and colony level models environmental heterogeneity and in hive pesticide distribution the ability to model all possible exposure pathways from foraging dynamics to intra colony interactions is another important requirement fischer and moriarty 2014 included a formal evaluation of existing candidate models that assessed the risks to honey bees from pesticides none of the existing honey bee models were determined to be currently suitable for regulatory usage because of a variety of issues that included lack of linkage between foragers and surrounding landscape insufficient testing with empirical data lack of sensitivity analysis to understand controlling factors non incorporation of multiple stressors and insufficient documentation for some of the models for the usepa an existing usda model is being evaluated usepa 2012 2014 to simulate honey bee colony dynamics and provide an additional line of evidence for the pesticide evaluation process varroapop is a population model that predicts the population growth and behavior of a honey bee apis mellifera colony infested by varroa mites varroa destructor the model was developed as an extension of a honey bee population model beepop that was created by degrandi hoffman et al 1989 to simulate colony dynamics the modified version of beepop can then be used to translate mite effects on individuals and predict outcomes at the colony level and parameterized for specific environments purucker et al 2007 varroapop uses weather conditions mite population dynamics and age structured honey bee colony input parameters to calculate honey bee and mite population growth we updated the existing varroapop model to predict population growth and behavior by leveraging existing cohort development dynamics existing features included daily tracking of colony population size and demographics in which weather conditions mite population dynamics and age structured honey bee colony input parameters informed output this version of varroapop pesticide v3 2 6 11 introduces pesticide treatments to model simulations in which individuals can be exposed to the active ingredient by physical contact i e foraging or ingestion the model can be used to evaluate risks to honey bee colony survival from pesticide exposure at different times of year and with different weather and colony conditions the complexities of varroa parasitism and its effects on worker longevity and colony growth also can be included in simulations with pesticide induced sublethal and lethal effects at each life stage it also provides a platform for estimating the sublethal effects of pesticide exposure through future enhancements to the model we implement monte carlo simulations in order to create spatial heterogeneity and to vary in hive pesticide distribution in exposure scenarios we use sensitivity analyses to identify parameters that are the most influential contributing most to output variability as part of the continuing development of the model this helps highlight important parameters which may require additional research allow for the calibration of sensitive parameters to realistically simulate collected data determine parameters which are less important in order to avoid overparameterization and to assess the relative importance of subroutines that model elements of hive population dynamics sensitivity analysis has been a useful tool which has furthered understanding of other honey bee colony models schmickl and crailsheim 2007 becher et al 2014 torres et al 2015 we use the modified version of varroapop varroapop pesticide to evaluate temporally a baseline scenario without pesticide exposure and three exposure scenarios representing different application types foliar application seed treatment and soil application the sensitivity analyses are employed at different temporal scales within each application type to conditionally identify important parameters 2 methods 2 1 varroapop model varroapop was developed as an extension of the beepop colony population dynamics model to determine the effects of varroa mite parasitism on honey bee colony growth and survival varroapop couples mite population growth from reproduction and immigration with colony growth based on queen egg laying rates and worker longevity degrandi hoffman et al 1989 degrandi hoffman and curry 2004 degrandi hoffman et al 2016 varroa mites affect colony dynamics by reducing the longevity of adult workers parasitized during development an overview of the model routine is shown in fig 1 the flowchart at the top of the schematic diagram fig 1 represents the overall daily model algorithm 2 1 1 queen fecundity and hive dynamics the complete descriptions of beepop and varroapop are available from degrandi hoffman et al 1989 degrandi hoffman and curry 2004 and degrandi hoffman et al 2016 briefly colony growth was predicted based on the number of eggs laid per day egg laying was determined by the maximum number of eggs the queen can lay per day a function of queen strength maximum and minimum temperatures as expressed in heat units photoperiod and size of the adult worker population queen strength is initially parameterized as a continuous number between 1 and 5 which is used to linearly interpolate between values for the maximum daily number of eggs 1000 3000 and the initial sperm count 1 8 5 5 million as a queen ages the number of daily eggs laid by the queen declines as a quadratic function of the number of days the queen has been laying eggs the proportion of eggs that develop into workers i e fertilized eggs was determined as a function of photoperiod colony size and the amount of sperm in the queen s spermatheca workers are categorized as house bees workers 21 days old unless specified otherwise and foragers workers 21 days old workers do not perform specific tasks in the simulations foragers return nectar and pollen to the colony as the queen ages the concentration of sperm in the spermatheca is reduced and the probabilities of producing unfertilized eggs that develop into drones increases even if the queen has sufficient amounts of sperm to fertilize the eggs she lays colonies produce drones primarily in the late spring and summer the proportion of unfertilized eggs produced by queens with sufficient sperm was estimated as a function of colony size and photoperiod requeening within varroapop can be enabled with automatic or scheduled settings automatic requeening can be triggered once the proportion of drone eggs fell below a specified proportion during the foraging season april september however we scheduled requeening to occur annually starting on 05 01 1989 in both requeening scenarios an egg laying delay may be specified for the new queen the number of eggs fertilized and unfertilized laid each day was treated as a cohort that were aged to emerged adult workers or drones adult workers remain in the hive for 21 days and then forage for a specified number of days foraging bees collect nectar and pollen that is either consumed or stored if more is collected in a day than required to feed the colony precocious foraging was simulated by reducing the number of days that worker bees remain in the hive after emergence resources are assumed to be unlimited thus simulating a managed colony where beekeepers feed sugar syrup and protein substitute during resource shortages the total number of adult workers in all cohorts was reported as the colony population size and used to estimate egg laying 2 1 2 varroa mite infestation external parasites are a common stressor in managed honey bee colonies adult varroa destructor mites suck the hemolymph from adults and brood transmitting diseases and viruses that negatively impact the chances of colony survival nazzi and conte 2016 varroa populations are initialized in colonies by defining a percentage of adult workers and sealed brood cells with mites mites on adult workers infest worker and drone brood cells of appropriate age and reproduce mites that enter brood cells to reproduce are called mother mites the proportion of infested worker and drone cells where mites successfully reproduce is an input literature values for the number of mated daughter mites produced in each worker or drone brood cell are used as default values the daughter mites emerge from the brood cell with the adult bee the daughter mites and a percentage of the mother mites can then infest and reproduce in brood cells thus increasing the mite population infestation rates are predicted with a functional response equation based on the ratio of mites to brood cells colonies with high numbers of brood cells have higher brood cell infestation rates if mite populations exceed the number of brood cells the brood cells may be multiplicatively infested with mites mite reproduction per mother mite is reduced when cells are multiplicatively infested adult bees that were parasitized by mites during development have reduced longevity 2 1 3 accounting for pesticide exposures and effects to individual honey bees exposure routes for bees differ based on application type in the model bees foraging in a field treated with a pesticide through foliar spray could potentially be exposed to the pesticide through direct spray contact exposure as well through consuming contaminated food oral exposure direct spray onto bees contact exposure is not expected for honey bees foraging in fields treated with a pesticide through direct application to soil e g drip irrigation or through seed treatments for these application methods pesticide exposure through consumption of residues in nectar and pollen are expected to be the dominant routes foraging honey bees may also be exposed to pesticides via contact with dust from seed treatments or via consumption of water from surface water puddles dew droplet formation on leaves and guttation fluid however those routes will be implemented in a future version of the model the exposure and effect algorithms and parameters used in this model are defined in degrandi hoffman et al 2016 and appendix a table a1 estimating contact exposure to individual bees was assessed for forager bees following foliar spray applications koch and weisser 1997 contact exposure was considered on the day of pesticide application for in hive bees it was assumed that contact exposure was negligible relative to the oral exposure they would receive from consuming contaminated nectar and pollen collected from treated fields for soil applications and seed treatments contact exposure is not assessed in the version of varroapop used for this sensitivity analysis estimating dietary exposure to individual bees was calculated by multiplying food intake rates by pesticide concentrations in pollen nectar and jelly methods for estimating pesticide concentrations in pollen and nectar differ by application method with different algorithms for foliar spray soil applications and seed treatments usepa 2014 pesticide concentrations in royal and worker jelly are a factor of 100 lower than concentrations in pollen based on the least conservative ratio of concentrations of a pesticide in nurse bee food when processed into royal jelly usepa 2012 honey bee apis mellifera l adult workers females as well as drones males fulfill their nutritional requirements through consumption of a combination of nectar honey pollen and bee bread stored pollen combined with nectar or honey food consumption rates are expressed as nectar and pollen equivalents for bees that consume honey and bee bread larval and adult queens require royal jelly which is composed primarily of glandular secretions produced by nurse bees haydak 1970 worker larvae and drones receive royal jelly during the first 3 days of development and then receive brood food jelly for the remainder of their larval development period babendreier et al 2004 simpson 1955 over the course of the adult life stage an adult worker bee requires different portions of nectar honey and bee bread in order to meet the demands of the different tasks she must fulfill for example young bees that produce royal and brood jellies i e nurse bees require the most pollen compared to other bees engaged in different tasks because their glandular secretions provide protein and lipids to larvae and to the queen winston 1987 older forager bees require more nectar or honey to meet the energy demands of flying rortais et al 2005 and generally do not consume much pollen crailsheim et al 1992 2 1 4 pesticide exposure scenarios four different sets of monte carlo simulations were run in order to estimate the effects of pesticides on honey bee colony dynamics the exposure scenarios included foliar spray soil application and seed treatment in addition a set of control scenario simulations were implemented to serve as a baseline with which to contrast the application scenarios all non pesticide based life history and environmental variables were shared across the four sets of simulation inputs the model has the ability to use empirical concentration data for pollen nectar and bees however for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis these components were calculated with algorithms based on the application methods being assessed pesticide concentrations for foliar sprays on blooming plants i e pollen and nectar contamination was estimated by considering initial residue concentrations at the time of application fletcher et al 2004 and the effect of the dissipation of the pesticide as defined by a dissipation half life willis and mcdowell 1987 for this scenario required inputs that utilize input distributions include foliar dissipation half life in days application rate in lb a i a number of applications and the application interval in days the initial residue value was multiplied by the application rate of the pesticide to derive starting pesticide concentrations in pollen and nectar in modeling exposures over multiple days after application the half life accounts for the dissipation of pesticide residues pesticide concentrations in pollen and nectar of crops growing in treated soil was estimated from a model published by briggs et al 1982 1983 and modified by ryan et al 1988 the model depends upon the octanol water and organic carbon partitioning of a chemical as well as basic soil properties required inputs include application rate partitioning coefficients and the aerobic soil metabolism half life soil properties include the fraction of organic carbon in soil bulk density and soil water content since these properties were simulated from probability distributions a correlation was induced between octanol water and organic carbon partitioning to more accurately reflect their joint distributions pesticide concentration in soil at each daily time step can be estimated by dividing the application rate by the soil depth and incorporating loss processes degradation of the pesticide in soil was implemented with a chemical specific aerobic soil metabolism half life the approach assumes no additional losses of the pesticide from soil via leaching runoff or volatilization a transpiration stream concentration factor is then calculated using the above inputs to estimate the overall movement with which a pesticide moves from the soil root system and translocates to the aboveground portion of the plant including pollen and nectar for seed treatments the estimated pesticide concentration in pollen and nectar of treated crops is 1 μg a i g this is based on eppo s european plant protection organization screening value eppo 2010 since seed concentration is treated as a constant regardless of the application rate this is an insensitive parameter within the sensitivity analysis 2 1 5 method for translating pesticide toxicity data into mortality of bees to calculate the percent mortality to adults following field pollen nectar and contact exposure as well as larvae to in hive dietary exposure the model uses three separate dose response relationships that are based on toxicity inputs the percent reduction due to mortality is applied to the proportion of groups of individuals that do not have a tolerance threshold greater than the calculated dose tolerance thresholds are pre determined upon initializing the model or when births occur by dividing each cohort into equal numbers of bees and assigning each a set tolerance threshold note that the percent mortality predicted for different cohorts are different depending upon the age of exposure for example only foraging bees experience contact exposures also hive bees and foraging bees receive different dietary exposures of pesticides therefore toxicity parameters include adult oral ld50 and slope adult contact ld50 and slope and larval oral ld50 and slope the proportion of honey bees p hat that do not survive a given exposure concentration was calculated using probit analysis a specialized type of regression for binomial outcomes that accounts for the sigmoidal nature of the survival curve in this case for each combination of pesticide exposure and honey bee age class the outcome is the survival of the honey bee the algorithm translates environmental compartment exposure concentrations dose and toxicity to estimate the percent mortality for each cohort for larvae dietary exposure concentrations were recalculated for each day of the simulation and used with larval toxicity parameters to assess mortality to each larval cohort for all adults dietary based exposure concentrations were used in combination with the adult oral toxicity to estimate mortality to adult cohorts note that in hive bees have different dietary exposures than forager bees due to differences in exposure concentrations and feeding rates that can be attributed to different energetic requirements of their respective tasks for forager bees estimated exposures due to contact from foliar applications of pesticides were also used in conjunction with the contact based toxicity parameters 2 2 programming for monte carlo simulations varroapop was written in c using microsoft foundation classes mfc as the interface to the microsoft windows environment in the doc view architecture model in mfc the document contains all the relevant data and model inputs and a set of views that express the output of the model in the user interface in varroapop the document is represented externally with a vrp file that contains all the input data accessed by the varroapop pesticide algorithms the simulation was constructed around the model of a colony that experiences daily environmental updates the model can be executed interactively where a user inputs information and graphical and tabular output is presented at the end of each simulation run or it can be executed non interactively where the inputs are supplied with command line parameters and outputs are written to computer readable text files in addition the model can be executed via the command line with inputs passed in as text files r r development core team 2016 wrapper scripts were developed to leverage this feature and access the varroapop c binary and implement the monte carlo analyses for different exposure scenarios the scripts are structured in a sequential way to setup a local execution environment create the input distributions for the different exposure scenarios write an input file for each monte carlo simulation and then execute all the monte carlo simulations in a parallel processing manner by passing the input files to the varroapop executable as an argument the varroapop output files are written to disk as an external representation of the r objects for the inputs and outputs of each simulation these objects can then be read back from these files as two dimensional data frames for the sensitivity analysis post processing in r 2 2 1 implementation of monte carlo simulations monte carlo simulations were performed to assess how bee colony dynamics change with different methods of exposure with the varroapop pesticide model the model presents 3 types of pesticide application methods foliar spray seed and soil in total 20k simulations were run at 5000 runs per pesticide application method i e foliar soil seed and a control set in which pesticides were not applied all four sets of 5000 simulations were run with identical colony input parameters in order to isolate the impact of pesticide exposure on colony dynamics inputs for each run were selected from random uniform distributions the range limits of each distribution were defined according to previous studies observational data or expert opinion table 1 displays parameter information for the input distributions used in the monte carlo simulations non informative uniform distributions were used to capture a wide realistic range of parameter inputs that represent a wide range of possible colony settings and applied pesticides professional judgement was used to set the limits for the ranges since literature references only exist for specific settings all simulations were run for a duration of three years starting on january 1 1988 to december 31 1990 exposure simulations were run with a single pesticide application date on july 1 1989 during the growing season with exposures occurring in the subsequent month weather data from fresno ca was used from january 1 1988 to december 31 1990 the weather file includes daily values for variables such as precipitation cm day pan evaporation cm day mean temperature c wind speed cm s and solar radiation langleys day that are used as inputs for plant phenology and bee foraging behavior algorithms all sets of simulations were initialized with 10 000 adult worker bees 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses are used to identify parameters which are the most influential contributing most to output variability as part of the model calibration process to highlight parameters which require additional research for strengthening the knowledge base to determine parameters which are insignificant and can be eliminated from the final model to avoid overparameterization hamby 1994 iman and helton 1988 saltelli et al 2004 2008 sensitivity results are also used to assess the relative importance of subroutines that model elements of hive population dynamics multiple techniques can be used to analyze the performance of a model the partial correlation coefficient pcc function of the r package sensitivity pujol et al 2015 was used as a primary sensitivity metric for analyzing model output the pcc function is a bivariate correlation function based on the methods of saltelli et al 2000 this approach assumes a linear relationship between the input and output and provides measures of the relative contributions of various input parameters to the observed variations in output this method of linear sensitivity analyses pcc can provide an effective measure of importance of model inputs the partial correlation coefficient pcc is a measure of interaction between two input variables when removed from any interdependencies or correlations of other variables in a linear system pcc values range from 1 to 1 with positive and negative values indicating positive and negative correlations respectively the partial correlation coefficient is given by eq 1 1 r a b c r a b r a c r b c 1 r a c 2 1 r b c 2 where rabc is the pcc between variables a and b with variable c held constant monte carlo analyses were performed with the varroapop model to assess how bee colony dynamics change with exposure to pesticides inputs were parameterized with uniform distributions for relevant input variables in varroapop sensitivity analysis was performed by querying 5000 simulation results of a specific input and output variable within the 3d array for three pesticide treated and one non treated runs a three year simulation period was used with a pesticide application in the middle of the second year to allow for burn in and evaluation of sensitivity both before and after exposure application simulations that included pesticide treatments were run with a single pesticide application date with a 30 day exposure period all other colony input parameters were the same as in the non treated simulations 3 results 3 1 simulation time series and colony survival control simulations provide a statistical baseline with which to compare the partial correlation coefficients and model results of the exposed i e soil foliar seed simulations we utilize partial correlation coefficients pcc for sensitivity analysis addressed in section 3 2 to assess model performance of varroapop for controlled versus three exposed application scenarios controlled and exposed sets of simulations were run with identical base parameters which includes the requeening ability and associated parameters i e requeen strength colony size is a function of worker longevity overwintering success and spring time flight weather simulation results of the controlled i e no pesticide application scenario exhibited rebounding colony survival during the foraging season april september with die offs occurring during the winter over the simulated time period fig 2 overwintering mortality leads to a sharp decrease in colony size after which colony size continues to decline into the foraging season for 25 of the simulations across the controlled and exposed scenarios controlled and exposed simulations share identical colony input parameters and thus colony size patterns and diverge at the point of pesticide application the lower quartile of colonies in the controlled and exposed scenarios continue to decline without response to the pesticide application which is indicative of how parameters associated with intra colony bee dynamics i e queen strength and forager lifespan may be more influential on colony size than pesticide parameters the upper quartile of colonies in the exposed simulations display steeper rates of decline in colony size following the pesticide exposure compared to the controlled colonies the pattern of recovery of the foliar simulations displays a steady prolonged decline in colony survival whereas the soil simulations display rebounding colony dynamics following the exposure date fig 2 both methods of exposure i e foliar and soil struggle to recover and the pattern of recovery depends on the method of pesticide application differences in these patterns are indicative of how each pesticide application method impacts colonies through alternate routes of exposure which translates to varying colony dynamics sensitivity analysis results allow us to determine specific critical parameters that influence colony dynamics once pesticides are applied to the model further time conditional analysis reveals that the relative importance of these parameters fluctuates throughout the simulation period these results are discussed in depth with sensitivity analysis in section 3 2 the output profile of the monte carlo simulations by proportion of surviving output variables i e colony size foragers adult workers and capped worker brood shows the response behavior of colonies in different application scenarios fig 3 fig 3 displays the proportion of colonies that rebound after a pesticide application and the pattern of recovery for the remainder of the simulation period foliar and soil application methods have the strongest impact on colony dynamics over half of the simulated bee colonies of the soil condition fail to recover within a week of exposure bee colonies with soil pesticide applications die off at a steady linear rate the foliar spray application condition has a substantial but less severe impact on bee colonies than the soil condition when compared to the control scenario initially almost 90 of the colonies rebound after the foliar application scenario however the impact of the foliar spray application intensifies within six months following the application date and simulated colonies experience rebounding recovery until equilibrium is reached after the month long exposure period simulated honey bee colonies exposed to the seed condition maintain a steady rate of colony persistence similar to the control scenario throughout the exposure period and into the third year the variation in response to pesticide exposure methods is attributed to different routes of exposure to the colonies this is evident by breaking down the sensitivity analysis by day which is discussed in section 3 2 colony persistence is a product of the interaction of queen strengths and forager lifespans in fig 4 few colonies with weak queen strength on a scale of 1 5 survive up to the pesticide application date at end of the second foraging season the surviving colonies with weak queens are those with high average forager lifespans even so smaller colonies with short forager lifespans survive to this point on account of strong queens queen strength is the primary determinant of colony size prior to pesticide application and interactions between queen strengths of greater than 1 and high average forager lifespans allow for stronger colonies simulated colonies of the control and exposed scenarios share identical input parameters up to the pesticide application date we expect the relative importance of queen strength and forager lifespan to shift with time as colonies are exposed to pesticides for these time conditional results the relative sensitivities are as expected with forager lifespan and queen strength being the most influential parameters in the spring pesticide toxicity importance spiking in the summer during the pesticide application period and queen strength being the most influential parameter the rest of the year pesticide residue concentration in pollen affects colony dynamics and colony survival in different modes depending on what pesticide application method is used for the simulated colonies fig 5 summarizes each set of monte carlo simulations per application method and reveals how varroapop pesticide registers in hive pollen concentrations of pesticide application method simulations employing the foliar spray method exhibit relatively moderate pollen concentrations in less than 5 of the monte carlo simulations during the month in which pesticide is applied seed applications show a high frequency of relatively low concentrations of pesticide within the in hive pollen and low pesticide concentration of in hive pollen could explain the ability of simulated colonies to recover in the seed condition pollen concentrations resulting from the soil application method exhibit peculiar behavior as a result of internal model calculations for soil conditions 3 2 sensitivity analysis and colony survival colony dynamics and the potential for colony survival is dependent upon different input parameters according to the pesticide application type we utilize partial correlation coefficients pcc for sensitivity analysis to assess model performance of varroapop under the control scenario and three different pesticide application conditions initial sensitivity analysis of the control scenario demonstrates that colony size is primarily attributed to forager lifespan and queen strength across the entire simulation period regardless of the type of pesticide application fig 6 we utilize colony size to examine model performance because it presents comprehensive simulation results for analysis further investigation reveals that the importance of forager lifespan and queen strength remain strong parameters for colony size over all the application scenarios but their sensitivity fluctuates over time depending on pesticide application method and timing of exposure a comparison of sensitivity analysis results before and after pesticide exposure exhibits a shift in influential parameters over colony size with each application method fig 6 colony size depends on forager lifespan and queen strength to propagate colonies through the simulation time period but sensitivity results of each pesticide application method i e foliar seed soil reveals that toxicological parameters grow in influence with colony size the influence of the parameters that contribute to pesticide exposure slope and ld50 values for adults and larvae for the foliar scenario when summed have a similar level of influence as queen strength and forager lifespan in order to further understand the relationships between input parameters on colony size daily pcc values were calculated and examined across the simulated time period fig 6 the time series of pcc values following the pesticide application date reveals which toxicological parameters influence colony size and give some insight into lag effects inherent in the model queen strength requeen strength and forager lifespan maintain significant positive correlations on colony size amongst control and exposed scenarios the reported pcc values in table 2 represent the status colony dynamics 30 days after the pesticide application date daily breakout of these parameters for the foliar spray application simulations shows that the pcc value of adult contact ld50 falls below our minimum significance criterion over time while pesticide application rate remains a significant input parameter over the course of the simulation period for the soil application method sensitivity analysis shows that seed concentration significantly accounts for responses in colony size following pesticide application the majority of other input parameters included in the sensitivity analysis did not exhibit significant impacts on colony size however daily time series of pcc values across the simulation period fig 7 reveals influential input parameters that fall below the significance threshold of the sensitivity analysis 4 discussion 4 1 simulation results our simulation results show that honey bee colonies are less likely to recover from pesticide exposure relative to the control simulations in particular colonies with foliar spray and soil application methods exhibit the least recovery following pesticide application and exposure whereas colonies exposed to pesticides via the seed application method showed little difference compared to the control scenario we observe a minimum colony survival threshold in our monte carlo simulations queen strength and forager lifespan are strong factors for colony survival colonies with strong queens and workers with longer than average forager lifespan are more likely to survive than those with weak queens and short lived foragers this combined influence of queen strength and forager lifespan creates a minimum boundary condition for model parameterization and colony survival this boundary can fluctuate according to other influential parameters that arise with each pesticide application method queen strength remains the dominant parameter for colony survival across controlled and exposed simulations and throughout the simulation period 1 2 of simulated colonies with strong queen strengths do not survive through the first winter and up to the time when pesticide is applied in the second foraging season regardless of forager lifespan whereas 10 3 of colonies with forager lifespans greater than 10 days did not survive up to the pesticide application date independent of queen strength this highlights the influence of the queen strength parameter to direct colony dynamics independent of forager lifespan even so the dynamic of the relationship between queen strength and forager lifespan is strongly perturbed by intra colony events such as re queening simulation and sensitivity analysis results of the exposed methods reveal two mechanisms by which colony survival is affected between foliar spray and soil applications at face value monte carlo simulations of the foliar and soil conditions exhibit very similar responses to pesticide application however further investigation with sensitivity analysis reveals different pathways of pesticide exposure within the varroapop pesticide model foliar spray applications are often applied in domestic settings for garden use and provides a topical defense against target pests seed and soil application techniques are generally employed with systemic pesticides in which chemicals are integrated into the plant tissues dively and kamel 2012 reported higher insecticide residues in pollen and nectar of foliar applications than of soil or seed applications in their exposure study foliar spray application rate and adult contact ld50 become critical parameters in the foliar condition which indicates mortality of foraging individuals via direct exposure to spray applications our results however do not indicate if foraging bees that come into direct contact with foliar applied pesticides die on contact or lose cognitive function and expire before returning to the hive 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis indicates that colony survival is most influenced by routes of pesticide exposure outside of the hive via forager interaction with dosed pollen and nectar sensitivity analysis results of the foliar spray condition indicate application rate nectar load and adult contact ld50 as significant critical parameters for colony persistence in actual colonies pesticides can enter the hive in pollen and nectar and be stored in comb cells the model simulates this by determining the nectar and pollen requirements of a colony each day depending on population size varroapop calculates pesticide residue in nectar and pollen from foliar spray as a function of application rate and dissipation with time therefore the estimated field concentrations of topical pesticide residue in pollen and nectar are a direct factor of the application rate however pesticide residues inside the hive are a function of application rate and a number of other colony dynamic factors adult contact ld50 refers to the median lethal dose of adults via contact exposure to pesticide residue in the varroapop pesticide model foraging bees are the primary caste of workers that come into direct contact with dosed pollen and nectar varroapop defines forager interaction with pollen and nectar as contact based or direct exposure queen strength and forager lifespan remain to be the most critical parameters for colony survival over the course of the simulation period other parameters associated with internal colony dynamics and individual exposure to pesticides react to pesticide application in the exposure scenarios and temporarily dictate colony dynamics but these become less critical over time such that queen strength and forager lifespan become the main drivers of colony dynamics post exposure the importance of queen strength is associated with egg laying potential and how the colony perpetuates from the initial number of eggs laid and the worker to drone ratio forager lifespan determines the resource dynamics of the hive via foraging trips and collected nectar and pollen loads queen strength and forager lifespan together drive colony dynamics including survival through the winter and in pesticide exposure conditions sensitivity analysis of the varroapop pesticide model provides guidance for future model development linear sensitivity analysis reveals queen strength and forager lifespan as consistent critical parameters for colony dynamics regardless of pesticide exposure the relative importance of pesticide parameters is a function of toxicity and application rates and can fluctuate over time as displayed in the time conditional sensitivity analysis adult contact ld50 and application rate became critical parameters of colony dynamics in the foliar application method simulations whereas pollen load was the most critical toxicological parameter in the soil application method simulations sensitivity indices of the seed application method did not identify sensitive toxicological parameters since simulation results displayed colony dynamics that did not deviate significantly from the control conditions daily time series of sensitivity values allows for detailed observation of model behavior and interactions between critical parameters 4 3 model restrictions and potential modifications with the recent sensitivity analysis results and conclusions in mind opportunities exist to make additional model modifications to strengthen model behavior regarding colony dynamics and toxicological effects allowing for multiple pesticide applications at different times will warrant long term simulations and strengthened toxicological modeling within varroapop pesticide further modifications may also be informed by evaluating simulation results against empirical data from field studies the current model version includes resource storage consumption and gathering metrics which can serve as a foundation to add the impact of resource availability to the model e g impacts to egg laying brood cannibalism seasonal effects implementing these details into colony dynamics could identify additional sensitive resource parameters additionally having these monte carlo capabilities provides opportunities for model calibration in specific exposure settings for example calibrating the model for specific data sets that contain application details and field collected data e g pollen concentrations pollen loads cohort survival rates allows for more confidence in the realism of the model this implementation also provides a basis for future incorporation of sublethal impacts of pesticide exposure and resulting effects on hive outcomes 5 conclusion sensitivity analyses with varroapop pesticide indicates queen strength and forager lifespan as consistent critical parameters for colony dynamics regardless of pesticide exposure the influence of the parameters that contribute to pesticide exposure and effects e g application inputs toxicity values for adults and larvae and foraging parameters are partitioned amongst those parameters but have a similar level of influence as queen strength and forager lifespan when aggregated the relative importance of pesticide parameters is a function of toxicity and application rate conditionally implementing the sensitivity analyses on a daily timescale demonstrates that the relative importance of these parameters fluctuates throughout the simulation period in response to external events for these time conditional results the relative sensitivities are as expected with forager lifespan and queen strength being most influential parameters in the spring pesticide exposure and effects parameters spiking in importance in the aftermath of pesticide application and queen strength being the most influential parameters the rest of the year by using sensitivity analysis to assess model output and variability the development calibration and application of simulation models to environmental risk assessment can be better informed and potentially yield more accurate predictions and inference for complex ecological processes 6 software availability the c binary for the latest release of the varroapop program and the r code that implements the sensitivity analysis and generates

pesticides used either directly within a hive or for agricultural uses unintentional exposure to agriculturally applied pesticides was high with a detection rate of 40 honey bees can be lethally impacted by exposure to pesticides but are most likely exposed to concentrations lower than lethal limits at sublethal levels pesticide exposure has been associated with changes in individual bee

screening assessment more realistic and taxa specific lines of evidence can be requested and evaluated before making a final registration decision for instance additional empirical exposure and effects data requirements for a higher tier honey bee colony model were identified in fischer and moriarty 2014 with a goal of addressing questions that cannot be answered with individual level tests semi field and field studies in addition sponsler and johnson 2016 identify key components of exposure modeling that are often lacking in population and colony level models environmental heterogeneity and in hive pesticide distribution the ability to model all possible exposure pathways from foraging dynamics to intra colony interactions is another important requirement fischer and moriarty 2014 included a formal evaluation of existing candidate models that assessed the risks to honey bees from pesticides none of the existing honey bee models were determined to be currently suitable for regulatory usage because of a variety of issues that included lack of linkage between foragers and surrounding landscape insufficient testing with empirical data lack of sensitivity analysis to understand controlling factors non incorporation of multiple stressors and insufficient documentation for some of the models for the usepa an existing usda model is being evaluated usepa 2012 2014 to simulate honey bee colony dynamics and provide an additional line of evidence for the pesticide evaluation process varroapop is a population model that predicts the population growth and behavior of a honey bee apis mellifera colony infested by varroa mites varroa destructor the model was developed as an extension of a honey bee population model beepop that was created by degrandi hoffman et al 1989 to simulate colony dynamics the modified version of beepop can then be used to translate mite effects on individuals and predict outcomes at the colony level and parameterized for specific environments purucker et al 2007 varroapop uses weather conditions mite population dynamics and age structured honey bee colony input parameters to calculate honey bee and mite population growth we updated the existing varroapop model to predict population growth and behavior by leveraging existing cohort development dynamics existing features included daily tracking of colony population size and demographics in which weather conditions mite population dynamics and age structured honey bee colony input parameters informed output this version of varroapop pesticide v3 2 6 11 introduces pesticide treatments to model simulations in which individuals can be exposed to the active ingredient by physical contact i e foraging or ingestion the model can be used to evaluate risks to honey bee colony survival from pesticide exposure at different times of year and with different weather and colony conditions the complexities of varroa parasitism and its effects on worker longevity and colony growth also can be included in simulations with pesticide induced sublethal and lethal effects at each life stage it also provides a platform for estimating the sublethal effects of pesticide exposure through future enhancements to the model we implement monte carlo simulations in order to create spatial heterogeneity and to vary in hive pesticide distribution in exposure scenarios we use sensitivity analyses to identify parameters that are the most influential contributing most to output variability as part of the continuing development of the model this helps highlight important parameters which may require additional research allow for the calibration of sensitive parameters to realistically simulate collected data determine parameters which are less important in order to avoid overparameterization and to assess the relative importance of subroutines that model elements of hive population dynamics sensitivity analysis has been a useful tool which has furthered understanding of other honey bee colony models schmickl and crailsheim 2007 becher et al 2014 torres et al 2015 we use the modified version of varroapop varroapop pesticide to evaluate temporally a baseline scenario without pesticide exposure and three exposure scenarios representing different application types foliar application seed treatment and soil application the sensitivity analyses are employed at different temporal scales within each application type to conditionally identify important parameters 2 methods 2 1 varroapop model varroapop was developed as an extension of the beepop colony population dynamics model to determine the effects of varroa mite parasitism on honey bee colony growth and survival varroapop couples mite population growth from reproduction and immigration with colony growth based on queen egg laying rates and worker longevity degrandi hoffman et al 1989 degrandi hoffman and curry 2004 degrandi hoffman et al 2016 varroa mites affect colony dynamics by reducing the longevity of adult workers parasitized during development an overview of the model routine is shown in fig 1 the flowchart at the top of the schematic diagram fig 1 represents the overall daily model algorithm 2 1 1 queen fecundity and hive dynamics the complete descriptions of beepop and varroapop are available from degrandi hoffman et al 1989 degrandi hoffman and curry 2004 and degrandi hoffman et al 2016 briefly colony growth was predicted based on the number of eggs laid per day egg laying was determined by the maximum number of eggs the queen can lay per day a function of queen strength maximum and minimum temperatures as expressed in heat units photoperiod and size of the adult worker population queen strength is initially parameterized as a continuous number between 1 and 5 which is used to linearly interpolate between values for the maximum daily number of eggs 1000 3000 and the initial sperm count 1 8 5 5 million as a queen ages the number of daily eggs laid by the queen declines as a quadratic function of the number of days the queen has been laying eggs the proportion of eggs that develop into workers i e fertilized eggs was determined as a function of photoperiod colony size and the amount of sperm in the queen s spermatheca workers are categorized as house bees workers 21 days old unless specified otherwise and foragers workers 21 days old workers do not perform specific tasks in the simulations foragers return nectar and pollen to the colony as the queen ages the concentration of sperm in the spermatheca is reduced and the probabilities of producing unfertilized eggs that develop into drones increases even if the queen has sufficient amounts of sperm to fertilize the eggs she lays colonies produce drones primarily in the late spring and summer the proportion of unfertilized eggs produced by queens with sufficient sperm was estimated as a function of colony size and photoperiod requeening within varroapop can be enabled with automatic or scheduled settings automatic requeening can be triggered once the proportion of drone eggs fell below a specified proportion during the foraging season april september however we scheduled requeening to occur annually starting on 05 01 1989 in both requeening scenarios an egg laying delay may be specified for the new queen the number of eggs fertilized and unfertilized laid each day was treated as a cohort that were aged to emerged adult workers or drones adult workers remain in the hive for 21 days and then forage for a specified number of days foraging bees collect nectar and pollen that is either consumed or stored if more is collected in a day than required to feed the colony precocious foraging was simulated by reducing the number of days that worker bees remain in the hive after emergence resources are assumed to be unlimited thus simulating a managed colony where beekeepers feed sugar syrup and protein substitute during resource shortages the total number of adult workers in all cohorts was reported as the colony population size and used to estimate egg laying 2 1 2 varroa mite infestation external parasites are a common stressor in managed honey bee colonies adult varroa destructor mites suck the hemolymph from adults and brood transmitting diseases and viruses that negatively impact the chances of colony survival nazzi and conte 2016 varroa populations are initialized in colonies by defining a percentage of adult workers and sealed brood cells with mites mites on adult workers infest worker and drone brood cells of appropriate age and reproduce mites that enter brood cells to reproduce are called mother mites the proportion of infested worker and drone cells where mites successfully reproduce is an input literature values for the number of mated daughter mites produced in each worker or drone brood cell are used as default values the daughter mites emerge from the brood cell with the adult bee the daughter mites and a percentage of the mother mites can then infest and reproduce in brood cells thus increasing the mite population infestation rates are predicted with a functional response equation based on the ratio of mites to brood cells colonies with high numbers of brood cells have higher brood cell infestation rates if mite populations exceed the number of brood cells the brood cells may be multiplicatively infested with mites mite reproduction per mother mite is reduced when cells are multiplicatively infested adult bees that were parasitized by mites during development have reduced longevity 2 1 3 accounting for pesticide exposures and effects to individual honey bees exposure routes for bees differ based on application type in the model bees foraging in a field treated with a pesticide through foliar spray could potentially be exposed to the pesticide through direct spray contact exposure as well through consuming contaminated food oral exposure direct spray onto bees contact exposure is not expected for honey bees foraging in fields treated with a pesticide through direct application to soil e g drip irrigation or through seed treatments for these application methods pesticide exposure through consumption of residues in nectar and pollen are expected to be the dominant routes foraging honey bees may also be exposed to pesticides via contact with dust from seed treatments or via consumption of water from surface water puddles dew droplet formation on leaves and guttation fluid however those routes will be implemented in a future version of the model the exposure and effect algorithms and parameters used in this model are defined in degrandi hoffman et al 2016 and appendix a table a1 estimating contact exposure to individual bees was assessed for forager bees following foliar spray applications koch and weisser 1997 contact exposure was considered on the day of pesticide application for in hive bees it was assumed that contact exposure was negligible relative to the oral exposure they would receive from consuming contaminated nectar and pollen collected from treated fields for soil applications and seed treatments contact exposure is not assessed in the version of varroapop used for this sensitivity analysis estimating dietary exposure to individual bees was calculated by multiplying food intake rates by pesticide concentrations in pollen nectar and jelly methods for estimating pesticide concentrations in pollen and nectar differ by application method with different algorithms for foliar spray soil applications and seed treatments usepa 2014 pesticide concentrations in royal and worker jelly are a factor of 100 lower than concentrations in pollen based on the least conservative ratio of concentrations of a pesticide in nurse bee food when processed into royal jelly usepa 2012 honey bee apis mellifera l adult workers females as well as drones males fulfill their nutritional requirements through consumption of a combination of nectar honey pollen and bee bread stored pollen combined with nectar or honey food consumption rates are expressed as nectar and pollen equivalents for bees that consume honey and bee bread larval and adult queens require royal jelly which is composed primarily of glandular secretions produced by nurse bees haydak 1970 worker larvae and drones receive royal jelly during the first 3 days of development and then receive brood food jelly for the remainder of their larval development period babendreier et al 2004 simpson 1955 over the course of the adult life stage an adult worker bee requires different portions of nectar honey and bee bread in order to meet the demands of the different tasks she must fulfill for example young bees that produce royal and brood jellies i e nurse bees require the most pollen compared to other bees engaged in different tasks because their glandular secretions provide protein and lipids to larvae and to the queen winston 1987 older forager bees require more nectar or honey to meet the energy demands of flying rortais et al 2005 and generally do not consume much pollen crailsheim et al 1992 2 1 4 pesticide exposure scenarios four different sets of monte carlo simulations were run in order to estimate the effects of pesticides on honey bee colony dynamics the exposure scenarios included foliar spray soil application and seed treatment in addition a set of control scenario simulations were implemented to serve as a baseline with which to contrast the application scenarios all non pesticide based life history and environmental variables were shared across the four sets of simulation inputs the model has the ability to use empirical concentration data for pollen nectar and bees however for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis these components were calculated with algorithms based on the application methods being assessed pesticide concentrations for foliar sprays on blooming plants i e pollen and nectar contamination was estimated by considering initial residue concentrations at the time of application fletcher et al 2004 and the effect of the dissipation of the pesticide as defined by a dissipation half life willis and mcdowell 1987 for this scenario required inputs that utilize input distributions include foliar dissipation half life in days application rate in lb a i a number of applications and the application interval in days the initial residue value was multiplied by the application rate of the pesticide to derive starting pesticide concentrations in pollen and nectar in modeling exposures over multiple days after application the half life accounts for the dissipation of pesticide residues pesticide concentrations in pollen and nectar of crops growing in treated soil was estimated from a model published by briggs et al 1982 1983 and modified by ryan et al 1988 the model depends upon the octanol water and organic carbon partitioning of a chemical as well as basic soil properties required inputs include application rate partitioning coefficients and the aerobic soil metabolism half life soil properties include the fraction of organic carbon in soil bulk density and soil water content since these properties were simulated from probability distributions a correlation was induced between octanol water and organic carbon partitioning to more accurately reflect their joint distributions pesticide concentration in soil at each daily time step can be estimated by dividing the application rate by the soil depth and incorporating loss processes degradation of the pesticide in soil was implemented with a chemical specific aerobic soil metabolism half life the approach assumes no additional losses of the pesticide from soil via leaching runoff or volatilization a transpiration stream concentration factor is then calculated using the above inputs to estimate the overall movement with which a pesticide moves from the soil root system and translocates to the aboveground portion of the plant including pollen and nectar for seed treatments the estimated pesticide concentration in pollen and nectar of treated crops is 1 μg a i g this is based on eppo s european plant protection organization screening value eppo 2010 since seed concentration is treated as a constant regardless of the application rate this is an insensitive parameter within the sensitivity analysis 2 1 5 method for translating pesticide toxicity data into mortality of bees to calculate the percent mortality to adults following field pollen nectar and contact exposure as well as larvae to in hive dietary exposure the model uses three separate dose response relationships that are based on toxicity inputs the percent reduction due to mortality is applied to the proportion of groups of individuals that do not have a tolerance threshold greater than the calculated dose tolerance thresholds are pre determined upon initializing the model or when births occur by dividing each cohort into equal numbers of bees and assigning each a set tolerance threshold note that the percent mortality predicted for different cohorts are different depending upon the age of exposure for example only foraging bees experience contact exposures also hive bees and foraging bees receive different dietary exposures of pesticides therefore toxicity parameters include adult oral ld50 and slope adult contact ld50 and slope and larval oral ld50 and slope the proportion of honey bees p hat that do not survive a given exposure concentration was calculated using probit analysis a specialized type of regression for binomial outcomes that accounts for the sigmoidal nature of the survival curve in this case for each combination of pesticide exposure and honey bee age class the outcome is the survival of the honey bee the algorithm translates environmental compartment exposure concentrations dose and toxicity to estimate the percent mortality for each cohort for larvae dietary exposure concentrations were recalculated for each day of the simulation and used with larval toxicity parameters to assess mortality to each larval cohort for all adults dietary based exposure concentrations were used in combination with the adult oral toxicity to estimate mortality to adult cohorts note that in hive bees have different dietary exposures than forager bees due to differences in exposure concentrations and feeding rates that can be attributed to different energetic requirements of their respective tasks for forager bees estimated exposures due to contact from foliar applications of pesticides were also used in conjunction with the contact based toxicity parameters 2 2 programming for monte carlo simulations varroapop was written in c using microsoft foundation classes mfc as the interface to the microsoft windows environment in the doc view architecture model in mfc the document contains all the relevant data and model inputs and a set of views that express the output of the model in the user interface in varroapop the document is represented externally with a vrp file that contains all the input data accessed by the varroapop pesticide algorithms the simulation was constructed around the model of a colony that experiences daily environmental updates the model can be executed interactively where a user inputs information and graphical and tabular output is presented at the end of each simulation run or it can be executed non interactively where the inputs are supplied with command line parameters and outputs are written to computer readable text files in addition the model can be executed via the command line with inputs passed in as text files r r development core team 2016 wrapper scripts were developed to leverage this feature and access the varroapop c binary and implement the monte carlo analyses for different exposure scenarios the scripts are structured in a sequential way to setup a local execution environment create the input distributions for the different exposure scenarios write an input file for each monte carlo simulation and then execute all the monte carlo simulations in a parallel processing manner by passing the input files to the varroapop executable as an argument the varroapop output files are written to disk as an external representation of the r objects for the inputs and outputs of each simulation these objects can then be read back from these files as two dimensional data frames for the sensitivity analysis post processing in r 2 2 1 implementation of monte carlo simulations monte carlo simulations were performed to assess how bee colony dynamics change with different methods of exposure with the varroapop pesticide model the model presents 3 types of pesticide application methods foliar spray seed and soil in total 20k simulations were run at 5000 runs per pesticide application method i e foliar soil seed and a control set in which pesticides were not applied all four sets of 5000 simulations were run with identical colony input parameters in order to isolate the impact of pesticide exposure on colony dynamics inputs for each run were selected from random uniform distributions the range limits of each distribution were defined according to previous studies observational data or expert opinion table 1 displays parameter information for the input distributions used in the monte carlo simulations non informative uniform distributions were used to capture a wide realistic range of parameter inputs that represent a wide range of possible colony settings and applied pesticides professional judgement was used to set the limits for the ranges since literature references only exist for specific settings all simulations were run for a duration of three years starting on january 1 1988 to december 31 1990 exposure simulations were run with a single pesticide application date on july 1 1989 during the growing season with exposures occurring in the subsequent month weather data from fresno ca was used from january 1 1988 to december 31 1990 the weather file includes daily values for variables such as precipitation cm day pan evaporation cm day mean temperature c wind speed cm s and solar radiation langleys day that are used as inputs for plant phenology and bee foraging behavior algorithms all sets of simulations were initialized with 10 000 adult worker bees 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses are used to identify parameters which are the most influential contributing most to output variability as part of the model calibration process to highlight parameters which require additional research for strengthening the knowledge base to determine parameters which are insignificant and can be eliminated from the final model to avoid overparameterization hamby 1994 iman and helton 1988 saltelli et al 2004 2008 sensitivity results are also used to assess the relative importance of subroutines that model elements of hive population dynamics multiple techniques can be used to analyze the performance of a model the partial correlation coefficient pcc function of the r package sensitivity pujol et al 2015 was used as a primary sensitivity metric for analyzing model output the pcc function is a bivariate correlation function based on the methods of saltelli et al 2000 this approach assumes a linear relationship between the input and output and provides measures of the relative contributions of various input parameters to the observed variations in output this method of linear sensitivity analyses pcc can provide an effective measure of importance of model inputs the partial correlation coefficient pcc is a measure of interaction between two input variables when removed from any interdependencies or correlations of other variables in a linear system pcc values range from 1 to 1 with positive and negative values indicating positive and negative correlations respectively the partial correlation coefficient is given by eq 1 1 r a b c r a b r a c r b c 1 r a c 2 1 r b c 2 where rabc is the pcc between variables a and b with variable c held constant monte carlo analyses were performed with the varroapop model to assess how bee colony dynamics change with exposure to pesticides inputs were parameterized with uniform distributions for relevant input variables in varroapop sensitivity analysis was performed by querying 5000 simulation results of a specific input and output variable within the 3d array for three pesticide treated and one non treated runs a three year simulation period was used with a pesticide application in the middle of the second year to allow for burn in and evaluation of sensitivity both before and after exposure application simulations that included pesticide treatments were run with a single pesticide application date with a 30 day exposure period all other colony input parameters were the same as in the non treated simulations 3 results 3 1 simulation time series and colony survival control simulations provide a statistical baseline with which to compare the partial correlation coefficients and model results of the exposed i e soil foliar seed simulations we utilize partial correlation coefficients pcc for sensitivity analysis addressed in section 3 2 to assess model performance of varroapop for controlled versus three exposed application scenarios controlled and exposed sets of simulations were run with identical base parameters which includes the requeening ability and associated parameters i e requeen strength colony size is a function of worker longevity overwintering success and spring time flight weather simulation results of the controlled i e no pesticide application scenario exhibited rebounding colony survival during the foraging season april september with die offs occurring during the winter over the simulated time period fig 2 overwintering mortality leads to a sharp decrease in colony size after which colony size continues to decline into the foraging season for 25 of the simulations across the controlled and exposed scenarios controlled and exposed simulations share identical colony input parameters and thus colony size patterns and diverge at the point of pesticide application the lower quartile of colonies in the controlled and exposed scenarios continue to decline without response to the pesticide application which is indicative of how parameters associated with intra colony bee dynamics i e queen strength and forager lifespan may be more influential on colony size than pesticide parameters the upper quartile of colonies in the exposed simulations display steeper rates of decline in colony size following the pesticide exposure compared to the controlled colonies the pattern of recovery of the foliar simulations displays a steady prolonged decline in colony survival whereas the soil simulations display rebounding colony dynamics following the exposure date fig 2 both methods of exposure i e foliar and soil struggle to recover and the pattern of recovery depends on the method of pesticide application differences in these patterns are indicative of how each pesticide application method impacts colonies through alternate routes of exposure which translates to varying colony dynamics sensitivity analysis results allow us to determine specific critical parameters that influence colony dynamics once pesticides are applied to the model further time conditional analysis reveals that the relative importance of these parameters fluctuates throughout the simulation period these results are discussed in depth with sensitivity analysis in section 3 2 the output profile of the monte carlo simulations by proportion of surviving output variables i e colony size foragers adult workers and capped worker brood shows the response behavior of colonies in different application scenarios fig 3 fig 3 displays the proportion of colonies that rebound after a pesticide application and the pattern of recovery for the remainder of the simulation period foliar and soil application methods have the strongest impact on colony dynamics over half of the simulated bee colonies of the soil condition fail to recover within a week of exposure bee colonies with soil pesticide applications die off at a steady linear rate the foliar spray application condition has a substantial but less severe impact on bee colonies than the soil condition when compared to the control scenario initially almost 90 of the colonies rebound after the foliar application scenario however the impact of the foliar spray application intensifies within six months following the application date and simulated colonies experience rebounding recovery until equilibrium is reached after the month long exposure period simulated honey bee colonies exposed to the seed condition maintain a steady rate of colony persistence similar to the control scenario throughout the exposure period and into the third year the variation in response to pesticide exposure methods is attributed to different routes of exposure to the colonies this is evident by breaking down the sensitivity analysis by day which is discussed in section 3 2 colony persistence is a product of the interaction of queen strengths and forager lifespans in fig 4 few colonies with weak queen strength on a scale of 1 5 survive up to the pesticide application date at end of the second foraging season the surviving colonies with weak queens are those with high average forager lifespans even so smaller colonies with short forager lifespans survive to this point on account of strong queens queen strength is the primary determinant of colony size prior to pesticide application and interactions between queen strengths of greater than 1 and high average forager lifespans allow for stronger colonies simulated colonies of the control and exposed scenarios share identical input parameters up to the pesticide application date we expect the relative importance of queen strength and forager lifespan to shift with time as colonies are exposed to pesticides for these time conditional results the relative sensitivities are as expected with forager lifespan and queen strength being the most influential parameters in the spring pesticide toxicity importance spiking in the summer during the pesticide application period and queen strength being the most influential parameter the rest of the year pesticide residue concentration in pollen affects colony dynamics and colony survival in different modes depending on what pesticide application method is used for the simulated colonies fig 5 summarizes each set of monte carlo simulations per application method and reveals how varroapop pesticide registers in hive pollen concentrations of pesticide application method simulations employing the foliar spray method exhibit relatively moderate pollen concentrations in less than 5 of the monte carlo simulations during the month in which pesticide is applied seed applications show a high frequency of relatively low concentrations of pesticide within the in hive pollen and low pesticide concentration of in hive pollen could explain the ability of simulated colonies to recover in the seed condition pollen concentrations resulting from the soil application method exhibit peculiar behavior as a result of internal model calculations for soil conditions 3 2 sensitivity analysis and colony survival colony dynamics and the potential for colony survival is dependent upon different input parameters according to the pesticide application type we utilize partial correlation coefficients pcc for sensitivity analysis to assess model performance of varroapop under the control scenario and three different pesticide application conditions initial sensitivity analysis of the control scenario demonstrates that colony size is primarily attributed to forager lifespan and queen strength across the entire simulation period regardless of the type of pesticide application fig 6 we utilize colony size to examine model performance because it presents comprehensive simulation results for analysis further investigation reveals that the importance of forager lifespan and queen strength remain strong parameters for colony size over all the application scenarios but their sensitivity fluctuates over time depending on pesticide application method and timing of exposure a comparison of sensitivity analysis results before and after pesticide exposure exhibits a shift in influential parameters over colony size with each application method fig 6 colony size depends on forager lifespan and queen strength to propagate colonies through the simulation time period but sensitivity results of each pesticide application method i e foliar seed soil reveals that toxicological parameters grow in influence with colony size the influence of the parameters that contribute to pesticide exposure slope and ld50 values for adults and larvae for the foliar scenario when summed have a similar level of influence as queen strength and forager lifespan in order to further understand the relationships between input parameters on colony size daily pcc values were calculated and examined across the simulated time period fig 6 the time series of pcc values following the pesticide application date reveals which toxicological parameters influence colony size and give some insight into lag effects inherent in the model queen strength requeen strength and forager lifespan maintain significant positive correlations on colony size amongst control and exposed scenarios the reported pcc values in table 2 represent the status colony dynamics 30 days after the pesticide application date daily breakout of these parameters for the foliar spray application simulations shows that the pcc value of adult contact ld50 falls below our minimum significance criterion over time while pesticide application rate remains a significant input parameter over the course of the simulation period for the soil application method sensitivity analysis shows that seed concentration significantly accounts for responses in colony size following pesticide application the majority of other input parameters included in the sensitivity analysis did not exhibit significant impacts on colony size however daily time series of pcc values across the simulation period fig 7 reveals influential input parameters that fall below the significance threshold of the sensitivity analysis 4 discussion 4 1 simulation results our simulation results show that honey bee colonies are less likely to recover from pesticide exposure relative to the control simulations in particular colonies with foliar spray and soil application methods exhibit the least recovery following pesticide application and exposure whereas colonies exposed to pesticides via the seed application method showed little difference compared to the control scenario we observe a minimum colony survival threshold in our monte carlo simulations queen strength and forager lifespan are strong factors for colony survival colonies with strong queens and workers with longer than average forager lifespan are more likely to survive than those with weak queens and short lived foragers this combined influence of queen strength and forager lifespan creates a minimum boundary condition for model parameterization and colony survival this boundary can fluctuate according to other influential parameters that arise with each pesticide application method queen strength remains the dominant parameter for colony survival across controlled and exposed simulations and throughout the simulation period 1 2 of simulated colonies with strong queen strengths do not survive through the first winter and up to the time when pesticide is applied in the second foraging season regardless of forager lifespan whereas 10 3 of colonies with forager lifespans greater than 10 days did not survive up to the pesticide application date independent of queen strength this highlights the influence of the queen strength parameter to direct colony dynamics independent of forager lifespan even so the dynamic of the relationship between queen strength and forager lifespan is strongly perturbed by intra colony events such as re queening simulation and sensitivity analysis results of the exposed methods reveal two mechanisms by which colony survival is affected between foliar spray and soil applications at face value monte carlo simulations of the foliar and soil conditions exhibit very similar responses to pesticide application however further investigation with sensitivity analysis reveals different pathways of pesticide exposure within the varroapop pesticide model foliar spray applications are often applied in domestic settings for garden use and provides a topical defense against target pests seed and soil application techniques are generally employed with systemic pesticides in which chemicals are integrated into the plant tissues dively and kamel 2012 reported higher insecticide residues in pollen and nectar of foliar applications than of soil or seed applications in their exposure study foliar spray application rate and adult contact ld50 become critical parameters in the foliar condition which indicates mortality of foraging individuals via direct exposure to spray applications our results however do not indicate if foraging bees that come into direct contact with foliar applied pesticides die on contact or lose cognitive function and expire before returning to the hive 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis indicates that colony survival is most influenced by routes of pesticide exposure outside of the hive via forager interaction with dosed pollen and nectar sensitivity analysis results of the foliar spray condition indicate application rate nectar load and adult contact ld50 as significant critical parameters for colony persistence in actual colonies pesticides can enter the hive in pollen and nectar and be stored in comb cells the model simulates this by determining the nectar and pollen requirements of a colony each day depending on population size varroapop calculates pesticide residue in nectar and pollen from foliar spray as a function of application rate and dissipation with time therefore the estimated field concentrations of topical pesticide residue in pollen and nectar are a direct factor of the application rate however pesticide residues inside the hive are a function of application rate and a number of other colony dynamic factors adult contact ld50 refers to the median lethal dose of adults via contact exposure to pesticide residue in the varroapop pesticide model foraging bees are the primary caste of workers that come into direct contact with dosed pollen and nectar varroapop defines forager interaction with pollen and nectar as contact based or direct exposure queen strength and forager lifespan remain to be the most critical parameters for colony survival over the course of the simulation period other parameters associated with internal colony dynamics and individual exposure to pesticides react to pesticide application in the exposure scenarios and temporarily dictate colony dynamics but these become less critical over time such that queen strength and forager lifespan become the main drivers of colony dynamics post exposure the importance of queen strength is associated with egg laying potential and how the colony perpetuates from the initial number of eggs laid and the worker to drone ratio forager lifespan determines the resource dynamics of the hive via foraging trips and collected nectar and pollen loads queen strength and forager lifespan together drive colony dynamics including survival through the winter and in pesticide exposure conditions sensitivity analysis of the varroapop pesticide model provides guidance for future model development linear sensitivity analysis reveals queen strength and forager lifespan as consistent critical parameters for colony dynamics regardless of pesticide exposure the relative importance of pesticide parameters is a function of toxicity and application rates and can fluctuate over time as displayed in the time conditional sensitivity analysis adult contact ld50 and application rate became critical parameters of colony dynamics in the foliar application method simulations whereas pollen load was the most critical toxicological parameter in the soil application method simulations sensitivity indices of the seed application method did not identify sensitive toxicological parameters since simulation results displayed colony dynamics that did not deviate significantly from the control conditions daily time series of sensitivity values allows for detailed observation of model behavior and interactions between critical parameters 4 3 model restrictions and potential modifications with the recent sensitivity analysis results and conclusions in mind opportunities exist to make additional model modifications to strengthen model behavior regarding colony dynamics and toxicological effects allowing for multiple pesticide applications at different times will warrant long term simulations and strengthened toxicological modeling within varroapop pesticide further modifications may also be informed by evaluating simulation results against empirical data from field studies the current model version includes resource storage consumption and gathering metrics which can serve as a foundation to add the impact of resource availability to the model e g impacts to egg laying brood cannibalism seasonal effects implementing these details into colony dynamics could identify additional sensitive resource parameters additionally having these monte carlo capabilities provides opportunities for model calibration in specific exposure settings for example calibrating the model for specific data sets that contain application details and field collected data e g pollen concentrations pollen loads cohort survival rates allows for more confidence in the realism of the model this implementation also provides a basis for future incorporation of sublethal impacts of pesticide exposure and resulting effects on hive outcomes 5 conclusion sensitivity analyses with varroapop pesticide indicates queen strength and forager lifespan as consistent critical parameters for colony dynamics regardless of pesticide exposure the influence of the parameters that contribute to pesticide exposure and effects e g application inputs toxicity values for adults and larvae and foraging parameters are partitioned amongst those parameters but have a similar level of influence as queen strength and forager lifespan when aggregated the relative importance of pesticide parameters is a function of toxicity and application rate conditionally implementing the sensitivity analyses on a daily timescale demonstrates that the relative importance of these parameters fluctuates throughout the simulation period in response to external events for these time conditional results the relative sensitivities are as expected with forager lifespan and queen strength being most influential parameters in the spring pesticide exposure and effects parameters spiking in importance in the aftermath of pesticide application and queen strength being the most influential parameters the rest of the year by using sensitivity analysis to assess model output and variability the development calibration and application of simulation models to environmental risk assessment can be better informed and potentially yield more accurate predictions and inference for complex ecological processes 6 software availability the c binary for the latest release of the varroapop program and the r code that implements the sensitivity analysis and generates

25303,old growth beech fagus sylvatica l forests in europe show a structural heterogeneity which distinguish from managed ones recent investigations revealed that facilitative belowground interactions might counteract aboveground competition for light however the exact interaction of these mechanisms is unclear we developed the beechplasticity beep model to investigate whether the mere focus on the aboveground competition for canopy space with subsequent modeling of the light transmittance through the forest canopy suffices to reproduce the observed structural attributes the beep model is individual based and explicitly describes the plasticity of tree crowns in a three dimensional space through a geometric approach this conceptual design allows tracing neighborhood effects to the forest stand level we ran 10 simulation experiments with 1000 time steps on a simulation area of 0 5öha we analyzed the emerging spatial point patterns gap dynamics as well as distributions of tree age tree height tree crown projection area and tree diameter by applying various indices that revealed the emergent horizontal and vertical forest structure we were able to show a strong mutual link between beech crown plasticity and forest heterogeneity the crown plasticity enabled the trees to close small gaps which resulted in a highly dynamic tree regeneration which in turn led to a small scale heterogeneous forest structure we found that over long periods crown centroids of canopy trees taller than 20öm were more regularly distributed than stem foot points absolute crown displacements were greater than reported from beech stands in north germany and the sudetes in the czech republic this indicates a need to restrain the model crown growth in order to recognize tree architecture and stability we could simulate an increasing forest structural heterogeneity starting with a structural homogeneous layer of tree saplings we showed that forest structures similar to those in unmanaged beech forests took several tree generations or approximately 700 time steps to emerge we recommend enhancing this model approach with spatial explicit modeling of the leaf area distribution which has already been done for single beech trees keywords old growth forests beech fagus sylvatica l crown plasticity 1 introduction today relicts of virgin beech forests fagus sylvatica l in europe are scattered and are mostly of small size leibundgut 1993 smejkal et al 1997 tabaku 2000 while extensive forests are exceptional tabaku 2000 hobi et al 2015a this situation is the result of a human induced reduction of beech forest once the most important forest community in central europe peterken 1996 consequently relict beech forests have been listed as a unesco world natural heritage vološčuk 2014 hobi et al 2015a found multi layered beech forests stands interrupted by mostly small canopy gaps and a high abundance of old large diameter trees in the ukrainian carpathians less than 2 of the gaps were greater than 200 m² hobi et al 2015b similar results have been reported from slovenian virgin beech forests zeibig et al 2005 beech trees are able to adapt their crown shape according to neighborhood crown pressure and available photosynthetic active radiation par petriţan et al 2009 this mechanism is known as crown plasticity release events in the forest canopy caused by the death of trees lead to an extension of tree crowns into canopy gaps muth and bazzaz 2001 fichtner et al 2013 if the gap is sufficiently small closure is reached after several years depending on the vitality of the trees that surround the gap edges canopy gaps remain if their size is beyond the average shoot growth potential of the canopy trees trees position their crowns away from neighborhood pressure and shading muth and bazzaz 2003 crown displacement can be described by the horizontal distance between the stem foot position and the center of gravity or centroid of the crown projection area schröter et al 2012 spatial statistics such as ripley s k function ripley 1977 or the clark evans index clark and evans 1954 have been successfully applied in revealing different spatial patterns of tree stem foot positions and their crown centroids leaving the latter more regularly distributed than stem foot positions schröter et al 2012 bulušek et al 2016 however only a few studies directly link the observed patterns to the underlying processes e g fichtner et al 2015 crown plasticity facilitates the expansion of the tree crown into canopy gaps and in turn enhances individual tree growth juchheim et al 2017 demonstrating the importance of plastic tree crowns as a driver of forest dynamics fichtner et al 2013 glatthorn et al 2017 this mechanism has already been studied for mixed species forests longuetaud et al 2013 jucker et al 2015 and for pinus sylvestris l forests uria diez and pommerening 2017 the interplay between canopy openings and crown plasticity alters the environmental conditions beneath the forest canopy and impacts the growth of understory trees however well studied are only the influences of gap size on the light regime and microclimatic conditions for beech forests ritter et al 2005 gálhidy et al 2006 bílek et al 2014 čater et al 2014 čater and kobler 2017 the analysis of belowground processes is still hard to handle and results from the few available studies are contradicting for example beech trees seem to compete size asymmetrically for belowground resources and this behavior is in contrast to many other species beyer et al 2013 facilitative effects have been also observed particularly between small and large diameter trees these effects for example are attributed to mycorrhizal networks beiler et al 2015 fichtner et al 2015 it seems to be established however that belowground processes can counteract the aboveground intraspecific competition in old growth beech forests fichtner et al 2015 which demonstrates the complementarity of both and the basis for the complexity of the net outcome of tree interactions in near natural beech forests facilitative effects have been observed between small and large diameter trees probably caused by mycorrhizal networks beiler et al 2015 fichtner et al 2015 these effects could even increase the resilience of forests against environmental changes which would be in agreement with the hypotheses that forests with a long ecological continuity are better adapted to global change than others von oheimb et al 2014 various case studies demonstrated the existence of beech microbial mutualism e g cesarz et al 2013 beech selectively allocates carbon to specific mycorrhizal species at the root tip level valtanen et al 2014 mycorrhizal species exert a functional feedback on their hosts in terms of nutrient uptake transfer and storage seven and polle 2014 klein et al 2016 revealed a significant carbon exchange in a temperate forest even between trees of different species however empirical studies have not been able to capture the importance of these belowground interactions for stand dynamics so far the question arises how above and belowground processes interact and if focusing on one mechanism alone namely the aboveground competition for light and crown space could explain the patterns and structures we observe in beech forests individual based models e g lin et al 2012 grueters et al 2014 provide an excellent basis to address such questions however the focus on the aboveground competition for light needs the explicit description of beech crown plasticity which has not been achieved yet the grid based model before can reproduce the mosaic pattern of developmental stages of old growth beech forests rademacher et al 2004 but does not include tree crown plasticity individual based forest models such as les include plastic tree crowns liénard and strigul 2016 but do not explicitly model beech forests beech crown dynamics were accurately modeled for single trees but not for complete stands nor from an individual based perspective beyer et al 2014 2015 2017 this led us to the development of the beechplasticity beep model which is able to simulate plastic tree crowns from an individual based perspective for whole forest stands the plasticity approach used in this model is geometric and was already applied for modelling crown plasticity of hevea brasiliensis willd vincent and harja 2008 we applied the model to the question if spatial point patterns crown displacements gap dynamics and subsequent alteration of the light transmittance through the forest canopy can be reproduced by only focusing on modeling the aboveground competition for crown space 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model the description of our individual based beep model grimm and railsback 2005 follows the odd protocol grimm et al 2010 2 1 1 purpose the beep model was developed for the description of old growth forests of european beech fagus sylvatica l the model explicitly considers tree crown plasticity as a response to available radiation and neighboring tree crowns the model is used to explore the mutual link between light competition crown shift random loss of crown parts tree growth and mortality particular emphasis is placed on the importance of crown plasticity for structural patterns such as the vertical heterogeneity in tree heights and horizontal distribution patterns of stem locations and crown centroids 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the beep model has only one entity namely individual beech trees they are described by a set of simple state variables characterizing the location for the tree and the dimension of the stem x y m m coordinates of the stem foot point dbh cm stem diameter at breast height h m tree height further state variables specify the crowns dimensions m height of the crown onset point the x y coordinates are equal to the stem foot point of the tree the crown onset point is the origin of the crown vectors shown in fig 1 x y z m m m coordinates of the points spanning the crown surface vectors connecting the onset point with the various points on the crown surface are referred to as crown vectors considering the photosynthetic active radiation par as environmental factor the pacl percentage of above canopy light received is the last state variable of the trees regulating their height growth one time step represents one year space is described in three dimensions the typical size of a simulated plot is 0 5 ha in order to keep the simulation time manageable but can be varied by the experimenter 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the model describes five processes namely regeneration radiation mortality as well as height and crown growth the flowchart in fig 2 shows the sequence of their execution regeneration assumes a masting rhythm of three time steps the new tree recruits are established in a minimum distance of 0 3 m of an established tree if the light availability described as pacl threshold is sufficient the process radiation describes the availability of photosynthetic active radiation par within the forest stand this occurs in two steps 1 the total par above the canopy is decomposed into direct and diffuse par and their spatial distributions are simulated over the upper hemisphere 2 the transmission of the direct and diffuse radiation through the canopy pacl is calculated as percentage of above canopy light according to the lambert beer bouguer s law with leaf area density as the driving variable the total par in step 1 is executed only once during the initialization of a simulation experiment the transmission in step 2 is calculated for each tree in each simulation step considering light competition by neighboring trees the process mortality refers to the death of a tree which occurs if its crown cannot be maintained this can occur either as a result of competition for crown space see section 2 1 9 or as a consequence of random losses of crown points due to tree senescence all trees are initialized with a certain threshold mortality index which informs about the tree height at which its senescence begins see section 2 1 5 this index is the relation of the current tree height to its maximum tree height as the tree reaches its individual threshold e g 95 of its maximum height a random number of its crown points is deleted this process is repeated the following time steps until the crown point number falls below a threshold see section 2 1 9 height and crown growth describes 1 the increase of the tree height as a function of tree age and pacl and 2 the extension of the crown surface by increasing the crown vectors see fig 1 the length of the crown vector extension depends on the realized height growth and the available space in the canopy defined by competing neighboring trees this can result in crown shape distortion stem diameter is derived from the crown projection area sections 2 1 7 2 1 10 provide detailed information about the implementation of the processes in the related submodels 2 1 4 design concepts basic principles height and crown growth base on the classical concept of optimal growth reduced by correction factors the attenuation of the photosynthetic active radiation par in the canopy is calculated according to bouguer s law using leaf area density as main factor emergence the size distributions of tree dimensions tree height and diameter at breast height as well as the spatial patterns of tree stem foot points and crown centroids emerge from the neighborhood interactions and the ecological processes described by the model adaptation trees adapt their crown to the neighborhood constellation due to this plasticity they optimize their use of the available canopy space objectives not relevant learning not relevant prediction not relevant sensing trees sense neighboring crowns for this all crown points of a focal tree check for crown points of neighbors in a vision cone the vision cone is a cone with an opening angle of 60 and a height of 10 m set with its tip upon a crown point see fig 3 for further details interaction trees interact a indirectly via the reduction of the available light beneath their canopy light competition and b directly by hindering the growth of crown vectors of neighbor trees space competition stochasticity the stem foot positions of the tree x and y coordinates and individual tree variables determine the height and crown vector growth in particular three parameters defining the maximum size of the trees namely maximum height maxh maximum pace of height increment maxhp and maximum stem diameter in breast height potd are random the mortality index that determines tree senescence is random as well collectives not relevant observation stem foot position crown centroid diameter at breast height tree height and crown projection area are registered for all trees of the forest stand at each time step we reduced edge effects by truncating a boundary of 10 m from the edges and excluded the simulated individuals from analysis 2 1 5 initialization at the start of the simulation a number of 3000 small tree saplings are randomly distributed over the simulated area of 0 5 ha we initiate the simulation with tree saplings to create a more realistic forest canopy development although beginning with mature trees is possible as well we had to reduce the initial sapling number and the simulation area due to simulation speed limits the x and y coordinates of the stem foot point are drawn from a uniform distribution these values fix the simulation area so that new tree recruits see section 2 1 7 cannot establish outside this area the initial values of the state variables and model parameters are assigned to the trees see table 1 for details a tree sapling is characterized by a height of 0 05 m a diameter of breast height of 0 cm and an initial crown radius of 0 05 m at the beginning every tree is characterized by a pacl value of 1 and a mortality index ranging between 0 8 and 0 98 see details in section 2 1 9 we assume a maximum dbh of 150 cm given by the parameter maxd which we derived from inventory data dolnik et al 2008 we parameterized the crown diameter and height growth relationship with inventory data from the municipal forest of lübeck schattiner zuschlag which has not been managed for more than 100 years dolnik et al 2008 table 1 provides an overview on the model parameters as tree growth is described phenomenologically the maximum tree height maxh and the maximum pace of height increment maxhp are randomly chosen and are not part of a detailed process based submodel we draw values for these parameters from a normal distribution see table 1 to create initial differences in height and crown growth 2 1 6 input data the distribution of diffuse and direct radiation at the position of the town lübeck n 53 52 1738 e 10 41 2547 north germany is calculated in advance and loaded in the initialization process details of the calculation are given in brunner 1998 and in section 2 1 8 2 1 7 regeneration trees become adult with an age of 60 years gruber 2003 we assume a synchronous masting rhythm of 3 time steps for all adult beech canopy trees taller than 20 m gruber 2003 in a masting year every mature canopy tree produces five saplings we restrict the sapling number to reduce the computational effort the saplings are distributed in a ballistic way 1 a dispersal angle is randomly chosen between 0 and 360 2 a dispersal distance is chosen from a poisson distribution using the average crown radius λ of the parent tree as expected value tree positions with a sapling parent tree distance smaller than 0 3 m or pacl below 3 are deleted if the pacl at any particular location is greater than 3 a new tree is initialized according to section 2 1 5 but with its tree position already calculated 2 1 8 radiation the growth of the trees depends on the received percentage of above canopy light pacl the model calculates light interception and transfer through the forest stand with the ray tracing algorithm according to brunner 1998 in this approach photosynthetic active radiation par attenuation in the modeled canopy is calculated according to bouguer s law with leaf area density as the driving variable by tracing sample rays distributed over a hemisphere the model calculates the spatial distribution of direct and diffuse par in the forest stand resulting in the pacl of a particular tree to apply this the model initializes the exact position of 8192 sample rays over a hemisphere and calculates the direct and diffuse radiation for every ray above the canopy the ray number was chosen according to the results of the sensitivity analysis by brunner 1998 the ray distribution is almost even while the average angular resolution is 0 01 in the altitude direction and 0 04 in the azimuthal direction this setting does not change during the simulation the sum of diffuse and direct radiation for every ray is specified as the above canopy light acl this acl is calculated from the exact sun positions during the period from march to october for the town lübeck in north germany this distribution of total par is provided as a file and loaded into the model before initialization as this radiation model was developed for rotation symmetric crown shapes brunner 1998 we adapted the model to asymmetric crown shapes we do not consider stems and branches as obstructions to irradiance and we further assume leaf area density to be constant within the individual tree crown we estimate the leaf area density lad for every tree according to the results of beyer et al 2017 depending on tree height h with 1 lad a h² b h c firstly the model identifies all trees taller than the focal tree and then calculates which rays from the given distribution are obstructed by a tree crown the obstructed ray passes through the crown of a neighbor tree while its path length m path through the crown is estimated as 2 path cl cos φ where cl is the crown length m being the difference between the tree height h and the height of the crown onset point o and φ is the zenith angle of the particular ray the resulting percentage of above canopy light for the particular ray paclray is calculated as 3 paclray exp 0 5 lad path the sum of all paclray values of all obstructed rays and the acl values of all unobstructed rays gives the pacl of the focal tree we assume the simulated plot to be embedded in a closed forest which does not allow rays to pass through the forest canopy beyond the borders of the simulated plot this affects the pacl calculation of edge trees which are excluded from further analysis 2 1 9 mortality individual trees die if they cannot maintain a minimum number of 10 crown points the minimum number of 10 equals the number of crown points that can be gained at every time step see section 2 1 10 below any tree with a point number less than 10 is automatically deleted we chose this deterministic approach to establish a proxy for a minimum growth that the tree must be able to maintain the exact number of 10 points is further considered a result of the regular crown point arrangement see fig 1 the number of crown points can fall below this threshold due to neighbor crown competition every crown point of a particular tree detects neighbor crown points in an upright vision cone with an opening angle of 60 and a height of 10 m these crown points of a particular tree are deleted if they detect more than two neighbor crown points if the crown point number of the tree falls below 10 as a result of this competition for crown space the individual tree is deleted details in section 2 1 10 furthermore trees cannot only die from competition for canopy space but also through a decline in their vitality we included this decline with a mortality index that signals at which point of the tree development tree senescence begins which means a loss of crown points this mortality index is assigned at the beginning 4 m h maxh we chose to base this index on the tree height in order to avoid a maximum tree age in contrast we assume that the trees begin to decline when they reach a height between 80 and 98 of their maximum height maxh while the mortality index itself is drawn from a normal distribution the link between tree mortality and the maximum tree dimension is deterministic when a tree reaches its mortality index m a random number of its crown points are deleted in the following time steps these crown points can have any location in the individual tree crown this procedure continues until the threshold of 10 crown points see above cannot be maintained and the individual tree is deleted thus the decline of the tree spreads over several time steps and its crown gradually shrinks which allows a gradual canopy opening and increase of pacl values in the forest understory however large scale forest disturbance is not recognized through this approach 2 1 10 height and crown growth a tree grows by extending its crown surface relative to its vertical stem axis this is described in two steps 1 the calculation of the potential height growth based on the theoretical age of the tree pretzsch 2001 which will be 2 modified to the realized height growth by light competition the theoretical age of the tree ta depends on the current tree height h 5 ta ln 1 h maxh 0 5 maxhp where maxh gives the maximum height a tree can reach and maxhp modifies the pace of height increment the theoretical age defines that particular age the tree should have under optimum growing conditions the potential height growth pi is then derived from the theoretical age ta and the current tree height h pretzsch 2001 by 6 pi maxh 1 exp maxhp ta 1 2 h based on this information the extension of all crown vectors can be calculated as described in the following the potential height increment pi equals the maximum possible extension of all crown vectors in a next step the potential growth pi is modified by the relative growth response rg to the available pacl burschel and schmaltz 1965a b gemmel et al 1996 ammer 2000 kunstler et al 2005 and a shoot reduction factor sr the rg is calculated as 7 rg d 1 exp e pacl f where d e and f are coefficients considering the shade tolerance of beech saplings we assume that growth is possible if pacl is equal or greater than 3 emborg 1998 modry et al 2004 and adjusted the parameter values table 1 accordingly the rg ranges between 0 and 1 the relative growth response is calculated on the tree level in the following the growth of the crown vectors is calculated we assume beech trees reduce the growth of crown vectors according to the position of the crown vectors to the individual stem axis if the available pacl is less than 100 this leads to slender crown shapes of trees in the understory the reduction is achieved by the shoot reduction factor sr ranging from 0 1 to 1 the minimum value of 0 1 secures that a crown vector cannot shrink the growth is linearly reduced according to the angle between the crown vector and the stem axis following the equation 8 sr g pacl h α 1 where α is the angle between the stem axis and the particular crown vector g and h are parameters specified in table 1 the lower the available pacl the more slender the tree crown becomes on the contrary if the pacl is 100 no reduction is imposed the tree crown then develops to a hemispherical shape the realized increment i of the particular crown vector is then 9 i pi rg sr all crown vectors are extended at once according to their crown vector increment this leads to a crown surface expansion and an increase in tree height the new tree height h is the maximum z coordinate of all crown points which have been relocated by the crown vector growth neighbor crowns hinder the crown vector growth thus before extending a crown vector the particular crown point senses neighbor crown points in an upright vision cone with a height of 10 m and an opening angle of 60 see fig 3 crown points of the focal tree crown are excluded from detection the particular crown point is deleted if more than two points are detected point number set by calibration which enables the contact between neighboring tree crowns but prevents further crown intersection the crown onset point with height o moves to the next minimum height of the crown points if a complete lower crown part is deleted see fig 3a the maximum upward movement depends on the vertical distance between crown points the crown points itself remain unaltered but the crown vector orientation changes so that new vectors can be created at the crown top if the angle α is greater than 5 see fig 3c this mechanism provides an optimum of crown space occupation we assume only 10 new points are created at every time step by calibration the interplay between crown point loss due to competition or senescence and crown vector growth changes the trees crown space occupation the horizontal projection of the crown points forms a polygon of n crown points this crown projection area cpa can increase or decrease as a result of the interaction described above tree diameter dbh is derived from the crown projection area cpa and calculated by 10 dbh maxd 1 exp i cpa potd where i maxd and potd are parameters the parameter potd alters the crown efficiency which is the basal area increment per crown surface area increment fichtner et al 2013 while the crown projection area can decrease the diameter cannot the diameter at breast height increases if the crown projection area grows 2 2 sensitivity and robustness analysis we explored the influence of various sets of input parameters on model output with a sensitivity analysis ginot et al 2006 in particular we performed classical local sensitivity analysis altering one parameter at a time bar massada and carmel 2008 as well as global sensitivity analysis where we varied several input parameters over broad parameter ranges the results for a global sensitivity analysis are presented in the appendix a in supplementary data of special importance was the parameter fitting of the standard deviations used for initializing the maxh and maxhp parameters that determine the tree height and crown growth changes in these standard deviations caused the self thinning trajectory of a homogeneous simulated stand to change which was not revealed by global but through local sensitivity analysis increasing the initial standard deviation of these parameters causes the tree competition for canopy space to increase which in turn steepens the self thinning trajectory as this trajectory is of vital importance for forest model development we fitted the parameter standard deviations for maxh and maxhp according to empirical results from unmanaged beech forests pretzsch and mette 2008 condés et al 2017 we performed robustness analysis grimm and berger 2016 to test model behavior under extreme parameter values and to test the accuracy of different submodels described in section 2 1 we provide details in appendix b in supplementary data 2 3 data analysis we implemented 10 simulation runs to account for model sensitivity the initial conditions for every simulation were held constant each simulation was run for 1000 time steps on an area of 0 5 ha we set the simulation time to 1000 time steps to allow several tree generations to develop and the forest structure to emerge we stopped the simulation after 1000 time steps because of the structural development of the forest presented below the simulation area is restricted to 0 5 ha due to simulation speed limits we reduced edge effects by truncating a boundary of 10 m from the edges and excluded the simulated individuals from analysis as we assume the simulated plot to be embedded in a closed forest edge trees experience the greatest competition in terms of pacl we calculated three indices to describe the forest structural development over the simulation period all indices are described in the following we compared the simulated indices to those calculated from empirical forest stands from unmanaged beech forests this comparison aims not at reproducing the exact forest stands in terms of age and size distributions but rather attempts to reveal whether the simulation model is able to reach the levels of empirical indices we analyzed the horizontal forest structure with the clark evans aggregations index r and the crown shift index csi see below which is based on besag s transformation of ripley s k l r we analyzed the spatial point patterns of stem foot points and crown centroids with besag s transformation of ripley s k function besag 1977 the crown centroid is the center of gravity of the horizontal crown projection that forms a polygon of n crown points see section 2 1 10 the center of gravity of this polygon is calculated as the mean of the gravity centers of the triangles in which the polygon can be split weighted by the respective triangle area crown centroid calculation was performed with the r packages rgeos bivand and rundel 2017 and sp pebesma and bivand 2005 besag s transformation of ripley s k function was calculated with the r package ads pelissier and goreaud 2015 and is defined as 11 l r k r π 0 5 where k r is ripley s k function and l r is besag s transformation l r is calculated for a set of sample radii from 0 m to 10 m in 0 1 m intervals we used l r values for comparison with empirical data and for the calculation of the csi index we calculated the clark evans aggregation index r clark and evans 1954 for stem foot points and crown centroids with the package spatstat baddeley et al 2015 to describe the horizontal forest structure we used the edge correction according to donnelly 1978 for the calculation of the theoretically expected value for the mean nearest neighbor distance under a poisson process we compared clark evans indices to empirical calculations from virgin beech forests clark evans r is defined as the ratio between the distance of a point to its nearest neighbor ra and the mean expected value of a randomly distributed population re 12 r ra re0 r 2 15 clark evans indices greater than 1 indicate a regular point distribution values below 1 indicate point aggregation we compared the simulated clark evans indices with observed indices from unmanaged beech forests in the sudetes of the czech republic bulušek et al 2016 which are characterized by a large range of growing conditions and successional stages the csi index is a measure of the enhanced regularity of the crown centroids compared to the stem foot positions which is a result of the horizontal crown displacement at first we subtracted all radii r from the l r values which yielded negative l r r values we calculated the csi as the difference between the centroid and stem area under the curve auc which was calculated from the negative l r r values for sample radii from 0 m to 10 m in 0 1 m intervals the auc is the area under the curve for all l r r values under zero fig 4 if the centroid s auc is greater than the auc of the stem foot points the csi is positive and the centroids are more regularly distributed we analyzed the vertical forest structural diversity with the shannon index e g mcarthur and macarthur 1961 which is calculated over a set of 11 height classes h ranging from 0 m to 55 m each of which is characterized by a height of 5 m 13 s i i 1 h p i l n p i pi describes the relative abundance of a particular height class i which is the number of trees in a particular height class i divided by the total number of trees the greater the si values the greater is the vertical structure of the forest to describe horizontal and vertical forest structure in one measure we calculated the structural complexity index sci zenner and hibbs 2000 firstly we triangulated a x y spatial point data set of stem foot points with the r package deldir turner 2001 which gave a network of non overlapping triangles secondly we assigned every vertex a z coordinate given by the particular tree height this second step yielded a three dimensional surface of triangles covering the forest heterogeneity both in the horizontal and in the vertical direction thirdly we gained the sci by dividing the sum of all surface triangle areas through the sum of the projected triangle areas the sci value is thus a measure of forest rugosity the greater the sci values the greater is the forest structure described by the index we compared the simulated csi si and sci values with the observed indices calculated for an unmanaged beech forest stand in north east germany schröter et al 2012 which is characterized by a late terminal and senescence successional state all model simulation and analysis was carried out with r 3 4 0 r development core team 2017 using further the latest versions of the packages geometry habel et al 2015 plyr wickham 2011 and mgcv wood 2006 and rgl adler and murdoch 2017 we provide the source code of the model simulation as a separate file in the appendix 3 results the development of the csi values reveals distinct periods in which crown centroids of canopy trees show an enhanced regularity indicated by positive csi values compared to stem foot points fig 5 these periods are initiated by the death of canopy trees the length of the periods appears to extend while the forest structure becomes increasingly dispersed with small gaps after approximately 700 simulated time steps the former remarkable fluctuation observable in forest stand values ceases and is replaced by an average state of variables csi values are positive over the majority of simulation steps the average crown shift values absolute displacement for canopy trees taller than 20 m range between 0 and 5 m empirical values from unmanaged beech forests are 1 95 m schröter et al 2012 and 1 5 m bulušek et al 2016 respectively the increasing forest heterogeneity is revealed by increasing sci values see fig 6 the csi follows the sci and si after a certain time lag which indicates the reaction of tree crowns csi to sudden canopy openings and subsequent increase of forest heterogeneity sci and si in their neighborhood sci si and csi correspond with each other which shows the strong mutual link between tree mortality and crown plasticity altering the forest structure initial si fluctuations show artifacts caused by early mortality in the developing forest both sci and si values show that structural heterogeneity increases over the simulation period however the increase decelerates towards the end of the simulation period of 1000 time steps red dashed lines in fig 6 show that indices calculated for a beech forest stand in north east germany lie within the range of simulated values while the extent of forest heterogeneity of the empirical forest stand appears not to have reached its maximum because the structural complexity index sci is relatively low compared to simulated indices the comparison of clark evans indices to empirical observations from protected areas in the sudetes of the czech republic bulušek et al 2016 in fig 7 shows that crown centroids are more regularly distributed relative to stem foot positions but simulated indices bold lines cannot fully cover the whole range of empirical values the simulation model appears not to reach the level of regularity of the crown centroids observed in beech forests in the sudetes 4 discussion this study presents the first individual based beech forest model which describes the dynamic tree crown adaption to an asymmetric competition environment by means of simulation experiments we were able to show that the mere focus on aboveground competition for light suffices to generate the structures and patterns observed in old growth forests tree height and crown growth is mechanistic and not based on a process based hydraulic or photosynthetic submodel in contrast to many other forest models e g pretzsch et al 2002 the diameter at breast height dbh is not a driving variable but results from the occupied crown space of beech trees this mechanism allows individual trees to change their allometry in terms of a height diameter relationship we showed a strong mutual link between beech crown plasticity and emergent vertical and horizontal forest structure the structural complexity index sci for a beech stand in north germany schröter et al 2012 was relatively low compared to our simulation results which may be a result of the absence of measured tree regeneration with a diameter at breast height below 7 cm in the study of schröter et al 2012 the values for the average crown displacement for large canopy trees 20 m outreach the values reported from schröter et al 2012 and bulušek et al 2016 respectively this indicates that the crown growth in the beep model has to be more restrained for instance to ensure architectural stability of the whole tree which is not yet recognized we showed that crown centroids are more regularly distributed than stem foot positions over long periods of the simulation runs and that the extent of regularity is within the range of empirical findings although the maximum values for clark evans indices bulušek et al 2016 could not be matched the enhanced regularity is a result of the local neighborhood adaption of canopy trees to gaps and is the reason for the stand productivity even in late successional stages in which leaf area losses from sudden deaths of individual trees can be rapidly compensated glatthorn et al 2017 the beech crown plasticity increases canopy space filling and stand productivity juchheim et al 2017 the interplay of tree mortality and crown plasticity led to long periods over which the canopy is interspersed with small gaps these gaps may close again which leads to the death of already established regeneration as a consequence the beech regeneration greatly differs in terms of age height and diameter and this result is congruent with the findings from central bohemian forests bílek et al 2014 and ukrainian beech forests hobi et al 2015a the model simulations produced a multi layered forest stand with several successional stages on a relatively small area of 0 5 ha similar findings were reported for actual old growth beech stands by hobi et al 2015a and commarmot et al 2005 we observed wide diameter height and age distributions on the stand level trees of the same age can significantly differ in their dimension the range of simulated tree ages in a forest canopy can extend over a period of 100 years these characteristics are also reported from the largest primeval beech forest in the carpathians hobi et al 2015a we observed that the average increase of the forest structure revealed by the applied indices decelerated towards the end of the simulation period of 1000 time steps this could be a sign that structural fluctuations reach an average state taking into account that the model simulations started with a homogeneous layer of tree saplings we could demonstrate that it needs several tree generations or approximately 700 time steps to reach a certain average state in the forest structure that is similar to the structural patterns reported from old growth beech forests this result might be important for conservation practices of beech forests 5 conclusions we conclude that the model is able to reproduce a wide range of structural patterns observed in old growth beech forest in europe this is possible by only focusing on the space occupation ability of beech fagus sylvatica l and modeling the light transmittance through the forest canopy crown plasticity plays an important role in the emergence of a small scale heterogeneity in unmanaged beech forests we could show that it needs several tree generations for the forest to reach a certain average state with structural characteristics of old growth forests the beep model simulates the space occupation of a particular tree in a certain direction which lacks a sufficient amount of empirical data from old growth forests to overcome these challenges spatial foliage distribution and subsequent light transmittance modeling beyer et al 2014 2015 2017 would be a promising

25303,old growth beech fagus sylvatica l forests in europe show a structural heterogeneity which distinguish from managed ones recent investigations revealed that facilitative belowground interactions might counteract aboveground competition for light however the exact interaction of these mechanisms is unclear we developed the beechplasticity beep model to investigate whether the mere focus on the aboveground competition for canopy space with subsequent modeling of the light transmittance through the forest canopy suffices to reproduce the observed structural attributes the beep model is individual based and explicitly describes the plasticity of tree crowns in a three dimensional space through a geometric approach this conceptual design allows tracing neighborhood effects to the forest stand level we ran 10 simulation experiments with 1000 time steps on a simulation area of 0 5öha we analyzed the emerging spatial point patterns gap dynamics as well as distributions of tree age tree height tree crown projection area and tree diameter by applying various indices that revealed the emergent horizontal and vertical forest structure we were able to show a strong mutual link between beech crown plasticity and forest heterogeneity the crown plasticity enabled the trees to close small gaps which resulted in a highly dynamic tree regeneration which in turn led to a small scale heterogeneous forest structure we found that over long periods crown centroids of canopy trees taller than 20öm were more regularly distributed than stem foot points absolute crown displacements were greater than reported from beech stands in north germany and the sudetes in the czech republic this indicates a need to restrain the model crown growth in order to recognize tree architecture and stability we could simulate an increasing forest structural heterogeneity starting with a structural homogeneous layer of tree saplings we showed that forest structures similar to those in unmanaged beech forests took several tree generations or approximately 700 time steps to emerge we recommend enhancing this model approach with spatial explicit modeling of the leaf area distribution which has already been done for single beech trees keywords old growth forests beech fagus sylvatica l crown plasticity 1 introduction today relicts of virgin beech forests fagus sylvatica l in europe are scattered and are mostly of small size leibundgut 1993 smejkal et al 1997 tabaku 2000 while extensive forests are exceptional tabaku 2000 hobi et al 2015a this situation is the result of a human induced reduction of beech forest once the most important forest community in central europe peterken 1996 consequently relict beech forests have been listed as a unesco world natural heritage vološčuk 2014 hobi et al 2015a found multi layered beech forests stands interrupted by mostly small canopy gaps and a high abundance of old large diameter trees in the ukrainian carpathians less than 2 of the gaps were greater than 200 m² hobi et al 2015b similar results have been reported from slovenian virgin beech forests zeibig et al 2005 beech trees are able to adapt their crown shape according to neighborhood crown pressure and available photosynthetic active radiation par petriţan et al 2009 this mechanism is known as crown plasticity release events in the forest canopy caused by the death of trees lead to an extension of tree crowns into canopy gaps muth and bazzaz 2001 fichtner et al 2013 if the gap is sufficiently small closure is reached after several years depending on the vitality of the trees that surround the gap edges canopy gaps remain if their size is beyond the average shoot growth potential of the canopy trees trees position their crowns away from neighborhood pressure and shading muth and bazzaz 2003 crown displacement can be described by the horizontal distance between the stem foot position and the center of gravity or centroid of the crown projection area schröter et al 2012 spatial statistics such as ripley s k function ripley 1977 or the clark evans index clark and evans 1954 have been successfully applied in revealing different spatial patterns of tree stem foot positions and their crown centroids leaving the latter more regularly distributed than stem foot positions schröter et al 2012 bulušek et al 2016 however only a few studies directly link the observed patterns to the underlying processes e g fichtner et al 2015 crown plasticity facilitates the expansion of the tree crown into canopy gaps and in turn enhances individual tree growth juchheim et al 2017 demonstrating the importance of plastic tree crowns as a driver of forest dynamics fichtner et al 2013 glatthorn et al 2017 this mechanism has already been studied for mixed species forests longuetaud et al 2013 jucker et al 2015 and for pinus sylvestris l forests uria diez and pommerening 2017 the interplay between canopy openings and crown plasticity alters the environmental conditions beneath the forest canopy and impacts the growth of understory trees however well studied are only the influences of gap size on the light regime and microclimatic conditions for beech forests ritter et al 2005 gálhidy et al 2006 bílek et al 2014 čater et al 2014 čater and kobler 2017 the analysis of belowground processes is still hard to handle and results from the few available studies are contradicting for example beech trees seem to compete size asymmetrically for belowground resources and this behavior is in contrast to many other species beyer et al 2013 facilitative effects have been also observed particularly between small and large diameter trees these effects for example are attributed to mycorrhizal networks beiler et al 2015 fichtner et al 2015 it seems to be established however that belowground processes can counteract the aboveground intraspecific competition in old growth beech forests fichtner et al 2015 which demonstrates the complementarity of both and the basis for the complexity of the net outcome of tree interactions in near natural beech forests facilitative effects have been observed between small and large diameter trees probably caused by mycorrhizal networks beiler et al 2015 fichtner et al 2015 these effects could even increase the resilience of forests against environmental changes which would be in agreement with the hypotheses that forests with a long ecological continuity are better adapted to global change than others von oheimb et al 2014 various case studies demonstrated the existence of beech microbial mutualism e g cesarz et al 2013 beech selectively allocates carbon to specific mycorrhizal species at the root tip level valtanen et al 2014 mycorrhizal species exert a functional feedback on their hosts in terms of nutrient uptake transfer and storage seven and polle 2014 klein et al 2016 revealed a significant carbon exchange in a temperate forest even between trees of different species however empirical studies have not been able to capture the importance of these belowground interactions for stand dynamics so far the question arises how above and belowground processes interact and if focusing on one mechanism alone namely the aboveground competition for light and crown space could explain the patterns and structures we observe in beech forests individual based models e g lin et al 2012 grueters et al 2014 provide an excellent basis to address such questions however the focus on the aboveground competition for light needs the explicit description of beech crown plasticity which has not been achieved yet the grid based model before can reproduce the mosaic pattern of developmental stages of old growth beech forests rademacher et al 2004 but does not include tree crown plasticity individual based forest models such as les include plastic tree crowns liénard and strigul 2016 but do not explicitly model beech forests beech crown dynamics were accurately modeled for single trees but not for complete stands nor from an individual based perspective beyer et al 2014 2015 2017 this led us to the development of the beechplasticity beep model which is able to simulate plastic tree crowns from an individual based perspective for whole forest stands the plasticity approach used in this model is geometric and was already applied for modelling crown plasticity of hevea brasiliensis willd vincent and harja 2008 we applied the model to the question if spatial point patterns crown displacements gap dynamics and subsequent alteration of the light transmittance through the forest canopy can be reproduced by only focusing on modeling the aboveground competition for crown space 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model the description of our individual based beep model grimm and railsback 2005 follows the odd protocol grimm et al 2010 2 1 1 purpose the beep model was developed for the description of old growth forests of european beech fagus sylvatica l the model explicitly considers tree crown plasticity as a response to available radiation and neighboring tree crowns the model is used to explore the mutual link between light competition crown shift random loss of crown parts tree growth and mortality particular emphasis is placed on the importance of crown plasticity for structural patterns such as the vertical heterogeneity in tree heights and horizontal distribution patterns of stem locations and crown centroids 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the beep model has only one entity namely individual beech trees they are described by a set of simple state variables characterizing the location for the tree and the dimension of the stem x y m m coordinates of the stem foot point dbh cm stem diameter at breast height h m tree height further state variables specify the crowns dimensions m height of the crown onset point the x y coordinates are equal to the stem foot point of the tree the crown onset point is the origin of the crown vectors shown in fig 1 x y z m m m coordinates of the points spanning the crown surface vectors connecting the onset point with the various points on the crown surface are referred to as crown vectors considering the photosynthetic active radiation par as environmental factor the pacl percentage of above canopy light received is the last state variable of the trees regulating their height growth one time step represents one year space is described in three dimensions the typical size of a simulated plot is 0 5 ha in order to keep the simulation time manageable but can be varied by the experimenter 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the model describes five processes namely regeneration radiation mortality as well as height and crown growth the flowchart in fig 2 shows the sequence of their execution regeneration assumes a masting rhythm of three time steps the new tree recruits are established in a minimum distance of 0 3 m of an established tree if the light availability described as pacl threshold is sufficient the process radiation describes the availability of photosynthetic active radiation par within the forest stand this occurs in two steps 1 the total par above the canopy is decomposed into direct and diffuse par and their spatial distributions are simulated over the upper hemisphere 2 the transmission of the direct and diffuse radiation through the canopy pacl is calculated as percentage of above canopy light according to the lambert beer bouguer s law with leaf area density as the driving variable the total par in step 1 is executed only once during the initialization of a simulation experiment the transmission in step 2 is calculated for each tree in each simulation step considering light competition by neighboring trees the process mortality refers to the death of a tree which occurs if its crown cannot be maintained this can occur either as a result of competition for crown space see section 2 1 9 or as a consequence of random losses of crown points due to tree senescence all trees are initialized with a certain threshold mortality index which informs about the tree height at which its senescence begins see section 2 1 5 this index is the relation of the current tree height to its maximum tree height as the tree reaches its individual threshold e g 95 of its maximum height a random number of its crown points is deleted this process is repeated the following time steps until the crown point number falls below a threshold see section 2 1 9 height and crown growth describes 1 the increase of the tree height as a function of tree age and pacl and 2 the extension of the crown surface by increasing the crown vectors see fig 1 the length of the crown vector extension depends on the realized height growth and the available space in the canopy defined by competing neighboring trees this can result in crown shape distortion stem diameter is derived from the crown projection area sections 2 1 7 2 1 10 provide detailed information about the implementation of the processes in the related submodels 2 1 4 design concepts basic principles height and crown growth base on the classical concept of optimal growth reduced by correction factors the attenuation of the photosynthetic active radiation par in the canopy is calculated according to bouguer s law using leaf area density as main factor emergence the size distributions of tree dimensions tree height and diameter at breast height as well as the spatial patterns of tree stem foot points and crown centroids emerge from the neighborhood interactions and the ecological processes described by the model adaptation trees adapt their crown to the neighborhood constellation due to this plasticity they optimize their use of the available canopy space objectives not relevant learning not relevant prediction not relevant sensing trees sense neighboring crowns for this all crown points of a focal tree check for crown points of neighbors in a vision cone the vision cone is a cone with an opening angle of 60 and a height of 10 m set with its tip upon a crown point see fig 3 for further details interaction trees interact a indirectly via the reduction of the available light beneath their canopy light competition and b directly by hindering the growth of crown vectors of neighbor trees space competition stochasticity the stem foot positions of the tree x and y coordinates and individual tree variables determine the height and crown vector growth in particular three parameters defining the maximum size of the trees namely maximum height maxh maximum pace of height increment maxhp and maximum stem diameter in breast height potd are random the mortality index that determines tree senescence is random as well collectives not relevant observation stem foot position crown centroid diameter at breast height tree height and crown projection area are registered for all trees of the forest stand at each time step we reduced edge effects by truncating a boundary of 10 m from the edges and excluded the simulated individuals from analysis 2 1 5 initialization at the start of the simulation a number of 3000 small tree saplings are randomly distributed over the simulated area of 0 5 ha we initiate the simulation with tree saplings to create a more realistic forest canopy development although beginning with mature trees is possible as well we had to reduce the initial sapling number and the simulation area due to simulation speed limits the x and y coordinates of the stem foot point are drawn from a uniform distribution these values fix the simulation area so that new tree recruits see section 2 1 7 cannot establish outside this area the initial values of the state variables and model parameters are assigned to the trees see table 1 for details a tree sapling is characterized by a height of 0 05 m a diameter of breast height of 0 cm and an initial crown radius of 0 05 m at the beginning every tree is characterized by a pacl value of 1 and a mortality index ranging between 0 8 and 0 98 see details in section 2 1 9 we assume a maximum dbh of 150 cm given by the parameter maxd which we derived from inventory data dolnik et al 2008 we parameterized the crown diameter and height growth relationship with inventory data from the municipal forest of lübeck schattiner zuschlag which has not been managed for more than 100 years dolnik et al 2008 table 1 provides an overview on the model parameters as tree growth is described phenomenologically the maximum tree height maxh and the maximum pace of height increment maxhp are randomly chosen and are not part of a detailed process based submodel we draw values for these parameters from a normal distribution see table 1 to create initial differences in height and crown growth 2 1 6 input data the distribution of diffuse and direct radiation at the position of the town lübeck n 53 52 1738 e 10 41 2547 north germany is calculated in advance and loaded in the initialization process details of the calculation are given in brunner 1998 and in section 2 1 8 2 1 7 regeneration trees become adult with an age of 60 years gruber 2003 we assume a synchronous masting rhythm of 3 time steps for all adult beech canopy trees taller than 20 m gruber 2003 in a masting year every mature canopy tree produces five saplings we restrict the sapling number to reduce the computational effort the saplings are distributed in a ballistic way 1 a dispersal angle is randomly chosen between 0 and 360 2 a dispersal distance is chosen from a poisson distribution using the average crown radius λ of the parent tree as expected value tree positions with a sapling parent tree distance smaller than 0 3 m or pacl below 3 are deleted if the pacl at any particular location is greater than 3 a new tree is initialized according to section 2 1 5 but with its tree position already calculated 2 1 8 radiation the growth of the trees depends on the received percentage of above canopy light pacl the model calculates light interception and transfer through the forest stand with the ray tracing algorithm according to brunner 1998 in this approach photosynthetic active radiation par attenuation in the modeled canopy is calculated according to bouguer s law with leaf area density as the driving variable by tracing sample rays distributed over a hemisphere the model calculates the spatial distribution of direct and diffuse par in the forest stand resulting in the pacl of a particular tree to apply this the model initializes the exact position of 8192 sample rays over a hemisphere and calculates the direct and diffuse radiation for every ray above the canopy the ray number was chosen according to the results of the sensitivity analysis by brunner 1998 the ray distribution is almost even while the average angular resolution is 0 01 in the altitude direction and 0 04 in the azimuthal direction this setting does not change during the simulation the sum of diffuse and direct radiation for every ray is specified as the above canopy light acl this acl is calculated from the exact sun positions during the period from march to october for the town lübeck in north germany this distribution of total par is provided as a file and loaded into the model before initialization as this radiation model was developed for rotation symmetric crown shapes brunner 1998 we adapted the model to asymmetric crown shapes we do not consider stems and branches as obstructions to irradiance and we further assume leaf area density to be constant within the individual tree crown we estimate the leaf area density lad for every tree according to the results of beyer et al 2017 depending on tree height h with 1 lad a h² b h c firstly the model identifies all trees taller than the focal tree and then calculates which rays from the given distribution are obstructed by a tree crown the obstructed ray passes through the crown of a neighbor tree while its path length m path through the crown is estimated as 2 path cl cos φ where cl is the crown length m being the difference between the tree height h and the height of the crown onset point o and φ is the zenith angle of the particular ray the resulting percentage of above canopy light for the particular ray paclray is calculated as 3 paclray exp 0 5 lad path the sum of all paclray values of all obstructed rays and the acl values of all unobstructed rays gives the pacl of the focal tree we assume the simulated plot to be embedded in a closed forest which does not allow rays to pass through the forest canopy beyond the borders of the simulated plot this affects the pacl calculation of edge trees which are excluded from further analysis 2 1 9 mortality individual trees die if they cannot maintain a minimum number of 10 crown points the minimum number of 10 equals the number of crown points that can be gained at every time step see section 2 1 10 below any tree with a point number less than 10 is automatically deleted we chose this deterministic approach to establish a proxy for a minimum growth that the tree must be able to maintain the exact number of 10 points is further considered a result of the regular crown point arrangement see fig 1 the number of crown points can fall below this threshold due to neighbor crown competition every crown point of a particular tree detects neighbor crown points in an upright vision cone with an opening angle of 60 and a height of 10 m these crown points of a particular tree are deleted if they detect more than two neighbor crown points if the crown point number of the tree falls below 10 as a result of this competition for crown space the individual tree is deleted details in section 2 1 10 furthermore trees cannot only die from competition for canopy space but also through a decline in their vitality we included this decline with a mortality index that signals at which point of the tree development tree senescence begins which means a loss of crown points this mortality index is assigned at the beginning 4 m h maxh we chose to base this index on the tree height in order to avoid a maximum tree age in contrast we assume that the trees begin to decline when they reach a height between 80 and 98 of their maximum height maxh while the mortality index itself is drawn from a normal distribution the link between tree mortality and the maximum tree dimension is deterministic when a tree reaches its mortality index m a random number of its crown points are deleted in the following time steps these crown points can have any location in the individual tree crown this procedure continues until the threshold of 10 crown points see above cannot be maintained and the individual tree is deleted thus the decline of the tree spreads over several time steps and its crown gradually shrinks which allows a gradual canopy opening and increase of pacl values in the forest understory however large scale forest disturbance is not recognized through this approach 2 1 10 height and crown growth a tree grows by extending its crown surface relative to its vertical stem axis this is described in two steps 1 the calculation of the potential height growth based on the theoretical age of the tree pretzsch 2001 which will be 2 modified to the realized height growth by light competition the theoretical age of the tree ta depends on the current tree height h 5 ta ln 1 h maxh 0 5 maxhp where maxh gives the maximum height a tree can reach and maxhp modifies the pace of height increment the theoretical age defines that particular age the tree should have under optimum growing conditions the potential height growth pi is then derived from the theoretical age ta and the current tree height h pretzsch 2001 by 6 pi maxh 1 exp maxhp ta 1 2 h based on this information the extension of all crown vectors can be calculated as described in the following the potential height increment pi equals the maximum possible extension of all crown vectors in a next step the potential growth pi is modified by the relative growth response rg to the available pacl burschel and schmaltz 1965a b gemmel et al 1996 ammer 2000 kunstler et al 2005 and a shoot reduction factor sr the rg is calculated as 7 rg d 1 exp e pacl f where d e and f are coefficients considering the shade tolerance of beech saplings we assume that growth is possible if pacl is equal or greater than 3 emborg 1998 modry et al 2004 and adjusted the parameter values table 1 accordingly the rg ranges between 0 and 1 the relative growth response is calculated on the tree level in the following the growth of the crown vectors is calculated we assume beech trees reduce the growth of crown vectors according to the position of the crown vectors to the individual stem axis if the available pacl is less than 100 this leads to slender crown shapes of trees in the understory the reduction is achieved by the shoot reduction factor sr ranging from 0 1 to 1 the minimum value of 0 1 secures that a crown vector cannot shrink the growth is linearly reduced according to the angle between the crown vector and the stem axis following the equation 8 sr g pacl h α 1 where α is the angle between the stem axis and the particular crown vector g and h are parameters specified in table 1 the lower the available pacl the more slender the tree crown becomes on the contrary if the pacl is 100 no reduction is imposed the tree crown then develops to a hemispherical shape the realized increment i of the particular crown vector is then 9 i pi rg sr all crown vectors are extended at once according to their crown vector increment this leads to a crown surface expansion and an increase in tree height the new tree height h is the maximum z coordinate of all crown points which have been relocated by the crown vector growth neighbor crowns hinder the crown vector growth thus before extending a crown vector the particular crown point senses neighbor crown points in an upright vision cone with a height of 10 m and an opening angle of 60 see fig 3 crown points of the focal tree crown are excluded from detection the particular crown point is deleted if more than two points are detected point number set by calibration which enables the contact between neighboring tree crowns but prevents further crown intersection the crown onset point with height o moves to the next minimum height of the crown points if a complete lower crown part is deleted see fig 3a the maximum upward movement depends on the vertical distance between crown points the crown points itself remain unaltered but the crown vector orientation changes so that new vectors can be created at the crown top if the angle α is greater than 5 see fig 3c this mechanism provides an optimum of crown space occupation we assume only 10 new points are created at every time step by calibration the interplay between crown point loss due to competition or senescence and crown vector growth changes the trees crown space occupation the horizontal projection of the crown points forms a polygon of n crown points this crown projection area cpa can increase or decrease as a result of the interaction described above tree diameter dbh is derived from the crown projection area cpa and calculated by 10 dbh maxd 1 exp i cpa potd where i maxd and potd are parameters the parameter potd alters the crown efficiency which is the basal area increment per crown surface area increment fichtner et al 2013 while the crown projection area can decrease the diameter cannot the diameter at breast height increases if the crown projection area grows 2 2 sensitivity and robustness analysis we explored the influence of various sets of input parameters on model output with a sensitivity analysis ginot et al 2006 in particular we performed classical local sensitivity analysis altering one parameter at a time bar massada and carmel 2008 as well as global sensitivity analysis where we varied several input parameters over broad parameter ranges the results for a global sensitivity analysis are presented in the appendix a in supplementary data of special importance was the parameter fitting of the standard deviations used for initializing the maxh and maxhp parameters that determine the tree height and crown growth changes in these standard deviations caused the self thinning trajectory of a homogeneous simulated stand to change which was not revealed by global but through local sensitivity analysis increasing the initial standard deviation of these parameters causes the tree competition for canopy space to increase which in turn steepens the self thinning trajectory as this trajectory is of vital importance for forest model development we fitted the parameter standard deviations for maxh and maxhp according to empirical results from unmanaged beech forests pretzsch and mette 2008 condés et al 2017 we performed robustness analysis grimm and berger 2016 to test model behavior under extreme parameter values and to test the accuracy of different submodels described in section 2 1 we provide details in appendix b in supplementary data 2 3 data analysis we implemented 10 simulation runs to account for model sensitivity the initial conditions for every simulation were held constant each simulation was run for 1000 time steps on an area of 0 5 ha we set the simulation time to 1000 time steps to allow several tree generations to develop and the forest structure to emerge we stopped the simulation after 1000 time steps because of the structural development of the forest presented below the simulation area is restricted to 0 5 ha due to simulation speed limits we reduced edge effects by truncating a boundary of 10 m from the edges and excluded the simulated individuals from analysis as we assume the simulated plot to be embedded in a closed forest edge trees experience the greatest competition in terms of pacl we calculated three indices to describe the forest structural development over the simulation period all indices are described in the following we compared the simulated indices to those calculated from empirical forest stands from unmanaged beech forests this comparison aims not at reproducing the exact forest stands in terms of age and size distributions but rather attempts to reveal whether the simulation model is able to reach the levels of empirical indices we analyzed the horizontal forest structure with the clark evans aggregations index r and the crown shift index csi see below which is based on besag s transformation of ripley s k l r we analyzed the spatial point patterns of stem foot points and crown centroids with besag s transformation of ripley s k function besag 1977 the crown centroid is the center of gravity of the horizontal crown projection that forms a polygon of n crown points see section 2 1 10 the center of gravity of this polygon is calculated as the mean of the gravity centers of the triangles in which the polygon can be split weighted by the respective triangle area crown centroid calculation was performed with the r packages rgeos bivand and rundel 2017 and sp pebesma and bivand 2005 besag s transformation of ripley s k function was calculated with the r package ads pelissier and goreaud 2015 and is defined as 11 l r k r π 0 5 where k r is ripley s k function and l r is besag s transformation l r is calculated for a set of sample radii from 0 m to 10 m in 0 1 m intervals we used l r values for comparison with empirical data and for the calculation of the csi index we calculated the clark evans aggregation index r clark and evans 1954 for stem foot points and crown centroids with the package spatstat baddeley et al 2015 to describe the horizontal forest structure we used the edge correction according to donnelly 1978 for the calculation of the theoretically expected value for the mean nearest neighbor distance under a poisson process we compared clark evans indices to empirical calculations from virgin beech forests clark evans r is defined as the ratio between the distance of a point to its nearest neighbor ra and the mean expected value of a randomly distributed population re 12 r ra re0 r 2 15 clark evans indices greater than 1 indicate a regular point distribution values below 1 indicate point aggregation we compared the simulated clark evans indices with observed indices from unmanaged beech forests in the sudetes of the czech republic bulušek et al 2016 which are characterized by a large range of growing conditions and successional stages the csi index is a measure of the enhanced regularity of the crown centroids compared to the stem foot positions which is a result of the horizontal crown displacement at first we subtracted all radii r from the l r values which yielded negative l r r values we calculated the csi as the difference between the centroid and stem area under the curve auc which was calculated from the negative l r r values for sample radii from 0 m to 10 m in 0 1 m intervals the auc is the area under the curve for all l r r values under zero fig 4 if the centroid s auc is greater than the auc of the stem foot points the csi is positive and the centroids are more regularly distributed we analyzed the vertical forest structural diversity with the shannon index e g mcarthur and macarthur 1961 which is calculated over a set of 11 height classes h ranging from 0 m to 55 m each of which is characterized by a height of 5 m 13 s i i 1 h p i l n p i pi describes the relative abundance of a particular height class i which is the number of trees in a particular height class i divided by the total number of trees the greater the si values the greater is the vertical structure of the forest to describe horizontal and vertical forest structure in one measure we calculated the structural complexity index sci zenner and hibbs 2000 firstly we triangulated a x y spatial point data set of stem foot points with the r package deldir turner 2001 which gave a network of non overlapping triangles secondly we assigned every vertex a z coordinate given by the particular tree height this second step yielded a three dimensional surface of triangles covering the forest heterogeneity both in the horizontal and in the vertical direction thirdly we gained the sci by dividing the sum of all surface triangle areas through the sum of the projected triangle areas the sci value is thus a measure of forest rugosity the greater the sci values the greater is the forest structure described by the index we compared the simulated csi si and sci values with the observed indices calculated for an unmanaged beech forest stand in north east germany schröter et al 2012 which is characterized by a late terminal and senescence successional state all model simulation and analysis was carried out with r 3 4 0 r development core team 2017 using further the latest versions of the packages geometry habel et al 2015 plyr wickham 2011 and mgcv wood 2006 and rgl adler and murdoch 2017 we provide the source code of the model simulation as a separate file in the appendix 3 results the development of the csi values reveals distinct periods in which crown centroids of canopy trees show an enhanced regularity indicated by positive csi values compared to stem foot points fig 5 these periods are initiated by the death of canopy trees the length of the periods appears to extend while the forest structure becomes increasingly dispersed with small gaps after approximately 700 simulated time steps the former remarkable fluctuation observable in forest stand values ceases and is replaced by an average state of variables csi values are positive over the majority of simulation steps the average crown shift values absolute displacement for canopy trees taller than 20 m range between 0 and 5 m empirical values from unmanaged beech forests are 1 95 m schröter et al 2012 and 1 5 m bulušek et al 2016 respectively the increasing forest heterogeneity is revealed by increasing sci values see fig 6 the csi follows the sci and si after a certain time lag which indicates the reaction of tree crowns csi to sudden canopy openings and subsequent increase of forest heterogeneity sci and si in their neighborhood sci si and csi correspond with each other which shows the strong mutual link between tree mortality and crown plasticity altering the forest structure initial si fluctuations show artifacts caused by early mortality in the developing forest both sci and si values show that structural heterogeneity increases over the simulation period however the increase decelerates towards the end of the simulation period of 1000 time steps red dashed lines in fig 6 show that indices calculated for a beech forest stand in north east germany lie within the range of simulated values while the extent of forest heterogeneity of the empirical forest stand appears not to have reached its maximum because the structural complexity index sci is relatively low compared to simulated indices the comparison of clark evans indices to empirical observations from protected areas in the sudetes of the czech republic bulušek et al 2016 in fig 7 shows that crown centroids are more regularly distributed relative to stem foot positions but simulated indices bold lines cannot fully cover the whole range of empirical values the simulation model appears not to reach the level of regularity of the crown centroids observed in beech forests in the sudetes 4 discussion this study presents the first individual based beech forest model which describes the dynamic tree crown adaption to an asymmetric competition environment by means of simulation experiments we were able to show that the mere focus on aboveground competition for light suffices to generate the structures and patterns observed in old growth forests tree height and crown growth is mechanistic and not based on a process based hydraulic or photosynthetic submodel in contrast to many other forest models e g pretzsch et al 2002 the diameter at breast height dbh is not a driving variable but results from the occupied crown space of beech trees this mechanism allows individual trees to change their allometry in terms of a height diameter relationship we showed a strong mutual link between beech crown plasticity and emergent vertical and horizontal forest structure the structural complexity index sci for a beech stand in north germany schröter et al 2012 was relatively low compared to our simulation results which may be a result of the absence of measured tree regeneration with a diameter at breast height below 7 cm in the study of schröter et al 2012 the values for the average crown displacement for large canopy trees 20 m outreach the values reported from schröter et al 2012 and bulušek et al 2016 respectively this indicates that the crown growth in the beep model has to be more restrained for instance to ensure architectural stability of the whole tree which is not yet recognized we showed that crown centroids are more regularly distributed than stem foot positions over long periods of the simulation runs and that the extent of regularity is within the range of empirical findings although the maximum values for clark evans indices bulušek et al 2016 could not be matched the enhanced regularity is a result of the local neighborhood adaption of canopy trees to gaps and is the reason for the stand productivity even in late successional stages in which leaf area losses from sudden deaths of individual trees can be rapidly compensated glatthorn et al 2017 the beech crown plasticity increases canopy space filling and stand productivity juchheim et al 2017 the interplay of tree mortality and crown plasticity led to long periods over which the canopy is interspersed with small gaps these gaps may close again which leads to the death of already established regeneration as a consequence the beech regeneration greatly differs in terms of age height and diameter and this result is congruent with the findings from central bohemian forests bílek et al 2014 and ukrainian beech forests hobi et al 2015a the model simulations produced a multi layered forest stand with several successional stages on a relatively small area of 0 5 ha similar findings were reported for actual old growth beech stands by hobi et al 2015a and commarmot et al 2005 we observed wide diameter height and age distributions on the stand level trees of the same age can significantly differ in their dimension the range of simulated tree ages in a forest canopy can extend over a period of 100 years these characteristics are also reported from the largest primeval beech forest in the carpathians hobi et al 2015a we observed that the average increase of the forest structure revealed by the applied indices decelerated towards the end of the simulation period of 1000 time steps this could be a sign that structural fluctuations reach an average state taking into account that the model simulations started with a homogeneous layer of tree saplings we could demonstrate that it needs several tree generations or approximately 700 time steps to reach a certain average state in the forest structure that is similar to the structural patterns reported from old growth beech forests this result might be important for conservation practices of beech forests 5 conclusions we conclude that the model is able to reproduce a wide range of structural patterns observed in old growth beech forest in europe this is possible by only focusing on the space occupation ability of beech fagus sylvatica l and modeling the light transmittance through the forest canopy crown plasticity plays an important role in the emergence of a small scale heterogeneity in unmanaged beech forests we could show that it needs several tree generations for the forest to reach a certain average state with structural characteristics of old growth forests the beep model simulates the space occupation of a particular tree in a certain direction which lacks a sufficient amount of empirical data from old growth forests to overcome these challenges spatial foliage distribution and subsequent light transmittance modeling beyer et al 2014 2015 2017 would be a promising step but needs to be installed on an individual based fundament further the model needs to be evaluated with multitemporal crown data from unmanaged beech forest acknowledgements we thank goddert von

25304,masting is the highly variable and synchronous production of seeds by plants masting can have cascading effects on plant population dynamics and forest properties such as tree growth carbon stocks regeneration nutrient cycling or future species composition however masting has often been missing from forest models those few that simulate masting have done so using relatively simple empirical rules and lack an implementation of process based mechanisms that control such events here we review more than 200 published papers on mechanistic formulations of masting and summarize how the main processes involved in masting and their related patterns can be incorporated in forest models at different degrees of complexity our review showed that of all proximate causes of masting resource acquisition storage and allocation were the processes studied most often hormonal and genetic regulation of bud formation floral induction and anthesis were less frequently addressed we outline the building blocks of a general process based model of masting that can be used to improve the oversimplified functions in different types of forest models and to implement them where missing a complete implementation of masting in forest models should include functions for resource allocation and depletion and for pollination as regulated by both forest structure and weather in the years prior to seed production when models operate at spatio temporal scales mismatched with the main masting processes or if calibration data are not available simulation can be based on parameterizing masting patterns variability synchrony or frequency also observed masting patterns have the potential to be used as reality checks for more process based forest models wishing to accurately reproduce masting as an emergent phenomenon keywords masting seed production process based models resource budget model resource allocation tree reproduction 1 introduction understanding forest ecosystems and predicting their dynamics through models remains an abiding concern of forest researchers modeling forest dynamics using only a limited set of fundamental variables represents a challenging task considering the myriad of components mechanisms and the degree of complexity involved models however provide invaluable information to plan sustainable forest management monserud 2003 taylor et al 2009 in order to improve the accuracy of forest models operating under changing environmental conditions ecological processes which have big effects on forest dynamics must be accounted for a prominent but overlooked example of such processes is mast seeding or masting i e the highly variable and synchronous production of seeds by a population of plants masting occurs among grass shrub and tree species in many different biomes e g schauber et al 2002 abrahamson and layne 2003 poncet et al 2009 drobyshev et al 2010 the synchronized annual variability displayed by masting has been explained by several hypotheses sork 1993 kelly 1994 herrera et al 1998 kelly and sork 2002 masting events are thought to be cued by particular climatic conditions synchronized over large areas i e moran effect in the years that precede flowering schauber et al 2002 piovesan and adams 2001 2005 kelly et al 2013 however no general consensus has been reached yet on the complete set of processes and mechanisms causing masting pearse et al 2016 masting is intimately related to other processes of forest dynamics fig 1 such as tree growth thomas 2011 muller haubold et al 2013 hacket pain et al 2017 seed dispersal and regeneration vander wall 2001 ascoli et al 2015 the relative contribution of seed production to annual net primary productivity npp in masting species has been estimated for some species at between 20 and 57 mund et al 2010 muller haubold et al 2013 and about 15 of stem biomass growth mencuccini et al 1995 the fact that tree growth is reduced in years of heavy seed production piovesan and schirone 2000 may help to explain the failure of most process based forest models to reproduce observed inter annual variability in carbon fluxes or observed biomass growth drobyshev et al 2010 collalti et al 2016 as well as the disagreement between modeled growth climate relationships and observed tree rings babst et al 2013 additionally masting has far reaching effects on ecosystem functions and services such as carbon sequestration miyazaki 2013 and on community trophic cascades including birds and mammals ostfeld et al 1996 mcshea 2000 clotfelter et al 2007 jensen et al 2012 zwolak et al 2016 selås 2017 and vectors of human diseases ostfeld 1997 tersago et al 2009 in forestry research forest models are sets of equations that integrate several mechanisms describing and predicting important forest processes such as growth mortality and regeneration e g monserud 2003 vacchiano et al 2012 since masting has such widespread influences on forest ecosystem dynamics implementing it into predictive forest models may contribute to improve their accuracy not only in terms of modeling seed production but also extending to growth trade offs pollen and seed dispersal establishment success species migration cascading trophic interactions effects of silvicultural treatments and ecosystem resilience to natural disturbances or climate change in some of these forest models seed production has been implemented either as a constant or limitless process not integrated into allocation price et al 2001 or more realistically as a function of npp or leaf mass e g bossel 1996 however this is unlikely to fully reproduce the characteristics of masting those that did attempt to model masting explicitly used a simplistic implementation e g a regular frequency of years with high seed output rammig et al 2007 neglecting the relationship between masting processes and environmental conditions overall masting has been included in forest models in very few cases table 1 be it to look specifically at masting effects or within large scale forest ecosystem models in which patterns of seed production have not been specifically developed to incorporate mast seeding inconsistent study design omitted reporting of effect sizes and lack of validation of model prediction against observed data mean that no conclusive evidence exists on whether an explicit inclusion of masting in forest models is relevant to accurately predict ecosystem and ecological dynamics the effect size of including not including masting in models could possibly vary depending on the desired output variable and on the spatial and temporal span being modeled e g an individual stand vs a regional forest landscape rigorously validated analyses of the accuracy of forest model prediction with and without masting are greatly needed however the inclusion of masting in forest models can be crucial on one side for greater realism and on the other to equip models with a process based understanding that would enable to produce projections out of the range of their calibration domain e g under climate change in the following paragraphs we first provide a concise overview of the most important patterns and processes related to masting then we propose ways to implement them in forest models across different spatial temporal and ecological scales to do so we carried out a review of formulations used in the scientific literature to model masting patterns and processes finally we bring this evidence together in a broader discussion on what to consider when implementing masting in forest models 2 masting patterns and underlying processes masting can be modelled using two main approaches a reproducing demographic and ecological patterns produced by masting both spatially and temporally or b understanding and reproducing mechanistic processes or proximate causes sensu kelly 1994 which is usually a more complex task and not necessarily leading to less uncertainty than the former 2 1 patterns patterns of masting have been characterized in different ways in the literature e g kelly and sork 2002 koenig et al 2003 pearse et al 2016 here we refer to variability synchrony and frequency as key elements to describe masting patterns fig 2 although other elements have been proposed such as temporal autocorrelation e g koenig et al 2003 crone et al 2011 variability defined as the absolute or relative difference in the number or mass of seeds produced by one unit typically a tree or stand across time e g herrera et al 1998 greene and johnson 2004 richardson et al 2005 crone et al 2011 seed production that is either large or zero produces a bimodal frequency distribution of seed crop size but see allen et al 2012 for more continuous distributions variability can be quantified either by the coefficient of variation cv of the number of seeds produced across time or by the recently proposed disparity index fernández martínez et al 2017a the latter is a modification of cv that does not depend on the mean and takes into account actual year to year variation in a temporally explicit way a particular type of variability often found in masting species is a negative autocorrelation the current seed crop can be often explained to a high degree by a negative correlation with the previous year s crop e g in alternate bearing species or as a consequence of resource depletion synchrony defined as the degree of similarity between the number or mass of seeds produced by a population of trees or stands at the same time for one or multiple species e g lamontagne and boutin 2007 fearer et al 2008 allen et al 2012 the spatial extent of synchrony may range from stand to region or even sub continent koenig and knops 2000 a marked distance decay in synchrony was reported at continental vacchiano et al 2017 regional e g fearer et al 2008 and local e g allen and platt 1990 scales synchrony can be measured at the individual level correlation between individual and population seed production or at the population level correlation among trees or stands or percentage of trees or stands showing a similar seed output frequency defined as the number of high seed production years during a time period e g sork et al 1993 greene and johnson 2004 allen et al 2012 when the causes for synchrony and variability are explicitly modeled frequency is an emergent behavior and regular cycles in fruiting need not to be mechanistically explained however they can and should be linked to the temporal patterns of the underlying drivers e g solar activity or climate oscillations ascoli et al 2017b in this review we consider frequency as a stand alone pattern because the question of interest usually is when will the next massive fruiting occur furthermore masting frequency is typically the only parameter that has been implemented in forest models thus far e g rammig et al 2007 2 2 processes the causes driving variability and synchrony in seed production have been categorized as ultimate and proximate pearse et al 2016 ultimate causes include processes associated with evolutionary timescales such selective pressure they are excluded from the present review because they would be incompatible with the time span covered by most forest models used for ecological or forest management prediction proximate causes on the other hand operate between a decade and a few days before seed production they include dynamics of resource accumulation and depletion weather events favorable to phenological phases involved in flowering and fruiting and all cellular and genetic processes involved in their occurrence crone and rapp 2014 pearse et al 2016 masting patterns emerge when several proximate causes interact across space and time affecting all processes that lead to seed production resource acquisition bud initiation anthesis pollination and fertilization flower abortion and seed maturation allen et al 2017 fig 3 2 2 1 resource acquisition storage and allocation trees allocate resources to growth survival and reproduction cf fridley 2017 for a review it is well established that there is an internal cycling of resources see millard and grelet 2010 for a review on carbohydrates and nitrogen n and proe and millard 1995 for phosphorus p and that macronutrients influence fecundity and seed production reekie and bazzaz 1987 ichie and nakagawa 2013 miyazaki 2013 han et al 2014 yet it is still unclear which of the nutrients non structural carbohydrates nsc n or p and interactions among nutrients compensation effects are most limiting for reproduction körner 2003 han et al 2008 sala et al 2012 whether nutrients used for reproduction come from recently acquired or accumulated resources koenig and knops 2000 kelly and sork 2002 sala et al 2012 and in the last case what is the accumulation period ichie et al 2018 until today four non mutually exclusive mechanisms have been proposed to explain how resource supply and uptake are involved in seed production resource matching in which a fixed fraction of resources is allocated each year to reproduction koenig and knops 2000 storage in which trees accumulate resources over several years in order to eventually allocate them to high seed production leading to negative temporal autocorrelation in seed production series sork 1993 koenig et al 1994 switching in which a variable fraction of resources is allocated each year to reproduction leading to negative correlations between reproduction and growth yasumura et al 2006 monks and kelly 2006 sala et al 2012 veto in which some external agent e g late frost may limit the investment in fruiting preventing resources to be allocated to reproduction koenig et al 2015 pesendorfer et al 2016 bogdziewicz et al 2017b 2 2 2 hormonal and genetic regulation of bud formation floral induction and anthesis floral induction is driven by hormonal induction which incorporates the influence of numerous external and internal cues bernier and périlleux 2005 turnbull 2011 bluemel et al 2015 large seed quantities are directly correlated to gibberellin contents böhlenius et al 2006 turnbull 2011 whereas fruit abortion is driven by ethylene bleecker and kende 2000 the biosynthesis of growth hormones wahl et al 2013 and the expression of flowering genes miyazaki et al 2014 are stimulated under higher resource supply especially n sedgley and griffin 1989 2 2 3 pollination a tree can produce a large quantity of seeds when three conditions are met i the tree produces a high initial flower crop ii pollination success is high and iii a high proportion of fertilized flowers mature into fruits most masting species are outcrossers pearse et al 2016 therefore masting is restricted by pollen production by other plants in the population smith et al 1990 plants with many pollen producing neighbors produce larger seed crops than more isolated ones knapp et al 2001 theoretical models showed that such density dependent pollen limitation pollen coupling can also induce synchrony in seed production isagi et al 1997 lyles et al 2015 venner et al 2016 however empirical support of the role of pollen limitation on masting remains scarce and the importance of pollen limitation as a trigger of seed production is still widely debated koenig and ashley 2003 koenig et al 2012 rapp et al 2013 pearse et al 2015 see also pearse et al 2016 for a review 2 2 4 seed maturation fertilization and flower abortion in perennial plants fertilized flowers are often aborted stephenson 1981 sork and bramble 1993 holland et al 2004 from an evolutionary point of view flower abortion is an inexpensive strategy to either maximize the long term quality of the remaining fertilized flowers becerra and lloyd 1992 or re allocate resources to other non reproductive processes in response to unpredicted disturbances goubitz et al 2002 montesinos et al 2012 especially when resources are depleted during fruit maturation tsuruta et al 2011 2 2 5 weather cues and vetoes many of the processes above are influenced linearly or not fernández martínez et al 2017b by weather as confirmed by the large number of studies reporting on correlations between weather and seed production in masting species allen et al 2014 canham et al 2014 moreira et al 2015 pérezramos et al 2015 caignard et al 2017 vacchiano et al 2017 acquisition and storage of resources depend on photosynthesis and on the amount of solar radiation but are also constrained by water limitation and drought stress which were shown to affect seed crops with a lag of two or three years newbery et al 2006 smaill et al 2011 barringer et al 2013 muller haubold et al 2013 bachofen et al 2017 other studies highlighted a correlation between large seed crops and higher than average summer temperatures during both floral initiation and fruit maturation piovesan and adams 2001 richardson et al 2005 fearer et al 2008 buechling et al 2016 which can also be attributed to resource mediated mechanisms meteorological conditions solar radiation and temperature can also affect flowering inducing hormones such as gibberellins and phytocromes reviewed by ruan et al 2012 and have a crucial impact on pollination in particular pollen concentrations are negatively correlated to rainfall and humidity but positively correlated to temperature during the pollen season cecich and sullivan 1999 sabit et al 2016 bogdziewicz et al 2017a the pollen season itself is longer under drier and warmer weather fuhrmann et al 2016 also spring microclimatic conditions affect the local budburst synchrony that is a proxy for flowering synchrony and pollen availability and consequently the pollination efficiency koenig et al 2015 finally extreme weather events can damage reproductive structures by e g late frost during flowering augspurger 2009 changyang et al 2016 or intense summer rainfall during fruit maturation abrahamson and layne 2003 however the variability of weather has been shown to be often smaller than the variability in masting indicating that climate alone cannot explain all variability in masting koenig and knops 2005 3 literature review the scope of this review is to summarize how masting patterns and processes have been described in the scientific literature this includes quantitative analyses of masting variability synchrony and frequency as well as empirical or process based models of processes leading to masting at all ecological levels and geographic scales to do so we searched the scopus database for titles and abstracts containing the following search string masting or mast seeding or mast fruiting or mast flowering and variability or pattern or synchrony or periodicity or model and forest or tree we complemented the search results by a targeted search based on references from a recent and comprehensive review on masting processes pearse et al 2016 the geographic scope of our search was global we excluded from the analysis papers that only reported masting observations without quantitatively describing a pattern or modeling a process out of a total of 360 papers found for the period 1957 2016 we selected 206 for further analysis containing a total of 323 individual model formulations for a pattern a process or both i e several papers contained more than one pattern and or process for each individual model formulation we collected information regarding the modeled species the pattern and process being modeled and the modelling methods table 2 the largest share of studies was carried out in temperate ecosystems n 105 51 followed by studies from mediterranean 17 tropical 13 and boreal biomes 5 only 11 papers referred to multiple biomes reflecting the overall scarcity of generalized approaches on masting fig 4 a most studies involved broadleaves n 140 and more in general wind pollinated species n 130 with exclusive anemophilous pollination a strategy that is disproportionately common among masting species herrera et al 1998 especially for cross pollinating ones satake and iwasa 2000 2002a b the dominant geographical focus was the stand 47 of all papers followed by region 31 at the two ends of the spectrum both individual tree and continental global algorithms were varey rare 4 and 2 respectively the temporal unit was almost always the year 90 with only 16 studies having a monthly time resolution or finer most analyses were conducted at tree 51 of all papers stand 26 or population level 20 as spatial units the predominant level of ecological and data complexity at which masting was described or modelled was demographics 52 i e the numerical oscillations of reproductive organs flowers pollen fruits seeds and their environmental drivers one in five studies 22 had a merely descriptive character i e no causal or correlative analyses were carried out for the masting patterns reported studies explicitly looking into resource dynamics or finer scale processes were 20 of the total of all 323 masting formulations covered in our review most 77 described variables related to seeds or fruits which are usually easier to measure and more directly related to masting than e g pollen or flowers fig 4b a small group of resource based formulations instead modeled the nutrient content of tree organs including reproductive ones following masting response variables were more often described by univariate 41 or multivariate 31 algorithms the complete review table and metadata is reported as supplementary material s1 3 1 patterns variability was the most frequently analyzed pattern 60 194 of 323 formulations vastly exceeding synchrony 17 and frequency 11 fig 4b by definition synchrony was the only pattern where the geographical focus was always larger than a single tree variability was usually quantified using the coefficient of variation of masting time series series e g ichie and nakagawa 2013 monks and kelly 2006 or the standard deviation e g nussbaumer et al 2016 or variance e g koenig et al 1994 of the time series other methods to quantify variability included the temporal autocorrelation structure in the data e g koenig et al 2003 some studies extended the analysis by linking variability in seed production with variability in weather conditions usually using a correlation based approach e g selås et al 2002 kelly et al 2013 typically strong correlations were found with weather measured in seasons associated with masting related processes multiple regression models could reproduce the observed variability of reproduction with a high accuracy poncet et al 2009 vacchiano et al 2017 a variation on this theme is to relate variability to teleconnection indices rather than climate indices schauber et al 2002 sakai et al 2006 ascoli et al 2017b a second group of studies attempted to explain observed variability in seed production using information on biological processes e g flower and leaf phenology koenig et al 2012 pesendorfer et al 2016 synchrony between populations was modeled by correlating it to geographic distance e g by mantel tests suzuki et al 2005 or by using indices of spatial aggregation fredriksson and wich 2006 spatial synchrony between populations was also linked to the synchrony of weather conditions during important phases of the reproductive cycle moran effect koenig 2002 synchrony of trees within the same population was modeled using the standard deviation sd between individual seed production in any given year e g isagi et al 1997 at the individual level pollen availability is a key control on synchrony within populations pollen coupling even if such a link has been modeled only by theoretical formulations so far satake and iwasa 2000 2002a b although see bogdziewicz et al 2017b frequency was the least reported pattern of masting measures of frequency included a typical mean return interval or a typical frequency of mast years hilton and packham 2003 nussbaumer et al 2016 this approach relies on the identification of a binary threshold for masting i e the definition of a mast year vs a non mast year most models included in table 1 characterized masting patterns by frequency a more rigorous approach is to conduct a form of spectral analysis such as fourier analysis but this was not frequently reported abrahamson and layne 2003 kasprzyk et al 2014 a similar approach is to test for temporal autocorrelation at different timescales greene and johnson 2004 spearman s rank correlation between seed production series over different periods also seems to be a good estimator to test for variations in frequency allen et al 2012 greene and johnson 2004 3 2 processes excluding studies with simple weather or climate correlations only 100 formulations out of 323 explicitly modeled a masting process most of these were empirically based 76 and stand alone 83 confirming a significant lack of implementing masting within larger model frameworks our review has confirmed the stronger tradition of studies related to resource acquisition storage and allocation which represented the most abundant 67 and longest studied group table 3 pollination 22 has come under the focus of research more recently whereas studies on floral induction anthesis 6 hormonal and genetic regulation of bud formation 3 and seed maturation after flower abortion 2 have been emerging as a novel yet challenging approach our review also highlighted the fact that efforts to relate seed production to multiple and interacting proximate causes were more frequent for pollination 50 and resource related studies 45 of formulations as opposed to only 27 of those using hormonal genetic or flowering processes table 4 only 83 formulations addressed both a pattern and a process of masting the review of such simultaneous pattern and process formulations highlighted the complex relations among them fig 5 no process could explain individually the variability synchrony or frequency of masting but rather a combination of processes was always involved in all patterns crone and rapp 2014 pearse et al 2016 3 3 examples of masting process formulations three quarters of studies on masting processes i e 73 papers focused on broadleaf species to illustrate how masting patterns and processes can be modeled we collected formulations for species belonging to the fagales order table 5 which have been repeatedly analyzed by some of the most recent and comprehensive studies on masting these formulations differ from what exposed for forest models that did did not include masting table 1 in that they are stand alone analyses that have usually been subject to validation against empirical measurements 4 challenges for modelling masting 4 1 options to implement masting in forest models based on the review of 206 papers on the use of mast seeding in forest models we confirmed that masting is an important albeit overlooked process in modelling forest dynamics the review highlighted the progression in understanding of masting by ecologists from the description of temporal variability in seed production to a more mechanistic understanding of what drives the highly fluctuating and synchronous seed production at the population level different options are available to reproduce reproduction in forest models for masting species from very simple formulations for variability synchrony frequency to semi empirical seed crop as a function of weather or completely detailed explicitly accounting for resources hormones and genetic regulation complete process based approaches should have the capability of producing emergent masting patterns without the need to parameterize them externally however while it may seem desirable to improve model realism by including a higher number of processes this would also increase model complexity and introduce more sources of uncertainty regarding model complexity it is clear that proximate causes of masting involve different ecological levels and occur at several scales from leaf to stand this presents a challenge for models that operate either at the wider side of the scale spectrum because they may miss the processes that result in emergent masting behavior or at the narrower because process modeled with insufficient accuracy or complexity may fail to generate the desired pattern when the model is up scaled regarding model uncertainty while some masting processes have been repeatedly described by quantitative algorithms e g resource uptake allocation and storage other processes are fairly unclear for example if masting needs to be modeled in a process based way flowering and pollination should be addressed by algorithms and included either implicitly or explicitly in forest models so far only little evidence has been elaborated on the interaction between resource dynamics in the tree and biochemical processes which renders the implementation of this masting component difficult in forest models additionally nutrient cycles are missing from many forest models especially p or may have not been validated as thoroughly or extensively as other process e g vega nieva et al 2013 the uncertainty on such a crucial mechanism of masting both in the masting literature and in its implementation in forest models calls for more scientific effort on the other hand hormonal and genetics components which operate as a signaling device are usually not included explicitly in forest dynamics models especially when the modelling object is larger than a single tree for these reasons modeling masting by patterns variability synchrony or frequency rather than processes might be the best option currently available for those forest models that operate at spatio temporal scales incompatible with a process based implementation of the main masting processes e g big leaf global dynamic vegetation models or when the variables involved are not readily produced by the model or when data to parameterize a process based formulation are lacking when several formulations of masting patterns and processes are available for some species or biome the choice of which to include in a forest model depends on the predictor and response variables involved and on the temporal and spatial resolution of the other model components e g tree vs stand the large amount of empirical studies and data accumulated in the literature e g mencuccini et al 1995 schauber et al 2002 ascoli et al 2017a should nevertheless represent a solid base to calibrate masting formulations for many species biomes and ecological resolutions but a minimum number of temporal and spatial observations needs to be assured although we have reported examples of masting algorithms for some species and biomes table 5 modelers operating in different or novel ecosystems should be cautious when assuming that process based masting models would work in the same way there indeed some of the mechanisms underlying proximate causes of masting may be highly context dependent e g significant weather predictors although the scale at which they vary is not entirely clear yet vacchiano et al 2017 on the other hand even in the absence of calibration data quantifying the variability synchrony and frequency of masting that emerge from process based models of seed production may serve as a tool for the verification of model behavior 4 2 linked patterns linked processes even if pattern only formulations are used the strong relationships between such patterns need to be acknowledged for example high variability at the population scale is only observable when synchrony is high koenig et al 2003 synchrony is only meaningful if measured over a long period of time one year s high synchrony is not enough to define masting finally the frequency of mast events is an indirect component of their variability since rare high seed production events also imply a relatively high variability any quantitative description of mast seeding therefore needs to combine the temporal and the spatial dimensions of all masting patterns fig 2 likewise a process based formulation must take into consideration that masting is determined by a chain of events fig 3 more tests with existing or new forest models are needed to understand whether all such processes must be included to obtain an accurate simulation of mast seeding and to assess the trade offs between realism gained and uncertainties introduced when chaining several sub models together an example of successful model chain is represented by resource budget models rbm isagi et al 1997 which include a strong link among most of the proximate causes of masting in particular resource allocation and depletion and pollination processes pollen coupling combined to density dependent pollen limitation are linked in rbm because pollen availability depends on the amount of resources allocated to flowering both male and female flowers in particular the rbm postulates that that i a plant cannot gain the amount of resources required to produce a high seed production in one year only but needs to accumulate resources over multiple years until its resources exceed some threshold that allows them to reproduce ii the ratio between the amount of resources used for fruiting and those used for flowering regulates masting patterns i e a higher ratio results in a higher inter annual variability and lower frequency iii a large seed crop causes resource depletion for the individual plant which will fail to reproduce in subsequent years as long as its reserves are below the threshold fig 6 theoretical rbm produce an emergent representation of variability and synchrony of masting rees et al 2002 satake and iwasa 2002a b venner et al 2016 noise in synchrony between individuals and populations is taken into account by varying the level of resources gained by each tree and each year through photosynthesis yet rbms have been tested empirically for very few species see crone and rapp 2014 for a review for example it is unclear if the resource whose accumulation and depletion are simulated in rbm is carbon nsc or rather some less abundant nutrient such as n or p in addition pearse et al 2016 questioned the existence of a resource threshold for reproduction should such a threshold exist most species would have no reproduction in most years a hypothesis that lacks empirical confirmation monks and kelly 2006 kelly et al 2013 as seedfall is often continuously distributed kelly 1994 koenig and knops 2000 allen et al 2012 a proposal for a novel process based implementation of masting within forest models could therefore revolve around validating and improving rbms possibly integrated with the knowledge collected about pollen regulation from a biochemical context dynamics of limiting resources and weather influences on both resources and pollination processes as a trigger or signal fig 7 such implementation would also provide grounds to test hypotheses on the ecological relevance of masting e g after natural disturbance ascoli et al 2015 and about the effect of climate change on masting and its patterns a topic which is still largely controversial due to the interactions between different processes and variables involved mckone et al 1998 piovesan and adams 2001 jump et al 2006 övergaard et al 2007 drobyshev et al 2010 future research on this topic will need to focus on understanding the most important controls of the masting process cascade moving away from a big bucket approach and focusing on proximate causes still lacking a formal quantitative treatment e g hormonal induction resource allocation while trying to link with inputs and outputs currently used by forest models also variation in masting patterns and processes between species biomes will need to be better understood with a special focus on less known ecosystems e g tropical a suitable design to advance these ideas and calibrate predictive models would involve the experimental manipulation of resource dynamics at various life stages of the tree in particular this would address the reproductive cycle with complementary measurements of inter annual variation in climate and resources as well as reproductive buds flowers and seeds allen et al 2017 in addition the design would account for contrasts between functionally different species in the same environment and for the same species in markedly different environments authors contribution gv coordinated and conceived

25304,masting is the highly variable and synchronous production of seeds by plants masting can have cascading effects on plant population dynamics and forest properties such as tree growth carbon stocks regeneration nutrient cycling or future species composition however masting has often been missing from forest models those few that simulate masting have done so using relatively simple empirical rules and lack an implementation of process based mechanisms that control such events here we review more than 200 published papers on mechanistic formulations of masting and summarize how the main processes involved in masting and their related patterns can be incorporated in forest models at different degrees of complexity our review showed that of all proximate causes of masting resource acquisition storage and allocation were the processes studied most often hormonal and genetic regulation of bud formation floral induction and anthesis were less frequently addressed we outline the building blocks of a general process based model of masting that can be used to improve the oversimplified functions in different types of forest models and to implement them where missing a complete implementation of masting in forest models should include functions for resource allocation and depletion and for pollination as regulated by both forest structure and weather in the years prior to seed production when models operate at spatio temporal scales mismatched with the main masting processes or if calibration data are not available simulation can be based on parameterizing masting patterns variability synchrony or frequency also observed masting patterns have the potential to be used as reality checks for more process based forest models wishing to accurately reproduce masting as an emergent phenomenon keywords masting seed production process based models resource budget model resource allocation tree reproduction 1 introduction understanding forest ecosystems and predicting their dynamics through models remains an abiding concern of forest researchers modeling forest dynamics using only a limited set of fundamental variables represents a challenging task considering the myriad of components mechanisms and the degree of complexity involved models however provide invaluable information to plan sustainable forest management monserud 2003 taylor et al 2009 in order to improve the accuracy of forest models operating under changing environmental conditions ecological processes which have big effects on forest dynamics must be accounted for a prominent but overlooked example of such processes is mast seeding or masting i e the highly variable and synchronous production of seeds by a population of plants masting occurs among grass shrub and tree species in many different biomes e g schauber et al 2002 abrahamson and layne 2003 poncet et al 2009 drobyshev et al 2010 the synchronized annual variability displayed by masting has been explained by several hypotheses sork 1993 kelly 1994 herrera et al 1998 kelly and sork 2002 masting events are thought to be cued by particular climatic conditions synchronized over large areas i e moran effect in the years that precede flowering schauber et al 2002 piovesan and adams 2001 2005 kelly et al 2013 however no general consensus has been reached yet on the complete set of processes and mechanisms causing masting pearse et al 2016 masting is intimately related to other processes of forest dynamics fig 1 such as tree growth thomas 2011 muller haubold et al 2013 hacket pain et al 2017 seed dispersal and regeneration vander wall 2001 ascoli et al 2015 the relative contribution of seed production to annual net primary productivity npp in masting species has been estimated for some species at between 20 and 57 mund et al 2010 muller haubold et al 2013 and about 15 of stem biomass growth mencuccini et al 1995 the fact that tree growth is reduced in years of heavy seed production piovesan and schirone 2000 may help to explain the failure of most process based forest models to reproduce observed inter annual variability in carbon fluxes or observed biomass growth drobyshev et al 2010 collalti et al 2016 as well as the disagreement between modeled growth climate relationships and observed tree rings babst et al 2013 additionally masting has far reaching effects

et al 2012 zwolak et al 2016 selås 2017 and vectors of human diseases ostfeld 1997 tersago et al 2009 in forestry research forest models are sets of equations that integrate several mechanisms describing and predicting important forest processes such as growth mortality and regeneration e g monserud 2003 vacchiano et al 2012 since masting has such widespread influences on forest ecosystem dynamics implementing it into predictive forest models may contribute to improve their accuracy not only in terms of modeling seed production but also extending to growth trade offs pollen and seed dispersal establishment success species migration cascading trophic interactions effects of silvicultural treatments and ecosystem resilience to natural disturbances or climate change in some of these forest models seed production has been implemented either as a constant or limitless process not integrated into allocation price et al 2001 or more realistically as a function of npp or leaf mass e g bossel 1996 however this is unlikely to fully reproduce the characteristics of masting those that did attempt to model masting explicitly used a simplistic implementation e g a regular frequency of years with high seed output rammig et al 2007 neglecting the relationship between masting processes and environmental conditions overall masting has been included in forest models in very few cases table 1 be it to look specifically at masting effects or within large scale forest ecosystem models in which patterns of seed production have not been specifically developed to incorporate mast seeding inconsistent study design omitted reporting of effect sizes and lack of validation of model prediction against observed data mean that no conclusive evidence exists on whether an explicit inclusion of masting in forest models is relevant to accurately predict ecosystem and ecological dynamics the effect size of including not including masting in models could possibly vary depending on the desired output variable and on the spatial and temporal span being modeled e g an individual stand vs a regional forest landscape rigorously validated analyses of the accuracy of forest model prediction with and without masting are greatly needed however the inclusion of masting in forest models can be crucial on one side for greater realism and on the other to equip models with a process based understanding that would enable to produce projections out of the range of their calibration domain e g under climate change in the following paragraphs we first provide a concise overview of the most important patterns and processes related to masting then we propose ways to implement them in forest models across different spatial temporal and ecological scales to do so we carried out a review of formulations used in the scientific literature to model masting patterns and processes finally we bring this evidence together in a broader discussion on what to consider when implementing masting in forest models 2 masting patterns and underlying processes masting can be modelled using two main approaches a reproducing demographic and ecological patterns produced by masting both spatially and temporally or b understanding and reproducing mechanistic processes or proximate causes sensu kelly 1994 which is usually a more complex task and not necessarily leading to less uncertainty than the former 2 1 patterns patterns of masting have been characterized in different ways in the literature e g kelly and sork 2002 koenig et al 2003 pearse et al 2016 here we refer to variability synchrony and frequency as key elements to describe masting patterns fig 2 although other elements have been proposed such as temporal autocorrelation e g koenig et al 2003 crone et al 2011 variability defined as the absolute or relative difference in the number or mass of seeds produced by one unit typically a tree or stand across time e g herrera et al 1998 greene and johnson 2004 richardson et al 2005 crone et al 2011 seed production that is either large or zero produces a bimodal frequency distribution of seed crop size but see allen et al 2012 for more continuous distributions variability can be quantified either by the coefficient of variation cv of the number of seeds produced across time or by the recently proposed disparity index fernández martínez et al 2017a the latter is a modification of cv that does not depend on the mean and takes into account actual year to year variation in a temporally explicit way a particular type of variability often found in masting species is a negative autocorrelation the current seed crop can be often explained to a high degree by a negative correlation with the previous year s crop e g in alternate bearing species or as a consequence of resource depletion synchrony defined as the degree of similarity between the number or mass of seeds produced by a population of trees or stands at the same time for one or multiple species e g lamontagne and boutin 2007 fearer et al 2008 allen et al 2012 the spatial extent of synchrony may range from stand to region or even sub continent koenig and knops 2000 a marked distance decay in synchrony was reported at continental vacchiano et al 2017 regional e g fearer et al 2008 and local e g allen and platt 1990 scales synchrony can be measured at the individual level correlation between individual and population seed production or at the population level correlation among trees or stands or percentage of trees or stands showing a similar seed output frequency defined as the number of high seed production years during a time period e g sork et al 1993 greene and johnson 2004 allen et al 2012 when the causes for synchrony and variability are explicitly modeled frequency is an emergent behavior and regular cycles in fruiting need not to be mechanistically explained however they can and should be linked to the temporal patterns of the underlying drivers e g solar activity or climate oscillations ascoli et al 2017b in this review we consider frequency as a stand alone pattern because the question of interest usually is when will the next massive fruiting occur furthermore masting frequency is typically the only parameter that has been implemented in forest models thus far e g rammig et al 2007 2 2 processes the causes driving variability and synchrony in seed production have been categorized as ultimate and proximate pearse et al 2016 ultimate causes include processes associated with evolutionary timescales such selective pressure they are excluded from the present review because they would be incompatible with the time span covered by most forest models used for ecological or forest management prediction proximate causes on the other hand operate between a decade and a few days before seed production they include dynamics of resource accumulation and depletion weather events favorable to phenological phases involved in flowering and fruiting and all cellular and genetic processes involved in their occurrence crone and rapp 2014 pearse et al 2016 masting patterns emerge when several proximate causes interact across space and time affecting all processes that lead to seed production resource acquisition bud initiation anthesis pollination and fertilization flower abortion and seed maturation allen et al 2017 fig 3 2 2 1 resource acquisition storage and allocation trees allocate resources to growth survival and reproduction cf fridley 2017 for a review it is well established that there is an internal cycling of resources see millard and grelet 2010 for a review on carbohydrates and nitrogen n and proe and millard 1995 for phosphorus p and that macronutrients influence fecundity and seed production reekie and bazzaz 1987 ichie and nakagawa 2013 miyazaki 2013 han et al 2014 yet it is still unclear which of the nutrients non structural carbohydrates nsc n or p and interactions among nutrients compensation effects are most limiting for reproduction körner 2003 han et al 2008 sala et al 2012 whether nutrients used for reproduction come from recently acquired or accumulated resources koenig and knops 2000 kelly and sork 2002 sala et al 2012 and in the last case what is the accumulation period ichie et al 2018 until today four non mutually exclusive mechanisms have been proposed to explain how resource supply and uptake are involved in seed production resource matching in which a fixed fraction of resources is allocated each year to reproduction koenig and knops 2000 storage in which trees accumulate resources over several years in order to eventually allocate them to high seed production leading to negative temporal autocorrelation in seed production series sork 1993 koenig et al 1994 switching in which a variable fraction of resources is allocated each year to reproduction leading to negative correlations between reproduction and growth yasumura et al 2006 monks and kelly 2006 sala et al 2012 veto in which some external agent e g late frost may limit the investment in fruiting preventing resources to be allocated to reproduction koenig et al 2015 pesendorfer et al 2016 bogdziewicz et al 2017b 2 2 2 hormonal and genetic regulation of bud formation floral induction and anthesis floral induction is driven by hormonal induction which incorporates the influence of numerous external and internal cues bernier and périlleux 2005 turnbull 2011 bluemel et al 2015 large seed quantities are directly correlated to gibberellin contents böhlenius et al 2006 turnbull 2011 whereas fruit abortion is driven by ethylene bleecker and kende 2000 the biosynthesis of growth hormones wahl et al 2013 and the expression of flowering genes miyazaki et al 2014 are stimulated under higher resource supply especially n sedgley and griffin 1989 2 2 3 pollination a tree can produce a large quantity of seeds when three conditions are met i the tree produces a high initial flower crop ii pollination success is high and iii a high proportion of fertilized flowers mature into fruits most masting species are outcrossers pearse et al 2016 therefore masting is restricted by pollen production by other plants in the population smith et al 1990 plants with many pollen producing neighbors produce larger seed crops than more isolated ones knapp et al 2001 theoretical models showed that such density dependent pollen limitation pollen coupling can also induce synchrony in seed production isagi et al 1997 lyles et al 2015 venner et al 2016 however empirical support of the role of pollen limitation on masting remains scarce and the importance of pollen limitation as a trigger of seed production is still widely debated koenig and ashley 2003 koenig et al 2012 rapp et al 2013 pearse et al 2015 see also pearse et al 2016 for a review 2 2 4 seed maturation fertilization and flower abortion in perennial plants fertilized flowers are often aborted stephenson 1981 sork and bramble 1993 holland et al 2004 from an evolutionary point of view flower abortion is an inexpensive strategy to either maximize the long term quality of the remaining fertilized flowers becerra and lloyd 1992 or re allocate resources to other non reproductive processes in response to unpredicted disturbances goubitz et al 2002 montesinos et al 2012 especially when resources are depleted during fruit maturation tsuruta et al 2011 2 2 5 weather cues and vetoes many of the processes above are influenced linearly or not fernández martínez et al 2017b by weather as confirmed by the large number of studies reporting on correlations between weather and seed production in masting species allen et al 2014 canham et al 2014 moreira et al 2015 pérezramos et al 2015 caignard et al 2017 vacchiano et al 2017 acquisition and storage of resources depend on photosynthesis and on the amount of solar radiation but are also constrained by water limitation and drought stress which were shown to affect seed crops with a lag of two or three years newbery et al 2006 smaill et al 2011 barringer et al 2013 muller haubold et al 2013 bachofen et al 2017 other studies highlighted a correlation between large seed crops and higher than average summer temperatures during both floral initiation and fruit maturation piovesan and adams 2001 richardson et al 2005 fearer et al 2008 buechling et al 2016 which can also be attributed to resource mediated mechanisms meteorological conditions solar radiation and temperature can also affect flowering inducing hormones such as gibberellins and phytocromes reviewed by ruan et al 2012 and have a crucial impact on pollination in particular pollen concentrations are negatively correlated to rainfall and humidity but positively correlated to temperature during the pollen season cecich and sullivan 1999 sabit et al 2016 bogdziewicz et al 2017a the pollen season itself is longer under drier and warmer weather fuhrmann et al 2016 also spring microclimatic conditions affect the local budburst synchrony that is a proxy for flowering synchrony and pollen availability and consequently the pollination efficiency koenig et al 2015 finally extreme weather events can damage reproductive structures by e g late frost during flowering augspurger 2009 changyang et al 2016 or intense summer rainfall during fruit maturation abrahamson and layne 2003 however the variability of weather has been shown to be often smaller than the variability in masting indicating that climate alone cannot explain all variability in masting koenig and knops 2005 3 literature review the scope of this review is to summarize how masting patterns and processes have been described in the scientific literature this includes quantitative analyses of masting variability synchrony and frequency as well as empirical or process based models of processes leading to masting at all ecological levels and geographic scales to do so we searched the scopus database for titles and abstracts containing the following search string masting or mast seeding or mast fruiting or mast flowering and variability or pattern or synchrony or periodicity or model and forest or tree we complemented the search results by a targeted search based on references from a recent and comprehensive review on masting processes pearse et al 2016 the geographic scope of our search was global we excluded from the analysis papers that only reported masting observations without quantitatively describing a pattern or modeling a process out of a total of 360 papers found for the period 1957 2016 we selected 206 for further analysis containing a total of 323 individual model formulations for a pattern a process or both i e several papers contained more than one pattern and or process for each individual model formulation we collected information regarding the modeled species the pattern and process being modeled and the modelling methods table 2 the largest share of studies was carried out in temperate ecosystems n 105 51 followed by studies from mediterranean 17 tropical 13 and boreal biomes 5 only 11 papers referred to multiple biomes reflecting the overall scarcity of generalized approaches on masting fig 4 a most studies involved broadleaves n 140 and more in general wind pollinated species n 130 with exclusive anemophilous pollination a strategy that is disproportionately common among masting species herrera et al 1998 especially for cross pollinating ones satake and iwasa 2000 2002a b the dominant geographical focus was the stand 47 of all papers followed by region 31 at the two ends of the spectrum both individual tree and continental global algorithms were varey rare 4 and 2 respectively the temporal unit was almost always the year 90 with only 16 studies having a monthly time resolution or finer most analyses were conducted at tree 51 of all papers stand 26 or population level 20 as spatial units the predominant level of ecological and data complexity at which masting was described or modelled was demographics 52 i e the numerical oscillations of reproductive organs flowers pollen fruits seeds and their environmental drivers one in five studies 22 had a merely descriptive character i e no causal or correlative analyses were carried out for the masting patterns reported studies explicitly looking into resource dynamics or finer scale processes were 20 of the total of all 323 masting formulations covered in our review most 77 described variables related to seeds or fruits which are usually easier to measure and more directly related to masting than e g pollen or flowers fig 4b a small group of resource based formulations instead modeled the nutrient content of tree organs including reproductive ones following masting response variables were more often described by univariate 41 or multivariate 31 algorithms the complete review table and metadata is reported as supplementary material s1 3 1 patterns variability was the most frequently analyzed pattern 60 194 of 323 formulations vastly exceeding synchrony 17 and frequency 11 fig 4b by definition synchrony was the only pattern where the geographical focus was always larger than a single tree variability was usually quantified using the coefficient of variation of masting time series series e g ichie and nakagawa 2013 monks and kelly 2006 or the standard deviation e g nussbaumer et al 2016 or variance e g koenig et al 1994 of the time series other methods to quantify variability included the temporal autocorrelation structure in the data e g koenig et al 2003 some studies extended the analysis by linking variability in seed production with variability in weather conditions usually using a correlation based approach e g selås et al 2002 kelly et al 2013 typically strong correlations were found with weather measured in seasons associated with masting related processes multiple regression models could reproduce the observed variability of reproduction with a high accuracy poncet et al 2009 vacchiano et al 2017 a variation on this theme is to relate variability to teleconnection indices rather than climate indices schauber et al 2002 sakai et al 2006 ascoli et al 2017b a second group of studies attempted to explain observed variability in seed production using information on biological processes e g flower and leaf phenology koenig et al 2012 pesendorfer et al 2016 synchrony between populations was modeled by correlating it to geographic distance e g by mantel tests suzuki et al 2005 or by using indices of spatial aggregation fredriksson and wich 2006 spatial synchrony between populations was also linked to the synchrony of weather conditions during important phases of the reproductive cycle moran effect koenig 2002 synchrony of trees within the same population was modeled using the standard deviation sd between individual seed production in any given year e g isagi et al 1997 at the individual level pollen availability is a key control on synchrony within populations pollen coupling even if such a link has been modeled only by theoretical formulations so far satake and iwasa 2000 2002a b although see bogdziewicz et al 2017b frequency was the least reported pattern of masting measures of frequency included a typical mean return interval or a typical frequency of mast years hilton and packham 2003 nussbaumer et al 2016 this approach relies on the identification of a binary threshold for masting i e the definition of a mast year vs a non mast year most models included in table 1 characterized masting patterns by frequency a more rigorous approach is to conduct a form of spectral analysis such as fourier analysis but this was not frequently reported abrahamson and layne 2003 kasprzyk et al 2014 a similar approach is to test for temporal autocorrelation at different timescales greene and johnson 2004 spearman s rank correlation between seed production series over different periods also seems to be a good estimator to test for variations in frequency allen et al 2012 greene and johnson 2004 3 2 processes excluding studies with simple weather or climate correlations only 100 formulations out of 323 explicitly modeled a masting process most of these were empirically based 76 and stand alone 83 confirming a significant lack of implementing masting within larger model frameworks our review has confirmed the stronger tradition of studies related to resource acquisition storage and allocation which represented the most abundant 67 and longest studied group table 3 pollination 22 has come under the focus of research more recently whereas studies on floral induction anthesis 6 hormonal and genetic regulation of bud formation 3 and seed maturation after flower abortion 2 have been emerging as a novel yet challenging approach our review also highlighted the fact that efforts to relate seed production to multiple and interacting proximate causes were more frequent for pollination 50 and resource related studies 45 of formulations as opposed to only 27 of those using hormonal genetic or flowering processes table 4 only 83 formulations addressed both a pattern and a process of masting the review of such simultaneous pattern and process formulations highlighted the complex relations among them fig 5 no process could explain individually the variability synchrony or frequency of masting but rather a combination of processes was always involved in all patterns crone and rapp 2014 pearse et al 2016 3 3 examples of masting process formulations three quarters of studies on masting processes i e 73 papers focused on broadleaf species to illustrate how masting patterns and processes can be modeled we collected formulations for species belonging to the fagales order table 5 which have been repeatedly analyzed by some of the most recent and comprehensive studies on masting these formulations differ from what exposed for forest models that did did not include masting table 1 in that they are stand alone analyses that have usually been subject to validation against empirical measurements 4 challenges for modelling masting 4 1 options to implement masting in forest models based on the review of 206 papers on the use of mast seeding in forest models we confirmed that masting is an important albeit overlooked process in modelling forest dynamics the review highlighted the progression in understanding of masting by ecologists from the description of temporal variability in seed production to a more mechanistic understanding of what drives the highly fluctuating and synchronous seed production at the population level different options are available to reproduce reproduction in forest models for masting species from very simple formulations for variability synchrony frequency to semi empirical seed crop as a function of weather or completely detailed explicitly accounting for resources hormones and genetic regulation complete process based approaches should have the capability of producing emergent masting patterns without the need to parameterize them externally however while it may seem desirable to improve model realism by including a higher number of processes this would also increase model complexity and introduce more sources of uncertainty regarding model complexity it is clear that proximate causes of masting involve different ecological levels and occur at several scales from leaf to stand this presents a challenge for models that operate either at the wider side of the scale spectrum because they may miss the processes that result in emergent masting behavior or at the narrower because process modeled with insufficient accuracy or complexity may fail to generate the desired pattern when the model is up scaled regarding model uncertainty while some masting processes have been repeatedly described by quantitative algorithms e g resource uptake allocation and storage other processes are fairly unclear for example if masting needs to be modeled in a process based way flowering and pollination should be addressed by algorithms and included either implicitly or explicitly in forest models so far only little evidence has been elaborated on the interaction between resource dynamics in the tree and biochemical processes which renders the implementation of this masting component difficult in forest models additionally nutrient cycles are missing from many forest models especially p or may have not been validated as thoroughly or extensively as other process e g vega nieva et al 2013 the uncertainty on such a crucial mechanism of masting both in the masting literature and in its implementation in forest models calls for more scientific effort on the other hand hormonal and genetics components which operate as a signaling device are usually not included explicitly in forest dynamics models especially when the modelling object is larger than a single tree for these reasons modeling masting by patterns variability synchrony or frequency rather than processes might be the best option currently available for those forest models that operate at spatio temporal scales incompatible with a process based implementation of the main masting processes e g big leaf global dynamic vegetation models or when the variables involved are not readily produced by the model or when data to parameterize a process based formulation are lacking when several formulations of masting patterns and processes are available for some species or biome the choice of which to include in a forest model depends on the predictor and response variables involved and on the temporal and spatial resolution of the other model components e g tree vs stand the large amount of empirical studies and data accumulated in the literature e g mencuccini et al 1995 schauber et al 2002 ascoli et al 2017a should nevertheless represent a solid base to calibrate masting formulations for many species biomes and ecological resolutions but a minimum number of temporal and spatial observations needs to be assured although we have reported examples of masting algorithms for some species and biomes table 5 modelers operating in different or novel ecosystems should be cautious when assuming that process based masting models would work in the same way there indeed some of the mechanisms underlying proximate causes of masting may be highly context dependent e g significant weather predictors although the scale at which they vary is not entirely clear yet vacchiano et al 2017 on the other hand even in the absence of calibration data quantifying the variability synchrony and frequency of masting that emerge from process based models of seed production may serve as a tool for the verification of model behavior 4 2 linked patterns linked processes even if pattern only formulations are used the strong relationships between such patterns need to be acknowledged for example high variability at the population scale is only observable when synchrony is high koenig et al 2003 synchrony is only meaningful if measured over a long period of time one year s high synchrony is not enough to define masting finally the frequency of mast events is an indirect component of their variability since rare high seed production events also imply a relatively high variability any quantitative description of mast seeding therefore needs to combine the temporal and the spatial dimensions of all masting patterns fig 2 likewise a process based formulation must take into consideration that masting is determined by a chain of events fig 3 more tests with existing or new forest models are needed to understand whether all such processes must be included to obtain an accurate simulation of mast seeding and to assess the trade offs between realism gained and uncertainties introduced when chaining several sub models together an example of successful model chain is represented by resource budget models rbm isagi et al 1997 which include a strong link among most of the proximate causes of masting in particular resource allocation and depletion and pollination processes pollen coupling combined to density dependent pollen limitation are linked in rbm because pollen availability depends on the amount of resources allocated to flowering both male and female flowers in particular the rbm postulates that that i a plant cannot gain the amount of resources required to produce a high seed production in one year only but needs to accumulate resources over multiple years until its resources exceed some threshold that allows them to reproduce ii the ratio between the amount of resources used for fruiting and those used for flowering regulates masting patterns i e a higher ratio results in a higher inter annual variability and lower frequency iii a large seed crop causes resource depletion for the individual plant which will fail to reproduce in subsequent years as long as its reserves are below the threshold fig 6 theoretical rbm produce an emergent representation of variability and synchrony of masting rees et al 2002 satake and iwasa 2002a b venner et al 2016 noise in synchrony between individuals and populations is taken into account by varying the level of resources gained by each tree and each year through photosynthesis yet rbms have been tested empirically for very few species see crone and rapp 2014 for a review for example it is unclear if the resource whose accumulation and depletion are simulated in rbm is carbon nsc or rather some less abundant nutrient such as n or p in addition pearse et al 2016 questioned the existence of a resource threshold for reproduction should such a threshold exist most species would have no reproduction in most years a hypothesis that lacks empirical confirmation monks and kelly 2006 kelly et al 2013 as seedfall is often continuously distributed kelly 1994 koenig and knops 2000 allen et al 2012 a proposal for a novel process based implementation of masting within forest models could therefore revolve around validating and improving rbms possibly integrated with the knowledge collected about pollen regulation from a biochemical context dynamics of limiting resources and weather influences on both resources and pollination processes as a trigger or signal fig 7 such implementation would also provide grounds to test hypotheses on the ecological relevance of masting e g after natural disturbance ascoli et al 2015 and about the effect of climate change on masting and its patterns a topic which is still largely controversial due to the interactions between different processes and variables involved mckone et al 1998 piovesan and adams 2001 jump et al 2006 övergaard et al 2007 drobyshev et al 2010 future research on this topic will need to focus on understanding the most important controls of the masting process cascade moving away from a big bucket approach and focusing on proximate causes still lacking a formal quantitative treatment e g hormonal induction resource allocation while trying to link with inputs and outputs currently used by forest models also variation in masting patterns and processes between species biomes will need to be better understood with a special focus on less known ecosystems e g tropical a suitable design to advance these ideas and calibrate predictive models would involve the experimental manipulation of resource dynamics at various life stages of the tree in particular this would address the reproductive cycle with complementary measurements of inter annual variation in climate and resources as well as reproductive buds flowers and seeds allen et al 2017 in addition the design would account for contrasts between functionally different species in the same environment and for the same species in markedly different environments authors contribution gv coordinated and conceived
