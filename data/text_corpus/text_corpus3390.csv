16950,humans and wildlife are frequently exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals with exposure rarely causing only one dominant effect consequently there is an urgent need to develop strategies to assess exposures to multiple hazardous chemicals and effects of such combinations here the maximum cumulative ratio was used as part of a tiered approach to evaluate and prioritize risks of co exposures to metals in 781 samples of surface water from tai lake china multiple metals including copper lead cadmium nickel and zinc dominated the hazardous effects on aquatic organisms based on species sensitivity distributions developed from genus mean chronic values crustaceans were the most susceptible to effects of metals results of a multi generation experiment demonstrated adverse effects of mixtures of metals at environmentally relevant concentrations on growth and reproduction of the cladocerans daphnia magna and moina macrocopa specifically when exposed to metals body length and total number of offspring produced per adult female were less than the controls resistance of d magna populations to mixtures of metals was significantly less while under similar conditions m macrocopa exhibited greater capacity to recover and the response to adverse effects occurred earlier demographic analysis models constructed using a leslie matrix used to predict population dynamics of the cladocerans revealed that various effects of metal cocktails on individual level endpoints was related to attenuation at the population level by integrating all the observations it was recommended that densities of populations of cladocerans in surface waters could be a useful parameter for indicating possible detrimental effects induced by toxic chemicals results of this study provide novel insights into risks posed by simultaneous exposure to multiple metals and reveal their potential adverse long term effects on sensitive aquatic organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords crustacean metal mixture multi generational effect leslie matrix population dynamics tai lake china asia 1 introduction multiple metals are generally present in surface waters which can enter via multiple routes such as atmospheric deposition industrial effluent discharge and surface runoff zeng et al 2012 however most regulatory approaches and assessments of the hazards of metals are based on results of toxicity tests of individual metals on individual species gama flores et al 2007 which do not account for the possibility that simultaneous exposure to other metals may also contribute to the observed toxicity results of several studies have indicated that the combination of chemicals at concentrations less than the no observation effect concentrations could produce significant effects and that toxic potency can be strictly additive or supra additive payne et al 2001 silva et al 2002 for example some mixtures of different metals each individually causing 10 growth inhibition of hordeum vulgare yielded much greater inhibition up to 66 when dosed in combination nys et al 2017 thus single metal exposures judged to be safe based on results of independent exposures might pose significant risks in reality if there is co exposure with other metals there was urgent need to develop strategies for assessing interactive effects of exposure to multiple hazardous metals a key challenge in elucidating risks arises from the large number of potential combinations and concentrations of metals in the environment to address the challenge the maximum cumulative ratio mcr concept has been proposed price and han 2011 tiered approaches that apply the mcr can identify combined exposures in cases where potential risks would be ignored and provide a quantitative measure of the magnitude of the toxicity that is underestimated by single substance assessments mcr methodology has been applied to crop protection products in surface waters in the u s vallotton and price 2016 tai lake chinese taihu is a shallow lake located in a densely populated urbanized and industrialized area south of the yangtze delta in china due to rapid industrialization and intensification of agriculture in the watershed surrounding tai lake various contaminants such as nutrients and metals have been introduced into its surface water zhai et al 2010 urban effluents from metal processing plating and electronics industries are dominant sources of metals to tai lake liang et al 2011 long term exposures to metals influence capacities of populations to cope with additional environmental stressors ríos arana et al 2007 therefore the presence of multiple metal contaminants might pose threats to aquatic organisms in tai lake however most published data are based on concentrations of chemicals that are greater than those detected in freshwater systems therefore studies considering effects of metals on aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations are required dietrich et al 2010a in this study mcr was used to identify whether single or multiple metals dominated the adverse effects on aquatic organisms in tai lake and the adverse effects of multi metal mixtures at environmentally realistic concentrations were studied the water flea is a common crustacean invertebrate in freshwater systems this type of zooplankton grazes on algae and forms the base of the secondary producer food chain chen et al 2014 testing more than two successive generations provides more information regarding possible chronic population level effects of metals dietrich et al 2010b a multi generational study over three generations using two model organisms the cladocerans daphnia magna and moina macrocopa was conducted the primary aim of the present study was to identify the real culprit causing adverse effects by multiple metals on organisms in an aquatic environment and investigate the effects of co exposure to the most hazardous metals at environmental concentrations on growth reproduction and population dynamics in the two sensitive species the secondary aim of the paper was to screen the most sensitive parameter of water flea as a candidate indicator indicating possible detrimental effects induced by multiple toxic chemicals therefore results of this study allowed integration of effects of metal mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations in risk assessment frameworks 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and analysis samples of water 500 ml were collected twice in september 2019 wet season and january 2020 dry season from 52 sampling points in tai lake fig s1 in the supporting information temperature dissolved oxygen turbidity electrical conductivity and ph of water samples were measured on site using ysi portable meters 6600v2 4 ecosense ohio usa then water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm microporous membranes and packed in polyethylene bottles that were pre washed according to national standard water quality reference hj 493 2009 ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2009 after sampling samples were preserved by adjusting ph to 1 2 by adding 5 ml concentrated nitric acid hno3 to 500 ml water sample prior to quantification of copper cu lead pb cadmium cd and zinc zn concentrations while those for quantification of hexavalent chromium cr ⅵ were preserved with naoh ph 8 9 concentrations of cu pb cd zn and cr ⅵ were determined by use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms following methods set by national standards hj 700 2014 ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2014 analyses were performed on blank and duplicate samples and a standard recovery test was used to determine the accuracy of the analysis the relative deviation of the duplicate samples was 6 50 for all batch treatments and the recovery rates of each element were in the range 87 105 which satisfied the quality requirements 2 2 chronic toxicity benchmarks and metal concentrations in tai lake in addition to data obtained for 104 samples concentrations of metals were obtained from the published literature by searching using the keywords tai lake and metals data were also provided by the jiangsu environmental monitoring center aquatic benchmarks bms are based on the most sensitive toxicity endpoint of the distribution for each aquatic taxa and support baseline risk assessments of individual metals u s environmental protection agency 2019 the use of chronic bms is optimal for long term protection of aquatic organisms water chemistry characteristics such as ph organic carbon content hardness as well as other edaphic factors and biological species result in diverse bms in various regions carlson a 1984 therefore chronic bms of metals that have been established through quality screening and data standardization for the tai lake were selected first followed by bms for china and finally the values set by other agencies such as the u s environmental protection agency u s epa if the values derived for tai lake and china differed more than five fold the geometric mean of the two bms was used as the ultimate threshold table 1 2 3 methodology for risk assessment of metals a tiered mcr approach based on dose additive models was used to determine whether it was necessary to perform a detailed cumulative risk assessment for organisms that are simultaneously exposed to multiple metals price and han 2011 hazard quotients hq for individual metals were calculated by dividing the metal concentration by the bm eq 1 the hazard index hi was calculated as the sum of individual hqs eq 2 the mcr for exposure to n pollutants was then calculated eqs 3 and 4 1 h q i c i b m i 2 hi h q i 3 mhq max h q i 4 mc r i h i i mh q i where c i μg l is the measured environmental concentration of the i th metal in surface water bm i denotes the chronic benchmark of the i th metal hq i is the hazard quotient of the i th metal hi is the sum of the individual values of hq i and mhq is the maximum of hq i based on results of mcr and hi for each sample four groups of combined exposure were identified price et al 2012 each group indicates the potential hazard and proposes relevant management strategies group i at least individual metals are of concern mhq 1 group ii risks posed by individual metals and multiple metals can be ignored hi 1 group iii risks posed by individual metals could be ignored however the combined effect is a concern mhq 1 and hi 1 this group was divided into two subgroups group iiia toxicity of the combined exposure was dominated by one metal mcr 2 group iiib toxicity of combined exposure was accounted for by several metals mcr 2 hqs were calculated for each metal in mixtures based on the mcr during tier i in tier ii sums of samples with an hq 1 0 were calculated for each metal to identify the possible combination of metals that posed the greatest risk to organisms subsequently species that were more sensitive to metals were identified based on the species sensitivity distributions ssds which were developed following our previously reported method sun et al 2020 the mcr approach can be used to investigate the magnitudes of toxicity underestimation by assessments of hazard based on individual metals price and han 2011 the proportion of the toxicity that is overlooked for each sample can be estimated eq 5 5 missed toxicity 1 1 mc r i 2 4 multi generation experiment based on results of the mcr mixtures of cu pb nickel ni cd and zn were selected to be tested for multi generational effects on the most susceptible organisms cladocerans stock solutions of pbcl2 cucl2 2h2o zncl2 cdcl2 2 5h2o and nicl2 2 5h2o all purity 99 00 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa were prepared as sources of pb cu zn cd and ni respectively two cladocerans d magna and m macrocopa were selected as test species for the multi generation experiment based on the distribution of environmental concentrations of each metal table 1 organisms were exposed to one of the three concentrations least medium and greatest table 2 in addition tap water was aerated for 3 days and was used as a negative control to which responses could be referenced basic physical and chemical parameters of experimental water samples were as follows ph 7 60 0 14 conductivity 300 9 80 μs cm dissolved oxygen 8 15 0 23 mg l alkalinity 81 25 2 17 mg l caco3 and hardness 155 50 4 95 mg l caco3 experiments were conducted according to the organization for economic co operation and development oecd guideline 211 oecd guidelines for the testing of chemicals 2012 further details regarding exposures to mixtures of metals are provided in the supporting information 2 5 leslie matrix and demographic analysis the leslie matrix is a matriarchal based model developed by leslie 1945 and lewis 1977 it can project population growth over time based on the fecundity and survival rates of individual life stage classes in this study stage specific survivorship and fecundity data were obtained from the multi generation experiment in a leslie matrix analysis the life history information is organized in a projection matrix a eq 6 6 a f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 s 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 5 0 where fi represents the total numbers of offspring per adult female produced at stage i and si represents the survival rate from stage i 1 to stage i the number of females at each stage at time t was calculated eq 7 7 n t n 1 t n 2 t n 3 t n 4 t n 5 t n 6 t t where nij is the number of organisms of stage i at the start of day j the numbers for the following days were determined eq 8 8 n t 1 a n t the intrinsic rate of population growth r is an integrative indicator that is important for measuring the instantaneous rate of population development it is the natural logarithm of the largest eigenvalue λ of matrix a eq 9 9 r ln λ r can also be calculated using the survivorship and reproduction data eq 10 10 r ln r 0 r 0 x l x m x where r0 is the net reproduce rate lx is the survive rate of individuals reaching age x and mx is the average number of live offspring produced per female of age x during the time interval x to x 1 the leslie matrix distinguishes various life stages and the same r value was obtained through equations 9 and 10 when setting one day as the life stage of test organisms monte carlo type stochastic simulations based on survival rate normal distribution were used to represent the 95 confidence interval ci based on 1000 iterations however the results of monte carlo type stochastic simulations were hardly different from values predicted using the leslie matrix thus could not be effectively displayed 2 6 statistical analysis basic descriptive statistical analyses were performed using microsoft excel version 2016 microsoft redmond usa and data were processed using spss software version 22 0 spss inc usa statistical drawing was performed using graphpad prism graphpad prism development core team http www graphpad com scientific software prism monte carlo type stochastic simulations were employed using poptools http www poptools org for a probabilistic estimation of population prediction based on the variability of the input parameters differences in growth and reproduction parameters were determined using one way analysis of variance anova assuming normal distributions based on the shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variances was assessed by use of levene s test then significant differences were tested using tukey s honestly significant difference least significance difference lsd method which was applied for multiple comparisons among means for data that were not normally distributed logarithmic transformation was applied and data were then rechecked for normality levels of significance were set to p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of metals in tai lake surface water dissolved oxygen concentrations of water fluctuated within the ranges 3 48 13 89 and 8 91 11 08 mg l during the wet and dry seasons respectively similarly the ph also varied substantially ranging from 6 93 to 8 52 at 52 sampling sites and was generally high in the wet season for electrical conductivity similar variations were observed among different seasons ranging from 103 30 to 592 00 μs cm concentrations of the five metals in tai lake varied between seasons and among locations tables s1 and s2 concentrations of cu in the wet and dry seasons were 0 68 11 and 1 52 5 4 μg l respectively concentrations of zn at most locations were 30 μg l except for a few points where the concentration was 50 μg l concentrations of cd were similar during wet and dry seasons with mean concentrations of 0 044 and 0 049 μg l respectively during the wet season 33 of concentrations of pb were less than the limit of detection concentrations of cr ⅵ were 0 71 10 5 and 1 53 3 73 μg l during the wet and dry seasons respectively concentrations of cu zn and cr ⅵ in the wet season were generally greater than those during the dry season the opposite trend was observed for distributions of concentrations of pb emissions from mechanical manufacturing industries were possibly the main source of metals in tai lake basin during the wet season while metals accumulated in environmental media were the main source during the dry season yao et al 2014 differences in sources of metals might result in different distributions of the five metals in tai lake when combined with recent values published in the literature 11 metals were detected in 781 samples from tai lake the order of median concentrations in tai lake was as follows iron fe manganese mn zn cu ni pb cr ⅵ arsenic as selenium se cd mercury hg table 1 fig s2a concentrations of the 11 metals were generally skewed and were best described by a log normal distribution fig s2b l in tai lake concentrations of fe and mn which are generally regarded as macro elements were greater than concentrations of other metals followed by those of zn and cu which are classified as trace elements however concentrations of se which is also an essential trace element in surface water were relatively low median concentrations of ni 3 00 µg l which is not included in the environmental quality standards for surface water ministry of environment protection of the people s republic of china 2002 were greater than concentrations of most of the studied metals metals considered to be priority pollutants in china including cr ⅵ pb as cd and hg were present at relatively small concentrations for example cd and hg concentrations were 10 to 100 fold less than those of other metals 3 2 evaluation of composite hq of metals based on the calculated mcr and hi values all samples could be categorized into one of four groups fig 1 the percentages of samples in groups i and ii were 54 2 and 30 2 respectively while the percentage of samples in group iii was 15 6 these results indicated that 69 8 of samples exceeded the level of concern based on the potential for the observed metal concentrations to cause adverse effects group iii could be further divided into samples that are hazardous based on composite metals group iiib 6 1 or a single metal group iiia 9 5 in general both the hi and n or mcr and n were significantly positively correlated fig s3 this suggests that the need for cumulative hazard assessment increases with the number of metals considered for aquatic environments in addition mcr values demonstrated that when the chemical by chemical approach mhq was applied to assess the risks of metal mixtures on average 46 6 of toxicities of samples were missed by overlooking the toxicity attributed to co exposure during risk assessments the results underscore that it is important to study combined effects of metals distributions of hqs of metals indicated that the maximum hq values of individual metals in 781 samples collected from tai lake were 1 0 except for hg se and as fig 2 based on the number of samples in which the single metal hq exceeded 1 0 in the tier i assessment the order of the top five metals was cu cd pb ni and zn followed by fe and mn fig s4 greater hazards posed by cu and zn were consistent with previous results fu et al 2016 which predicted that approximately 99 9 and 50 7 of aquatic organisms would be adversely affected by cu and zn respectively in tai lake surface water pb and cd have been classified as priority pollutants in ambient waters in china and in the u s epa and reportedly pose risks to organisms in tai lake jiang et al 2012 lei et al 2016 in addition ni poses the greatest hazard to humans via ingestion due to relatively great concentrations in tai lake liang et al 2011 furthermore zn and cu have potential effects on human health when they co occur with other metals fu et al 2013 little attention has previously been paid to concentrations of fe and mn in water or the hazards they pose according to the results of present study fe may have adverse effects on organisms because the chronic bm for mn is not based on toxic potencies but on other characteristics mn exposure may not pose a risk for aquatic organisms u s epa 1986 thus in tai lake mixtures of cu pb cd ni and zn were considered as the combination with the greatest potential to cause adverse effects and should be given the greatest priority based on the chronic ssd curves of the five metals crustaceans especially cladocerans such as daphnids were the most susceptible to the effects of metals fig s5 previous analyses of ssd curves based on acute metal exposures indicated that invertebrates were more sensitive than vertebrates xin et al 2015 which was consistent with the results of the chronic ssd curves in this study therefore d magna and m macrocopa were selected as test species to explore the multi generational effects of cu pb ni cd and zn mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations which could provide insights into the adverse effects of prevailing metal exposure states on sensitive species in tai lake 3 3 multi generational effects on growth metals influenced rates of survival of d magna and m macrocopa mortality followed a concentration response pattern and was directly proportional to the concentrations of metals in mixtures table s3 results of the exposure groups indicated that resistance of d magna to metals weakened whereby offspring became more sensitive however survival rates of later generations of m macrocopa in the remaining treatments increased and were significantly different from the trend observed for d magna potential tolerance and recovery trends of m macrocopa were previously demonstrated in a few life history variables gama flores et al 2017 results of a previous study indicated that feeding behavior of d magna was affected by exposure to small concentrations of multiple metals ni zn cu and cd although the concentrations were 27 63 times less than concentrations that are lethal lari et al 2017 in the present study growth of d magna was affected by mixtures of five metals compared with other endpoints body length showed a stronger dose response relationship over three generations fig 3 a table s4 body lengths of adult female f0 d magna were 9 85 38 58 less than those of the control group which indicated that exposure to the greatest concentration had the most significant effect at the greatest concentration the number of molts in the f1 generation of d magna was significantly less p 0 001 than that in the f0 generation fig s6b and were inversely proportional to the concentrations of metal mixtures fig 3b this result was consistent with results of a previous study which reported that growth of d magna was inversely proportional to concentrations of binary mixtures of metals brun et al 2019 significant multi generational effects on growth of m macrocopa were observed compared with the control tolerance of m macrocopa became greater in successive generations fig 3c d table s5 when exposed to the greatest concentration of mixture of metals body lengths of females belonging to f0 and f1 generations were significantly less p 0 001 the opposite effect was observed in the f2 generation exposed to the same concentration p 0 05 in addition during exposure to the medium concentration the inhibition of body length observed in the f2 generation decreased when compared to the body lengths in the f0 generation p 0 01 fig s6a in the f0 generation a stronger dose response relationship was observed for the number of molts which was significantly inversely proportional to the exposure concentration fig 3d however the number of molts of f1 and f2 generations were similar to that of the control the results above are consistent with the results of a previous study gama flores et al 2007 which showed that survival rate and reproduction of m macrocopa were inversely proportion to the exposure duration and the cdcl2 concentrations to which they were exposed all results demonstrated that the toxicity of mixture of metals was caused by the combined effect of intensity concentration and duration time of exposure 3 4 multi generational effects on reproduction results of previous studies have demonstrated that several measurement endpoints of offspring were affected when adult female d magna were exposed to a single metal guan and wang 2006 similar effects were observed for m macrocopa gama flores et al 2017 thereby indicating that not only survival rates but also reproductive rates were affected when individuals were continuously exposed to cd in this study effects of metal mixtures on reproduction appeared to be greater than that on the growth especially in terms of the significant decrease in the number of offspring total numbers of offspring per adult female d magna produced within 21 days exhibited a strong dose response relationship and was inversely proportional to concentrations in all treatments fig 4 table s6 as a result of the exposure to the maximum concentration total numbers of offspring were reduced by 58 3 82 6 and 23 8 in f0 f1 and f2 generations respectively compared with the controls when exposed to the greatest concentration the endpoint was reduced by 56 8 in the f1 generation compared with the f0 generation fig s6c age at first spawning of d magna gradually increased in successive generations under the same exposure fig s6d generation times in the f0 and f1 generations also decreased significantly following exposure to the greatest concentration p 0 001 these results are consistent with previously reported results biesinger et al 1986 statistically significant changes were also observed for m macrocopa exposed to multiple metals compared with the controls fig 4 table s7 the number of offspring produced by m macrocopa exposed to multiple metals was lower than that by the controls this endpoint significantly differed between each generation especially for the medium exposure group wherein it increased gradually with successive generations fig s6c at the medium concentration a significant delay in age of first reproduction was observed for the f0 generation p 0 05 a significant decline in the age of first reproduction for f2 m macrocopa was also observed in individuals exposed to the least concentration compared with the controls p 0 01 hazardous effects induced by metal mixtures were observed on generation times of m macrocopa the generation times of m macrocopa in f0 and f2 generations exposed to the medium and greatest concentrations of metal mixtures were significantly less than those of the control p 0 05 in this study the finite rate of increase λ which is used to evaluate the development of a population over a longer time period an et al 2009 exhibited similar trends as the intrinsic rate of population growth for both species a difference in the intrinsic rate of population growth of d magna was primarily observed in the f1 generation this indicator was significantly weak in the least and medium exposure groups compared with the control group p 0 01 fig 4 table s6 the same reduction occurred in f0 m macrocopa p 0 001 fig 4 but the intrinsic rate of population growth significantly increased as a function of generation in m macrocopa in the medium exposure group i e by 8 8 in the f2 generation compared with the f0 generation fig s6f table s7 all reproduction endpoints showed that m macrocopa exhibited greater capacity to recover but the response to adverse effects was earlier than d magna under the same conditions environmental concentrations of the five metals were mostly higher than the concentrations used in the multi generation experiment and it is important to note that there are more than five metals in tai lake thus it is speculated that effects of multiple metals on these two cladocerans may be more critical in the actual environment and other organisms would also be adversely affected 3 5 multi generational effects on population development to visually show the long term effects of exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations of metal mixtures on population development demographic analysis models were constructed using a leslie matrix based on multi generational toxicity data of d magna and m macrocopa the initial population size was set as 10 for simulation of population dynamics analysis predicted only the number of d magna after three years and m macrocopa after two years due to their rapid reproduction rate the contribution to sensitivity of the dominant eigenvalue i e the infinite rate of increase was predominantly related to the survival rate whereas fecundity did not contribute significantly population growth showed that different effects of metal mixtures on individual level endpoints could lead to attenuation at the population level over the next two or three years fig 5 fig s7 the logarithmic value of the number of d magna would be significantly lower than that of the control groups by 2 40 25 76 in three years after exposure to multiple metals and the adverse effects would strengthen in successive generations a stage structured population analysis based on mortality and life history traits revealed deteriorating groups had aging populations within the cumulative 1 2 and 3 years proportions of adult aged population 14 21 days in f2 d magna each treatment over 3 years were as follows medium 0 85 least 0 75 blank 0 32 however no maturity populations with stable reproduction occurred in f1 d magna exposed to the greatest concentration multi generational exposure to greater concentrations of mixtures of metals were likely to cause greater effects on populations of d magna and even cause extinction similarly development of m macrocopa would also be affected by metal cocktails and the influence on population size seemed to be more dramatic than for populations of d magna when only one generation was compared however the impact would be weakened in successive generations specifically the logarithmic value of the population size of f0 m macrocopa was predicted to decline by 17 04 25 45 over two years by exposure to mixture of metals compared with controls in contrast an increase compared with that in the blank group was predicted in f2 population exposed to the medium concentration a number of scientific reports indicate that the densities of cladocerans in water bodies are declining barbiero et al 2019 and daphnia is no longer the dominant species in water bodies while moina is gradually predominant which is consistent with results of the multi generational experiment in this study the reason for the difference between the two species could be due to the shorter life cycle of m macrocopa compared to that of d magna and the former can produce more offspring within relatively short periods which may result in offspring sharing the toxic effects of metals entering the body of the adult females due to the sensitivities to various substances and a number of parameters that can be measured simultaneously cladocerans are considered as effective tools for toxicity assessment and monitoring of water quality zein et al 2014 the present study shows that adverse effects of metal mixtures on water flea cannot be ignored despite the harmful effect of individual metals on organisms is negligible in most scenarios multi generational effects showed that continuous exposure to low concentrations of multiple metals could lead to large population losses for dominant aquatic species m macrocopa stage based structure analysis for d magna indicated the proportion of the adult aged population changed dramatically under continuous exposure to greater concentrations of multiple metals within several years m macrocopa appeared to be more responsive to chemical stressors compared with d magna which suggested the potential use of moina as important biomarker in water quality assessment reproduction endpoints especially the total number of offspring appeared to be more sensitive to exposure of cocktails so the densities of cladocerans in water bodies could be an effective parameter indicating possible detrimental effects induced by toxic chemicals dodson et al 1995 however the metal monitoring results to which we used in our analysis most likely underestimate actual exposures because it is difficult to capture transient metal peak concentrations sexual reproduction in water flea and the associated production of resting eggs allows them to survive unfavorable environmental conditions issa et al 2021 which might result in overestimation of ecotoxicological risks posed by metal cocktails in surface waters speciation of the metals in tai lake is much more complicated than that represented in this experiment and toxicities can be affected by chemical properties of water bodies such as hardness carlson a 1984 further research should be performed to investigate the effects of different water chemistry characteristics on bioavailability and toxicity of metal mixture as well as the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects induced by metal mixtures on organisms to link laboratory data to situation in the field relationships between resting egg production and end points of interest e g survivorship rate fecundity can be incorporated into a population model besides whole life stage data on population structure and development based on density dependent growth are needed due complexities of natural environments finally more multi generational studies are recommended since potential effects may be overlooked in single generation experiments 4 conclusions this study investigated distributions of multiple metals in tai lake integrated individual level measurements from multi generational experiments and a simple demographic model to predict the long term effects of metal cocktails at environmental concentrations on sensitive populations our results showed that co exposure to mixtures of cu pb cd ni and zn at environmental concentrations caused a series of adverse multi generational effects on growth reproduction and population dynamics of sensitive species d magna and m macrocopa indicating that adverse effects caused by environmentally relevant concentrations of metal cocktails in tai lake should not be ignored these findings highlight the immense value of population density of cladocerans as effective indicator for toxicity assessment and monitoring of water quality the framework presented in the present study could address the challenge of assessing the hazards of metal mixtures in aquatic environments and the associated large datasets and facilitate the consideration of the potential toxicities of metal mixtures based on environmentally relevant concentrations in risk assessment activities this integrated approach can be

multiple hazardous metals a key challenge in elucidating risks arises from the large number of potential combinations and concentrations of metals in the environment to address the challenge the maximum cumulative ratio mcr concept has been proposed price and han 2011 tiered approaches that apply the mcr can identify combined exposures in cases where potential risks would be ignored and provide a quantitative measure of the magnitude of the toxicity that is underestimated by single substance assessments mcr methodology has been applied to crop protection products in surface waters in the u s vallotton and price 2016 tai lake chinese taihu is a shallow lake located in a densely populated urbanized and industrialized area south of the yangtze delta in china due to rapid industrialization and intensification of agriculture in the watershed surrounding tai lake various contaminants such as nutrients and metals have been introduced into its surface water zhai et al 2010 urban effluents from metal processing plating and electronics industries are dominant sources of metals to tai lake liang et al 2011 long term exposures to metals influence capacities of populations to cope with additional environmental stressors ríos arana et al 2007 therefore the presence of multiple metal contaminants might pose threats to aquatic organisms in tai lake however most published data are based on concentrations of chemicals that are greater than those detected in freshwater systems therefore studies considering effects of metals on aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations are required dietrich et al 2010a in this study mcr was used to identify whether single or multiple metals dominated the adverse effects on aquatic organisms in tai lake and the adverse effects of multi metal mixtures at environmentally realistic concentrations were studied the water flea is a common crustacean invertebrate in freshwater systems this type of zooplankton grazes on algae and forms the base of the secondary producer food chain chen et al 2014 testing more than two successive generations provides more information regarding possible chronic population level effects of metals dietrich et al 2010b a multi generational study over three generations using two model organisms the cladocerans daphnia magna and moina macrocopa was conducted the primary aim of the present study was to identify the real culprit causing adverse effects by multiple metals on organisms in an aquatic environment and investigate the effects of co exposure to the most hazardous metals at environmental concentrations on growth reproduction and population dynamics in the two sensitive species the secondary aim of the paper was to screen the most sensitive parameter of water flea as a candidate indicator indicating possible detrimental effects induced by multiple toxic chemicals therefore results of this study allowed integration of effects of metal mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations in risk assessment frameworks 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and analysis samples of water 500 ml were collected twice in september 2019 wet season and january 2020 dry season from 52 sampling points in tai lake fig s1 in the supporting information temperature dissolved oxygen turbidity electrical conductivity and ph of water samples were measured on site using ysi portable meters 6600v2 4 ecosense ohio usa then water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm microporous membranes and packed in polyethylene bottles that were pre washed according to national standard water quality reference hj 493 2009 ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2009 after sampling samples were preserved by adjusting ph to 1 2 by adding 5 ml concentrated nitric acid hno3 to 500 ml water sample prior to quantification of copper cu lead pb cadmium cd and zinc zn concentrations while those for quantification of hexavalent chromium cr ⅵ were preserved with naoh ph 8 9 concentrations of cu pb cd zn and cr ⅵ were determined by use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms following methods set by national standards hj 700 2014 ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2014 analyses were performed on blank and duplicate samples and a standard recovery test was used to determine the accuracy of the analysis the relative deviation of the duplicate samples was 6 50 for all batch treatments and the recovery rates of each element were in the range 87 105 which satisfied the quality requirements 2 2 chronic toxicity benchmarks and metal concentrations in tai lake in addition to data obtained for 104 samples concentrations of metals were obtained from the published literature by searching using the keywords tai lake and metals data were also provided by the jiangsu environmental monitoring center aquatic benchmarks bms are based on the most sensitive toxicity endpoint of the distribution for each aquatic taxa and support baseline risk assessments of individual metals u s environmental protection agency 2019 the use of chronic bms is optimal for long term protection of aquatic organisms water chemistry characteristics such as ph organic carbon content hardness as well as other edaphic factors and biological species result in diverse bms in various regions carlson a 1984 therefore chronic bms of metals that have been established through quality screening and data standardization for the tai lake were selected first followed by bms for china and finally the values set by other agencies such as the u s environmental protection agency u s epa if the values derived for tai lake and china differed more than five fold the geometric mean of the two bms was used as the ultimate threshold table 1 2 3 methodology for risk assessment of metals a tiered mcr approach based on dose additive models was used to determine whether it was necessary to perform a detailed cumulative risk assessment for organisms that are simultaneously exposed to multiple metals price and han 2011 hazard quotients hq for individual metals were calculated by dividing the metal concentration by the bm eq 1 the hazard index hi was calculated as the sum of individual hqs eq 2 the mcr for exposure to n pollutants was then calculated eqs 3 and 4 1 h q i c i b m i 2 hi h q i 3 mhq max h q i 4 mc r i h i i mh q i where c i μg l is the measured environmental concentration of the i th metal in surface water bm i denotes the chronic benchmark of the i th metal hq i is the hazard quotient of the i th metal hi is the sum of the individual values of hq i and mhq is the maximum of hq i based on results of mcr and hi for each sample four groups of combined exposure were identified price et al 2012 each group indicates the potential hazard and proposes relevant management strategies group i at least individual metals are of concern mhq 1 group ii risks posed by individual metals and multiple metals can be ignored hi 1 group iii risks posed by individual metals could be ignored however the combined effect is a concern mhq 1 and hi 1 this group was divided into two subgroups group iiia toxicity of the combined exposure was dominated by one metal mcr 2 group iiib toxicity of combined exposure was accounted for by several metals mcr 2 hqs were calculated for each metal in mixtures based on the mcr during tier i in tier ii sums of samples with an hq 1 0 were calculated for each metal to identify the possible combination of metals that posed the greatest risk to organisms subsequently species that were more sensitive to metals were identified based on the species sensitivity distributions ssds which were developed following our previously reported method sun et al 2020 the mcr approach can be used to investigate the magnitudes of toxicity underestimation by assessments of hazard based on individual metals price and han 2011 the proportion of the toxicity that is overlooked for each sample can be estimated eq 5 5 missed toxicity 1 1 mc r i 2 4 multi generation experiment based on results of the mcr mixtures of cu pb nickel ni cd and zn were selected to be tested for multi generational effects on the most susceptible organisms cladocerans stock solutions of pbcl2 cucl2 2h2o zncl2 cdcl2 2 5h2o and nicl2 2 5h2o all purity 99 00 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa were prepared as sources of pb cu zn cd and ni respectively two cladocerans d magna and m macrocopa were selected as test species for the multi generation experiment based on the distribution of environmental concentrations of each metal table 1 organisms were exposed to one of the three concentrations least medium and greatest table 2 in addition tap water was aerated for 3 days and was used as a negative control to which responses could be referenced basic physical and chemical parameters of experimental water samples were as follows ph 7 60 0 14 conductivity 300 9 80 μs cm dissolved oxygen 8 15 0 23 mg l alkalinity 81 25 2 17 mg l caco3 and hardness 155 50 4 95 mg l caco3 experiments were conducted according to the organization for economic co operation and development oecd guideline 211 oecd guidelines for the testing of chemicals 2012 further details regarding exposures to mixtures of metals are provided in the supporting information 2 5 leslie matrix and demographic analysis the leslie matrix is a matriarchal based model developed by leslie 1945 and lewis 1977 it can project population growth over time based on the fecundity and survival rates of individual life stage classes in this study stage specific survivorship and fecundity data were obtained from the multi generation experiment in a leslie matrix analysis the life history information is organized in a projection matrix a eq 6 6 a f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 s 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 5 0 where fi represents the total numbers of offspring per adult female produced at stage i and si represents the survival rate from stage i 1 to stage i the number of females at each stage at time t was calculated eq 7 7 n t n 1 t n 2 t n 3 t n 4 t n 5 t n 6 t t where nij is the number of organisms of stage i at the start of day j the numbers for the following days were determined eq 8 8 n t 1 a n t the intrinsic rate of population growth r is an integrative indicator that is important for measuring the instantaneous rate of population development it is the natural logarithm of the largest eigenvalue λ of matrix a eq 9 9 r ln λ r can also be calculated using the survivorship and reproduction data eq 10 10 r ln r 0 r 0 x l x m x where r0 is the net reproduce rate lx is the survive rate of individuals reaching age x and mx is the average number of live offspring produced per female of age x during the time interval x to x 1 the leslie matrix distinguishes various life stages and the same r value was obtained through equations 9 and 10 when setting one day as the life stage of test organisms monte carlo type stochastic simulations based on survival rate normal distribution were used to represent the 95 confidence interval ci based on 1000 iterations however the results of monte carlo type stochastic simulations were hardly different from values predicted using the leslie matrix thus could not be effectively displayed 2 6 statistical analysis basic descriptive statistical analyses were performed using microsoft excel version 2016 microsoft redmond usa and data were processed using spss software version 22 0 spss inc usa statistical drawing was performed using graphpad prism graphpad prism development core team http www graphpad com scientific software prism monte carlo type stochastic simulations were employed using poptools http www poptools org for a probabilistic estimation of population prediction based on the variability of the input parameters differences in growth and reproduction parameters were determined using one way analysis of variance anova assuming normal distributions based on the shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variances was assessed by use of levene s test then significant differences were tested using tukey s honestly significant difference least significance difference lsd method which was applied for multiple comparisons among means for data that were not normally distributed logarithmic transformation was applied and data were then rechecked for normality levels of significance were set to p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of metals in tai lake surface water dissolved oxygen concentrations of water fluctuated within the ranges 3 48 13 89 and 8 91 11 08 mg l during the wet and dry seasons respectively similarly the ph also varied substantially ranging from 6 93 to 8 52 at 52 sampling sites and was generally high in the wet season for electrical conductivity similar variations were observed among different seasons ranging from 103 30 to 592 00 μs cm concentrations of the five metals in tai lake varied between seasons and among locations tables s1 and s2 concentrations of cu in the wet and dry seasons were 0 68 11 and 1 52 5 4 μg l respectively concentrations of zn at most locations were 30 μg l except for a few points where the concentration was 50 μg l concentrations of cd were similar during wet and dry seasons with mean concentrations of 0 044 and 0 049 μg l respectively during the wet season 33 of concentrations of pb were less than the limit of detection concentrations of cr ⅵ were 0 71 10 5 and 1 53 3 73 μg l during the wet and dry seasons respectively concentrations of cu zn and cr ⅵ in the wet season were generally greater than those during the dry season the opposite trend was observed for distributions of concentrations of pb emissions from mechanical manufacturing industries were possibly the main source of metals in tai lake basin during the wet season while metals accumulated in environmental media were the main source during the dry season yao et al 2014 differences in sources of metals might result in different distributions of the five metals in tai lake when combined with recent values published in the literature 11 metals were detected in 781 samples from tai lake the order of median concentrations in tai lake was as follows iron fe manganese mn zn cu ni pb cr ⅵ arsenic as selenium se cd mercury hg table 1 fig s2a concentrations of the 11 metals were generally skewed and were best described by a log normal distribution fig s2b l in tai lake concentrations of fe and mn which are generally regarded as macro elements were greater than concentrations of other metals followed by those of zn and cu which are classified as trace elements however concentrations of se which is also an essential trace element in surface water were relatively low median concentrations of ni 3 00 µg l which is not included in the environmental quality standards for surface water ministry of environment protection of the people s republic of china 2002 were greater than concentrations of most of the studied metals metals considered to be priority pollutants in china including cr ⅵ pb as cd and hg were present at relatively small concentrations for example cd and hg concentrations were 10 to 100 fold less than those of other metals 3 2 evaluation of composite hq of metals based on the calculated mcr and hi values all samples could be categorized into one of four groups fig 1 the percentages of samples in groups i and ii were 54 2 and 30 2 respectively while the percentage of samples in group iii was 15 6 these results indicated that 69 8 of samples exceeded the level of concern based on the potential for the observed metal concentrations to cause adverse effects group iii could be further divided into samples that are hazardous based on composite metals group iiib 6 1 or a single metal group iiia 9 5 in general both the hi and n or mcr and n were significantly positively correlated fig s3 this suggests that the need for cumulative hazard assessment increases with the number of metals considered for aquatic environments in addition mcr values demonstrated that when the chemical by chemical approach mhq was applied to assess the risks of metal mixtures on average 46 6 of toxicities of samples were missed by overlooking the toxicity attributed to co exposure during risk assessments the results underscore that it is important to study combined effects of metals distributions of hqs of metals indicated that the maximum hq values of individual metals in 781 samples collected from tai lake were 1 0 except for hg se and as fig 2 based on the number of samples in which the single metal hq exceeded 1 0 in the tier i assessment the order of the top five metals was cu cd pb ni and zn followed by fe and mn fig s4 greater hazards posed by cu and zn were consistent with previous results fu et al 2016 which predicted that approximately 99 9 and 50 7 of aquatic organisms would be adversely affected by cu and zn respectively in tai lake surface water pb and cd have been classified as priority pollutants in ambient waters in china and in the u s epa and reportedly pose risks to organisms in tai lake jiang et al 2012 lei et al 2016 in addition ni poses the greatest hazard to humans via ingestion due to relatively great concentrations in tai lake liang et al 2011 furthermore zn and cu have potential effects on human health when they co occur with other metals fu et al 2013 little attention has previously been paid to concentrations of fe and mn in water or the hazards they pose according to the results of present study fe may have adverse effects on organisms because the chronic bm for mn is not based on toxic potencies but on other characteristics mn exposure may not pose a risk for aquatic organisms u s epa 1986 thus in tai lake mixtures of cu pb cd ni and zn were considered as the combination with the greatest potential to cause adverse effects and should be given the greatest priority based on the chronic ssd curves of the five metals crustaceans especially cladocerans such as daphnids were the most susceptible to the effects of metals fig s5 previous analyses of ssd curves based on acute metal exposures indicated that invertebrates were more sensitive than vertebrates xin et al 2015 which was consistent with the results of the chronic ssd curves in this study therefore d magna and m macrocopa were selected as test species to explore the multi generational effects of cu pb ni cd and zn mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations which could provide insights into the adverse effects of prevailing metal exposure states on sensitive species in tai lake 3 3 multi generational effects on growth metals influenced rates of survival of d magna and m macrocopa mortality followed a concentration response pattern and was directly proportional to the concentrations of metals in mixtures table s3 results of the exposure groups indicated that resistance of d magna to metals weakened whereby offspring became more sensitive however survival rates of later generations of m macrocopa in the remaining treatments increased and were significantly different from the trend observed for d magna potential tolerance and recovery trends of m macrocopa were previously demonstrated in a few life history variables gama flores et al 2017 results of a previous study indicated that feeding behavior of d magna was affected by exposure to small concentrations of multiple metals ni zn cu and cd although the concentrations were 27 63 times less than concentrations that are lethal lari et al 2017 in the present study growth of d magna was affected by mixtures of five metals compared with other endpoints body length showed a stronger dose response relationship over three generations fig 3 a table s4 body lengths of adult female f0 d magna were 9 85 38 58 less than those of the control group which indicated that exposure to the greatest concentration had the most significant effect at the greatest concentration the number of molts in the f1 generation of d magna was significantly less p 0 001 than that in the f0 generation fig s6b and were inversely proportional to the concentrations of metal mixtures fig 3b this result was consistent with results of a previous study which reported that growth of d magna was inversely proportional to concentrations of binary mixtures of metals brun et al 2019 significant multi generational effects on growth of m macrocopa were observed compared with the control tolerance of m macrocopa became greater in successive generations fig 3c d table s5 when exposed to the greatest concentration of mixture of metals body lengths of females belonging to f0 and f1 generations were significantly less p 0 001 the opposite effect was observed in the f2 generation exposed to the same concentration p 0 05 in addition during exposure to the medium concentration the inhibition of body length observed in the f2 generation decreased when compared to the body lengths in the f0 generation p 0 01 fig s6a in the f0 generation a stronger dose response relationship was observed for the number of molts which was significantly inversely proportional to the exposure concentration fig 3d however the number of molts of f1 and f2 generations were similar to that of the control the results above are consistent with the results of a previous study gama flores et al 2007 which showed that survival rate and reproduction of m macrocopa were inversely proportion to the exposure duration and the cdcl2 concentrations to which they were exposed all results demonstrated that the toxicity of mixture of metals was caused by the combined effect of intensity concentration and duration time of exposure 3 4 multi generational effects on reproduction results of previous studies have demonstrated that several measurement endpoints of offspring were affected when adult female d magna were exposed to a single metal guan and wang 2006 similar effects were observed for m macrocopa gama flores et al 2017 thereby indicating that not only survival rates but also reproductive rates were affected when individuals were continuously exposed to cd in this study effects of metal mixtures on reproduction appeared to be greater than that on the growth especially in terms of the significant decrease in the number of offspring total numbers of offspring per adult female d magna produced within 21 days exhibited a strong dose response relationship and was inversely proportional to concentrations in all treatments fig 4 table s6 as a result of the exposure to the maximum concentration total numbers of offspring were reduced by 58 3 82 6 and 23 8 in f0 f1 and f2 generations respectively compared with the controls when exposed to the greatest concentration the endpoint was reduced by 56 8 in the f1 generation compared with the f0 generation fig s6c age at first spawning of d magna gradually increased in successive generations under the same exposure fig s6d generation times in the f0 and f1 generations also decreased significantly following exposure to the greatest concentration p 0 001 these results are consistent with previously reported results biesinger et al 1986 statistically significant changes were also observed for m macrocopa exposed to multiple metals compared with the controls fig 4 table s7 the number of offspring produced by m macrocopa exposed to multiple metals was lower than that by the controls this endpoint significantly differed between each generation especially for the medium exposure group wherein it increased gradually with successive generations fig s6c at the medium concentration a significant delay in age of first reproduction was observed for the f0 generation p 0 05 a significant decline in the age of first reproduction for f2 m macrocopa was also observed in individuals exposed to the least concentration compared with the controls p 0 01 hazardous effects induced by metal mixtures were observed on generation times of m macrocopa the generation times of m macrocopa in f0 and f2 generations exposed to the medium and greatest concentrations of metal mixtures were significantly less than those of the control p 0 05 in this study the finite rate of increase λ which is used to evaluate the development of a population over a longer time period an et al 2009 exhibited similar trends as the intrinsic rate of population growth for both species a difference in the intrinsic rate of population growth of d magna was primarily observed in the f1 generation this indicator was significantly weak in the least and medium exposure groups compared with the control group p 0 01 fig 4 table s6 the same reduction occurred in f0 m macrocopa p 0 001 fig 4 but the intrinsic rate of population growth significantly increased as a function of generation in m macrocopa in the medium exposure group i e by 8 8 in the f2 generation compared with the f0 generation fig s6f table s7 all reproduction endpoints showed that m macrocopa exhibited greater capacity to recover but the response to adverse effects was earlier than d magna under the same conditions environmental concentrations of the five metals were mostly higher than the concentrations used in the multi generation experiment and it is important to note that there are more than five metals in tai lake thus it is speculated that effects of multiple metals on these two cladocerans may be more critical in the actual environment and other organisms would also be adversely affected 3 5 multi generational effects on population development to visually show the long term effects of exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations of metal mixtures on population development demographic analysis models were constructed using a leslie matrix based on multi generational toxicity data of d magna and m macrocopa the initial population size was set as 10 for simulation of population dynamics analysis predicted only the number of d magna after three years and m macrocopa after two years due to their rapid reproduction rate the contribution to sensitivity of the dominant eigenvalue i e the infinite rate of increase was predominantly related to the survival rate whereas fecundity did not contribute significantly population growth showed that different effects of metal mixtures on individual level endpoints could lead to attenuation at the population level over the next two or three years fig 5 fig s7 the logarithmic value of the number of d magna would be significantly lower than that of the control groups by 2 40 25 76 in three years after exposure to multiple metals and the adverse effects would strengthen in successive generations a stage structured population analysis based on mortality and life history traits revealed deteriorating groups had aging populations within the cumulative 1 2 and 3 years proportions of adult aged population 14 21 days in f2 d magna each treatment over 3 years were as follows medium 0 85 least 0 75 blank 0 32 however no maturity populations with stable reproduction occurred in f1 d magna exposed to the greatest concentration multi generational exposure to greater concentrations of mixtures of metals were likely to cause greater effects on populations of d magna and even cause extinction similarly development of m macrocopa would also be affected by metal cocktails and the influence on population size seemed to be more dramatic than for populations of d magna when only one generation was compared however the impact would be weakened in successive generations specifically the logarithmic value of the population size of f0 m macrocopa was predicted to decline by 17 04 25 45 over two years by exposure to mixture of metals compared with controls in contrast an increase compared with that in the blank group was predicted in f2 population exposed to the medium concentration a number of scientific reports indicate that the densities of cladocerans in water bodies are declining barbiero et al 2019 and daphnia is no longer the dominant species in water bodies while moina is gradually predominant which is consistent with results of the multi generational experiment in this study the reason for the difference between the two species could be due to the shorter life cycle of m macrocopa compared to that of d magna and the former can produce more offspring within relatively short periods which may result in offspring sharing the toxic effects of metals entering the body of the adult females due to the sensitivities to various substances and a number of parameters that can be measured simultaneously cladocerans are considered as effective tools for toxicity assessment and monitoring of water quality zein et al 2014 the present study shows that adverse effects of metal mixtures on water flea cannot be ignored despite the harmful effect of individual metals on organisms is negligible in most scenarios multi generational effects showed that continuous exposure to low concentrations of multiple metals could lead to large population losses for dominant aquatic species m macrocopa stage based structure analysis for d magna indicated the proportion of the adult aged population changed dramatically under continuous exposure to greater concentrations of multiple metals within several years m macrocopa appeared to be more responsive to chemical stressors compared with d magna which suggested the potential use of moina as important biomarker in water quality assessment reproduction endpoints especially the total number of offspring appeared to be more sensitive to exposure of cocktails so the densities of cladocerans in water bodies could be an effective parameter indicating possible detrimental effects induced by toxic chemicals dodson et al 1995 however the metal monitoring results to which we used in our analysis most likely underestimate actual exposures because it is difficult to capture transient metal peak concentrations sexual reproduction in water flea and the associated production of resting eggs allows them to survive unfavorable environmental conditions issa et al 2021 which might result in overestimation of ecotoxicological risks posed by metal cocktails in surface waters speciation of the metals in tai lake is much more complicated than that represented in this experiment and toxicities can be affected by chemical properties of water bodies such as hardness carlson a 1984 further research should be performed to investigate the effects of different water chemistry characteristics on bioavailability and toxicity of metal mixture as well as the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects induced by metal mixtures on organisms to link laboratory data to situation in the field relationships between resting egg production and end points of interest e g survivorship rate fecundity can be incorporated into a population model besides whole life stage data on population structure and development based on density dependent growth are needed due complexities of natural environments finally more multi generational studies are recommended since potential effects may be overlooked in single generation experiments 4 conclusions this study investigated distributions of multiple metals in tai lake integrated individual level measurements from multi generational experiments and a simple demographic model to predict the long term effects of metal cocktails at environmental concentrations on sensitive populations our results showed that co exposure to mixtures of cu pb cd ni and zn at environmental concentrations caused a series of adverse multi generational effects on growth reproduction and population dynamics of sensitive species d magna and m macrocopa indicating that adverse effects caused by environmentally relevant concentrations of metal cocktails in tai lake should not be ignored these findings highlight the immense value of population density of cladocerans as effective indicator for toxicity assessment and monitoring of water quality the framework presented in the present study could address the challenge of assessing the hazards of metal mixtures in aquatic environments and the associated large datasets and facilitate the consideration of the potential toxicities of metal mixtures based on environmentally relevant concentrations in risk assessment activities this integrated approach can be

16951,drainages in the pearl river delta urban agglomeration prdua host vital aquatic ecosystems and face enormous pressures from human activities in one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world despite being crucial components of aquatic ecosystems the interactions and assembly processes of the protistan community are rarely explored in areas with serious anthropogenic disturbance to elucidate the mechanisms of these processes we used environmental dna sequencing of 18s rdna to investigate the influence of environmental factors and species interactions on the protistan community and its assembly in drainages of the prdua during summer the protistan community showed a high level of diversity and a marked spatial pattern in this region community assembly was driven primarily by stochastic processes based on the sloan neutral community model explaining 74 28 75 82 73 67 74 40 and 51 24 of community variations in the bj beijiang xj xijiang prd pearl river delta pre pearl river estuary areas and in total respectively meanwhile environmental variables including temperature ph dissolved oxygen transparency nutrients and land use were strongly correlated with the composition and assembly of the protistan community explaining 40 40 of variation in the protistan community furthermore the bacterial community was simultaneously analysed by the 16s rdna sequencing co occurrence network analysis revealed that species interactions within bacteria 81 41 positive or protists 82 80 positive and those between bacteria and protists 50 positive and 50 negative impacted the protistan community assembly in summary stochastic processes dominated whereas species interactions and environmental factors also played important roles in shaping the protistan communities in

agglomeration community assembly 1 introduction the pearl river delta urban agglomeration prdua is a highly developed urban agglomeration in china china is undergoing a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization during which the prdua has gradually become one of the country s most important regional units chen et al 2017a dong and xu 2019 with the concentration of urban and developed areas rapid population expansion and intense anthropogenic disturbance have put great pressure on regional ecosystems xu et al 2013 li and zhang 2019 liu et al 2019a causing a series of

urban agglomeration is a continuous area of development and therefore may have larger negative impacts on natural ecosystems due to the lack of distance between cities du et al 2016 sun et al 2018 thus the structure pattern and services of urban ecosystems are dramatically different as major urban ecosystems of the prdua aquatic ecosystems are also confronted with intense anthropogenic activities severe environmental deterioration and increasing risk of biodiversity loss çelekli et al 2016 hu et al 2019 häder et al 2020 various government projects have been undertaken to address the ecological and environmental issues facing the aquatic ecosystems of the prdua simultaneously awareness and scientific studies assessing the status of aquatic ecosystems have gradually increased in the prdua however as no quantitative evaluations have been conducted to evaluate the ecological changes or regional variations of the aquatic ecosystems during the increases in human activities and pollution the spatio temporal dynamics of aquatic biodiversity and their environmental drivers remain obscure microbial eukaryotes are essential components of aquatic ecosystems and represent the

revealed a biogeographical distribution pattern and that environmental factors can significantly affect community compositions liu et al 2018 lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 with increasing anthropogenic activity in drainages of the prdua evaluating the status of protistan communities in aquatic environments and their responses to environmental factors is essential to the development of ecological management strategies in the prdua protists are often neglected in aquatic ecosystem studies due to difficulties of measurement in traditional investigations traditionally biodiversity investigations of protists have been based on taxonomic identification using morphological characters liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 a large number of microbial species are not identifiable through microscopy and the difficulty of identifying species morphologically impedes the application of conventional methods to microeukaryotic communities nagarkar et al 2018 potter et al 1997 moreover traditional surveys are extremely time consuming have low effectiveness and place high demands on trained taxonomists fortunately environmental dna edna sequencing methods such as high throughput sequencing hts of the 18s ribosomal dna rdna region most often of the v4 and v9 hypervariable regions provides a potential solution for monitoring of microeukaryotes including protists giner et al 2020 martín et al 2020 obiol et al 2020 nonetheless the methodologies of hts combined with dna barcoding have a few limitations in biodiversity monitoring e g quantitative biases potential analytical errors lack of standards and estimating biases from dna extraction and pcr amplification which restricts our understanding of microeukaryotic community dynamics and functions mcgovern et al 2018 smith et al 2017 yeh et al 2018 despite this hts methods do offer dependable information in the context of ecological interpretations piwosz et al 2020 accordingly hts can be applied for studies on the relationships between microbial communities and environmental variables furthermore hts of edna metabarcoding can support more complete descriptions of protists enabling comprehensive and detailed analyses of protistan communities from environmental samples several ecological community theories have emerged to interpret the processes shaping community composition four process classes are thought to impact the patterns of community composition and diversity at the most general level i e selection among individuals of different species ecological drift dispersal and speciation vallend 2016 vellend and agrawal 2010 an ecological community is a dynamic and complex system controlled by various deterministic and stochastic components related to ecological processes ning et al 2019 zhou and ning 2017 generally deterministic and stochastic processes work together in the assembly of microbial communities i e the mechanisms that drive the diversity succession function biogeography and distribution of microbial communities bahram et al 2016 chase 2010 graham et al 2017 gravel et al 2006 hubbell 2001 stegen et al 2016 the former states that niche based theories including biotic e g predation mutualism trade offs facilitation and competition and abiotic environmental factors e g temperature ph and salinity drive microbial community variations liu et al 2015a wei et al 2016 the latter states that neutral based theories including birth death speciation limited dispersal and drift determine microbial community patterns chen et al 2017b 2019 zhou and ning 2017 understanding microbial community assembly and quantifying the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes are crucial for predicting how communities will respond to environmental variation and for clarifying ecological processes human activities and environmental pollution in the prdua aquatic ecosystem have seriously disturbed the microeukaryotic community at present however microeukaryotic community assembly remains poorly understood especially the protistan community in this study 18s rdna sequencing was employed to profile protists along the drainages of the prdua we aimed to determine i the composition and diversity of protistan communities in drainages of the prdua ii the dominant mechanism shaping the assembly of protistan communities namely stochastic or deterministic processes and iii the influences of environmental variables and species interactions on the protistan community the results elucidate the distribution patterns and community assembly process of protists which are crucial to understanding microbe driven ecosystem processes and functions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and edna sample collection the studied aquatic ecosystem

processes to protistan community assembly the sloan neutral community model ncm was employed to predict the relationships between asv detection frequencies and their relative abundance across the metacommunity sloan et al 2006 the total fit to the neutral model was indicated by the parameter r2 based on whether the asvs occurred within neutral partition less frequently than below partition or more frequently than above partition the 95 confidence intervals of the ncm predictions all asvs were divided into three groups non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination based on bray curtis similarity was used to analyze deviations in the distributions of the three partitions from the ncm predictions the mantel test was performed to compare the responses of these partitions to

of the sample with the fewest sequences 17 762 for downstream analysis table s2 rarefication curves approached a plateau confirming that adequate sequencing depth was achieved fig 2 a prd showed the highest diversity and pre the lowest diversity based on the shannon index fig 2b at the phylum level the dominant protists were ciliophora 42 23 ochrophyta 28 45 chlorophyta 12 88 cryptophyta 7 76 dinoflagellata 3 26 perkinsea 2 19 and opalozoa 1 46 respectively fig 2c at the genus level the dominant protists were strobilidiidae g x tintinnidium skeletonema cryptomonas cyclotella and askenasia which constituted 11 75 6 75 5 32 4 60 3 42 and 2 77 of the total number of sequences respectively for the 16s rrna gene 2 756 358 high quality sequences of bacteria were obtained from 54 samples

composition of communities among the four prdua drainages r2 0 348 p 0 001 table 1 multiple comparison analysis suggested significant separation between all pairwise groups we further identified family level indicator taxa associated with each group using the random forest model the out of bag error was 0 indicating good classification performance of this model among the families dinophyceae

chrysophyceae clade f dujardinidae polar centric mediophyceae and sandonidae were the most abundant in xj families such as mast 12c x basal cryptophyceae 1 monomastigaceae cryptomonadales x cryptophyceae xx mast 12 xx and raphidophyceae xx were enriched in prd whereas strobilidiidae f strombidiidae tintinnidiidae spirofilidae perkinsida xx and sessilida were enriched in pre figure s1 3 3 patterns and drivers of protistan community composition the cca results showed that total variation was 1 235 and the explanatory variables accounted for 58 2 of total variance adjusted variation was 40 1 the first and second axes modelled 26 4 and 12 89 of total variance of the protistan community respectively environmental variables nno3 explaining 13 2 of total variation transparency 5 5

6 significantly affected the protistan community 499 permutation testing fig 3 a the environmental variable nno3 had the most powerful effect on the spatial variations of protistan communities in all samples notably nno3 was positively correlated with the first axis of canonical correspondence in which pre showed the highest value in terms of protistan composition some taxa of ciliophora i e strobilidiidae f strombidiidae tintinnidiidae spirofilidae and sessilida and perkinsea i e perkinsida xx were differentially abundant in pre figure s1 correlation analysis between these differentially abundant taxa and environmental variables confirmed that nno3 was significantly correlated with most protists and showed the greatest contribution to community separation figure s2 a distance decay pattern of similarity was found in the protistan communities in which composition dissimilarity of the communities increased with geographical distance linear regression slope 7 087 10 7 p 0 01 fig 3b in total 57 of the variation could be explained by environmental and spatial variables based on vpa with the remaining 43 of variation unexplained fig 3c both environmental f 2 8 p 0 002 and spatial f 4 0 p 0 002 variables significantly affected the protistan community of total variation 16 6 was explained purely by spatial factors while 2 6 was explained purely by environmental factors simultaneous effects of spatial and environmental variables explained 37 8 of total variation 3 4 co occurrence network interactions of protistan and bacterial communities after analysis of the drivers of the protistan community 43 of variations remained unexplained therefore we next considered inter domain interactions of protists and bacteria the correlations analysed are detailed in supplementary table s4 the network consisted of 259 nodes 149 bacterial asvs and 110 protist asvs and 1 804 edges fig 4 a the numbers of internal associations within bacteria and within protists were 764 and 628 respectively fig 4b the external associations included 412 edges indicating a close relationship between protists and bacteria fig 4b interestingly most correlations for interactions within bacteria or protists were positive 81 41 for bacteria and 82 80 for protists whereas the correlations between protists and bacteria were 50 positive and 50 negative fig 4b the taxa involved in negative or positive correlations showed significant variation x squared 175 32 p 2 2e 16 asvs belonging to the same phylum were inclined to co occur positive correlations with one another inter phylum correlations within protists or bacteria were dominated by positive correlations however negative correlations were also observed e g between ciliophora and apicomplexa chlorophyta cryptophyta dinoflagellata ochrophyta opalozoa and pseudofungi figure s3 based on the topological roles of the nodes seven protist nodes and three bacterial nodes were identified as keystones connectors fig 4c indicating that protists might play more important roles than bacteria in the network topology the connectors belonged to ochrophyta three asvs ciliophora two asvs cryptophyta perkinsea proteobacteria actinobacteria and verrucomicrobia 3 5 neutral model of protistan community assembly to investigate the contribution of stochastic processes to protistan community assembly the sloan neutral model was fitted to four sections along the prdua drainage the neutral model fit well to the protistan communities in all sections with r2 values ranging between 0 584 and 0 757 fig 5 within each section 73 67 75 82 of asvs were well predicted by the neutral model for all the sections 51 24 of asvs were well predicted by the model statistical results are detailed in supplementary table s5 these results suggest that neutrally distributed asvs accounted for a large proportion of protist richness and that stochastic processes dominated protistan community assembly according to the ncm the total immigration rate of the protistan communities fig 5 m 0 255 was much lower than that of the bj branch m 0 414 prd branch m 0 503 pre waters m 0 597 and xj branch m 0 825 this indicated that the influence of dispersal on protistan communities along drainages across the prdua varied among river sections and decreased at larger spatial scales all taxa formed two distinct clusters in nmds analysis fig 6 among which below neutral asvs were significantly separated from the above neutral and neutral group table 2 analysis of similarities anosim global test p 0 001 r 0 07 the above neutral and neutral partitions overlapped strongly fig 6 table 2 anosim pairwise tests p 0 05 r 0 051 such differentiation was also observed for bacteria table s6 we further analysed the importance of the above neutral neutral and below neutral groups in the network based on the degree within module connectivities and among module connectivities figure s4 below neutral groups showed the highest degree and within module connectivities for both protists and bacteria however for among module connectivities the above neutral groups showed the highest value in protists while the below neutral groups showed the highest value in bacteria these results suggest that the below neutral groups were more important in the network for both protists and bacteria the mantel test results revealed that below neutral asvs showed different responses to environmental changes fig 6 first the below neutral partition was significantly associated with more environmental variables 19 vs 10 and 8 of the 21 selected variables for the below above neutral partitions respectively many variables such as chl a nnh4 salinity and do were only significantly correlated with the below neutral partition second the below neutral partition had higher mantel s r values average 0 204 vs 0 119 and 0 135 for below above neutral partitions respectively indicating strong responses to local environmental conditions the vpa for each group separately showed that the pure effects of environmental factors explained only a minor part of total variation for all groups compared to the pure effects of space table s7 in the above neutral neutral and below neutral groups the pure effects of environmental factors increased from 0 3 1 0 and 1 7 and the pure effects of space increased from 6 5 18 8 and 19 5 respectively table s7 most variations were explained by the simultaneous effects of both space and environment overlap effects 17 6 39 0 and 51 2 for above neutral and below groups respectively therefore spatially related processes especially the spatially structured environment are the main drivers of protist community composition and variation and these effects found to be strongest in the below neutral groups in the prdua 4 discussion protists are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and play a key role in energy flows and biogeochemical cycles the various ecological processes that shape protistan community are important topics in protistan ecology however the driving factors of protistan community and assembly mechanisms remain poorly understood especially in vulnerable aquatic ecosystems affected by strong anthropogenic disturbances moreover the development of hts has provided a fast and efficient method for obtaining more biological information about the protistan community huang and huang et al 2019 santos et al 2020 xie et al 2017 hts methods can simultaneously process many samples analyze data with high taxonomic resolution and provide valuable phylogenetic information for communities lundin et al 2012 mcgovern et al 2018 weiss et al 2016 despite the shortcomings of hts including quantitative biases and errors caused by dna extraction or primer associated pcr it is still a commonly used tool for studies on ecological interpretations of the microbial community de vargas et al 2015 gad et al 2020 lu et al 2020 piwosz et al 2020 ramirez et al 2018 for example yi et al 2017 and annekova et al 2020 studied protistan community compositions via 18s rrna gene hypervariable region amplicons mikhailov et al 2019 revealed the potential interactions among bacteria and microbial eukaryotes including protists and david et al 2021 identified the determinants of plankton protistan community assembly using hts drainages across the prdua are vital aquatic ecosystems under the influence of intense human activities elucidating the protistan community variations and assembly processes along prdua drainages is essential to maintaining biodiversity and stability in this type of aquatic ecosystem based on the results of hts we explored the variations of protistan communities their driving factors co occurrence patterns and assembly along the drainages of the prdua 4 1 diversity and spatial patterns of protistan communities in drainages of the prdua protistan communities are large and highly diverse groups within microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems it has been shown that protistan diversity is high not only in marine environments campo et al 2016 coutway et al 2005 de vargas et al 2015 lovejoy et al 2006 but also in freshwater ecosystems cruaud et al 2019 grossmann et al 2016a simon et al 2015 here the shannon index revealed a high level of protistan diversity in the prdua areas fig 2b compared to the river areas bj xj prd however the alpha diversity of the protistan community was lower in the estuarian site pre this is consistent with previous research on the community structure of protistan assemblages from the pearl river to coastal waters of the south china sea which reported higher protistan alpha diversity in freshwater than brackish estuarine water li et al 2018 wu and liu 2018 this phenomenon may be explained by large fluctuations in physicochemical factors e g salinity turbidity and do due to upstream freshwater inflow and tidal movement in estuaries where fewer species are well adapted mclusky and elliott 2007 zhou et al 2021 spatial patterns of protistan communities have been observed in a variety of aquatic environments including freshwater boenigk et al 2018 simon et al 2015 and marine ecosystems brisbin et al 2020 wu et al 2018 correspondingly our results showed marked spatial patterns in the protistan communities among the prdua drainages including significant variations in community composition abundant taxa and distance decay relationships several reasons may explain the spatial variations in protistan communities including stochastic processes which were dominant and important species interactions and environmental variables first 74 28 75 82 73 67 and 74 40 of community variation were explained by the ncm in the bj xj prd and pre areas respectively suggesting that stochastic processes dominantly drive spatial changes among the different studied areas logares et al 2018 roguet et al 2015 chen et al 2019 also showed that stochastic processes primarily shape eukaryotic microbial community variations in subtropical rivers in different regions second the changes in protistan community composition were influenced by complicated species interactions within between protists and bacteria fig 4 it is firmly established that inter domain interactions e g bacteria and protists should be considered as an essential factor for microeukaryotic community assembly in aquatic ecosystems sommer et al 2012 for example the dominant protistan and bacterial phyla of ciliophora and proteobacteria were keystone species in network analysis ciliophora are principally predators of bacteria lefranc et al 2005 richards and bass 2005 and their relationship may be one of symbiont host bjorbækmo et al 2020 third different protists responded differently to local environmental conditions figure s2 for example salinity may drive the ecological pattern of microeukaryotic community turnover and patterns of protistan diversity e g planktonic ciliate diversity along the inshore to offshore gradient on the continental shelf may be significantly correlated with salinity grattepanche et al 2016 whitfield et al 2012 temperature can control protistan densities and community composition by impacting feeding growth and survival barboza and defeo 2015 tveit et al 2015 weisse et al 2002 our results revealed that nine and 15 dominant protistan families were significantly related to salinity and temperature respectively figure s2 furthermore ciliophora and dinoflagellates were the dominant phyla in the prdua drainages which may indicate high nutrient loading due to intense anthropogenic activities the prdua drainages are human impacted aquatic ecosystems human activities can alter total nutrient load in many freshwaters and estuaries leading to high nutrient loads in aquatic ecosystems glibert et al 2016 in accordance with our results previous research has revealed that ciliophora are significantly positively correlated with concentrations of nutrients hou et al 2020 concentration of nutrients can affect the ciliates biomass suggesting a potential impact of eutrophication on ciliate growth wang et al 2014 4 2 stochastic processes dominate protistan community assembly the niche theory suggests that local microbial communities are shaped by stochastic or deterministic processes or by a combination of the two types determining the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes to microbial community assembly is an important ecological issue zhou and ning 2017 aguilar and sommaruga 2020 here the neutral community model ncm explained the assembly of the protistan community well in drainages across the prdua explaining over 70 of variations within each group bj xj prd and pre and over 50 in total fig 5 these results suggest that stochastic neutral processes i e dispersal limitation drift birth or death speciation play prominent roles in protistan community assembly this conclusion is consistent with the findings of ren et al 2018 and chen et al 2019 confirming that primarily stochastic processes govern the assembly of eukaryotic microbial communities in rivers and reservoirs a significant distance decay relationship fig 3b was observed further demonstrated the role of dispersal driven stochastic processes in constructing and shaping protistan communities significant distance decay relationships have also been detected for protistan communities in various aquatic ecosystems including the open ocean zhao et al 2017 2020 continental shelf brisbin et al 2020 wu et al 2018 coastal areas liu et al 2020b lakes liu et al 2020c logares et al 2018 soininen et al 2011 rivers isabwe et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2015a and other aquatic ecosystems boenigk et al 2018 guo et al 2020 simon et al 2015 however the fast flow rate of the pearl river in the flood season and the high dispersal capacity of protists are generally not conducive to the formation of distance decay the significant distance decay relationships in this study may be explained as follows firstly dispersal ability and species sorting are the two major factors that affect community distance decay relationships hanson et al 2012 species sorting can result in distance decay relationships by fitting to local environments based on the vpa in this study environmental effects interpreted as the strength of species sorting explained 40 4 of variation which indicated that species sorting play a role in shaping protistan communities wu et al 2018 secondly the scale dependency of the distance decay patterns in microorganisms means that the relative importance of history i e distance effect past environmental conditions and the environment can change with scale to a small extent geographic distance is significantly related to distance decay in similar environments while contemporary environmental factors and historical influences both affect biological communities at the intermediate scale 100 3000 km astorga et al 2012 martiny et al 2006 based on the intermediate spatial scale of prdua pure spatial variability 16 6 explained more protistan community variation than pure environmental variability 2 6 historical effects e g past environmental conditions can lead to pure spatial variability the legacies of which are preserved during the dispersal process ge et al 2008 in addition we found that the simultaneous effects of spatial and environmental factors accounted for 37 8 of variation indicating that spatially structured environment contributed to variation in the protistan community composition this further suggests that spatial variability plays a vital role in forming local environmental conditions and thus jointly impacts the distance decay relationship of the protistan community in the prdua drainages wang et al 2015b the ncm results indicate that the dispersal ability of protistan communities across the prdua drainages may vary among river sections and appears to decrease with larger spatial distance gradients chase and myers 2011 hubbell 2001 moreover the values of r2 and nm from the ncm differed slightly among the four branches and was slightly lower in the bj branch fig 5 0 584 and 7356 than the other three areas of the prdua revealing that the impact of stochastic processes in shaping protistan communities was stronger in the xj branch prd branch and pre waters sloan et al 2006 these results may be attributed to differences in taxonomic composition among drainages given their high diversity protists are likely to exhibit fine distinctions in metabolic activity dispersal potential and body size delong et al 2010 keeling and del campo 2017 wu et al 2018 which all influence the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes furthermore the below neutral partition representing taxa found less frequently than expected and other partitions above neutral and neutral asvs differed significantly which may be attributed to their lower dispersal ability another possibility is that below neutral taxa respond more sensitively to local environmental conditions which was confirmed by the mantel test results showing that the below neutral partition was significantly associated with a larger number of environmental variables fig 6 4 3 species interactions within and between protists and bacteria although stochastic processes significantly affected protistan community assembly the ncm did not 100 fit the protistan community data indicating that other mechanisms are shaping the protistan community including interactions among taxa and environmental filtering hu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 pan et al 2020 species cannot exist independently in the natural environment where complex networks of interactions among species exist freilich et al 2010 lima mendez et al 2015 network analysis can effectively characterize microbial interactions at a variety of taxonomic levels lupatini et al 2014 the community network pattern between protists and bacteria two pivotal components of the aquatic microbial food web was explored in the present study we found a close connection between protists and bacteria indicating that the bacterial community impacts the composition of the protistan community to some extent we identified 10 keystone species fig 4c 7 protists and 3 bacteria further demonstrating that interactions between protists and bacteria influence protistan community assembly and stability along drainages of the prdua chen et al 2020 kearns et al 2016 xue et al 2018 positive and negative interactions are interpreted as cooperative or mutualistic relationships and as competitive or antagonistic relationships among microbial species respectively ju et al 2014 xue et al 2018 xun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a protistan interactions in aquatic ecosystems include parasitism predation symbiosis and unresolved interactions bjorbækmo et al 2020 parasitism and predation are antagonistic whereas symbiosis is a mutualistic relationship in the current study the negative associations between ciliophora and several other phyla suggested that their interactions were likely to be parasitic or predatory figure s3 protistan parasitism can alter the structure and dynamics of food webs and protistan predation is critical for the release of dissolved nutrients in the aquatic food web amundsen et al 2009 azam et al 1983 del giorgio and williams 2005 lafferty et al 2008 given its dominance in the current study cryptophyta likely plays an important ecological role as parasite hosts or prey in the food web of the prdua drainages the positive correlations found between proteobacteria and ciliophora ochrophyta were indicative of symbiotic interactions in the prdua drainages bjorbækmo et al 2020 symbiotic bacterium protist interactions which include vitamin exchange n2 fixation and photosymbiosis have been demonstrated in previous research caron et al 2017 ramanan et al 2016 worden et al 2015 proteobacteria may provide nitrogen vitamins and or defense to ciliophora ochrophyta in exchange for photosynthetic products nutrients and or protection bjorbækmo et al 2020 in addition protistan groups are probably involved in multiple types of interactions e g symbionts parasites hosts predators prey and or unresolved interactions e g ciliophora can be defined as symbionts predators or playing unresolved interaction roles bjorbækmo et al 2020 based on meta analysis of bjorbækmo et al 2020 the interactions between protists and bacteria remain largely unresolved in general the correlations between protists and bacteria are half negative and half positive fig 4b figure s3 indicating that the four ecological interactions between protists and bacteria may co exist and may be important in driving protistan community assembly in the drainages of the prdua however it should be noted that correlation based approaches are inherently limited when it comes to ecological interaction inference complex nonlinear dynamics compositionality of sequencing data environmental heterogeneity latent confounders indirect associations and batch effects all hinder the usefulness of correlation metrics when inferring direct species species associations carr et al 2019 in addition in the present study we filtered up to 500 ml of water per sample which inevitably contained many heterogeneous suspended granules at the micrometer scale sample heterogeneity can obscure the signal of microbial interactions leading to erroneous conclusions about species connections due to the simpson s paradox context dependence and nonlinear averaging armitage and jones 2019 therefore these results need to be interpreted with caution and future studies which take these factors into account will need to be undertaken 4 4 influence of environmental factors on protistan communities previous studies have shown that abiotic environmental factors directly and indirectly influence the bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in aquatic ecosystems powell et al 2015 xue et al 2018 wan et al 2021 wang et al 2016 in the current study 16 environmental factors e g do ph temperature chl a transparency spc salinity orp nutrients and land use had significant effects on protistan community composition furthermore the vpa results also indicated that a certain proportion of protistan community variation was caused by environmental variables fig 3 these results are in agreement with previous researches lallias et al 2015 liu et al 2013 2015b ren et al 2018 saxena et al 2015 wang et al 2020b yu et al 2015 notably nutrient conditions especially nno3 contributed most to the community composition in prdua nitrogen is an important nutrient for autotrophs and is closely related to changes in the microeukaryotic community glibert et al 2016 xue et al 2018 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b the impacts of land use on biodiversity are well recognised for plants and animals in ecosystems worldwide but these patterns have rarely been studied in protistan communities land use such as intensive agriculture and rapid industrialization that involves the discharge of pollutants and nutrients or change of hydrodynamics can alter the environmental conditions of aquatic ecosystems and thereby adversely affect community composition and structure staley et al 2014 saxena et al 2015 xie et al 2017 our results show that different land uses can significantly impact environmental variables in water e g nno3 nno2 ss spc salinity tds do orp ph and transparency to varying degrees fig 6 by impacting environmental variables in the drainages land use indirectly contributes to protistan community composition consistent with grossmann et al 2016b schulz et al 2019 and santos et al 2020 our results confirmed that different land use e g agricultural land grass land forest land urban land and bare land was significantly related to protistan community composition in the prdua sites jonsson et al 2017 demonstrated that forestry use can affect aquatic moss and macroinvertebrate diversity through its influence on water chemistry e g ph organic matter loading agricultural and urbanized land can transform aquatic environments and impact biodiversity due to sewage which increases nutrient pollutant i e pahs pesticides and fine sediment in rivers bierschenk et al 2019 egler et al 2012 extence et al 2013 vandewalle et al 2010 moreover the sewage often contains abundant microbes which can enter rivers directly via discharge xie et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 consequently land use influences protistan community composition and assembly in drainages of the prdua in addition various environmental variables not measured in the current study may also play roles in maintaining the composition and distribution of protists along the prdua drainages the unexplained fraction of protistan community variation 43 0 in the vpa results may reflect the effects of certain non measured variables pan et al 2020 wei et al 2016 wu et al 2018 thus those environmental parameters especially ones impacted by anthropogenic activities e g pollution changes in hydrological conditions by dam construction gad et al 2020 hu et al 2017 not explored here should be considered in future work 5 conclusions the present study provides detailed insights into the spatial patterns driving factors species interactions and processes underlying the protistan communities of drainages in the prdua during summer it showed that different drainages had differences in protistan community composition diversity and spatial distribution ncm prediction showed that stochastic processes dominate the assembly of the protistan community with more than 70 explained in each drainage however stochastic processes could not completely explain protistan community assembly in this region accordingly nutrients land use and other environmental variables also play crucial roles in shaping the protistan community in each drainage additionally co occurrence network analysis showed that species interactions between protists and bacteria or within protists might be essential drivers of protistan community variations thus stochastic processes environmental filtering and species interactions act in combination to shape the protistan communities in drainages of the prdua to elucidate fully the assembly mechanisms of protistan community future protistan community ecological studies should consider additional environmental factors species interactions and temporal dynamics that were not

16951,drainages in the pearl river delta urban agglomeration prdua host vital aquatic ecosystems and face enormous pressures from human activities in one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world despite being crucial components of aquatic ecosystems the interactions and assembly processes of the protistan community are rarely explored in areas with serious anthropogenic disturbance to elucidate the mechanisms of these processes we used environmental dna sequencing of 18s rdna to investigate the influence of environmental factors and species interactions on the protistan community and its assembly in drainages of the prdua during summer the protistan community showed a high level of diversity and a marked spatial pattern in this region community assembly was driven primarily by stochastic processes based on the sloan neutral community model explaining 74 28 75 82 73 67 74 40 and 51 24 of community variations in the bj beijiang xj xijiang prd pearl river delta pre pearl river estuary areas and in total respectively meanwhile environmental variables including temperature ph dissolved oxygen transparency nutrients and land use were strongly correlated with the composition and assembly of the protistan community explaining 40 40 of variation in the protistan community furthermore the bacterial community was simultaneously analysed by the 16s rdna sequencing co occurrence network analysis revealed that species interactions within bacteria 81 41 positive or protists 82 80 positive and those between bacteria and protists 50 positive and 50 negative impacted the protistan community assembly in summary stochastic processes dominated whereas species interactions and environmental factors also played important roles in shaping the protistan communities in drainages across the prdua this study provides insights into the ecological patterns assembly processes and species interactions underlying protistan dynamics in urban aquatic ecosystems experiencing serious anthropogenic disturbance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords protistan community stochastic processes species interactions environmental variables pearl river delta urban agglomeration community assembly 1 introduction the pearl river delta urban agglomeration prdua is a highly developed urban agglomeration in china china is undergoing a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization during which the prdua has gradually become one of the country s most important regional units chen et al 2017a dong and xu 2019 with the concentration of urban and developed areas rapid population expansion and intense anthropogenic disturbance have put great pressure on regional ecosystems xu et al 2013 li and zhang 2019 liu et al 2019a causing a series of environmental issues e g pollution resource exhaustion biodiversity reduction ecosystem destruction and deterioration he et al 2014 bellamy et al 2017 liu et al 2019b compared to an individual city an urban agglomeration is a continuous area of development and therefore may have larger negative impacts on natural ecosystems due to the lack of distance between cities du et al 2016 sun et al 2018 thus the structure pattern and services of urban ecosystems are dramatically different as major urban ecosystems of the prdua aquatic ecosystems are also confronted with intense anthropogenic activities severe environmental deterioration and increasing risk of biodiversity loss çelekli et al 2016 hu et al 2019 häder et al 2020 various government projects have been undertaken to address the ecological and environmental issues facing the aquatic ecosystems of the prdua simultaneously awareness and scientific studies assessing the status of aquatic ecosystems have gradually increased in the prdua however as no quantitative evaluations have been conducted to evaluate the ecological changes or regional variations of the aquatic ecosystems during the increases in human activities and pollution the spatio temporal dynamics of aquatic biodiversity and their environmental drivers remain obscure microbial eukaryotes are essential components of aquatic ecosystems and represent the foundation of the food web and alterations in their community composition can cause intense changes at all trophic levels cheung et al 2010 logares et al 2012 lanzén et al 2016 protists the most diverse unicellular organisms among microeukaryotes play multiple ecological roles in aquatic food webs acting as decomposers producers and consumers cruaud et al 2019 giner et al 2020 protists in aquatic ecosystems exhibit characteristic community composition in response to human activities and environmental changes gad et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 due to human pressure freshwater ecosystems are among the most extensive and fastest changing aquatic ecosystems previous studies have shown that both abiotic e g temperature nitrate and biotic factors e g predators symbiosis are important drivers of freshwater protistan communities boenigk et al 2018 simon et al 2015 sommer et al 2012 gwendoline et al 2021 however knowledge on the biodiversity spatiotemporal dynamics and assembly of the protistan community in freshwater ecosystems remains limited hampering our understanding of their ecological roles and environmental relevance particularly in urban areas only a few studies have explored the dynamics and patterns of protistan communities in urban drainages cruaud et al 2019 demonstrated that the selective effects of environmental factors e g nitrogen concentrations and water temperature and their potential interactions with bacterial communities are related to protistan community assembly in the saint charles river in addition previous researches on the yangtze river revealed a biogeographical distribution pattern and that environmental factors can significantly affect community compositions liu et al 2018 lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 with increasing anthropogenic activity in drainages of the prdua evaluating the status of protistan communities in aquatic environments and their responses to environmental factors is essential to the development of ecological management strategies in the prdua protists are often neglected in aquatic ecosystem studies due to difficulties of measurement in traditional investigations traditionally biodiversity investigations of protists have been based on taxonomic identification using morphological characters liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 a large number of microbial species are not identifiable through microscopy and the difficulty of identifying species morphologically impedes the application of conventional methods to microeukaryotic communities nagarkar et al 2018 potter et al 1997 moreover traditional surveys are extremely time consuming have low effectiveness and place high demands on trained taxonomists fortunately environmental dna edna sequencing methods such as high throughput sequencing hts of the 18s ribosomal dna rdna region most often of the v4 and v9 hypervariable regions provides a potential solution for monitoring of microeukaryotes including protists giner et al 2020 martín et al 2020 obiol et al 2020 nonetheless the methodologies of hts combined with dna barcoding have a few limitations in biodiversity monitoring e g quantitative biases potential analytical errors lack of standards and estimating biases from dna extraction and pcr amplification which restricts our understanding of microeukaryotic community dynamics and functions mcgovern et al 2018 smith et al 2017 yeh et al 2018 despite this hts methods do offer dependable information in the context of ecological interpretations piwosz et al 2020 accordingly hts can be applied for studies on the relationships between microbial communities and environmental variables furthermore hts of edna metabarcoding can support more complete descriptions of protists enabling comprehensive and detailed analyses of protistan communities from environmental samples several ecological community theories have emerged to interpret the processes shaping community composition four process classes are thought to impact the patterns of community composition and diversity at the most general level i e selection among individuals of different species ecological drift dispersal and speciation vallend 2016 vellend and agrawal 2010 an ecological community is a dynamic and complex system controlled by various deterministic and stochastic components related to ecological processes ning et al 2019 zhou and ning 2017 generally deterministic and stochastic processes work together in the assembly of microbial communities i e the mechanisms that drive the diversity succession function biogeography and distribution of microbial communities bahram et al 2016 chase 2010 graham et al 2017 gravel et al 2006 hubbell 2001 stegen et al 2016 the former states that niche based theories including biotic e g predation mutualism trade offs facilitation and competition and abiotic environmental factors e g temperature ph and salinity drive microbial community variations liu et al 2015a wei et al 2016 the latter states that neutral based theories including birth death speciation limited dispersal and drift determine microbial community patterns chen et al 2017b 2019 zhou and ning 2017 understanding microbial community assembly and quantifying the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes are crucial for predicting how communities will respond to environmental variation and for clarifying ecological processes human activities and environmental pollution in the prdua aquatic ecosystem have seriously disturbed the microeukaryotic community at present however microeukaryotic community assembly remains poorly understood especially the protistan community in this study 18s rdna sequencing was employed to profile protists along the drainages of the prdua we aimed to determine i the composition and diversity of protistan communities in drainages of the prdua ii the dominant mechanism shaping the assembly of protistan communities namely stochastic or deterministic processes and iii the influences of environmental variables and species interactions on the protistan community the results elucidate the distribution patterns and community assembly process of protists which are crucial to understanding microbe driven ecosystem processes and functions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and edna sample collection the studied aquatic ecosystem

merged a similar bioinformatics pipeline was used as for the 18s data but taxonomy was assigned based on the rdp training set v16 2 5 statistical analysis data on asv abundance were rarefied to the sequencing depth of the sample with the fewest sequences for protists 17 762 and bacteria 40 435 respectively rarefication curves were drawn for resampled asv abundance the rarefication curves approached a plateau confirming adequate sequencing depth for both protists and bacteria of the resampled datasets we then used these normalized asv abundance tables for all the downstream analysis

processes to protistan community assembly the sloan neutral community model ncm was employed to predict the relationships between asv detection frequencies and their relative abundance across the metacommunity sloan et al 2006 the total fit to the neutral model was indicated by the parameter r2 based on whether the asvs occurred within neutral partition less frequently than below partition or more frequently than above partition the 95 confidence intervals of the ncm predictions all asvs were divided into three groups non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination based on bray curtis similarity was used to analyze deviations in the distributions of the three partitions from the ncm predictions the mantel test was performed to compare the responses of these partitions to environmental variables the ncm was developed as per r code in chen et al 2019 which is available at https github com weidong chen microbial ecology stochastic assembly of river microeukaryotes the

dinoflagellata 3 26 perkinsea 2 19 and opalozoa 1 46 respectively fig 2c at the genus level the dominant protists were strobilidiidae g x tintinnidium skeletonema cryptomonas cyclotella and askenasia which constituted 11 75 6 75 5 32 4 60 3 42 and 2 77 of the total number of sequences respectively for the 16s rrna gene 2 756 358 high quality sequences of bacteria were obtained from 54 samples

distances revealed remarkable spatial variations in the composition of protistan communities in the prdua drainage fig 2d the permanova results confirmed that significant differences existed in the composition of communities among the four prdua drainages r2 0 348 p 0 001 table 1 multiple comparison analysis suggested significant separation between all pairwise groups we further identified

samples notably nno3 was positively correlated with the first axis of canonical correspondence in which pre showed the highest value in terms of protistan composition some taxa of ciliophora i e strobilidiidae f strombidiidae tintinnidiidae spirofilidae and sessilida and perkinsea i e perkinsida xx were differentially abundant in pre figure s1 correlation analysis between these differentially abundant taxa and environmental variables confirmed that nno3 was significantly correlated with most protists and showed the greatest contribution to community separation figure s2 a distance decay

in total 57 of the variation could be explained by environmental and spatial variables based on vpa with the remaining 43 of variation unexplained fig 3c both environmental f 2 8 p 0 002 and spatial f

simultaneous effects of spatial and environmental variables explained 37 8 of total variation 3 4 co occurrence network interactions of protistan and bacterial communities after analysis of the drivers of the protistan community 43 of variations remained unexplained therefore we next considered inter domain interactions of protists and bacteria the correlations analysed are detailed in supplementary table s4 the network consisted of 259 nodes 149 bacterial asvs and 110 protist asvs and 1 804 edges fig 4 a the numbers of internal associations within bacteria and within protists were 764 and 628 respectively fig 4b the external associations included 412 edges indicating a close relationship between protists and bacteria fig 4b interestingly most correlations for interactions within bacteria or protists were positive 81 41 for bacteria and 82 80 for protists whereas the correlations between protists and bacteria were 50 positive and 50 negative fig 4b the taxa involved in negative or positive correlations showed significant variation x squared 175 32 p 2 2e 16 asvs belonging to the same phylum were inclined to co occur positive correlations with one another inter phylum correlations within protists or bacteria were dominated by positive correlations however negative correlations were also observed e g between ciliophora and apicomplexa chlorophyta cryptophyta dinoflagellata ochrophyta opalozoa and pseudofungi figure s3 based on the topological roles of the nodes seven protist nodes and three bacterial nodes were identified as keystones connectors fig 4c indicating that protists might play more important roles than bacteria in the network topology the connectors belonged to ochrophyta three asvs ciliophora two asvs cryptophyta perkinsea proteobacteria actinobacteria and verrucomicrobia 3 5 neutral model of protistan community assembly to investigate the contribution of stochastic processes to protistan community assembly the sloan neutral model was fitted to four sections along the prdua drainage the neutral model fit well to the protistan communities in all sections with r2 values ranging between 0 584 and 0 757 fig 5 within each section 73 67 75 82 of asvs were well predicted by the neutral model for all the sections 51 24 of asvs were well predicted by the model statistical results are detailed in supplementary table s5 these results suggest that neutrally distributed asvs accounted for a large proportion of protist richness and that stochastic processes dominated protistan community assembly according to the ncm the total immigration rate of the protistan communities fig 5 m 0 255 was much lower than that of the bj branch m 0 414 prd branch m 0 503 pre waters m 0 597 and xj branch m 0 825 this indicated that the influence of dispersal on protistan communities along drainages across the prdua varied among river sections and decreased at larger spatial scales all taxa formed two distinct clusters in nmds analysis fig 6 among which below neutral asvs were significantly separated from the above neutral and neutral group table 2 analysis of similarities anosim global test p 0 001 r 0 07 the above neutral and neutral partitions overlapped strongly fig 6 table 2 anosim pairwise tests p 0 05 r 0 051 such differentiation was also observed for bacteria table s6 we further analysed the importance of the above neutral neutral and below neutral groups in the network based on the degree within module connectivities and among module connectivities figure s4 below neutral groups showed the highest degree and within module connectivities for both protists and bacteria however for among module connectivities the above neutral groups showed the highest value in protists while the below neutral groups showed the highest value in bacteria these results suggest that the below neutral groups were more important in the network for both protists and bacteria the mantel test results revealed that below neutral asvs showed different responses to environmental changes fig 6 first the below neutral partition was significantly associated with more environmental variables 19 vs 10 and 8 of the 21 selected variables for the below above neutral partitions respectively many variables such as chl a nnh4 salinity and do were only significantly correlated with the below neutral partition second the below neutral partition had higher mantel s r values average 0 204 vs 0 119 and 0 135 for below above neutral partitions respectively indicating strong responses to local environmental conditions the vpa for each group separately showed that the pure effects of environmental factors explained only a minor part of total variation for all groups compared to the pure effects of space table s7 in the above neutral neutral and below neutral groups the pure effects of environmental factors increased from 0 3 1 0 and 1 7 and the pure effects of space increased from 6 5 18 8 and 19 5 respectively table s7 most variations were explained by the simultaneous effects of both space and environment overlap effects 17 6 39 0 and 51 2 for above neutral and below groups respectively therefore spatially related processes especially the spatially structured environment are the main drivers of protist community composition and variation and these effects found to be strongest in the below neutral groups in the prdua 4 discussion protists are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and play a key role in energy flows and biogeochemical cycles the various ecological processes that shape protistan community are important topics in protistan ecology however the driving factors of protistan community and assembly mechanisms remain poorly understood especially in vulnerable aquatic ecosystems affected by strong anthropogenic disturbances moreover the development of hts has provided a fast and efficient method for obtaining more biological information about the protistan community huang and huang et al 2019 santos et al 2020 xie et al 2017 hts methods can simultaneously process many samples analyze data with high taxonomic resolution and provide valuable phylogenetic information for communities lundin et al 2012 mcgovern et al 2018 weiss et al 2016 despite the shortcomings of hts including quantitative biases and errors caused by dna extraction or primer associated pcr it is still a commonly used tool for studies on ecological interpretations of the microbial community de vargas et al 2015 gad et al 2020 lu et al 2020 piwosz et al 2020 ramirez et al 2018 for example yi et al 2017 and annekova et al 2020 studied protistan community compositions via 18s rrna gene hypervariable region amplicons mikhailov et al 2019 revealed the potential interactions among bacteria and microbial eukaryotes including protists and david et al 2021 identified the determinants of plankton protistan community assembly using hts drainages across the prdua are vital aquatic ecosystems under the influence of intense human activities elucidating the protistan community variations and assembly processes along prdua drainages is essential to maintaining biodiversity and stability in this type of aquatic ecosystem based on the results of hts we explored the variations of protistan communities their driving factors co occurrence patterns and assembly along the drainages of the prdua 4 1 diversity and spatial patterns of protistan communities in drainages of the prdua protistan communities are large and highly diverse groups within microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems it has been shown that protistan diversity is high not only in marine environments campo et al 2016 coutway et al 2005 de vargas et al 2015 lovejoy et al 2006 but also in freshwater ecosystems cruaud et al 2019 grossmann et al 2016a simon et al 2015 here the shannon index revealed a high level of protistan diversity in the prdua areas fig 2b compared to the river areas bj xj prd however the alpha diversity of the protistan community was lower in the estuarian site pre this is consistent with previous research on the community structure of protistan assemblages from the pearl river to coastal waters of the south china sea which reported higher protistan alpha diversity in freshwater than brackish estuarine water li et al 2018 wu and liu 2018 this phenomenon may be explained by large fluctuations in physicochemical factors e g salinity turbidity and do due to upstream freshwater inflow and tidal movement in estuaries where fewer species are well adapted mclusky and elliott 2007 zhou et al 2021 spatial patterns of protistan communities have been observed in a variety of aquatic environments including freshwater boenigk et al 2018 simon et al 2015 and marine ecosystems brisbin et al 2020 wu et al 2018 correspondingly our results showed marked spatial patterns in the protistan communities among the prdua drainages including significant variations in community composition abundant taxa and distance decay relationships several reasons may explain the spatial variations in protistan communities including stochastic processes which were dominant and important species interactions and environmental variables first 74 28 75 82 73 67 and 74 40 of community variation were explained by the ncm in the bj xj prd and pre areas respectively suggesting that stochastic processes dominantly drive spatial changes among the different studied areas logares et al 2018 roguet et al 2015 chen et al 2019 also showed that stochastic processes primarily shape eukaryotic microbial community variations in subtropical rivers in different regions second the changes in protistan community composition were influenced by complicated species interactions within between protists and bacteria fig 4 it is firmly established that inter domain interactions e g bacteria and protists should be considered as an essential factor for microeukaryotic community assembly in aquatic ecosystems sommer et al 2012 for example the dominant protistan and bacterial phyla of ciliophora and proteobacteria were keystone species in network analysis ciliophora are principally predators of bacteria lefranc et al 2005 richards and bass 2005 and their relationship may be one of symbiont host bjorbækmo et al 2020 third different protists responded differently to local environmental conditions figure s2 for example salinity may drive the ecological pattern of microeukaryotic community turnover and patterns of protistan diversity e g planktonic ciliate diversity along the inshore to offshore gradient on the continental shelf may be significantly correlated with salinity grattepanche et al 2016 whitfield et al 2012 temperature can control protistan densities and community composition by impacting feeding growth and survival barboza and defeo 2015 tveit et al 2015 weisse et al 2002 our results revealed that nine and 15 dominant protistan families were significantly related to salinity and temperature respectively figure s2 furthermore ciliophora and dinoflagellates were the dominant phyla in the prdua drainages which may indicate high nutrient loading due to intense anthropogenic activities the prdua drainages are human impacted aquatic ecosystems human activities can alter total nutrient load in many freshwaters and estuaries leading to high nutrient loads in aquatic ecosystems glibert et al 2016 in accordance with our results previous research has revealed that ciliophora are significantly positively correlated with concentrations of nutrients hou et al 2020 concentration of nutrients can affect the ciliates biomass suggesting a potential impact of eutrophication on ciliate growth wang et al 2014 4 2 stochastic processes dominate protistan community assembly the niche theory suggests that local microbial communities are shaped by stochastic or deterministic processes or by a combination of the two types determining the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes to microbial community assembly is an important ecological issue zhou and ning 2017 aguilar and sommaruga 2020 here the neutral community model ncm explained the assembly of the protistan community well in drainages across the prdua explaining over 70 of variations within each group bj xj prd and pre and over 50 in total fig 5 these results suggest that stochastic neutral processes i e dispersal limitation drift birth or death speciation play prominent roles in protistan community assembly this conclusion is consistent with the findings of ren et al 2018 and chen et al 2019 confirming that primarily stochastic processes govern the assembly of eukaryotic microbial communities in rivers and reservoirs a significant distance decay relationship fig 3b was observed further demonstrated the role of dispersal driven stochastic processes in constructing and shaping protistan communities significant distance decay relationships have also been detected for protistan communities in various aquatic ecosystems including the open ocean zhao et al 2017 2020 continental shelf brisbin et al 2020 wu et al 2018 coastal areas liu et al 2020b lakes liu et al 2020c logares et al 2018 soininen et al 2011 rivers isabwe et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2015a and other aquatic ecosystems boenigk et al 2018 guo et al 2020 simon et al 2015 however the fast flow rate of the pearl river in the flood season and the high dispersal capacity of protists are generally not conducive to the formation of distance decay the significant distance decay relationships in this study may be explained as follows firstly dispersal ability and species sorting are the two major factors that affect community distance decay relationships hanson et al 2012 species sorting can result in distance decay relationships by fitting to local environments based on the vpa in this study environmental effects interpreted as the strength of species sorting explained 40 4 of variation which indicated that species sorting play a role in shaping protistan communities wu et al 2018 secondly the scale dependency of the distance decay patterns in microorganisms means that the relative importance of history i e distance effect past environmental conditions and the environment can change with scale to a small extent geographic distance is significantly related to distance decay in similar environments while contemporary environmental factors and historical influences both affect biological communities at the intermediate scale 100 3000 km astorga et al 2012 martiny et al 2006 based on the intermediate spatial scale of prdua pure spatial variability 16 6 explained more protistan community variation than pure environmental variability 2 6 historical effects e g past environmental conditions can lead to pure spatial variability the legacies of which are preserved during the dispersal process ge et al 2008 in addition we found that the simultaneous effects of spatial and environmental factors accounted for 37 8 of variation indicating that spatially structured environment contributed to variation in the protistan community composition this further suggests that spatial variability plays a vital role in forming local environmental conditions and thus jointly impacts the distance decay relationship of the protistan community in the prdua drainages wang et al 2015b the ncm results indicate that the dispersal ability of protistan communities across the prdua drainages may vary among river sections and appears to decrease with larger spatial distance gradients chase and myers 2011 hubbell 2001 moreover the values of r2 and nm from the ncm differed slightly among the four branches and was slightly lower in the bj branch fig 5 0 584 and 7356 than the other three areas of the prdua revealing that the impact of stochastic processes in shaping protistan communities was stronger in the xj branch prd branch and pre waters sloan et al 2006 these results may be attributed to differences in taxonomic composition among drainages given their high diversity protists are likely to exhibit fine distinctions in metabolic activity dispersal potential and body size delong et al 2010 keeling and del campo 2017 wu et al 2018 which all influence the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes furthermore the below neutral partition representing taxa found less frequently than expected and other partitions above neutral and neutral asvs differed significantly which may be attributed to their lower dispersal ability another possibility is that below neutral taxa respond more sensitively to local environmental conditions which was confirmed by the mantel test results showing that the below neutral partition was significantly associated with a larger number of environmental variables fig 6 4 3 species interactions within and between protists and bacteria although stochastic processes significantly affected protistan community assembly the ncm did not 100 fit the protistan community data indicating that other mechanisms are shaping the protistan community including interactions among taxa and environmental filtering hu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 pan et al 2020 species cannot exist independently in the natural environment where complex networks of interactions among species exist freilich et al 2010 lima mendez et al 2015 network analysis can effectively characterize microbial interactions at a variety of taxonomic levels lupatini et al 2014 the community network pattern between protists and bacteria two pivotal components of the aquatic microbial food web was explored in the present study we found a close connection between protists and bacteria indicating that the bacterial community impacts the composition of the protistan community to some extent we identified 10 keystone species fig 4c 7 protists and 3 bacteria further demonstrating that interactions between protists and bacteria influence protistan community assembly and stability along drainages of the prdua chen et al 2020 kearns et al 2016 xue et al 2018 positive and negative interactions are interpreted as cooperative or mutualistic relationships and as competitive or antagonistic relationships among microbial species respectively ju et al 2014 xue et al 2018 xun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a protistan interactions in aquatic ecosystems include parasitism predation symbiosis and unresolved interactions bjorbækmo et al 2020 parasitism and predation are antagonistic whereas symbiosis is a mutualistic relationship in the current study the negative associations between ciliophora and several other phyla suggested that their interactions were likely to be parasitic or predatory figure s3 protistan parasitism can alter the structure and dynamics of food webs and protistan predation is critical for the release of dissolved nutrients in the aquatic food web amundsen et al 2009 azam et al 1983 del giorgio and williams 2005 lafferty et al 2008 given its dominance in the current study cryptophyta likely plays an important ecological role as parasite hosts or prey in the food web of the prdua drainages the positive correlations found between proteobacteria and ciliophora ochrophyta were indicative of symbiotic interactions in the prdua drainages bjorbækmo et al 2020 symbiotic bacterium protist interactions which include vitamin exchange n2 fixation and photosymbiosis have been demonstrated in previous research caron et al 2017 ramanan et al 2016 worden et al 2015 proteobacteria may provide nitrogen vitamins and or defense to ciliophora ochrophyta in exchange for photosynthetic products nutrients and or protection bjorbækmo et al 2020 in addition protistan groups are probably involved in multiple types of interactions e g symbionts parasites hosts predators prey and or unresolved interactions e g ciliophora can be defined as symbionts predators or playing unresolved interaction roles bjorbækmo et al 2020 based on meta analysis of bjorbækmo et al 2020 the interactions between protists and bacteria remain largely unresolved in general the correlations between protists and bacteria are half negative and half positive fig 4b figure s3 indicating that the four ecological interactions between protists and bacteria may co exist and may be important in driving protistan community assembly in the drainages of the prdua however it should be noted that correlation based approaches are inherently limited when it comes to ecological interaction inference complex nonlinear dynamics compositionality of sequencing data environmental heterogeneity latent confounders indirect associations and batch effects all hinder the usefulness of correlation metrics when inferring direct species species associations carr et al 2019 in addition in the present study we filtered up to 500 ml of water per sample which inevitably contained many heterogeneous suspended granules at the micrometer scale sample heterogeneity can obscure the signal of microbial interactions leading to erroneous conclusions about species connections due to the simpson s paradox context dependence and nonlinear averaging armitage and jones 2019 therefore these results need to be interpreted with caution and future studies which take these factors into account will need to be undertaken 4 4 influence of environmental factors on protistan communities previous studies have shown that abiotic environmental factors directly and indirectly influence the bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in aquatic ecosystems powell et al 2015 xue et al 2018 wan et al 2021 wang et al 2016 in the current study 16 environmental factors e g do ph temperature chl a transparency spc salinity orp nutrients and land use had significant effects on protistan community composition furthermore the vpa results also indicated that a certain proportion of protistan community variation was caused by environmental variables fig 3 these results are in agreement with previous researches lallias et al 2015 liu et al 2013 2015b ren et al 2018 saxena et al 2015 wang et al 2020b yu et al 2015 notably nutrient conditions especially nno3 contributed most to the community composition in prdua nitrogen is an important nutrient for autotrophs and is closely related to changes in the microeukaryotic community glibert et al 2016 xue et al 2018 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b the impacts of land use on biodiversity are well recognised for plants and animals in ecosystems worldwide but these patterns have rarely been studied in protistan communities land use such as intensive agriculture and rapid industrialization that involves the discharge of pollutants and nutrients or change of hydrodynamics can alter the environmental conditions of aquatic ecosystems and thereby adversely affect community composition and structure staley et al 2014 saxena et al 2015 xie et al 2017 our results show that different land uses can significantly impact environmental variables in water e g nno3 nno2 ss spc salinity tds do orp ph and transparency to varying degrees fig 6 by impacting environmental variables in the drainages land use indirectly contributes to protistan community composition consistent with grossmann et al 2016b schulz et al 2019 and santos et al 2020 our results confirmed that different land use e g agricultural land grass land forest land urban land and bare land was significantly related to protistan community composition in the prdua sites jonsson et al 2017 demonstrated that forestry use can affect aquatic moss and macroinvertebrate diversity through its influence on water chemistry e g ph organic matter loading agricultural and urbanized land can transform aquatic environments and impact biodiversity due to sewage which increases nutrient pollutant i e pahs pesticides and fine sediment in rivers bierschenk et al 2019 egler et al 2012 extence et al 2013 vandewalle et al 2010 moreover the sewage often contains abundant microbes which can enter rivers directly via discharge xie et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 consequently land use influences protistan community composition and assembly in drainages of the prdua in addition various environmental variables not measured in the current study may also play roles in maintaining the composition and distribution of protists along the prdua drainages the unexplained fraction of protistan community variation 43 0 in the vpa results may reflect the effects of certain non measured variables pan et al 2020 wei et al 2016 wu et al 2018 thus those environmental parameters especially ones impacted by anthropogenic activities e g pollution changes in hydrological conditions by dam construction gad et al 2020 hu et al 2017 not explored here should be considered in future work 5 conclusions the present study provides detailed insights into the spatial patterns driving factors species interactions and processes underlying the protistan communities of drainages in the prdua during summer it showed that different drainages had differences in protistan community composition diversity and spatial distribution ncm prediction showed that stochastic processes dominate the assembly of the protistan community with more than 70 explained in each drainage however stochastic processes could not completely explain protistan community assembly in this region accordingly nutrients land use and other environmental variables also play crucial roles in shaping the protistan community in each drainage additionally co occurrence network analysis showed that species interactions between protists and bacteria or within protists might be essential drivers of protistan community variations thus stochastic processes environmental filtering and species interactions act in combination to shape the protistan communities in drainages of the prdua to elucidate fully the assembly mechanisms of protistan community future protistan community ecological studies should consider additional environmental factors species interactions and temporal dynamics that were not

16952,geogenic arsenic as contamination of groundwater is a health threat to millions of people worldwide particularly in alluvial regions of south and southeast asia mitigation measures are often

groundwater resources who 2011 karagas et al 2015 podgorski and berg 2020 diseases caused by this exposure are particularly common in the floodplains and deltas of the large east and south asian river systems smith et al 2000 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 berg et al 2007 fendorf et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 there the natural abundance of bioavailable natural organic matter om in geologically

cozzarelli et al 2016 ziegler et al 2017 polya et al 2019 which is thought to be linked to hydrogeological heterogeneities and to associated variations in dominating redox processes besides fe iii oxyhydr oxides and other redox sensitive mineral phases the abundance of dissolved sulphate so4 2 and the formation of as sulphide minerals has also been recognised to impact the mobility of as bostick and fendorf 2003 buschmann and berg 2009 furthermore the bioavailable om in young riverbank deposits ponds or channel infill plays an important role in creating hot spots of as mobilisation while older sedimentary om which tends to be more recalcitrant is of lower significance harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 rowland et al 2007 polizzotto et al 2008 neumann et al 2010 postma et al 2012 lawson et al 2016 kulkarni et al 2017 richards et al 2019 glodowska et al 2020a wallis et al 2020 however in that context the role of methane ch4 cycling has rarely been considered especially in natural settings polya et al 2019 although several studies detected ch4 in as contaminated aquifers liu et al 2009 postma et al 2012 2016 sø et al 2018 and indicated that elevated ch4 and as

discussion 3 1 hydrology and hydrogeochemical evolution of as contamination a comprehensive set of stable isotope signatures and hydrochemical parameters see methods was determined from groundwater and surface water samples collected along a 2 km long transect that follows the average groundwater flow direction towards hanoi as inferred from previous hydrological hydrochemical and numerical studies fig 1 van geen et al 2013 stopelli et al 2020 wallis et al 2020 river water infiltration is the main source of groundwater recharge at the study site with young om and fe iii rich riverbank sediments fig 2 creating a hot spot of arsenic release at the red river groundwater interface stahl et al 2016 stopelli et al 2020 wallis et al 2020 dissolved as is then advected into and within the holocene aquifer where concentrations initially range between 20 and 200 µg l fig 2 wells 2 to 5 hereafter indicated as flowpath 1 further along the groundwater flow direction dissolved as reaches up to 540 µg l in the holocene aquifer fig 2 wells 6 to 8 the highest dissolved as concentrations are found in the wells that also show the largest concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc ammonium nh4 and dissolved methane ch4 that is 5 7 mg doc l 50 65 mg nh4 n l and 40 58 mg ch4 l respectively fig 2 and fig s6 for nh4 the water isotope signatures in these wells δ 18o 6 1 are indicative of evaporative water that locally infiltrates from the aquitard into the aquifer fig 2 rather than of water originating from red river bank infiltration sediment coring revealed substantial lithological heterogeneity in the clayey aquitard deposits including sandy intercalations caused by alternating riverine and marine depositions during the holocene period eiche et al 2008 2017 trung et al 2020 kontny et al 2021 it was also shown that aquitard depositions contain up to 9 wt of sedimentary om eiche et al 2008 glodowska et al 2020a the doc enriched pore water 5 7 mg c l see fig 2 that evolves as it percolates through the sandy intercalations creates locally highly reducing conditions as it egresses into the underlying aquifer hereafter indicated as flowpath 2 our mixing calculations based on the water isotope ratios δ 18o and δ 2h suggest that groundwater collected just below the aquitard i e wells 6a and 8a in fig 2 consist of up to 92 aquitard pore water see supplementary section si 1 for calculations along with aquitard pore water compositions at the rtz that marks the interface between the holocene and the pleistocene aquifers both dissolved as and fe concentrations sharply decrease fig 2 wells 9 to 13 and fig s2 while mn concentrations increase fig s2 high resolution mineralogical analyses of a sediment core that was drilled through the rtz demonstrate the presence of newly formed as bearing mixed valent fe oxides kontny et al 2021 this finding suggests that fe2 is advected from the holocene aquifer into the rtz where it induces the transformation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides into a sequence of fe ii or mixed valence fe ii iii phases siderite pyrite goethite and haematite coatings and magnetite kontny et al 2021 accompanied by net as sorption and incorporation further along the groundwater flowpaths into the pleistocene aquifer as sorption onto the abundant fe oxyhydr oxides of the pleistocene sands attenuates the as concentrations to below 5 µg l eiche et al 2008 rathi et al 2017 neidhardt et al 2018 fig 2 wells 14 3 2 sources of dissolved organic matter the isotopic signatures of dissolved organic carbon δ 13c doc fig 3 a point to two distinct sources of om namely to i om originating from riverbank sediments δ 13c doc 28 0 1 to 27 5 1 and ii sedimentary om embedded in the aquitard δ 13c toc between 27 1 and 23 1 eiche et al 2017 these signatures are indicative of om derived from higher plant material and freshwater algae fry and sherr 1984 campeau et al 2017 eiche et al 2017 additional doc is possibly sourced from within the aquifer itself where isolated intercalations of up to 1 wt of om exist with δ 13c toc signatures around 25 eiche et al 2017 however the aquifer s average toc content is very low 0 03 wt eiche et al 2008 and therefore unlikely to provide a sizeable contribution to driving biogeochemical transformations this is in agreement with a recent reactive transport modelling analysis of the van phuc site that suggested negligible om reactivity in the holocene aquifer sands while identifying the riverbank groundwater interface as the dominant hotspot for om turnover and associated as release wallis et al 2020 overall taking into account that i the highest doc 5 7 mg l concentrations are present below the aquitard holocene aquifer hydraulic connections and ii the water isotopes indicate pore water infiltration from the aquitard we conclude that the elevated doc concentrations and the corresponding δ 13c doc signatures in parts of the holocene aquifer fig 2 and fig 3a wells 4 6a 8a are indicative of om infiltrating from the aquitard 3 3 fermentation of dissolved organic carbon compared to the aquitard sedimentary δ 13c toc signatures of 20 to 27 at the site eiche et al 2008 flowpath 2 and to the δ 13c doc signatures of 27 5 1 to 28 1 in riverbank porewater flowpath 1 the δ 13c doc values in the studied groundwaters 28 1 to 31 1 were slightly lower fig 3a this observation is consistent with the occurrence of anaerobic fermentation of om to small molecules including e g propionate and acetate a process that is characterised by a generally very small isotopic enrichment or even some depletion botsch and conrad 2011 conrad et al 2014 moreover our recent microbiological companion study glodowska et al 2021 identified active and abundant bacterial communities capable of fermentative metabolism in all groundwater samples fermentative metabolisms generally produce co2 h2 and a broad range of short chain c compounds from larger organic molecules and hence transform rather recalcitrant om to more bioavailable compounds mcmahon and chapelle 1991 chapelle 2000 subsequently fermentation products may serve as substrates for both methanogenesis and the microbial reduction of fe iii oxyhydr oxides glodowska et al 2020a 3 4 dic isotopes indicative of methanogenesis and methanotrophy dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations successively rise along the groundwater flowpath 1 from 18 mg c l in the red river to 23 28 mg c l in riverbank pore water and generally reach 100 200 mg c l in the holocene aquifer after a few hundred meters fig 2 and 3b this increase in dic is attributed to both the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the high biogeochemical turnover of the freshly deposited om in the riverbank sediments stahl et al 2016 wallis et al 2020 likely followed by much more slowly progressing fermentation reactions within the holocene aquifer stopelli et al 2020 glodowska et al 2021 our carbon isotope δ 13c dic data reveal a more complex picture compared to the dic concentrations alone fig 2 and fig 3b the almost uniform isotopic dic signatures of 8 6 2 to 11 1 2 in river water riverbank pore water and in holocene groundwater close to the river fig 3b wells 1 and 2 reflect atmospheric co2 8 to 9 and dissolution of freshwater carbonates co3² 5 to 15 while the influence of om oxidation 10 to 25 clark and fritz 1997 campeau et al 2017 in the riverbank sediments is less obvious further along groundwater flowpaths 1 and 2 the δ 13c dic values increase from 9 2 to 3 2 with dic becoming enriched in 13c in the holocene aquifer fig 2 and fig 3b in contrast while progressing towards the rtz and the pleistocene aquifer the decrease in δ 13c dic values to 17 2 indicates a preferential enrichment of 12c dic in groundwater prior to a final increase to background values between 7 2 and 13 2 in the pleistocene wells most distant from the riverbank fig 3b these contrasting δ 13c dic isotopic shifts are likely caused by the succession of methanogenesis where co2 is consumed followed by methanotrophy where co2 is produced respectively murphy et al 1989 campeau et al 2017 3 5 methane cycling along the groundwater flowpaths ch4 locally reaches very high concentrations of up to 58 mg l especially below the aquitard aquifer hydraulic connections fig 2 we suggest that the production of ch4 in the holocene aquifer is attributed to a two step process involving i a substrate producing fermentation step and ii methanogenesis conrad et al 2014 glodowska et al 2021 furthermore the decrease of methane concentrations across the rtz and the enrichment in the dic isotopy is a strong indication of methanotrophy the indicated methane cycling is corroborated by a recent microbial community analysis that showed the presence of both methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms in the holocene aquifer and at the rtz i e methyloparacocci methylomonaceae candidatus methanoperdens glodowska et al 2020b 2021 the carbon isotope signatures of ch4 δ 13c ch4 span a remarkably wide range from 87 2 to 47 2 δ 134 in the holocene aquifer the low δ 13c ch4 signatures between 87 2 and 75 2 fig 3c grey dots are typical for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis where the isotopically lighter 12co2 is kinetically favoured over 13co2 during transformation to ch4 whiticar 1999 liu et al 2009 conrad et al 2014 campeau et al 2017 accordingly the preferred consumption of 12co2 is reflected in the simultaneous increase of δ 13c in the bulk dic fig 3b and fig s3 note that the isotopic shift of dic is much lower than that of ch4 because co2 has a high background concentration in the form of hco3 the δ 13c ch4 signatures in three wells located within the holocene aquifer along flowpath 2 fig 4 are somewhat less negative 76 2 wells 6a 8a and 9a in fig 3c while the ch4 concentrations are 40 58 mg l which is close to or even above saturation at the given temperature and hydraulic pressure conditions saturation approx 43 to 63 mg l for wells screened at 20 m and 30 m respectively considering an average water table level of 8 m b g l therefore and based on noble gas investigations in groundwater of these wells we hypothesise that an interstitial free ch4 gas phase has formed which now occupies part of the pore space lightfoot et al 2020 accompanied by a slight isotopic enrichment of ch4 in groundwater as the lighter 12ch4 diffuses more easily into the gas phase than 13ch4 xia and tang 2012 further along flowpath 2 into the rtz and in the pleistocene aquifer fig 3c yellow and brown dots dissolved ch4 decreases sharply to below 0 5 mg l wells 12 and 13a while δ 13c ch4 values increase from 87 2 up to 47 2 δ 134 this is a strong indication of methane oxidation by methanotrophy where the preferred consumption of the isotopically lighter 12ch4 causes this remarkable isotopic enrichment in turn the co2 produced from methane oxidation is likely causing the observed decrease in δ 13c dic fig 3b and fig s3 finally the resulting rise in hco3 has most likely caused siderite feco3 oversaturation and precipitation explaining the presence of the latter within the rtz sediments kontny et al 2021 this hypothesised precipitation of carbonates can also explain the lower δ 13c dic signatures observed within the rtz as a result of the preferential precipitation of 13c carbonate 4 conclusions as conceptually illustrated in fig 4 our hydrochemical and stable carbon isotope analyses suggest that fermentation methanogenesis and methanotrophy can significantly affect carbon cycling in high as aquifers in previous analyses of as contaminated sites fermentative processes have largely been overlooked even though these processes transform om to small reactive molecules that can be utilized for methanogenesis and supply additional electron donating capacity for fe iii reduction therefore fermentation likely has important implications for the mobilisation and subsequent fate of as our study demonstrates that om rich pore waters infiltrating from aquitard sediments are accompanied by particularly high as concentrations in the aquifer consistent with recent findings from other as contaminated sites erban et al 2013 mihajlov et al 2020 while slowly percolating through the aquitard pore waters become enriched in doc and nh4 by the decomposition of sedimentary om during this percolation and or upon egress into the aquifer the doc can locally promote methanogenesis and fe iii reduction and thereby result in substantial as mobilisation in the affected parts of the aquifers fig 4 hence such highly reducing methanogenic zones likely contribute to the widely observed heterogeneity in groundwater as concentrations at these locations oversaturation of methane can lead to the formation of interstitial gas bubbles lightfoot et al 2020 which we hypothesize to locally obstruct the groundwater flow as reported previously for petroleum contaminated aquifers amos et al 2011 as well as for sites affected by denitrification and n2 gas formation ryan et al 2000 at our study site the overall effect of slow transport processes and accordingly sufficiently long reaction times for the development of highly reducing conditions is reflected in particularly high as concentrations 200 µg l i e 20 times the who guideline value that are predominantly found under methanogenic conditions furthermore our new data provide for the first time field based hydrochemical and isotopic evidence for methanotrophy to occur where ch4 enriched groundwater infiltrating from the holocene aquifer comes in contact with the abundant fe iii oxyhydr oxides contained in the pleistocene sediments fig 4 flowpath 2 this field observation is consistent with recent results of laboratory incubation experiments with pleistocene sediments from the rtz at our field site which demonstrated the occurrence of ch4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction and as mobilisation glodowska et al 2020b interestingly this finding is also in line with investigations carried out at a crude oil contaminated site in minnesota usa where methanogenesis coupled to iron reduction in the anaerobic core of the plume was shown to be an important process amos et al 2011 2012 consequently the as retardation capacity previously attributed to the high sorption capacity of rtz sediments specifically that associated with fe ii iii and fe iii minerals eiche et al 2008 rathi et al 2017 neidhardt et al 2018 kontny et al 2021 might be reduced under methanotrophic conditions here we showed how methane cycling contributes to the patchiness of redox conditions in aquifers and hence to the variability in groundwater of as concentrations particularly in aquifer zones characterized by slow advection flowpath 2 fig 4 in contrast in the more permeable aquifer sections where higher flow velocities persist flowpath 1 fig 4 methane cycling plays a minor role and as concentrations remain lower nevertheless overall mass fluxes of as will be largely controlled by these more permeable zones eventually both regimes high as conc small flux vs lower as conc high flux need to be understood and

16952,geogenic arsenic as contamination of groundwater is a health threat to millions of people worldwide particularly in alluvial regions of south and southeast asia mitigation measures are often hindered by high heterogeneities in as concentrations the cause s of which are elusive here we used a comprehensive suite of stable isotope analyses and hydrogeochemical parameters to shed light on the mechanisms in a typical high as holocene aquifer near hanoi where groundwater is advected to a low as pleistocene aquifer carbon isotope signatures δ 13c ch4 δ 13c doc δ 13c dic provided evidence that fermentation methanogenesis and methanotrophy are actively contributing to the as heterogeneity methanogenesis occurred concurrently where as levels are high 200 µg l and doc enriched aquitard pore water infiltrates into the aquifer along the flowpath to the holocene pleistocene aquifer transition methane oxidation causes a strong shift in δ 13c ch4 from 87 to 47 indicating high reactivity

water geogenic as contamination heterogeneity organic matter carbon isotope δ13c 1 introduction the health of tens of millions of people worldwide is affected by chronic exposure to arsenic polluted groundwater resources who 2011 karagas et al 2015 podgorski and berg 2020 diseases caused by this exposure are particularly common in the floodplains and deltas of the large east and south asian river systems smith et al 2000 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 berg et al 2007 fendorf et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 there the natural abundance of bioavailable natural organic matter om in geologically young holocene depositions often leads to hydrogeochemical conditions under which the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxyhydr oxide minerals triggers as release and widespread groundwater as pollution smedley and kinniburgh 2002 islam et al 2004 stuckey et al 2016 in contrast older sediments of the pleistocene period generally exhibit less reducing aquifer conditions with as concentrations usually 10 µg l a striking feature of as affected aquifers is the high local scale spatial variability of as concentrations van geen et al 2006 eiche et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 cozzarelli et al 2016 ziegler et al 2017 polya et al 2019 which is thought to be linked to hydrogeological heterogeneities and to associated variations in dominating redox processes besides fe iii oxyhydr oxides and other redox sensitive mineral phases the abundance of dissolved sulphate so4 2 and the formation of as sulphide minerals has also been recognised to impact the mobility of as bostick and fendorf 2003 buschmann and berg 2009 furthermore the bioavailable om in young riverbank deposits ponds or channel infill plays an important role in creating hot spots of as mobilisation while older sedimentary om which tends to be more recalcitrant is of lower significance harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 rowland et al 2007 polizzotto et al 2008 neumann et al 2010 postma et al 2012 lawson et al 2016 kulkarni et al 2017 richards et al 2019 glodowska et al 2020a wallis et al 2020 however in that context the role of methane ch4 cycling has rarely been considered especially in natural settings polya et al 2019 although several studies detected ch4 in as contaminated aquifers liu et al 2009 postma et al 2012 2016 sø et al 2018 and indicated that elevated ch4 and as concentrations might be related buschmann and berg 2009 sracek et al 2018 on larger scales 100 m to kilometre and based on the genesis and the resulting mineralogical characteristics of pleistocene and holocene sediments high and low as aquifers often show highly contrasting redox conditions they are found adjacent to each other separated by redox transition zones rtz generally the formation and stability of rtz is linked to a variety of factors including the interaction of transport processes microbial activity and the stability of as host mineral phases mainly fe bearing phases here we present a first detailed isotope study of ch4 and c cycling and its potential impact on as mobility at the metre to kilometre scale our field site at van phuc near hanoi vietnam has previously been

discussion 3 1 hydrology and hydrogeochemical evolution of as contamination a comprehensive set of stable isotope signatures and hydrochemical parameters see methods was determined from groundwater and surface water samples collected along a 2 km long transect that follows the average groundwater flow direction towards hanoi as inferred from previous hydrological hydrochemical and numerical studies fig 1 van geen et al 2013 stopelli et al 2020 wallis et al 2020 river water infiltration is the main source of groundwater recharge at the study site with young om and fe iii rich riverbank sediments fig 2 creating a hot spot of arsenic release at the red river groundwater interface stahl et al 2016 stopelli et al 2020 wallis et al 2020 dissolved as is then advected into and within the holocene aquifer where concentrations initially range between 20 and 200 µg l fig 2 wells 2 to 5 hereafter indicated as flowpath 1 further along the groundwater flow direction dissolved as reaches up to 540 µg l in the holocene aquifer fig 2 wells 6 to 8 the highest dissolved as concentrations are found in the wells that also show the largest concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc ammonium nh4 and dissolved methane ch4 that is 5 7 mg doc l 50 65 mg nh4 n l and 40 58 mg ch4 l respectively fig 2 and fig s6 for nh4 the water isotope signatures in these wells δ 18o 6 1 are indicative of evaporative water that locally infiltrates from the aquitard into the aquifer fig 2 rather than of water originating from red river bank infiltration sediment coring revealed substantial lithological heterogeneity in the clayey aquitard deposits including sandy intercalations caused by alternating riverine and marine depositions during the holocene period eiche et al 2008 2017 trung et al 2020 kontny et al 2021 it was also shown that aquitard depositions contain up to 9 wt of sedimentary om eiche et al 2008 glodowska et al 2020a the doc enriched pore water 5 7 mg c l see fig 2 that evolves as it percolates through the sandy intercalations creates locally highly reducing conditions as it egresses into the underlying aquifer hereafter indicated as flowpath 2 our mixing calculations based on the water isotope ratios δ 18o and δ 2h suggest that groundwater collected just below the aquitard i e wells 6a and 8a in fig 2 consist of up to 92 aquitard pore water see supplementary section si 1 for calculations along with aquitard pore water compositions at the rtz that marks the interface between the holocene and the pleistocene aquifers both dissolved as and fe concentrations sharply decrease fig 2 wells 9 to 13 and fig s2 while mn concentrations increase fig s2 high resolution mineralogical analyses of a sediment core that was drilled through the rtz demonstrate the presence of newly formed as bearing mixed valent fe oxides kontny et al 2021 this finding suggests that fe2 is advected from the holocene aquifer into the rtz where it induces the transformation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides into a sequence of fe ii or mixed valence fe ii iii phases siderite pyrite goethite and haematite coatings and magnetite kontny et al 2021 accompanied by net as sorption and incorporation further along the groundwater flowpaths into the pleistocene aquifer as sorption onto the abundant fe oxyhydr oxides of the pleistocene sands attenuates the as concentrations to below 5 µg l eiche et al 2008 rathi et al 2017 neidhardt et al 2018 fig 2 wells 14 3 2 sources of dissolved organic matter the isotopic signatures of dissolved organic carbon δ 13c doc fig 3 a point to two distinct sources of om namely to i om originating from riverbank sediments δ 13c doc 28 0 1 to 27 5 1 and ii sedimentary om embedded in the aquitard δ 13c toc between 27 1 and 23 1 eiche et al 2017 these signatures are indicative of om derived from higher plant material and freshwater algae fry and sherr 1984 campeau et al 2017 eiche et al 2017 additional doc is possibly sourced from within the aquifer itself where isolated intercalations of up to 1 wt of om exist with δ 13c toc signatures around 25 eiche et al 2017 however the aquifer s average toc content is very low 0 03 wt eiche et al 2008 and therefore unlikely to provide a sizeable contribution to driving biogeochemical transformations this is in agreement with a recent reactive transport modelling analysis of the van phuc site that suggested negligible om reactivity in the holocene aquifer sands while identifying the riverbank groundwater interface as the dominant hotspot for om turnover and associated as release wallis et al 2020 overall taking into account that i the highest doc 5 7 mg l concentrations are present below the aquitard holocene aquifer hydraulic connections and ii the water isotopes indicate pore water infiltration from the aquitard we conclude that the elevated doc concentrations and the corresponding δ 13c doc signatures in parts of the holocene aquifer fig 2 and fig 3a wells 4 6a 8a are indicative of om infiltrating from the aquitard 3 3 fermentation of dissolved organic carbon compared to the aquitard sedimentary δ 13c toc signatures of 20 to 27 at the site eiche et al 2008 flowpath 2 and to the δ 13c doc signatures of 27 5 1 to 28 1 in riverbank porewater flowpath 1 the δ 13c doc values in the studied groundwaters 28 1 to 31 1 were slightly lower fig 3a this observation is consistent with the occurrence of anaerobic fermentation of om to small molecules including e g propionate and acetate a process that is characterised by a generally very small isotopic enrichment or even some depletion botsch and conrad 2011 conrad et al 2014 moreover our recent microbiological companion study glodowska et al 2021 identified active and abundant bacterial communities capable of fermentative metabolism in all groundwater samples fermentative metabolisms generally produce co2 h2 and a broad range of short chain c compounds from larger organic molecules and hence transform rather recalcitrant om to more bioavailable compounds mcmahon and chapelle 1991 chapelle 2000 subsequently fermentation products may serve as substrates for both methanogenesis and the microbial reduction of fe iii oxyhydr oxides glodowska et al 2020a 3 4 dic isotopes indicative of methanogenesis and methanotrophy dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations successively rise along the groundwater flowpath 1 from 18 mg c l in the red river to 23 28 mg c l in riverbank pore water and generally reach 100 200 mg c l in the holocene aquifer after a few hundred meters fig 2 and 3b this increase in dic is attributed to both the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the high biogeochemical turnover of the freshly deposited om in the riverbank sediments stahl et al 2016 wallis et al 2020 likely followed by much more slowly progressing fermentation reactions within the holocene aquifer stopelli et al 2020 glodowska et al 2021 our carbon isotope δ 13c dic data reveal a more complex picture compared to the dic concentrations alone fig 2 and fig 3b the almost uniform isotopic dic signatures of 8 6 2 to 11 1 2 in river water riverbank pore water and in holocene groundwater close to the river fig 3b wells 1 and 2 reflect atmospheric co2 8 to 9 and dissolution of freshwater carbonates co3² 5 to 15 while the influence of om oxidation 10 to 25 clark and fritz 1997 campeau et al 2017 in the riverbank sediments is less obvious further along groundwater flowpaths 1 and 2 the δ 13c dic values increase from 9 2 to 3 2 with dic becoming enriched in 13c in the holocene aquifer fig 2 and fig 3b in contrast while progressing towards the rtz and the pleistocene aquifer the decrease in δ 13c dic values to 17 2 indicates a preferential enrichment of 12c dic in groundwater prior to a final increase to background values between 7 2 and 13 2 in the pleistocene wells most distant from the riverbank fig 3b these contrasting δ 13c dic isotopic shifts are likely caused by the succession of methanogenesis where co2 is consumed followed by methanotrophy where co2 is produced respectively murphy et al 1989 campeau et al 2017 3 5 methane cycling along the groundwater flowpaths ch4 locally reaches very high concentrations of up to 58 mg l especially below the aquitard aquifer hydraulic connections fig 2 we suggest that the production of ch4 in the holocene aquifer is attributed to a two step process involving i a substrate producing fermentation step and ii methanogenesis conrad et al 2014 glodowska et al 2021 furthermore the decrease of methane concentrations across the rtz and the enrichment in the dic isotopy is a strong indication of methanotrophy the indicated methane cycling is corroborated by a recent microbial community analysis that showed the presence of both methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms in the holocene aquifer and at the rtz i e methyloparacocci methylomonaceae candidatus methanoperdens glodowska et al 2020b 2021 the carbon isotope signatures of ch4 δ 13c ch4 span a remarkably wide range from 87 2 to 47 2 δ 134 in the holocene aquifer the low δ 13c ch4 signatures between 87 2 and 75 2 fig 3c grey dots are typical for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis where the isotopically lighter 12co2 is kinetically favoured over 13co2 during transformation to ch4 whiticar 1999 liu et al 2009 conrad et al 2014 campeau et al 2017 accordingly the preferred consumption of 12co2 is reflected in the simultaneous increase of δ 13c in the bulk dic fig 3b and fig s3 note that the isotopic shift of dic is much lower than that of ch4 because co2 has a high background concentration in the form of hco3 the δ 13c ch4 signatures in three wells located within the holocene aquifer along flowpath 2 fig 4 are somewhat less negative 76 2 wells 6a 8a and 9a in fig 3c while the ch4 concentrations are 40 58 mg l which is close to or even above saturation at the given temperature and hydraulic pressure conditions saturation approx 43 to 63 mg l for wells screened at 20 m and 30 m respectively considering an average water table level of 8 m b g l therefore and based on noble gas investigations in groundwater of these wells we hypothesise that an interstitial free ch4 gas phase has formed which now occupies part of the pore space lightfoot et al 2020 accompanied by a slight isotopic enrichment of ch4 in groundwater as the lighter 12ch4 diffuses more easily into the gas phase than 13ch4 xia and tang 2012 further along flowpath 2 into the rtz and in the pleistocene aquifer fig 3c yellow and brown dots dissolved ch4 decreases sharply to below 0 5 mg l wells 12 and 13a while δ 13c ch4 values increase from 87 2 up to 47 2 δ 134 this is a strong indication of methane oxidation by methanotrophy where the preferred consumption of the isotopically lighter 12ch4 causes this remarkable isotopic enrichment in turn the co2 produced from methane oxidation is likely causing the observed decrease in δ 13c dic fig 3b and fig s3 finally the resulting rise in hco3 has most likely caused siderite feco3 oversaturation and precipitation explaining the presence of the latter within the rtz sediments kontny et al 2021 this hypothesised precipitation of carbonates can also explain the lower δ 13c dic signatures observed within the rtz as a result of the preferential precipitation of 13c carbonate 4 conclusions as conceptually illustrated in fig 4 our hydrochemical and stable carbon isotope analyses suggest that fermentation methanogenesis and methanotrophy can significantly affect carbon cycling in high as aquifers in previous analyses of as contaminated sites fermentative processes have largely been overlooked even though these processes transform om to small reactive molecules that can be utilized for methanogenesis and supply additional electron donating capacity for fe iii reduction therefore fermentation likely has important implications for the mobilisation and subsequent fate of as our study demonstrates that om rich pore waters infiltrating from aquitard sediments are accompanied by particularly high as concentrations in the aquifer consistent with recent findings from other as contaminated sites erban et al 2013 mihajlov et al 2020 while slowly percolating through the aquitard pore waters become enriched in doc and nh4 by the decomposition of sedimentary om during this percolation and or upon egress into the aquifer the doc can locally promote methanogenesis and fe iii reduction and thereby result in substantial as mobilisation in the affected parts of the aquifers fig 4 hence such highly reducing methanogenic zones likely contribute to the widely observed heterogeneity in groundwater as concentrations at these locations oversaturation of methane can lead to the formation of interstitial gas bubbles lightfoot et al 2020 which we hypothesize to locally obstruct the groundwater flow as reported previously for petroleum contaminated aquifers amos et al 2011 as well as for sites affected by denitrification and n2 gas formation ryan et al 2000 at our study site the overall effect of slow transport processes and accordingly sufficiently long reaction times for the development of highly reducing conditions is reflected in particularly high as concentrations 200 µg l i e 20 times the who guideline value that are predominantly found under methanogenic conditions furthermore our new data provide for the first time field based hydrochemical and isotopic evidence for methanotrophy to occur where ch4 enriched groundwater infiltrating from the holocene aquifer comes in contact with the abundant fe iii oxyhydr oxides contained in the pleistocene sediments fig 4 flowpath 2 this field observation is consistent with recent results of laboratory incubation experiments with pleistocene sediments from the rtz at our field site which demonstrated the occurrence of ch4 oxidation coupled with fe iii reduction and as mobilisation glodowska et al 2020b interestingly this finding is also in line with investigations carried out at a crude oil contaminated site in minnesota usa where methanogenesis coupled to iron reduction in the anaerobic core of the plume was shown to be an important process amos et al 2011 2012 consequently the as retardation capacity previously attributed to the high sorption capacity of rtz sediments specifically that associated with fe ii iii and fe iii minerals eiche et al 2008 rathi et al 2017 neidhardt et al 2018 kontny et al 2021 might be reduced under methanotrophic conditions here we showed how methane cycling contributes to the patchiness of redox conditions in aquifers and hence to the variability in groundwater of as concentrations particularly in aquifer zones characterized by slow advection flowpath 2 fig 4 in contrast in the more permeable aquifer sections where higher flow velocities persist flowpath 1 fig 4 methane cycling plays a minor role and as concentrations remain lower nevertheless overall mass fluxes of as will be largely controlled by these more permeable zones eventually both regimes high as conc small flux vs lower as conc high flux need to be understood and

16953,we developed a comprehensive integrated water quality modeling approach towards a better understanding of the fate and transport of emerging contaminants and comprehensive assessment of their potential risks in a tropical reservoir two representative emerging contaminants namely bisphenol a bpa and n n diethyltoluamide deet were selected for this study unlike the traditional water quality modeling approach the target emerging contaminants were modelled in four multi compartments and coupled to a 3d dimensional eutrophication model to investigate their interactions with other water quality state variables first the integrated model was calibrated and validated in four multi compartments against an observed dataset in 2014 subsequently the correlation analysis between emerging contaminants and general water quality parameters were conducted the potential ecological risks in this reservoir were also assessed via the trophic state index tsi and coupled to a species sensitivity distribution ssd risk quotient rq method finally the model was applied to describe the dynamics of the two emerging contaminants and examine the direct and indirect influences of other environmental factors on their multi compartment distributions in the aquatic environment the comprehensive approach provides new insights into dynamic modeling of the fate and transport of emerging contaminants their interactions with other state variables as well as an assessment of their potential risks in aquatic ecosystems keywords emerging contaminants fate and transport multi compartments integrated modeling approach risk assessment 1 introduction the presence of emerging contaminants ecs of concern including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in the aquatic environment has been a worldwide environmental concern tran et al 2019 bisphenol a bpa and n n diethyltoluamide deet are two representative emerging contaminants of edcs and ppcps bpa is widely used in plasticizers paints heat stabilizers as well as many consumer products including food containers medical equipment etc vandenberg et al 2007 many in vitro assays and animal tests have verified the adverse impacts of bpa on metabolic immune and neurological systems wang et al 2018 deet is an active component of insect repellents and has also been widely used in resin solvents and film formers amichai et al 1994 deet can inhibit feeding and elicit avoidance behaviors in insects lee et al 2010 and also affect non target organisms in aquatic environments gao et al 2020 these micropollutants have been detected not only in aquatic ecosystems lópez doval et al 2017 but also both in biota salgueiro gonzález et al 2015 and human bodies huang et al 2017 vandenberg et al 2007 the ubiquity of ppcps and edcs may pose adverse impacts on ecosystem and human health even at trace concentration levels ebele et al 2017 tran et al 2018 in order to better manage these micropollutants in aquatic environments the foremost thing to know is where these compounds originate their pathways and destinations as well as their interactions with variable environments wilkinson et al 2017 the occurrence of micropollutants and their potential effects on the ecosystem have been widely studied via sampling campaigns boyd et al 2003 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 tran et al 2019 you et al 2015 and laboratory work mao et al 2020 villeneuve et al 2012 however the available data are still limited as sampling campaigns in the natural environment are costly time consuming and hard to sustain murray et al 2010 in addition the limited sampling points of a few stations make it difficult to spatiotemporally interpret a full scale dynamic distribution of the contaminants in the entire study area one of the important tools to investigate the emerging contaminant pollution problem is the numerical simulation of their fate and transport datta et al 2018 where simulation results can track the spatiotemporal dynamics of emerging contaminants at high resolution tong et al 2021 wellen et al 2015 and thus can supplement existing monitoring campaigns the chemical substances present in complex mixtures can interact with the surrounding environment synergistically or antagonistically lópez doval et al 2017 general water quality parameters such as ph dissolved oxygen nitrogen phosphorus organic carbon and chlorophyll a are monitored routinely due to their critical influence on water quality álvarez cabria et al 2016 ding et al 2016 these general water quality parameters also have direct e g ph hua et al 2019 or indirect e g toc lv et al 2020 nutrients aristi et al 2016 gonzález acevedo et al 2019 and phytoplankton xiong et al 2018 influences on the transport and fate of emerging contaminants shi et al 2017 investigated the interactions between algal blooms of phytoplankton and hydrophobic organic chemicals using years of field observations and suggested that the dynamics should be included in models in the future however previous modeling studies only focus on the kinetics of emerging contaminants themselves without consideration of their interactions with other general water quality parameters e g indirect impacts li et al 2017 wang et al 2019a xu et al 2017 which may not represent realistic environmental conditions and thus could lead to incorrect estimates in terms of their distributions in different phases e g dissolved and suspended solid phases in water column particulate and pore water phases in sediment this coupled modeling approach not only includes different ec processes directly related to their own unique properties but also considers their interactions with other water quality state variables indirect impacts in this way a more holistic picture of actual environmental conditions is simulated resulting in a better understanding of the fate and transport of emerging contaminants and subsequent assessment of their potential impacts and risks the distribution of emerging contaminants can be divided into several compartments bulk water bw and suspended solids ss in the water column pore water pw and sediments sed in the benthic layer in the aquatic environment benedé et al 2014 pico et al 2012 most of the studies focused on surface waters and sediments however studies of porewater and organic matter are limited chen et al 2019a mao et al 2018 emerging contaminants associated with suspended solids are inferred to influence the water quality in the water column through partition sorption and desorption as well as benthic sediments through sedimentation and resuspension mao et al 2018 which determine the important processes of fate and transport of emerging contaminants in the aquatic system thus it is essential to simulate the multi compartment distribution of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment however very few modeling approaches have been conducted on multimedia distributions of organic pollutants in aquatic environments kong et al 2018 especially when integrated with general water quality state variables to assess the indirect impacts eutrophication which is caused by the enrichment of nutrients is one of the most challenging environmental problems worldwide conley et al 2009 eutrophication not only brings aesthetic and recreational interferences but also may pose high risks to the ecosystem due to the release of toxins and allelopathic substances during harmful algal blooms tran et al 2020 it is well known that the amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen determine the eutrophication levels in the aquatic environment chen et al 2019b conley et al 2009 rousso et al 2020 therefore trophic status is one of the important criteria for water quality assessment christia et al 2014 cunha et al 2013 however the analysis of non regulated substances such as emerging contaminants is generally non mandatory for current water quality assessment you et al 2010 recent studies have provided evidence for the ubiquitous distribution of emerging contaminants in freshwater that have potential risks on the ecosystem gonzález gonzález et al 2014 wright walters et al 2011 to comprehensively evaluate contamination levels in aquatic ecosystems a risk assessment of emerging contaminants should also be conducted to provide guidance for control and regulation of the usage and release of emerging contaminants into water bodies hence a coupled water quality risk assessment model would be an effective tool that can be applied to conduct assessment of both water quality e g trophic state index and potential ecological risks of the emerging contaminants the objectives of this study are to a develop a comprehensive three dimensional hydrodynamic eutrophication risk assessment model of emerging contaminants for a tropical reservoir in singapore in this study among the more than 100 simulated water quality state variables parameters seven of them namely total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp chlorophyll a chl a nitrite no3 n dissolved oxygen do total organic carbon toc total suspended solids tss and two representative emerging contaminants i e bisphenol a bpa and n n diethyltoluamide deet were modeled in four environmental compartments bulk water bw and suspended solids ss in the water column pore water pw and sediments sed in the sediment layer b conduct correlation analysis between general water quality parameters and emerging contaminants under prevailing environmental conditions c conduct a comprehensive risk of emerging contaminants and trophic level nutrients and chlorophyll a assessment in terms of spatial and temporal distributions d explore the influence of limiting nutrients on the distributions of emerging contaminants in the four environmental compartments the new insights from the integrated 3d hydrodynamic eutrophication emerging contaminants risk assessment heecra model can help better understand the direct and indirect effects of environmental conditions on the dynamic distribution of emerging contaminants and thereby comprehensively elucidate their fate and transport in the aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling campaign the study area is a highly urbanized catchment that covers five tributaries and a tropical reservoir in singapore which is used for rainfall harvesting and recreational activities fig s1 details of description for the catchment can be found from previous studies chen et al 2019a you et al 2015 there are no effluent discharge points in the study area since wastewater is not directly discharged to inland surface waters in singapore the sampling campaign was conducted monthly from jan 2013 to jan 2014 at five tributaries and three locations within the reservoir s1 s2 s4 the water samples collected from a depth of 0 0 2 m were filled into 1 0 l amber water bottles for the chemical analysis the sediment samples were collected from the top 10 0 cm of the benthic sediment layer using a stainless steel grabber bpa and deet in different compartments bulk water suspended solids pore water and sediments were analyzed the analytical methods of detection for the emerging contaminants bpa and deet and environmental parameters are given in the supplementary material 2 2 modeling framework the integrated three dimensional hydrodynamic eutrophication emerging contaminants risk assessment heecra model included four vertical water layers and one sediment layer and was developed based on the delft 3d suite of models the 3d hydrodynamic model with four vertical layers for water quality was built up through a numerical calculation of non steady flow and transport phenomena resulting from bathymetry and meteorological forcing on a curvilinear and boundary fitted grid a z layer model was used in this hydrodynamic approach the 3d hydrodynamic model has been calibrated and validated in previous studies against the measurements of water level temperature and salinity and can simulate the hydrodynamic situation of the study area to a reasonable degree of accuracy wang et al 2019b the results of the hydrodynamic model were coupled to the eutrophication emerging contaminants model the kinetic processes of this model include two parts the eutrophication and emerging contaminants modules the simplified model framework is displayed by the flow charts in fig s2 all kinetic processes were included in the four environmental compartments i e dissolved in the water column and in the sediment pore water sorbed to particle in the water column and in the sediment layer the nutrients phytoplankton organic matter dissolved oxygen suspended solids salinity were modeled in the eutrophication module the emerging contaminants module was based on numerical solutions of a physical transport processes including advection dispersion settling sorption and desorption and b biochemical processes including degradation mineralization and conversion the state variables in the eutrophication model were linked to the components in the emerging contaminants model which allows the interactions between general water quality parameters and emerging contaminants the examination of water quality and ecological status in this reservoir was integrated into the model via calculation of the trophic state index tsi for eutrophication and analyzing the species sensitivity distribution ssd risk quotient rq for emerging contaminants bpa and deet the detailed information for model setup and description is provided in the supplementary material 2 3 modeling scenarios the modeling results represent the general water quality parameters and emerging contaminant levels under the current conditions scenario a baseline in order to explore the influence of nutrients on the distribution of emerging contaminants in the water column and in the sediments another calculation scheme was designed based on the primary limiting factor and nutrient contributions observed in the reservoir i e the input of dissolved phosphorous po4 3 was increased 3 times and other conditions remained unchanged scenario b 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation in this study field data at three observation stations in the reservoir from january 2013 to january 2014 were used to compare with the model results fig s3 the model was calibrated by measured data of s1 and validated by field data at stations s2 and s4 to evaluate the overall performance of the model for general water quality and emerging contaminant parameters the statistics metrics of root mean square error rmse the average standard deviation ard and the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse for each location are summarized in table s3 the nse values at all stations were ranged from 0 31 to 0 97 and all the ard values were smaller than 25 suggesting the simulated results yield good agreement with the observations to further understand the transport and fate of emerging contaminants in the ecosystem the distributions of modeled and measured emerging contaminants in four environmental compartments i e bulk water bw suspended solids ss pore water pw and sediments sed were investigated fig 1 the measured data are provided in table s4 the simulated results were consistent with the measured levels in the four compartments these results show that the calibrated model can be applied to describe the general water quality and emerging contaminants of the studied reservoir with a reasonable degree of accuracy the distribution of bpa and deet concentration in the water column and sediment layer showed opposite trends in the water column bulk water and suspended solids bpa and deet were predominately distributed in the dissolved phase bulk water accounting for approximately 98 4 and 99 0 of total concentrations in the water column respectively however in the benthic sediment layer bpa and deet were dominant in the sorbed phase sed with 94 8 and 92 3 contributions respectively the fraction of adsorbed bpa is larger than the fraction of adsorbed deet in either water column or sediment layer this is because the log kd value of bpa in either the water column or sediment layer is bigger than that of deet the benthic sediment layer is an organic rich matrix which could act as an accumulated charge sink for hydrophobic compounds and could be a secondary contamination source for the overlying water column through resuspension chen et al 2019a nevertheless there exist some differences between the measured and modeled concentrations for emerging contaminants which could be attributed to several reasons firstly the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment is usually at trace level concentrations ranging from ng l to µg l small deviations in the data value could be easily influenced by errors in sampling and analysis happonen et al 2016 furthermore some of the kinetic processes of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment still remain unclear wilkinson et al 2017 which introduce various inaccuracies in parameter estimation or assumptions with equations for process simulation datta et al 2018 for example the partitioning of emerging contaminants is described as an equilibrium process by means of a linear partition coefficient based on amounts of organic carbon d waq um 2009 however the dynamics of the sorption process is more complex hence a more comprehensive and dynamic sorption equation should be considered and incorporated in future modelling work besides many uncertainties originating from sampling methodologies happonen et al 2016 would also influence the results tran et al 2019 as well as measurement errors arising from the analytical detection of emerging contaminants petrović et al 2003 these may lead to considerable uncertainties in the simulated concentrations of emerging contaminants in addition calibration and validation are important steps to determine the model performance which require sufficient amounts and quality of observed data liu et al 2021 wang et al 2016 a rich historical environmental dataset e g a long period of time span and high frequency data can improve the accuracy of the model in the calibration and validation part of this study we considered bpa and deet in four compartments whereas for the general water quality variables only their dynamics in the water column were considered since available data was limited therefore the

et al 1997 therefore it is important to understand how photosynthesis is limited by nitrogen or phosphorus in the water body studies on freshwater lakes have shown that based on monitoring data high total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ratios greater than 10 normally result in phosphorus limitation for phytoplankton growth mccarthy et al 2009 first the average tn tp ratio of 29 was calculated using monitoring data that indicated phosphorus was the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth in the study area in addition based on the correlation analysis of model results for the total system a strong positive correlation r 0 72 between total phosphorus and chlorophyll a was observed whereas no obvious relationship r 0 1 was found between total nitrogen and chlorophyll a in the model algal growth was dynamically constrained by light and nutrients as simulated by the model in fig s4 thus the above results indicated that algal growth was mainly limited by phosphorus in the reservoir a

significant at the 0 05 level with 2 tailed table s5 from the results nutrients total nitrogen total phosphorus especially total phosphorus r 0 32 0 41 had strong positive correlations with emerging contaminant concentrations which implies that the emerging contaminants could potentially co occur with the nutrients input as the study area has no direct sewage discharge the co input of emerging contaminants and nutrients are likely to increase with non point source inputs such as diffuse inflows from urban runoff you et al 2015 or phosphorus release from anoxic anaerobic sediments yang et al 2020 the hypothesis of the co input source nutrients and emerging contaminants was also verified by the large negative correlation between dissolved oxygen and emerging contaminants r 0 63 0 26 it is well known that high concentrations of nutrients can enhance the primary productivity of phytoplankton which utilize dissolved oxygen as they decompose through mineralization process therefore reducing dissolved oxygen levels in the aquatic system manasrah et al 2006 at the same time lowered dissolved oxygen levels can trigger reducing conditions in the sediments thereby leading to phosphorus release from previously iron bound nutrients søndergaard et al 2003 3 3 comprehensive environmental risk assessment the spatial distributions of simulated results for 15 august are shown in fig 2 the reason why the model results of 15 august were selected for analysis was because the peak values occurred on this date which can provide us with the upper bound of potential risks to the ecosystem i e a conservative approach the available measured data for water quality parameters and emerging contaminants remain limited given that sampling campaigns in the natural environment are costly time consuming and difficult to obtain especially for emerging contaminants murray et al 2010 hence our model can be applied to investigate and predict the spatial and temporal distributions of the contaminants in the entire waterbody fig 2 shows that concentrations of bpa and deet in the northern part of the study area were higher than the rest of the area especially for the two tributaries in the upper region this can be explained by the close proximity of the two tributaries to high density commercial and residential areas in the city area where higher pollutant loads from human activities coupled to low dilution within smaller water volumes and potentially reduced photodegradation could have resulted in higher levels of contaminants you et al 2015 the ecotoxicity data for bpa and deet to freshwater species covering three trophic levels from literature are summarized in table s6 the simulation of species sensitivity distribution ssd yielded good fitting results with the fit coefficients of determinations r2 0 92 and 0 94 for bpa and deet respectively the confidence limits of hazardous concentrations protecting 95 of the species hc5 derived from ssd curves fig s5 were 0 0269 and 0 88 mg l respectively therefore based on equation s36 the pnec values for bpa and deet were estimated to be 6 725 and 22 000 ng l respectively using the predicted emerging contaminant levels pec and the predicted no effect concentrations pnec the spatial distribution of risk quotient for bpa and deet were plotted fig 2 common interpretations of the three risk levels were categorized as 0 01 rq 0 1 indicating low risk 0 1 rq 1 0 indicating medium risk and rq 1 0 indicating high risk the respective rq values of bpa and deet in the study area ranged from 0 002 0 045 bpa and 0 001 0 015 deet which indicate that the current emerging contaminant levels in the study area may pose low risk to the aquatic ecosystem apart from the spatial distribution a temporal ecological risk assessment was also conducted at the three reservoir stations and the entire reservoir fig 3 it is apparent that the rq values at s2 are higher than other stations regardless of bpa or deet due to the presence of the two tributaries with higher non point source contamination in general deet and bpa posed low ecosystem risk in the study period relatively higher ecological risks of emerging contaminants occurring approximately between august and september are consistent with the findings from our previous monitoring studies you et al 2015 the potential adverse effects of emerging contaminants also depend on the prevailing environmental e g nutrients trophic state temperature conductivity solar irradiation dissolved organic carbon amongst others and biological conditions e g parasitism predation invasive species amongst others holmstrup et al 2010 lópez doval et al 2017 thus the integrated ecological risk assessment for rq values emerging contaminants with the trophic state index nutrients and chlorophyll a has merit for this study the spatial distributions of nutrients fig 4 a and chlorophyll a fig 4b were different from that of the emerging contaminants where the high concentration regions for the former were located in the southwestern part of the study area and consistent with inputs from the tributary in that urbanized region in addition the trophic state index tsi fig 4c was also calculated based on the method provided by carlson 1977 carlson 1977 classified the tsi into four levels oligotrophic tsi 40 mesotrophic 40 tsi 50 eutrophic 50 tsi 70 and hypereutrophic tsi 70 according to this classification of tsi the trophic levels in the studied area ranged from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic with the southwestern area of the reservoir showing the highest tsi indicating hypereutrophic levels distinct gradients in nutrients and tsi with clearly defined spatial distributions were observed in different parts of the reservoir thus the model results can be potentially applied to link the pollution sources in the surrounding catchment area and provide management options for targeting specific locations of the reservoir 3 4 impacts of limited nutrients on multi compartment distribution of emerging contaminants the aquatic environment is a complex system where the transport and fate of emerging contaminants will depend on the interaction between the different phase compartments eutrophication is one of the primary environmental concerns worldwide from the above results the limited nutrient in the studied reservoir is phosphorus therefore to quantify the influence of limited nutrients on the dynamic distribution of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment we set the second model scheme scenario b where the input of dissolved phosphorus in the form of phosphate po4 3 was increased 3 times and other conditions remained unchanged the simulated results fig 5 showed that the total phosphorus and chlorophyll a content increased with increasing dissolved phosphorus po4 3 which is consistent with the previously stated results phosphorus was considered to be the primary nutrient limiting factor for phytoplankton growth in the study area the concentrations of bpa and deet in the entire water body remained constant fig 6 since we only changed the dissolved phosphorus po4 3 input which is consistent with the hypothesis however the fraction of free dissolved emerging contaminants in the water column decreased and the fraction of emerging contaminants sorbed to the suspended solids increased in scenario b fig 7 where the average fluctuations were about 0 26 and 0 14 for bpa and deet respectively the phytoplankton growth can be limited by multiple factors such as nutrients and lights liu et al 2021 yindong et al 2021 due to the fact that phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in the reservoir increasing po4 3 levels would induce the production of more phytoplankton which can act as particles that increase the sorption capacity in the water column mao et al 2018 thus nutrients can indirectly influence the distribution of emerging contaminants in the water column by affecting the number of suspended solids especially phytoplankton previous studies also reported that emerging contaminants can be removed by algae through adsorption bioaccumulation and intracellular and extracellular biodegradation xiong et al 2018 in the benthic sediments layer there was no significant difference in terms of the fraction of emerging contaminants in pore water sediment between scenarios a and b in which the fluctuations ranged from 0 0001 to 0 001 solar radiation is a key factor for photosynthesis of phytoplankton and light intensity diminishes exponentially down through the water column jassby and platt 1976 therefore with little phytoplankton growth near the sediments there was only a slight change in the sorption capacity in the sediment layer shi et al 2017 investigated the interactions between algal blooms of phytoplankton and hydrophobic organic chemicals using years of field observations and suggested that the dynamics should be included in models in the future also rodríguez escales and sánchez vila 2020 investigated the interactions between emerging organic compounds and biomass using laboratory experiments and kinetics modelling method thus future research could be directed towards the integration of field laboratory and model results to test hypotheses and determine how and to what extent nutrients and biomass may influence the distribution of emerging contaminants 4 conclusions this study presents a comprehensive modelling approach to understand the fate and transport of emerging contaminants bpa and deet in multi compartments and their interactions with other general water quality state variables as well as assess their potential risks in an aquatic ecosystem bpa and deet were predominately distributed in the dissolved phase in the water column but in the sorbed phase in the sediment layer our results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal distributions of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment can also be indirectly influenced by the variations of other general water quality state variables such as changes in limiting nutrient e g phosphorus concentrations through sorption processes associated with algae production strong positive correlations were observed between nutrients and emerging contaminants indicating the co occurrence of their pollution sources our assessment showed that the two studied compounds bpa and deet posed low risk to the aquatic ecosystem and the trophic levels in the studied area ranged from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic conditions during the period of analysis the comprehensive approach adopted in this study lays down a framework for integrating the various processes in a coupled hydrodynamic eutrophication emerging contaminants risk assessment model which can be used to explore other emerging contaminants this will provide useful information for policy makers in the sustainable management of aquatic ecosytems especially when dealing with rising concerns of

16953,we developed a comprehensive integrated water quality modeling approach towards a better understanding of the fate and transport of emerging contaminants and comprehensive assessment of their potential risks in a tropical reservoir two representative emerging contaminants namely bisphenol a bpa and n n diethyltoluamide deet were selected for this study unlike the traditional water quality modeling approach the target emerging contaminants were modelled in four multi compartments and coupled to a 3d dimensional eutrophication model to investigate their interactions with other water quality state variables first the integrated model was calibrated and validated in four multi compartments against an observed dataset in 2014 subsequently the correlation analysis between emerging contaminants and general water quality parameters were conducted the potential ecological risks in this reservoir were also assessed via the trophic state index tsi and coupled to a species sensitivity distribution ssd risk quotient rq method finally the model was applied to describe the dynamics of the two emerging contaminants and examine the direct and indirect influences of other environmental factors on their multi compartment distributions in the aquatic environment the comprehensive approach provides new insights into dynamic modeling of the fate and transport of emerging contaminants their interactions with other state variables as well as an assessment of their potential risks in aquatic ecosystems keywords emerging contaminants fate and transport multi compartments integrated modeling approach risk assessment 1 introduction the presence of emerging contaminants ecs of concern including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in the aquatic environment has been a worldwide environmental concern tran et al 2019 bisphenol a bpa and n n diethyltoluamide deet are two representative emerging contaminants of edcs and ppcps bpa is widely used in plasticizers paints heat stabilizers as well as many consumer products including food containers medical equipment etc vandenberg et al 2007 many in vitro assays and animal tests have verified the adverse impacts of bpa on metabolic immune and neurological systems wang et al 2018 deet is an active component of insect repellents and has also been widely used in resin solvents and film formers amichai et al 1994 deet can inhibit feeding and elicit avoidance behaviors in insects lee et al 2010 and also affect non target organisms in aquatic environments gao et al 2020 these micropollutants have been detected not only in aquatic ecosystems lópez doval et al 2017 but also both in biota salgueiro gonzález et al 2015 and human bodies huang et al 2017 vandenberg et al 2007 the ubiquity of ppcps and edcs may pose adverse impacts on ecosystem and human health even at trace concentration levels ebele et al 2017 tran et al 2018 in order to better manage these micropollutants in aquatic environments the foremost thing to know is where these compounds originate their pathways and destinations as well as their interactions with variable environments wilkinson et al 2017 the occurrence of micropollutants and their potential effects on the ecosystem have been widely studied via sampling campaigns boyd et al 2003 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 tran et al 2019 you et al 2015 and laboratory work mao et al 2020 villeneuve et al 2012 however the available data are still limited as sampling campaigns in the natural environment are costly time consuming and hard to sustain murray et al 2010 in addition the limited sampling points of a few stations make it difficult to spatiotemporally interpret a full scale dynamic distribution of the contaminants in the entire study area one of the important tools to investigate the emerging contaminant pollution problem is the numerical simulation of their fate and transport datta et al 2018 where simulation results can track the spatiotemporal dynamics of emerging contaminants at high resolution tong et al 2021 wellen et al 2015 and thus can supplement existing monitoring campaigns the chemical substances present in complex mixtures can interact with the surrounding environment synergistically or antagonistically lópez doval et al 2017 general water quality parameters such as ph dissolved oxygen nitrogen phosphorus organic carbon and chlorophyll a are monitored routinely due to their critical influence on water quality álvarez cabria et al 2016 ding et al 2016 these general water quality parameters also have direct e g ph hua et al 2019 or indirect e g toc lv et al 2020 nutrients aristi et al 2016 gonzález acevedo et al 2019 and phytoplankton xiong et al 2018 influences on the transport and fate of emerging contaminants shi et al 2017 investigated the interactions between algal blooms of phytoplankton and hydrophobic organic chemicals using years of field observations and suggested that the dynamics should be included in models in the future however previous modeling studies only focus on the kinetics of emerging contaminants themselves without consideration of their interactions with other general water quality parameters e g indirect impacts li et al 2017 wang et al 2019a xu et al 2017 which may not represent realistic environmental conditions and thus could lead to incorrect estimates in terms of their distributions in different phases e g dissolved and suspended solid phases in water column particulate and pore water phases in sediment this coupled modeling approach not only includes different ec processes directly related to their own unique properties but also considers their interactions with other water quality state variables indirect impacts in this way a more holistic picture of actual environmental conditions is simulated resulting in a better understanding of the fate and transport of emerging contaminants and subsequent assessment of their potential impacts and risks the distribution of emerging contaminants can be divided into several compartments bulk water bw and suspended solids ss in the water column pore water pw and sediments sed in the benthic layer in the aquatic environment benedé et al 2014 pico et al 2012 most of the studies focused on surface waters and sediments however studies of porewater and organic matter are limited chen et al 2019a mao et al 2018 emerging contaminants associated with suspended solids are inferred to influence the water quality in the water column through partition sorption and desorption as well as benthic sediments through sedimentation and resuspension mao et al 2018 which determine the important processes of fate and transport of emerging contaminants in the aquatic system thus it is essential to simulate the multi compartment distribution of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment however very few modeling approaches have been conducted on multimedia distributions of organic pollutants in aquatic environments kong et al 2018 especially when integrated with general water quality state variables to assess the indirect impacts eutrophication which is caused by the enrichment of nutrients is one of the most challenging environmental problems worldwide conley et al 2009 eutrophication not only brings aesthetic and recreational interferences but also may pose high risks to the ecosystem due to the release of toxins and allelopathic substances during harmful algal blooms tran et al 2020 it is well known that the amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen determine the eutrophication levels in the aquatic environment chen et al 2019b conley et al 2009 rousso et al 2020 therefore trophic status is one of the important criteria for water quality assessment christia et al 2014 cunha et al 2013 however the analysis of non regulated substances such as emerging contaminants is generally non mandatory for current water quality assessment you et al 2010 recent studies have provided evidence for the ubiquitous distribution of emerging contaminants in freshwater that have potential risks on the ecosystem gonzález gonzález et al 2014 wright walters et al 2011 to comprehensively evaluate contamination levels in aquatic ecosystems a risk assessment of emerging contaminants should also be conducted to provide guidance for control and regulation of the usage and release of emerging contaminants into water bodies hence a coupled water quality risk assessment model would be an effective tool that can be applied to conduct assessment of both water quality e g trophic state index and potential ecological risks of the emerging contaminants the objectives of this study are to a develop a comprehensive three dimensional hydrodynamic eutrophication risk assessment model of emerging contaminants for a tropical reservoir in singapore in this study among the more than 100 simulated water quality state variables parameters seven of them namely total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp chlorophyll a chl a nitrite no3 n dissolved oxygen do total organic carbon toc total suspended solids tss and two representative emerging contaminants i e bisphenol a bpa and n n diethyltoluamide deet were modeled in four environmental compartments bulk water bw and suspended solids ss in the water column pore water pw and sediments sed in the sediment layer b conduct correlation analysis between general water quality parameters and emerging contaminants under prevailing environmental conditions c conduct a comprehensive risk of emerging contaminants and trophic level nutrients and chlorophyll a assessment in terms of spatial and temporal distributions d explore the influence of limiting nutrients on the distributions of emerging contaminants in the four environmental compartments the new insights from the integrated 3d hydrodynamic eutrophication emerging contaminants risk assessment heecra model can help better understand the direct and indirect effects of environmental conditions on the dynamic distribution of emerging contaminants and thereby comprehensively elucidate their fate and transport in the aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling campaign the study area is a highly urbanized catchment that covers five tributaries and a tropical reservoir in singapore which is used for rainfall harvesting and recreational activities fig s1 details of description for the catchment can be found from previous studies chen et al 2019a you et al 2015 there are no effluent discharge points in the study area since wastewater is not directly discharged to inland surface waters in singapore the sampling campaign was conducted monthly from jan 2013 to jan 2014 at five tributaries and three locations within the reservoir s1 s2 s4 the water samples collected from a depth of 0 0 2 m were filled into 1 0 l amber water bottles for the chemical analysis the sediment samples were collected from the top 10 0 cm of the benthic sediment layer using a stainless steel grabber bpa and deet in different compartments bulk water suspended solids pore water and sediments were analyzed the analytical methods of detection for the emerging contaminants bpa and deet and environmental parameters are given in the supplementary material 2 2 modeling framework the integrated three dimensional hydrodynamic eutrophication emerging contaminants risk assessment heecra model included four vertical water layers and one sediment layer and was developed based on the delft 3d suite of models the 3d hydrodynamic model with four vertical layers for water quality was built up through a numerical calculation of non steady flow and transport phenomena resulting from bathymetry and meteorological forcing on a curvilinear and boundary fitted grid a z layer model was used in this hydrodynamic approach the 3d hydrodynamic model has been calibrated and validated in previous studies against the measurements of water level temperature and salinity and can simulate the hydrodynamic situation of the study area to a reasonable degree of accuracy wang et al 2019b the results of the hydrodynamic model were coupled to the eutrophication emerging contaminants model the kinetic processes of this model include two parts the eutrophication and emerging contaminants modules the simplified model framework is displayed by the flow charts in fig s2 all kinetic processes were included in the four environmental compartments i e dissolved in the water column and in the sediment pore water sorbed to particle in the water column and in the sediment layer the nutrients phytoplankton organic matter dissolved oxygen suspended solids salinity were modeled in the eutrophication module the emerging contaminants module was based on numerical solutions of a physical transport processes including advection dispersion settling sorption and desorption and b biochemical processes including degradation mineralization and conversion the state variables in the eutrophication model were linked to the components in the emerging contaminants model which allows the interactions between general water quality parameters and emerging contaminants the examination of water quality and ecological status in this reservoir was integrated into the model via calculation of the trophic state index tsi for eutrophication and analyzing the species sensitivity distribution ssd risk quotient rq for emerging contaminants bpa and deet the detailed information for model setup and description is provided in the supplementary material 2 3 modeling scenarios the modeling results represent the general water quality parameters and emerging contaminant levels under the current conditions scenario a baseline in order to explore the influence of nutrients on the distribution of emerging contaminants in the water column and in the sediments another calculation scheme was designed based on the primary limiting factor and nutrient contributions observed in the reservoir i e the input of dissolved phosphorous po4 3 was increased 3 times and other conditions remained unchanged scenario b 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation in this study field data at three observation stations in the reservoir from january 2013 to january 2014 were used to compare with the model results fig s3 the model was calibrated by measured data of s1 and validated by field data at stations s2 and s4 to evaluate the overall performance of the model for general water quality and emerging contaminant parameters the statistics metrics of root mean square error rmse the average standard deviation ard and the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse for each location are summarized in table s3 the nse values at all stations were ranged from 0 31 to 0 97 and all the ard values were smaller than 25 suggesting the simulated results yield good agreement with the observations to further understand the transport and fate of emerging contaminants in the ecosystem the distributions of modeled and measured emerging contaminants in four environmental compartments i e bulk water bw suspended solids ss pore water pw and sediments sed were investigated fig 1 the measured data are provided in table s4 the simulated results were consistent with the measured levels in the four compartments these results show that the calibrated model can be applied to describe the general water quality and emerging contaminants of the studied reservoir with a reasonable degree of accuracy the distribution of bpa and deet concentration in the water column and sediment layer showed opposite trends in the water column bulk water and suspended solids bpa and deet were predominately distributed in the dissolved phase bulk water accounting for approximately 98 4 and 99 0 of total concentrations in the water column respectively however in the benthic sediment layer bpa and deet were dominant in the sorbed phase sed with 94 8 and 92 3 contributions respectively the fraction of adsorbed bpa is larger than the fraction of adsorbed deet in either water column or sediment layer this is because the log kd value of bpa in either the water column or sediment layer is bigger than that of deet the benthic sediment layer is an organic rich matrix which could act as an accumulated charge sink for hydrophobic compounds and could be a secondary contamination source for the overlying water column through resuspension chen et al 2019a nevertheless there exist some differences between the measured and modeled concentrations for emerging contaminants which could be attributed to several reasons firstly the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment is usually at trace level concentrations ranging from ng l to µg l small deviations in the data value could be easily influenced by errors in sampling and analysis happonen et al 2016 furthermore some of the kinetic processes of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment still remain unclear wilkinson et al 2017 which introduce various inaccuracies in parameter estimation or assumptions with equations for process simulation datta et al 2018 for example the partitioning of emerging contaminants is described as an equilibrium process by means of a linear partition coefficient based on amounts of organic carbon d waq um 2009 however the dynamics of the sorption process is more complex hence a more comprehensive and dynamic sorption equation should be considered and incorporated in future modelling work besides many uncertainties originating from sampling methodologies happonen et al 2016 would also influence the results tran et al 2019 as well as measurement errors arising from the analytical detection of emerging contaminants petrović et al 2003 these may lead to considerable uncertainties in the simulated concentrations of emerging contaminants in addition calibration and validation are important steps to determine the model performance which require sufficient amounts and quality of observed data liu et al 2021 wang et al 2016 a rich historical environmental dataset e g a long period of time span and high frequency data can improve the accuracy of the model in the calibration and validation part of this study we considered bpa and deet in four compartments whereas for the general water quality variables only their dynamics in the water column were considered since available data was limited therefore the current model development was challenged by the impacts of low frequency and sparse datasets in future a further improvement of the calibration and validation procedures can be based on high frequency

biodegradation xiong et al 2018 in the benthic sediments layer there was no significant difference in terms of the fraction of emerging contaminants in pore water sediment between scenarios a and b in which the fluctuations ranged from 0 0001 to 0 001 solar radiation is a key factor for photosynthesis of phytoplankton and light intensity diminishes exponentially down through the water column jassby and platt 1976 therefore with little phytoplankton growth near the sediments there was only a slight change in the sorption capacity in the sediment layer shi et al 2017 investigated the interactions between algal blooms of phytoplankton and hydrophobic organic chemicals using years of field observations and suggested that the dynamics should be included in models in the future also rodríguez escales and sánchez vila 2020 investigated the interactions between emerging organic compounds and biomass using laboratory experiments and kinetics modelling method thus future research could be directed towards the integration of field laboratory and model results to test hypotheses and determine how and to what extent nutrients and biomass may influence the distribution of emerging contaminants 4 conclusions this study presents a comprehensive modelling approach to understand the fate and transport of emerging contaminants bpa and deet in multi compartments and their interactions with other general water quality state variables as well as assess their potential risks in an aquatic ecosystem bpa and deet were predominately distributed in the dissolved phase in the water column but in the sorbed phase in the sediment layer our results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal distributions of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment can also be indirectly influenced by the variations of other general water quality state variables such as changes in limiting nutrient e g phosphorus concentrations through sorption processes associated with algae production strong positive correlations were observed between nutrients and emerging contaminants indicating the co occurrence of their pollution sources our assessment showed that the two studied compounds bpa and deet posed low risk to the aquatic ecosystem and the trophic levels in the studied area ranged from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic conditions during the period of analysis the comprehensive approach adopted in this study lays down a framework for integrating the various processes in a coupled hydrodynamic eutrophication emerging contaminants risk assessment model which can be used to explore other emerging contaminants this will provide useful information for policy makers in the sustainable management of aquatic ecosytems especially when dealing with rising concerns of

16954,the presence of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater was first reported in march 2020 over the subsequent months the potential for wastewater surveillance to contribute to covid 19 mitigation programmes has been the focus of intense national and international research activities gaining the attention of policy makers and the public as a new application of an established methodology focused collaboration between public health practitioners and wastewater researchers is essential to developing a common understanding on how when and where the outputs of this non invasive community level approach can deliver actionable outcomes for public health authorities within this context the norman score sars cov 2 in sewage database provides a platform for rapid open access data sharing validated by the uploading of 276 data sets from nine countries to date through offering direct access to underpinning meta data sets and describing its use in data interpretation the norman score database is a resource for the development of recommendations on minimum data requirements for wastewater pathogen surveillance it is also a tool to engage public health practitioners in discussions on use of the approach providing an opportunity to build mutual understanding of the demand and supply for data and facilitate the translation of this promising research application into public health practice 1 introduction research continues apace into many aspects of the use of wastewater surveillance for the detection of sars cov 2 and how data generated can be utilised within local public health decision making also known as sewage or environmental surveillance the approach has an established literature in terms of monitoring the occurrence and concentration of chemicals arriving at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp choi et al 2018 determined chemical concentrations loads and population normalised loads of illicit gonzález mariño et al 2020a b ort et al 2014 and licit drugs including tobacco caffeine and alcohol castiglioni et al 2015 gracia lor et al 2017 ryu et al 2016 thomaidis et al 2016 are used to provide quantitative longitudinal data sets on the use at a catchment level it is also possible to evaluate the rates of exposure to environmental or food contaminants using the same approach rousis et al 2017 lopardo et al 2019 furthermore wastewater surveillance can be used to evidence changes overtime in relation to the implementation of new policy initiatives the practical utility of chemical wastewater surveillance data sets is demonstrated by its use within local and national monitoring and public health programmes emcdda 2020 riva et al 2020 lai et al 2018 prior to 2020 the use of wastewater surveillance for monitoring pathogens was gaining ground only slowly most notably enterovirus wastewater surveillance systems have been established in several locations sedmak et al 2003 majumdar et al 2018 with wastewater surveillance identified as playing a key role in polio eradication schemes in israel india and egypt who 2020 ashgar et al 2014 holm hansson et al 2017 the first sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance studies were undertaken in the netherlands with viral rna material detected in wastewater treatment influent samples in seven dutch cities and the international airport medema et al 2020a this landmark study included data on the detection of viral fragments in wastewater in one city prior to the detection of any clinical cases this potential to provide an early warning on the presence of the virus within a community is a proof of concept and an evidence base that could be used by public health teams as a trigger to intensify clinical testing facilitating the identification and isolation of positive cases thompson et al 2020 post 2020 hence the use of wastewater surveillance for sars cov 2 as a tool to address the covid19 pandemic is a new application of an established method in a rapidly moving field sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance studies to date have demonstrated the occurrence of its rna genome in a range of compartments primarily wwtp influents but it has also been reported in sludge and effluents as well as within receiving waters jones et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 in terms of infectivity potential of wastewater containing sars cov 2 rna initial studies westhaus et al 2021 bivins et al 2020a and expert opinion who 2020 jones et al 2020 indicate that detected rna materials do not occur in the form of an infectious viral particle further studies also looked to establish a quantitative relationship between viral load and number of clinical cases reported within a catchment vallejo et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020 however variations in the load and duration of viral material shed in faeces by asymptomatic pre symptomatic and symptomatic cases together with limited understanding of the fate of viral particles within sewer systems which vary significantly in design and flow dynamics and variations in analytical protocols and their associated extraction efficiencies generates considerable uncertainty in terms of directly relating viral loads to numbers of cases hence many open challenges exist within this research area and use of data by public health teams within the field key research questions encompass the potential for viral materials to adsorb to biofilm and particles degrade in the sewage system and optimising sample collection processes including collection location and frequency who 2020 moreover the need to standardise and optimise analytical protocols has been clearly identified michael kordatou et al 2020 in terms of interpreting data key issues include data comparability between studies e g use of a common marker for normalisation and how contextual data e g flow and other parameters are included in data interpretation the identification of a sars cov 2 rna threshold value and the actions that exceeding a threshold value should trigger medema et al 2020b variations in the amount of viral rna excreted per person are a further unknown and inherent levels of variability in shedding may make accurate predictions of prevalence impossible however the absence of an absolute understanding of shedding rate behaviour does not preclude the use of this approach in public health contexts where relative changes in signal as opposed to its absolute value can provide public health teams with valuable data further open questions remain over ethical aspects related to the use of wastewater surveillance and the need to develop a social license to operate if the approach is to be successfully adopted whilst ethical aspects have been largely overlooked during the current health emergency developments in near source tracking e g analysis of wastewater from aeroplanes hospitals and schools ahmed et al 2020 gonçalvesa et al 2021 hassard et al 2020 hong et al 2021 are rapidly pushing this issue up the research and practice agenda in this article a bottom up collaborative approach to enabling researchers to systematically and rapidly share raw data on traditional wastewater parameters the occurrence of sars cov 2 and clinical case numbers is presented as both a resource for researchers and a tool to facilitate discussion with public health teams 2 the use of wastewater surveillance data within public health decision making wastewater surveillance can be used to non invasively screen hard to test communities i e where uptake of testing is low or challenging for resource reasons at a sewer catchment level as a new public health tool to understand covid 19 spread cdc 2020 post 2020 detection of sars cov 2 rna fragments in wastewater is independent of clinical testing strategy bias thompson et al 2020 can be used as an early warning of the need for further testing e g reallocating increasing local testing resources such as drive through test facilities or the implementation of wastewater surveillance upstream of the wwtp i e near source tracking to identify location of cases hassard et al 2020 for example the detection of sars cov 2 rna concentrations can indicate the re emergence of the virus in a catchment following a period of no clinical cases and an increase in viral rna load can indicate the occurrence of new outbreaks requiring the urgent tracing of infected individuals and their subsequent support to isolate defra 2020 likewise decreasing prevalence can indicate that infected individuals are known and isolation public health interventions are effective further an increase in viral load over time against a trend of no change in daily positive case numbers could indicate that the clinical testing regime should be intensified i e new cases are not being detected thompson et al 2020 wastewater surveillance data sets can also be used to evidence the effect of alternative policy actions e g curfew vs local lockdown vs national lockdown at a community level as well as track progress of vaccination campaigns to deliver these types of actionable outcomes i e to enable public health authorities to use wastewater surveillance data within their community level decision making processes requires activities on several fronts as well as addressing the wastewater surveillance methodological and analytical challenges identified earlier data from wastewater needs to be collected frequently and available rapidly in a format that is useful and useable by public health practitioners further collaboration between wastewater and public health practitioners is required to ensure that public health teams can access the type of data they require in a timeframe and format that integrates with current pandemic mitigation measures i e addressing public health data requirements needs to be front and centre of operationalising this new development in wastewater surveillance the format and sampling strategies underpinning wastewater data sets may need to morph in terms of the locations and frequency of sample collection quality assurance quality control processes scale at which data is generated and made available and the aspects of primary value from a public health perspective i e absolute values or trends analysis delivering this type of integrated data share dashboard is already challenging under usual working conditions working across disciplines during a pandemic when public health teams are at or beyond full capacity is extremely challenging however collaboration between public health and wastewater researchers where public health practitioners take a lead role in determining dashboard development is happening for example in australia the development of a sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance dashboard was led by a collaboration between the victorian state public health team and water research australia this has already matured from a research and development phase to an operational tool for day to day use with functional dashboards for both internal and external communications victoria state government 2020 other countries with established monitoring programs include canada https cwn rce ca covid 19

data between a government led wastewater surveillance project and the national covid 19 track and trace programme led to the identification of an increase in sars cov 2 rna in wastewater despite relatively low numbers of people taking clinical tests defra 2020 this data was used to alert local health professionals to contact people in the area to warn of the increase in cases and encourage local populations to engage with clinical testing programmes the need for and benefits of collaboration among wastewater researchers has been recognised and several international and national collaborations rapidly established e g bivins et al 2020b wrf 2020 who 2020 jrc 2020 réseau obépine 2020 wra 2020 ucmerced 2020 these have focused primarily on technical and analytical issues facilitating opportunities for rapid discussion on a range of topics from recent publications to method development predictive modelling and risk assessment however collaboration activities to date have yet to address two key issues firstly the development of an open access data platform to enable and facilitate the rapid sharing and critical evaluation of multiple wastewater meta data sets to address technical issues bivins et al 2020a secondly engagement with public health authorities i e development of a critical mass of public health and wastewater researchers to collaboratively identify and deliver an operational sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance public health system 3 open access data sharing to progress collaboration across disciplines the norman score sars cov 2 in sewage sc2s database is a platform which can contribute to meeting both these needs this open access database is an output of the collaboration between two international networks the norman network www norman network net of research organisations supporting the validation and harmonisation of measurement methods and monitoring tools and score https score cost eu a network established to harmonise methodologies for measuring human biomarkers in wastewater to evaluate lifestyle health and exposure at the community level the database is located within the norman database system at https www norman network com nds as the latest addition to its 13 database modules within the interlinked database system series for the collection and evaluation of data information on emerging substances in the environment dulio et al 2020 the sc2s database structure follows that of the norman antibiotic resistance bacteria genes database enabling users to freely access data at a wwtp level as well us upload new data via a customised data collection template dct downloadable from the website which facilitates its automatic uploading to the system on accessing the database users can search via country and or wwtp or view the entire data set both within the database or it can be exported into ms excel without any restrictions data displayed in the dashboard includes sampling date gene copy number of copies ml and or ng of rna ml cycle threshold ct wwtp and country name population served and the number of people reported sars cov 2 positive in the sewer catchment area on the day of sampling table 1 identifies the requested reporting parameters and provides an overview of their role in interpreting generated data sets finally the full dct containing all reported data on all parameters can be downloaded for each dataset in terms of engaging the attention of public health authorities as a first step it includes both wastewater and clinical case data in addition and perhaps more importantly it is a starting point for further discussions with public health practitioners on what wastewater surveillance is the types of longitudinal data sets it can produce together with process controls and the potential of this non invasive approach as a tool to provide an early warning of new clusters as well as the impact of existing pandemic mitigation measures to launch the database invitations to participate were initially shared through both the norman and score networks with a request for members to disseminate further through their own networks to harmonise activities participants were provided with a common protocol covering sample collection rna extraction and analysis the common protocol available at https www norman network com nds sars cov 2 adopts the medema et al 2020a b methodology with an alternative simplified protocol for sars cov 2 extraction from wastewater via polyethylene glycol peg precipitation recognising that many consumables equipment currently in short supply given the logistical challenges and urgency to share data quickly participating laboratories did not undertake an inter laboratory validation procedure but were asked to report their laboratory qa qc procedures in full submission of data using both methods is welcomed with space on the dct to identify which approach was used and the genes targeted a further step was to establish a buddy system for research groups who were able to collect wastewater samples but whose laboratories were under lock down and or were not familiar with rna analysis as such the rapid sharing of a common protocol also had a capacity building effect enabling many groups to explore opportunities to undertake wastewater surveillance for pathogens for the first time two scheduled sampling campaigns were held on june 1st 2020 and june 15th 2020 with data referring to further identified sampling campaigns now welcomed to date the sc2s database contains 276 sets of data from nine different countries see fig 1 the impact of pandemic mitigation measures on working conditions impacted on the ability to both collect and manage samples e g reduced access to wwtps and laboratories consumables and or work force further whilst the dcts were developed to support systematic data reporting not all laboratories were able to provide all requested data due to the on going challenges experienced by many research groups in terms of access to laboratories shortages delays in shipping consumables and reduced work force nevertheless all received data sets were uploaded to achieve the aim of rapid data share as a compliment to ongoing efforts to standardise sampling and analytical protocols downloading the current data set shows that 24 hour composite samples either volume weighted or time weighted were collected on several dates on or close to scheduled sampling dates from 24th may 2020 16th june 2020 with grab and or composite samples collected on further as local conditions permitted sample preparation date date of analysis and storage conditions were identified together with the method used for sample preparation rna extraction analysis and the use of internal standards in the sample preparation phase 61 of samples and the rna extraction step 88 of samples reviewing the data set as a whole a positive signal for sars cov 2 was quantified in 167 of the 276 samples analysed of these 167 samples the n1 gene was quantified in 18 samples n2 gene in 8 samples a combined measure of n1 and n2 in 133 samples and the e gene in 3 samples ct counts ranged from 31 9 41 9 median 35 with the number of gene copies ml ranging from 0 04 148 gene copies ml median 10 6 gene copies ml in terms of quality control reported analysis included two to six replicates per sample with the use of a positive control reported in the analyses of 268 of the 276 samples the analytical limit of detection was reported on 173 occasions range 3 5 gene copies ml for n1 gene 0 5 5 gene copies ml for n2 gene 0 75 gene copies ml for n1 n2 combined gene measurement 0 5 100 gene copies ml for e gene with a study by philo et al 2021 suggesting that the variability in detection between target genes could be due to variations in the performance of assays or differential rates of degradation in the target genetic material no study reported their limit of quantification in terms of clinical data the number of positive cases reported in the local municipality which may may not reflect the sewer catchment on the day of sampling was reported for 260 of the 276 samples analysed range 0 1701 median 239 cases whilst at sewer catchment level ethical issues around participant anonymity and data protection is generally not an issue however as contributing areas reduce to for example an individual building level the need to systematically and robustly consider the use of generated data at source and further downstream i e secondary data use becomes increasingly urgent 4 conclusions the current data hosted by the sc2s provides a snapshot of the occurrence of sars cov 2 in wastewater at participating wwtps and demonstrates the ad hoc cooperation of the scientific community on data collection however more importantly the norman score initiative demonstrates that the sc2s database is a workable multi jurisdictional data share platform with potential to facilitate development of an international dataset provides a tool to engage and inform discussions with public health practitioners on the potential role of wastewater surveillance as an additional approach to integrate within community public health strategies is open to all contributors are warmly invited to submit data from any campaigns they are able to share using the relevant sections on the dct to document sample collection storage and analytical details together with clinical case numbers with continued use this collection of wastewater meta data will support a retrospective analysis of the impact of differing sewer catchment population variables on the use of wastewater surveillance as a tool in public health practice facilitated the collection of comparable data sets from an early phase of the pandemic continued use will provides an opportunity to maximise operational insights gained during different phases of the pandemic and support development of robust best practice in wastewater

in the environment dulio et al 2020 the sc2s database structure follows that of the norman antibiotic resistance bacteria genes database enabling users to freely access data at a wwtp level as well us upload new data via a customised data collection template dct downloadable from the website which facilitates its automatic uploading to the system on accessing the database users can search via country and or wwtp or view the entire data set both within the database or it can be exported into ms excel without any restrictions data displayed in the dashboard includes sampling date gene copy number of copies ml and or ng of rna ml cycle threshold ct wwtp and country name population served and the number of people reported sars cov 2 positive in the sewer catchment area on the day of sampling table 1 identifies the requested reporting parameters and provides an overview of their role in interpreting generated data sets finally the full dct containing all reported data on all parameters can be downloaded for each dataset in terms of engaging the attention of public health authorities as a first step it includes both wastewater and clinical case data in addition and perhaps more importantly it is a starting point for further discussions with public health practitioners on what wastewater surveillance is the types of longitudinal data sets it can produce together with process controls and the potential of this non invasive approach as a tool to provide an early warning of new clusters as well as the impact of existing pandemic mitigation measures to launch the database invitations to participate were initially shared through both the norman and score networks with a request for members to disseminate further through their own networks to harmonise activities participants were provided with a common protocol covering sample collection rna extraction and analysis the common protocol available at https www norman network com nds sars cov 2 adopts the medema et al 2020a b methodology with an alternative simplified protocol for sars cov 2 extraction from wastewater via polyethylene glycol peg precipitation recognising that many consumables equipment currently in short supply given the logistical challenges and urgency to share data quickly participating laboratories did not undertake an inter laboratory validation procedure but were asked to report their laboratory qa qc procedures in full submission of data using both methods is welcomed with space on the dct to identify which approach was used and the genes targeted a further step was to establish a buddy system for research groups who were able to collect wastewater samples but whose laboratories were under lock down and or were not familiar with rna analysis as such the rapid sharing of a common protocol also had a capacity building effect enabling many groups to explore opportunities to undertake wastewater surveillance for pathogens for the first time two scheduled sampling campaigns were held on june 1st 2020 and june 15th 2020 with data referring to further identified sampling campaigns now welcomed to date the sc2s database contains 276 sets of data from nine different countries see fig 1 the impact of pandemic mitigation measures on working conditions impacted on the ability to both collect and manage samples e g reduced access to wwtps and laboratories consumables and or work force further whilst the dcts were developed to support systematic data reporting not all laboratories were able to provide all requested data due to the on going challenges experienced by many research groups in terms of access to laboratories shortages delays in shipping consumables and reduced work force nevertheless all received data sets were uploaded to achieve the aim of rapid data share as a compliment to ongoing efforts to standardise sampling and analytical protocols downloading the current data set shows that 24 hour composite samples either volume weighted or time weighted were collected on several dates on or close to scheduled sampling dates from 24th may 2020 16th june 2020 with grab and or composite samples collected on further as local conditions permitted sample preparation date date of analysis and storage conditions were identified together with the method used for sample preparation rna extraction analysis and the use of internal standards in the sample preparation phase 61 of samples and the rna extraction step 88 of samples reviewing the data set as a whole a positive signal for sars cov 2 was quantified in 167 of the 276 samples analysed of these 167 samples the n1 gene was quantified in 18 samples n2 gene in 8 samples a combined measure of n1 and n2 in 133 samples and the e gene in 3 samples ct counts ranged from 31 9 41 9 median 35 with the number of gene copies ml ranging from 0 04 148 gene copies ml median 10 6 gene copies ml in terms of quality control reported analysis included two to six replicates per sample with the use of a positive control reported in the analyses of 268 of the 276 samples the analytical limit of detection was reported on 173 occasions range 3 5 gene copies ml for n1 gene 0 5 5 gene copies ml for n2 gene 0 75 gene copies ml for n1 n2 combined gene measurement 0 5 100 gene copies ml for e gene with a study by philo et al 2021 suggesting that the variability in detection between target genes could be due to variations in the performance of assays or differential rates of degradation in the target genetic material no study reported their limit of quantification in terms of clinical data the number of positive cases reported in the local municipality which may may not reflect the sewer catchment on the day of sampling was reported for 260 of the 276 samples analysed range 0 1701 median 239 cases whilst at sewer catchment level ethical issues around participant anonymity and data protection is generally not an issue however as contributing areas reduce to for example an individual building level the need to systematically and robustly consider the use of generated data at source and further downstream i e secondary data use becomes increasingly urgent 4 conclusions the current data hosted by the sc2s provides a snapshot of the occurrence of sars cov 2 in wastewater at participating wwtps and demonstrates the ad hoc cooperation of the scientific community on data collection however more importantly the norman score initiative demonstrates that the sc2s database is a workable multi jurisdictional data share platform with potential to facilitate development of an international dataset provides a tool to engage and inform discussions with public health practitioners on the potential role of wastewater surveillance as an additional approach to integrate within community public health strategies is open to all contributors are warmly invited to submit data from any campaigns they are able to share using the relevant sections on the dct to document sample collection storage and analytical details together with clinical case numbers with continued use this collection of wastewater meta data will support a retrospective analysis of the impact of differing sewer catchment population variables on the use of wastewater surveillance as a tool in public health practice facilitated the collection of comparable data sets from an early phase of the pandemic continued use will provides an opportunity to maximise operational insights gained during different phases of the pandemic and support development of robust best practice in wastewater
