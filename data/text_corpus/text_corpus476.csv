2380,real time control of hydroelectric generating units and floodgates is the key to ensuring the economy and safety of hydroelectric production runoff hydropower plants require high real time control accuracy because of the small regulation interval the existing real time control methods have certain shortcomings such as frequent load and gate adjustments and a wide range of water level fluctuations therefore we propose a data driven and physics based coupled real time model predictive control mpc method with the aim to develop a highly accurate control strategy compared to the traditional mpc model the model proposed in this study presents three major improvements 1 the data driven and physics based coupled model enhances the accuracy of water level prediction 2 the corresponding decision framework is developed for the actual operation of the power station to reduce the decision space and 3 a feedback correction mechanism that can convert the water level prediction error into flow error which reflects the time varying nature of the system we demonstrate that the coupled prediction model combined with feedback correction improves the water level prediction accuracy by 60 on average moreover the reduced decision space enables the optimization algorithm to reduce the optimization time by 83 on average and achieve a globally optimal solution in the decision space the proposed data driven and physics based coupled real time mpc method is thus useful for the real time regulation of run of river power plants abbreviations de differential

neural network data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as a high quality renewable energy source hydropower plays a very important role in the energy mix the total global hydropower installed capacity accounted for 55 6 of renewable energy worldwide and had a total generation capacity of more than 18 3 by the end of 2019 li et al 2021 ren21 2020a the increased demand for renewable energy has led to massive expansion of small hydroelectric plants especially run of river plants kuriqi et al 2019 as of the end of 2019 run of river power plants had a global installed capacity of 170 gw including more than 68 gw in china with an annual power generation capacity of more than 200 twh which is important for socioeconomic development cheng et al 2015 kishore et al 2021 ren21 2020b however the small reservoir capacity and small adjustable water level interval cause rainfall and runoff to drastically affect the short term power generation of run of river power plants thereby threatening the economics and safety of dispatch qiang et al 2016 with the rapid development of hydropower short term and real time control of power plants has become key research topics li and jiang 2011 following the current dispatching protocol in china the power station dispatcher makes a dispatching plan and submits it to the grid 1 day in advance and then ensures the economic operation of the power station based on real time operation fallah mehdipour et al 2012 lu et al 2015 consequently the effectiveness of real time dispatch of power stations largely depends on the level of the dispatcher zhang et al 2013 such characteristics are more highlighted in runoff power plants therefore they require more accurate and optimal scheduling models for real time regulation and control yuan and zhou 2017 considering this background model predictive control mpc has been gradually applied in the field of real time water resources scheduling delgoda et al 2013 ocampo martinez et al 2013 velarde et al 2019 mpc can perform the functions of a classical control method such as error feedback correction delgoda et al 2016 schwanenberg et al 2015 for complex systems with time variability and uncertainty ghadimi and firouz 2015 and is also able to handle time delays constraints and multiple objectives maciejowski 2002 richalet et al 1978 mpc usually consists of three components 1 a predictive model capable of demonstrating future system processes kong et al 2019 used a simplified st venant equation in mpc to describe the canal hydraulic characteristics and thus the automatic control of the south north water diversion middle route project in china aguilar et al 2016 validated an irrigated area in spain using a discrete time linear model under the mpc strategy 2 rolling optimization owing to the high dimensionality of the decision space and the complex nonlinear relationships in the water resources scheduling domain the strategy seeking process is combined with optimization algorithms to reduce the computation time myo lin et al 2020 found the pareto front by adopting the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii based on the simulation of a reservoir system using the st venant equation under the mpc strategy chiang and willems 2015 tested the flood control effectiveness of gate weirs using a genetic algorithm ga within the mpc framework 3 feedforward and feedback control to the best of our knowledge error feedback correction in mpc has not been studied extensively in real time water resources scheduling as one of the main control parameters in real time reservoir scheduling the water level in front of the dam can be chosen as the objective of the prediction model water balance models are often used in the simulation of hydropower plants rani and moreira 2010 they are widely used in the scheduling of large and medium sized reservoirs or cascade reservoirs because the process mechanism is clear the underlying data are accurate and comprehensive and the accuracy meets certain requirements in large and medium sized power plant scenarios liao et al 2020 tan et al 2020 data driven neural network models are usually capable of representing more complex nonlinear relationships gao et al 2020 kisi et al 2012 peralta et al 2014 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 reservoir water level changes are coupled with multiple nonlinear relationships but few researchers have applied them to reservoir water level simulations and predictions fayaed et al 2013 different models have advantages and disadvantages in different aspects hence the method of coupling various models to complement each other s strengths is widely used in practice rai and sahu 2020 the coupling approaches can be broadly classified into the following categories 1 adjusting the parameter composition or structure of the data driven model with a priori knowledge and results of the physics based model kisi et al 2012 predicted intermittent runoff by neural networks using known input data such as rainfall peralta et al 2014 used the available mechanistic model results to train neural networks for predicting the response of surface water groundwater interactions to different hydraulic stimuli atieh et al 2015 considered indices that capture the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation as input parameters to a neural network to predict the flow processes at stations 2 using data driven models to rate or calculate a parameter or complex linear relationship in a physics based model shang et al 2019 employed neural network models to predict downstream water levels in reservoirs and assist in reservoir operation and scheduling banihabib et al 2019 used neural network models for reservoir inflow prediction to assist in reservoir power generation flood control and other optimal operations tang et al 2014 reconstructed natural runoff with neural network models as a tool to assess the impact of human activities and climate change on the environment 3 enhancing the data driven model with physics based models to make the data driven model results controllable and reduce the singular solutions generated by the non training set of work conditions xie et al 2021 strengthened the robustness of the neural network model using the extreme scenarios generated by the physics based model as part of the input to the data driven model read et al 2019 incorporated energy conservation constraints into a data driven model and predicted lake water temperatures at different depths farfán et al 2020 corrected the mismatch scenario and applied physical knowledge to a neural network model the theory of optimal dispatching of reservoirs for power generation is well developed after determining the optimization objective function it can be solved using optimization algorithms such as dynamic programming on the water balance model yeh 1985 however the large decision space in the optimal scheduling of reservoir power generation results in a dimensional disaster problem carpentier et al 2018 he et al 2022 which can make it difficult for the optimization algorithm to converge to a globally optimal solution or may require long computational times to solve this problem niu et al 2021 optimized the gray wolf optimizer to increase the algorithm search capability and speed up the convergence fu et al 2020 proposed an algorithm that effectively optimizes each prediction parameter and significantly improved the performance feng et al 2020 improved the dynamic programming algorithm to effectively reduce the dimensions of complex hydropower operation problems using object specific heuristic intelligence algorithms a unique evolutionary mechanism or an optimization seeking strategy can be created in accordance with certain characteristics of the optimization problem however such algorithms usually have shortcomings such as premature or local optimality pandey et al 2014 and the algorithm performance fluctuates within a certain range wang et al 2018 improved the efficiency of the solution by reducing the maximum consumption space of renewable power tsoukalas and makropoulos 2015 solved the problem of calculation workload by introducing a hydrological uncertainty probability function in depth investigation of the actual operation process and regulations of hydropower plants can significantly reduce the decision space along with the reduction of the decision space computational efficiency will rapidly increase therefore we can even use an exhaustive method that can meet the model computational timeliness while ensuring that the obtained solution is a globally optimal solution wu et al 2018 to meet the real time control accuracy requirements and ensure feasibility of run of river hydropower plants we optimized each of the three parts of mpc 1 coupling the physics based model with the data driven model to improve the prediction accuracy 2 compressing the decision space to improve the optimization efficiency according to the actual operation protocol of the power plant and 3 proposing a method for error feedback this study aims to perform real time scheduling of run of river power plants by mpc the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the framework and components of mpc are described in detail in section 2 in section 3 the basic situation of the study area is described the methods described in section 2 are applied to the region and the corresponding results are presented in detail in section 4 the effects of the method are further elucidated finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology the real time scheduling process of mpc in a reservoir is shown in fig 1 the input data are the current reservoir water level z0 reservoir inflow sequence i future output planning sequence n and gate opening planning sequence a after the feedback correction of the inflow sequence in the error feedback module all inputs are compiled into a hydropower plant operation plan and transmitted to the prediction model the prediction model then generates the process of future water level changes corresponding to the operation plan into two parts 1 the error feedback module obtains the future water level process predicted by the model and forms an error feedback correction term with the actual input in the future and 2 determine whether the future water level process exceeds the expected water level range and if so call the optimization model the error feedback and prediction model are executed in a looping process when the water level process exceeds the expected water level range the optimization model reduces the optimization decision space using the operation plan and finds the best solution in the decision space and then outputs the best solution after comparison to form the scheduling recommendation 2 1 water level prediction model 2 1 1 water balance model for reservoir water level prediction su et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 a mechanism driven model such as the water balance model can be applied the general expression can be described as follows 1 v t 1 v t i t o t δ t e t l t where v t is the reservoir capacity at time period t i t and o t are reservoir inflow and outflow at time period t respectively δ t is the time step and e t and l t are the total evaporation and seepage of the reservoir at time period t respectively the evaporation and leakage at the minute scale in real time dispatch are small compared to the outflow and inflow so these can be neglected 2 z t f v t 3 q n g δ h n n 4 q g h δ h g a where z t is the water level at time period t f is the mapping relationship between water level and reservoir capacity q n is the power generation outflow δ h n is the generation net head g is the mapping of the net head of generation generation output and generation outflow n is the generation output q g is the gate outflow δ h g is the gate head a is the gate opening degree and h is the relationship between gate head gate opening and gate outflow the generation discharge and gate discharge constitute the reservoir outflow 2 1 2 neural network model data driven models can be classified as machine learning and deep learning machine learning first uses existing human knowledge to construct features that reflect the object of study from the collected data and then builds a model with a relatively simple structure such as a decision tree deep learning builds models directly on the collected data and learns the underlying pattern features in the data through the model s own learning capabilities such as recurrent neural networks data driven models can be used to describe various types of nonlinear relationships in a reservoir when the reservoir has been in operation for a long time the data quality is high and the amount of data is large such that the time series of the water level of the reservoir can be acquired directly or indirectly from eq 1 we know that the relevant variables of the reservoir water level are clear and the corresponding input and output can be directly used to fit the reservoir nonlinear relationship fig 2 the long short term memory lstm of the recurrent neural network was adopted and the input data are the water level of the reservoir at the current moment the inflow sequence of the reservoir in the predicted time horizon the unit output plan and the gate opening plan the output is the water level sequence in the predicted time horizon and the water level sequence is generated in a single time period this is to avoid the accumulation of errors created by individual generation with the accuracy of the fitted water level process as the sole objective mean squared error mse was used as the loss function eq 5 5 ms e data 1 st i s t t z it z it 2 where ms e data is the mean squared error of the predicted water level process t is the prediction horizon s is the training data set and z it and z it are the observed and model predicted values of the sample i at time period t respectively 2 1 3 coupling model because the water balance and the neural network models perform differently in different calculation periods the weight coefficients can be used to clarify the accuracy of the two models in different periods eq 6 and correct the final results of the reservoir water level prediction model the greater the weight coefficient the higher the accuracy of the water balance model results for that time period and the lower the accuracy of the neural network model results and vice versa the objective of minimizing the cumulative error of the water level in each time period eq 8 was solved using more mature optimization algorithms e g differential evolution de and particle swarm optimization pso 6 z t w t w b t 1 w t n n t 7 0 w t 1 where w t is the weighting coefficient at time period t the weighting coefficient should be within a certain interval to maintain a monotonic influence on the results w b t is the result of the water balance model at time period t and n n t is the neural network model result at time period t 8 min i s t t e t i where e t i is the error between the observed value and the result of the coupled model of the sample i at time period t s is the set of samples and t is the set of time periods 2 2 optimal operation of reservoir power generation 2 2 1 optimization objectives the characteristic smaller regulation capacity of run of river power plants which usually have power generation as their main objective paish 2002 makes it difficult to maintain their operating conditions including output and gate opening in a stable state when the boundary conditions change frequently the operating conditions of the hydropower plants must also be changed accordingly such high frequency changes in operating conditions will result in serious wear and tear of the hydraulic machinery of the power station thus reducing its service life while it is also a great test for dispatchers this can be avoided by optimal operation of the power station optimization requires advance consideration of the changes in boundary conditions to find stable working conditions and make full use of the reservoir regulation capacity of run of river hydropower plants it is also necessary to keep the power plant operating economically by maintaining high power generation efficiency therefore the optimization objective is to maximize the water level process to meet the expected water level range eq 9 reduce the number of output and load actions and maintain a low water consumption rate wcr eqs 10 and 11 9 mins i t z t l max z t l max 0 else l min z t z t l min where s is the degree to which the water level process meets the water level range and l max and l min are the upper and lower lines of the desired water level range respectively 10 minat a t n a t a 11 minwcr c t e t where at is the number of changes in the operating conditions of the hydropower plant a t n is the number of power generation output changes a t a is the number of gate opening changes wcr is the water consumption rate of the plant c t is the total water consumption in time period t including gate discharge and e t is the amount of electricity generated in time period t multi objective optimization problems can be derived as pareto fronts or converted to single objective optimization problems using weights we choose the latter method when we use intelligent algorithms and the weights of eqs 9 10 and 11 are 10 1 and 0 4 respectively when the exhaustive method can list all solutions in the feasible domain we simply need to screen solutions to meet the water level range and first filter using eq 10 and then using eq 11 the function is subject to the following constraints water level limits reservoir discharge limits hydropower generation limits and hydraulic connections ① water level limits 12 z min z z max where z min and z max are the lower and upper water level limits of the reservoir respectively ② reservoir discharge limits 13 q min q q max where q min and q max are the lower and upper water discharge limits of the reservoir respectively ③ hydropower generation limits 14 n min n n max where n min and n max are the lower and upper generation limits of the reservoir respectively ④ hydraulic connections 15 i t k ω q t k b t where ω is the set of upstream reservoirs q t k is the discharge of reservoir k at time t and b t is the local inflow at time t 2 2 2 decision framework in the optimal dispatching of reservoir power generation the upstream water level is usually discrete as a decision variable at each calculation time however it is difficult to reduce the decision space composed of the upstream water level because the nonlinear relationship coupled by the upstream water level is far too complex the variables that can affect the upstream water level are power generation flow q n and flood flow q g which are related to the power generation output n and gate opening a through eqs 3 and 4 respectively in the power grid operation and dispatching regulations to ensure the power supply requirements of the grid the power station on the power generation output control needs to obtain permission from the grid which indicates that the power station cannot change the load at any time therefore without the need for a discrete generation output at a point in time when the generation output cannot be changed we can count in the historical data of the time when the power station applied for load from the grid is to be approved and use it as the time interval when the hydropower station can change the load for the gate the power station has control rights thus it can change the gate during the first dispatching period however if the inflow is a short time pulse historical data show that this often occurs in the flood season it is difficult to complete the water level control with a single gate change thus setting the second gate change time thus the number of generation output changes and gate changes during the calculation period can be minimized with only one load change in the best case and one load and two gate changes required in the worst case scenarios fig 3 thus the plan can be described using only six parameters 1 the time of change of power output 2 time of change of the first gate opening 3 amount of change in the power output 4 amount of change in the first gate opening 5 time of change of the second gate opening and 6 amount of change in the second gate opening 2 2 3 optimization solution a exhaustive method a smaller decision space can be used to find the global optimal solution using the exhaustive enumeration method the strategies in the decision space are arranged and combined and then brought into the prediction model to obtain the reservoir water level process corresponding to all the strategies b optimization algorithm optimization algorithms e g pso and de are used to determine the optimal decision that will further reduce the optimization time the six parameters required for the decision are brought into the optimization algorithm as independent variables the corresponding hard constraints are then set and each individual formed decision is brought into the prediction model to acquire the corresponding water level process while using eq 16 as the optimization objective considering safety and economy 16 minf w c r s where f is individual fitness 2 3 error feedback to cope with the instability and time varying nature of the system in the mpc rolling optimization process we can compare the predicted value of the previous time period with the actual measured value of the current moment the errors can be presented as a combination of the prediction model and systematic errors in the problem of reservoir dispatch the resulting water level error can be converted to an inflow error using eq 17 and this error can then applied as a correction term to all inputs to the prediction model at the current moment using eq 18 17 δ q t f 1 z t f 1 z t 1 t m t 18 q t c δ q t q t where δ q t is the flow error correction term z t and z t 1 t m are the observed water level at time period t and the model s predicted water level at time period t 1 for time period t respectively t is the length of the time period and q t c and q t are the corrected inflow rate at time period t and the actual inflow rate at time period t respectively 2 4 prediction horizon the prediction time horizon in mpc is relevant to the performance of the control algorithm too long a control time horizon will increase the computational workload whereas a too short horizon will not achieve the control effect zhang et al 2019 in reservoir dispatch the longer the time scale the greater the uncertainty in reservoir inflow with the effect of reservoir inflow being more uncertain than that of other influencing factors liu et al 2019 in a group of cascade reservoirs when the downstream reservoir has no large branches from the upstream reservoir its incoming flow is usually determined by the upstream reservoir wu et al 2021 therefore the reliable prediction time could be based on the lag time of the upstream reservoir discharge traveling to the dispatching reservoir indicating that the inflow in the last period of the reliable prediction time is the upstream reservoir discharge in the current period but the shorter reliable prediction time horizon is not capable of presenting the mpc optimization effect hence in this study two to three times the reliable prediction time horizon is considered as the prediction time horizon outside the reliable prediction time horizon is called the reference prediction time horizon fig 4 and the runoff input of the reference prediction time horizon is determined according to the extent of the reliable prediction time horizon the inflow of the target reservoir is backcalculated according to eq 19 and the travel time of the downstream reservoir flow is analyzed by introducing the error accumulation term in eq 20 19 q t in v z et v z bt δ t q t out 20 min t 0 t u t j q t in 2 where q t in is the time period average inflow q t out is the time period average outflow z bt and z et are the reservoir capacity at the beginning and end of the period respectively u t j is the average upstream outflow in time period t j and j is the length of the delay time 3 case study 3 1 study area 3 1 1 basin information we tested the real time control system proposed in this paper at the shaping hydropower station sp in the dadu river basin of sichuan province mainland china with selected operational data on reservoir water level power generation output floodgate opening downstream water level and upstream reservoir discharge for 2 years 2019 and 2020 the location of the reservoir is shown in fig 5 a and a simplified schematic diagram of the inflow and outflow at sp is shown in fig 5 b the main purpose of the sp is to generate electricity while ensuring flood control the dead water level of sp is 550 0 m and the normal storage level is 554 0 m the reservoir regulation capacity is only 5 85 million m3 and the average annual runoff of the dadu river is 1 500 m3 s at the initial water level of 553 5 m and an increase of 200 m3 s in the inflow sp will exceed the normal storage level within one hour showing that the reservoir regulation capacity of sp is very small because of the high flow of flood discharge and elevated tailwater level and to improve the economic efficiency of hydropower and keep the output of generating units unimpeded sp needs to maintain a higher water level further reducing the regulation range of the reservoir the upstream of the sp is the zhentouba hydropower station ztb the tributary flow between the two stations is extremely small compared to the main stream therefore the incoming flow of sp is mainly influenced by the discharge of the ztb causing the water level of the sp to be very sensitive to the outflow from the upstream ztb 3 1 2 data processing in the real time optimization to maintain the economic operation of the hydropower plant 552 5 553 5 m was selected as the desired interval of optimized operating water level the operation and scheduling of the power generation output plan of sp must obey the unified arrangement of higher departments and follow the unified planning of the entire power grid when the dispatchers of sp need to change the power generation output according to the actual situation of the power station they must apply to the central control center this process usually results in a response time of 15 to 25 min after the application is submitted and historical data show that the majority of applications were approved the power station should not apply for another output change within 3 h after approval the floodgate is controlled by the sp and the gate status can be changed at any time if the time step is discrete to 5 min the change time of the generation output can be controlled in three moments from 15 to 25 min and changed only once the gate action is controlled twice the first time for the next moment of the control moment and the second time for one of the three moments between 15 and 25 min based on the historical data and the machine characteristics the generation output and the gate can be changed based on the current state at 100 mw and 5 m respectively and the discrete steps are 5 mw and 0 5 m accordingly the operation data of sp in 2019 was selected and the delay time from the release of ztb to sp was projected to be 75 min using eqs 19 and 20 historical data show that the annual variation of the 2019 pillow dam flow exceeded 10 of the flow and the previous moment only accounted for 4 8 of the year therefore 75 min was used as a reliable prediction horizon and 105 min was selected as the reference prediction horizon the inflows in the reference prediction time horizon are all the inflows at 75 min the total prediction time horizon was 3 h and 5 min was selected as the control time horizon by integrating the frequency and quality of data collection 3 2 water level prediction model we obtained the lstm neural network model for water level prediction using the 2019 data to form the training and validation sets to increase the model robustness the model training data formed from the 2019 measured data were divided into two types based on whether the gates were all closed or opened for the three hour water level prediction in the historical data of 2020 the reservoir inflow in the input data is the sequence of outflows of the ztb from 75 min ago to the moment of calculation the power generation output and gate opening were adopted from the historical actual data where the upstream water level and downstream water level at the current moment of the calculation period were used as the initial state of the reservoir we devised eight methods to predict water levels 1 neural network model nn 2 neural network model with feedback correction cnn 3 water balance model wb 4 water balance model with feedback correction cwb 5 neural network model coupled with water balance model nn wb 6 neural network model with feedback correction coupled with water balance model cnn wb 7 neural network model coupled with water balance with feedback correction nn cwb and 8 neural network model with feedback correction coupled with water balance with feedback correction cnn cwb all the weights for each combination model are calculated separately table 1 shows the water level predictions for each model throughout 2020 the error of the cwb improved significantly compared to wb and the cnn corrected by error feedback did not enhance noticeably compared to nn the performance of the cwb coupled nn was the best under the no gate opening condition and the average error within 90 min could be maintained at approximately 10 cm which is 63 better than the accuracy of nn and 65 better than that of wb under the gate opening condition cwb cnn and cwb nn performed similarly the cwb cnn effect was slightly better the average error could be maintained at approximately 23 36 cm in 90 min and the accuracy was improved by 45 compared with that of nn and 67 compared with that of wb therefore cwb nn was chosen as the prediction model for the no gate opening condition and cwb cnn was chosen as the prediction model for the gate opening condition fig 6 shows the typical results for 2020 wb showed more obvious water level trend changes than nn and the curve was relatively smooth however the model simulation results often do not accurately match the actual trend of water level changes resulting in large errors in the water level prediction of wb it is usually assumed that the upstream and downstream water level during the calculation period is a fixed average water level and this is used as the boundary condition for the generator set or the floodgate to calculate the discharge however in practice the boundary conditions during the calculation period are not fixed as wb is calculated by iteratively solving the water level sequence when the calculated water level is high at a certain time period the discharge of the same unit output will be small this results in a higher water level in the next time period and the error accumulates with each iteration the wb model has the characteristic of error accumulation and the model will continuously magnify the error of a time period thus yielding results that deviate from reality meanwhile various types of a priori relationships are also very sensitive to the accuracy of the wb such as the water level capacity curve unit characteristics curve and gate discharge curve some of these relationships will gradually change with the increase in reservoir operation time thus the original design relationship sometimes does not reflect the real physical situation the nn results in fig 6 are jagged and the trend of water level change is not obvious which sometimes produces the opposite trend of the actual water level change this is because the data driven model is a black box model and does not have a more reasonable explanation of the mechanistic properties at the same time the data driven model requires high data quality and the measured historical data in the training sample should meet a certain quality for the model to achieve high accuracy the results of the weights of nn cwb for each time period for the model with the best coupling effect are shown in fig 7 the trend of the weight gradually decreases because the wb error increases cumulatively with time and the error of nn does not have an error accumulation effect the overall proportion of weights with gates was smaller than that without gates probably because the cumulative effect of wb errors was further magnified by the addition of gates as a variable the coupled model of wb and nn can reduce the impact of individual models with large errors on the prediction value according to the error of individual models at different time periods so as to achieve the goal of improving accuracy however when all individual models have large errors it is difficult to further reduce the error 3 3 real time optimal operation as shown in fig 1 the real time optimization module is invoked when the water level predicted by the operation plan is not within the expected water level range table 2 shows the average results of the optimization in different ways without reduced decision space rds pso and de algorithms had long computation times and had difficulty converging to the optimal solution owing to the large decision space thus these algorithms cannot meet the demand of real time scheduling and their wcr was also poor combining the optimization algorithm with the rds can fully exploit the advantages of the optimization algorithm reducing the computation time by 46 compared to the exhaustive reduced decision space while producing similar scheduling results compared with the optimization algorithm without decision space constraints it decreased the optimization time by 83 on an average with the same termination optimization conditions and achieved better scheduling results in rds the economical and safe strategies formed by the optimization algorithm and the exhaustive method both advanced the load and gate actions avoiding frequent or excessive load and gate actions and maintaining a low wcr on january 17 the algorithm lowered the generation output in advance to avoid a gradual reduction of the water level in the actual action leading to a decreased generation fig 8 on april 4 the algorithm recommended keeping the generation output constant and maintaining high head generation while maintaining the water level in a safe range on july 23 the algorithm suggested raising the generation output and reducing the gate opening to enhance the generation efficiency on november 10 the algorithm suggested an early generation output increase reducing the number of load changes while maintaining high water level operation although the optimization algorithm with rds was faster in terms of computation than the exhaustive method with rds and the scheduling results were similar we still chose to use the exhaustive method for scheduling decisions this was because exhaustive enumeration can guarantee that the optimal solution in the decision space and the computation time can meet the demand of real time scheduling the optimization algorithm was faster but the computation time and effect were still uncertain our model has the following advantages over traditional methods 1 the model has a higher accuracy than traditional methods and improves decision executability 2 the model computation time can meet the real time scheduling requirements and can guarantee the optimal solution 3 the model can correct the decision with real time feedback to improve the efficiency of decision execution 4 discussion for the prediction results of multiple forecasting models the error distribution of each type of model for different calculation time periods differed significantly this problem can be solved using eq 6 table 1 shows that eqs 17 and 18 can reflect the unobserved or inaccurate measurements in the reservoir scheduling system high accuracy of water level prediction could make the decision acceptable to the dispatcher and it is important to regulate the actual operation of hydropower stations table 2 shows the tremendous improvement in the efficiency of the optimization computation by reducing the decision space the exhaustive decision space is also feasible in real time scheduling the method proposed in this study can be applied to hydropower plants of various sizes and is highly effective in run of river hydropower plants with small reservoir capacity however if reservoir inflow cannot be projected from upstream reservoir discharge this leads to a significant challenge for the decision because of the high uncertainty of hydrological forecasts the setting of the time step is one of the directions that can be further investigated and the influence of the time step on the decision needs to be further elaborated 5 conclusion the study proposes a real time control method for hydropower stations the three main highlights of the study are as follows 1 the prediction accuracy was improved by coupling the physics based wb model and the data driven nn model through weights 2 the decision space was reduced based on the actual operation of the reservoir avoiding a dimensional disaster that leads to a surge in computation time and non convergence to the optimization solution and 3 the time period error in rolling optimization was converted into incoming reservoir flow thus adapting to the reservoir time variability with imperfect monitoring system and upgrading the prediction accuracy therefore this study can be applied to the real time scheduling of run of river power plants that currently have a large amount of historical operational data imperfect monitoring systems and vague scheduling processes future research can focus on building nn models for water level prediction and refining the weights in different cases to further improve

2380,real time control of hydroelectric generating units and floodgates is the key to ensuring the economy and safety of hydroelectric production runoff hydropower plants require high real time control accuracy because of the small regulation interval the existing real time control methods have certain shortcomings such as frequent load and gate adjustments and a wide range of water level fluctuations therefore we propose a data driven and physics based coupled real time model predictive control mpc method with the aim to develop a highly accurate control strategy compared to the traditional mpc model the model proposed in this study presents three major improvements 1 the data driven and physics based coupled model enhances the accuracy of water level prediction 2 the corresponding decision framework is developed for the actual operation of the power station to reduce the decision space and 3 a feedback correction mechanism that can convert the water level prediction error into flow error which reflects the time varying nature of the system we demonstrate that the coupled prediction model combined with feedback correction improves the water level prediction accuracy by 60 on average moreover the reduced decision space enables the optimization algorithm to reduce the optimization time by 83 on average and achieve a globally optimal solution in the decision space the proposed data driven and physics based coupled real time mpc method is thus useful for the real time regulation of run of river power plants abbreviations de differential

neural network data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as a high quality renewable energy source hydropower plays a very important role in the energy mix the total global hydropower installed capacity accounted for 55 6 of renewable energy worldwide and had a total generation capacity of more than 18 3 by the end of 2019 li et al 2021 ren21 2020a the increased demand for renewable energy has led to massive expansion of small hydroelectric plants especially run of river plants kuriqi et al 2019 as of the end of 2019 run of river power plants had a global installed capacity of 170 gw including more than 68 gw in china with an annual power generation capacity of more than 200 twh which is important for socioeconomic development cheng et al 2015 kishore et al 2021 ren21 2020b however the small reservoir capacity and small adjustable water level interval cause rainfall and runoff to drastically affect the short term power generation of run of river power plants thereby threatening the economics and safety of dispatch qiang et al 2016 with the rapid development of hydropower short term and real time control of power plants has become key research topics li and jiang 2011 following the current dispatching protocol in china the power station dispatcher makes a dispatching plan and submits it to the grid 1 day in advance and then ensures the economic operation of the power station based on real time operation fallah mehdipour et al 2012 lu et al 2015 consequently the effectiveness of real time dispatch of power stations largely depends on the level of the dispatcher zhang et al 2013 such characteristics are more highlighted in runoff power plants therefore they require more accurate and optimal scheduling models for real time regulation and control yuan and zhou 2017 considering this background model predictive control mpc has been gradually applied in the field of real time water resources scheduling delgoda et al 2013 ocampo martinez et al 2013 velarde et al 2019 mpc can perform the functions of a classical control method such as error feedback correction delgoda et al 2016 schwanenberg et al 2015 for complex systems with time variability and uncertainty ghadimi and firouz 2015 and is also able to handle time delays constraints and multiple objectives maciejowski 2002 richalet et al 1978 mpc usually consists of three components 1 a predictive model capable of demonstrating future system processes kong et al 2019 used a simplified st venant equation in mpc to describe the canal hydraulic characteristics and thus the automatic control of the south north water diversion middle route project in china aguilar et al 2016 validated an irrigated area in spain using a discrete time linear model under the mpc strategy 2 rolling optimization owing to the high dimensionality of the decision space and the complex nonlinear relationships in the water resources scheduling domain the strategy seeking process is combined with optimization algorithms to reduce the computation time myo lin et al 2020 found the pareto front by adopting the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii based on the simulation of a reservoir system using the st venant equation under the mpc strategy chiang and willems 2015 tested the flood control effectiveness of gate weirs using a genetic algorithm ga within the mpc framework 3 feedforward and feedback control to the best of our knowledge error feedback correction in mpc has not been studied extensively in real time water resources scheduling as one of the main control parameters in real time reservoir scheduling the water level in front of the dam can be chosen as the objective of the prediction model water balance models are often used in the simulation of hydropower plants rani and moreira 2010 they are widely used in the scheduling of large and medium sized reservoirs or cascade reservoirs because the process mechanism is clear the underlying data are accurate and comprehensive and the accuracy meets certain requirements in large and medium sized power plant scenarios liao et al 2020 tan et al 2020 data driven neural network models are usually capable of representing more complex nonlinear relationships gao et al 2020 kisi et al 2012 peralta et al 2014 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 reservoir water level changes are coupled with multiple nonlinear relationships but few researchers have applied them to reservoir water level simulations and predictions fayaed et al 2013 different models have advantages and disadvantages in different aspects hence the method of coupling various models to complement each other s strengths is widely used in practice rai and sahu 2020 the coupling approaches can be broadly classified into the following categories 1 adjusting the parameter composition or structure of the data driven model with a priori knowledge and results of the physics based model kisi et al 2012 predicted intermittent runoff by neural networks using known input data such as rainfall peralta et al 2014 used the available mechanistic model results to train neural networks for predicting the response of surface water groundwater interactions to different hydraulic stimuli atieh et al 2015 considered indices that capture the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation as input parameters to a neural network to predict the flow processes at stations 2 using data driven models to rate or calculate a parameter or complex linear relationship in a physics based model shang et al 2019 employed neural network models to predict downstream water levels in reservoirs and assist in reservoir operation and scheduling banihabib et al 2019 used neural network models for reservoir inflow prediction to assist in reservoir power generation flood control and other optimal operations tang et al 2014 reconstructed natural runoff with neural network models as a tool to assess the impact of human activities and climate change on the environment 3 enhancing the data driven model with physics based models to make the data driven model results controllable and reduce the singular solutions generated by the non training set of work conditions xie et al 2021 strengthened the robustness of the neural network model using the extreme scenarios generated by the physics based model as part of the input to the data driven model read et al 2019 incorporated energy conservation constraints into a data driven model and predicted lake water temperatures at different depths farfán et al 2020 corrected the mismatch scenario and applied physical knowledge to a neural network model the theory of optimal dispatching of reservoirs for power generation is well developed after determining the optimization objective function it can be solved using optimization algorithms such as dynamic programming on the water balance model yeh 1985 however the large decision space in the optimal scheduling of reservoir power generation results in a dimensional disaster problem carpentier et al 2018 he et al 2022 which can make it difficult for the optimization algorithm to converge to a globally optimal solution or may require long computational times to solve this problem niu et al 2021 optimized the gray wolf optimizer to increase the algorithm search capability and speed up the convergence fu et al 2020 proposed an algorithm that effectively optimizes each prediction parameter and significantly improved the performance feng et al 2020 improved the dynamic programming algorithm to effectively reduce the dimensions of complex hydropower operation problems using object specific heuristic intelligence algorithms a unique evolutionary mechanism or an optimization seeking strategy can be created in accordance with certain characteristics of the optimization problem however such algorithms usually have shortcomings such as premature or local optimality pandey et al 2014 and the algorithm performance fluctuates within a certain range wang et al 2018 improved the efficiency of the solution by reducing the maximum consumption space of renewable power tsoukalas and makropoulos 2015 solved the problem of calculation workload by introducing a hydrological uncertainty probability function in depth investigation of the actual operation process and regulations of hydropower plants can significantly reduce the decision space along with the reduction of the decision space computational efficiency will rapidly increase therefore we can even use an exhaustive method that can meet the model computational timeliness while ensuring that the obtained solution is a globally optimal solution wu et al 2018 to meet the real time control accuracy requirements and ensure feasibility of run of river hydropower plants we optimized each of the three parts of mpc 1 coupling the physics based model with the data driven model to improve the prediction accuracy 2 compressing the decision space to improve the optimization efficiency according to the actual operation protocol of the power plant and 3 proposing a method for error feedback this study aims to perform real time scheduling of run of river power plants by mpc the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the framework and components of mpc are described in detail in section 2 in section 3 the basic situation of the study area is described the methods described in section 2 are applied to the region and the corresponding results are presented in detail in section 4 the effects of the method are further elucidated finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology the real time scheduling process of mpc in a reservoir is shown in fig 1 the input data are the current reservoir water level z0 reservoir inflow sequence i future output planning sequence n and gate opening planning sequence a after the feedback correction of the inflow sequence in the error feedback module all inputs are compiled into a hydropower plant operation plan and transmitted to the prediction model the prediction model then generates the process of future water level changes corresponding to the operation plan into two parts 1 the error feedback module obtains the future water level process predicted by the model and forms an error feedback correction term with the actual input in the future and 2 determine whether the future water level process exceeds the expected water level range and if so call the optimization model the error feedback and prediction model are executed in a looping process when the water level process exceeds the expected water level range the optimization model reduces the optimization decision space using the operation plan and finds the best solution in the decision space and then outputs the best solution after comparison to form the scheduling recommendation 2 1 water level prediction model 2 1 1 water balance model for reservoir water level prediction su et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 a mechanism driven model such as the water balance model can be applied the general expression can be described as follows 1 v t 1 v t i t o t δ t e t l t where v t is the reservoir capacity at time period t i t and o t are reservoir inflow and outflow at time period t respectively δ t is the time step and e t and l t are the total evaporation and seepage of the reservoir at time period t respectively the evaporation and leakage at the minute scale in real time dispatch are small compared to the outflow and inflow so these can be neglected 2 z t f v t 3 q n g δ h n n 4 q g h δ h g a where z t is the water level at time period t f is the mapping relationship between water level and reservoir capacity q n is the power generation outflow δ h n is the generation net head g is the mapping of the net head of generation generation output and generation outflow n is the generation output q g is the gate outflow δ h g is the gate head a is the gate opening degree and h is the relationship between gate head gate opening and gate outflow the generation discharge and gate discharge constitute the reservoir outflow 2 1 2 neural network model data driven models can be classified as machine learning and deep learning machine learning first uses existing human knowledge to construct features that reflect the object of study from the collected data and then builds a model with a relatively simple structure such as a decision tree deep learning builds models directly on the collected data and learns the underlying pattern features in the data through the model s own learning capabilities such as recurrent neural networks data driven models can be used to describe various types of nonlinear relationships in a reservoir when the reservoir has been in operation for a long time the data quality is high and the amount of data is large such that the time series of the water level of the reservoir can be acquired directly or indirectly from eq 1 we know that the relevant variables of the reservoir water level are clear and the corresponding input and output can be directly used to fit the reservoir nonlinear relationship fig 2 the long short term memory lstm of the recurrent neural network was adopted and the input data are the water level of the reservoir at the current moment the inflow sequence of the reservoir in the predicted time horizon the unit output plan and the gate opening plan the output is the water level sequence in the predicted time horizon and the water level sequence is generated in a single time period this is to avoid the accumulation of errors created by individual generation with the accuracy of the fitted water level process as the sole objective mean squared error mse was used as the loss function eq 5 5 ms e data 1 st i s t t z it z it 2 where ms e data is the mean squared error of the predicted water level process t is the prediction horizon s is the training data set and z it and z it are the observed and model predicted values of the sample i at time period t respectively 2 1 3 coupling model because the water balance and the neural network models perform differently in different calculation periods the weight coefficients can be used to clarify the accuracy of the two models in different periods eq 6 and correct the final results of the reservoir water level prediction model the greater the weight coefficient the higher the accuracy of the water balance model results for that time period and the lower the accuracy of the neural network model results and vice versa the objective of minimizing the cumulative error of the water level in each time period eq 8 was solved using more mature optimization algorithms e g differential evolution de and particle swarm optimization pso 6 z t w t w b t 1 w t n n t 7 0 w t 1 where w t is the weighting coefficient at time period t the weighting coefficient should be within a certain interval to maintain a monotonic influence on the results w b t is the result of the water balance model at time period t and n n t is the neural network model result at time period t 8 min i s t t e t i where e t i is the error between the observed value and the result of the coupled model of the sample i at time period t s is the set of samples and t is the set of time periods 2 2 optimal operation of reservoir power generation 2 2 1 optimization objectives the characteristic smaller regulation capacity of run of river power plants which usually have power generation as their main objective paish 2002 makes it difficult to maintain their operating conditions including output and gate opening in a stable state when the boundary conditions change frequently the operating conditions of the hydropower plants must also be changed accordingly such high frequency changes in operating conditions will result in serious wear and tear of the hydraulic machinery of the power station thus reducing its service life while it is also a great test for dispatchers this can be avoided by optimal operation of the power station optimization requires advance consideration of the changes in boundary conditions to find stable working conditions and make full use of the reservoir regulation capacity of run of river hydropower plants it is also necessary to keep the power plant operating economically by maintaining high power generation efficiency therefore the optimization objective is to maximize the water level process to meet the expected water level range eq 9 reduce the number of output and load actions and maintain a low water consumption rate wcr eqs 10 and 11 9 mins i t z t l max z t l max 0 else l min z t z t l min where s is the degree to which the water level process meets the water level range and l max and l min are the upper and lower lines of the desired water level range respectively 10 minat a t n a t a 11 minwcr c t e t where at is the number of changes in the operating conditions of the hydropower plant a t n is the number of power generation output changes a t a is the number of gate opening changes wcr is the water consumption rate of the plant c t is the total water consumption in time period t including gate discharge and e t is the amount of electricity generated in time period t multi objective optimization problems can be derived as pareto fronts or converted to single objective optimization problems using weights we choose the latter method when we use intelligent algorithms and the weights of eqs 9 10 and 11 are 10 1 and 0 4 respectively when the exhaustive method can list all solutions in the feasible domain we simply need to screen solutions to meet the water level range and first filter using eq 10 and then using eq 11 the function is subject to the following constraints water level limits reservoir discharge limits hydropower generation limits and hydraulic connections ① water level limits 12 z min z z max where z min and z max are the lower and upper water level limits of the reservoir respectively ② reservoir discharge limits 13 q min q q max where q min and q max are the lower and upper water discharge limits of the reservoir respectively ③ hydropower generation limits 14 n min n n max where n min and n max are the lower and upper generation limits of the reservoir respectively ④ hydraulic connections 15 i t k ω q t k b t where ω is the set of upstream reservoirs q t k is the discharge of reservoir k at time t and b t is the local inflow at time t 2 2 2 decision framework in the optimal dispatching of reservoir power generation the upstream water level is usually discrete as a decision variable at each calculation time however it is difficult to reduce the decision space composed of the upstream water level because the nonlinear relationship coupled by the upstream water level is far too complex the variables that can affect the upstream water level are power generation flow q n and flood flow q g which are related to the power generation output n and gate opening a through eqs 3 and 4 respectively in the power grid operation and dispatching regulations to ensure the power supply requirements of the grid the power station on the power generation output control needs to obtain permission from the grid which indicates that the power station cannot change the load at any time therefore without the need for a discrete generation output at a point in time when the generation output cannot be changed we can count in the historical data of the time when the power station applied for load from the grid is to be approved and use it as the time interval when the hydropower station can change the load for the gate the power station has control rights thus it can change the gate during the first dispatching period however if the inflow is a short time pulse historical data show that this often occurs in the flood season it is difficult to complete the water level control with a single gate change thus setting the second gate change time thus the number of generation output changes and gate changes during the calculation period can be minimized with only one load change in the best case and one load and two gate changes required in the worst case scenarios fig 3 thus the plan can be described using only six parameters 1 the time of change of power output 2 time of change of the first gate opening 3 amount of change in the power output 4 amount of change in the first gate opening 5 time of change of the second gate opening and 6 amount of change in the second gate opening 2 2 3 optimization solution a exhaustive method a smaller decision space can be used to find the global optimal solution using the exhaustive enumeration method the strategies in the decision space are arranged and combined and then brought into the prediction model to obtain the reservoir water level process corresponding to all the strategies b optimization algorithm optimization algorithms e g pso and de are used to determine the optimal decision that will further reduce the optimization time the six parameters required for the decision are brought into the optimization algorithm as independent variables the corresponding hard constraints are then set and each individual formed decision is brought into the prediction model to acquire the corresponding water level process while using eq 16 as the optimization objective considering safety and economy 16 minf w c r s where f is individual fitness 2 3 error feedback to cope with the instability and time varying nature of the system in the mpc rolling optimization process we can compare the predicted value of the previous time period with the actual measured value of the current moment the errors can be presented as a combination of the prediction model and systematic errors in the problem of reservoir dispatch the resulting water level error can be converted to an inflow error using eq 17 and this error can then applied as a correction term to all inputs to the prediction model at the current moment using eq 18 17 δ q t f 1 z t f 1 z t 1 t m t 18 q t c δ q t q t where δ q t is the flow error correction term z t and z t 1 t m are the observed water level at time period t and the model s predicted water level at time period t 1 for time period t respectively t is the length of the time period and q t c and q t are the corrected inflow rate at time period t and the actual inflow rate at time period t respectively 2 4 prediction horizon the prediction time horizon in mpc is relevant to the performance of the control algorithm too long a control time horizon will increase the computational workload whereas a too short horizon will not achieve the control effect zhang et al 2019 in reservoir dispatch the longer the time scale the greater the uncertainty in reservoir inflow with the effect of reservoir inflow being more uncertain than that of other influencing factors liu et al 2019 in a group of cascade reservoirs when the downstream reservoir has no large branches from the upstream reservoir its incoming flow is usually determined by the upstream reservoir wu et al 2021 therefore the reliable prediction time could be based on the lag time of the upstream reservoir discharge traveling to the dispatching reservoir indicating that the inflow in the last period of the reliable prediction time is the upstream reservoir discharge in the current period but the shorter reliable prediction time horizon is not capable of presenting the mpc optimization effect hence in this study two to three times the reliable prediction time horizon is considered as the prediction time horizon outside the reliable prediction time horizon is called the reference prediction time horizon fig 4 and the runoff input of the reference prediction time horizon is determined according to the extent of the reliable prediction time horizon the inflow of the target reservoir is backcalculated according to eq 19 and the travel time of the downstream reservoir flow is analyzed by introducing the error accumulation term in eq 20 19 q t in v z et v z bt δ t q t out 20 min t 0 t u t j q t in 2 where q t in is the time period average inflow q t out is the time period average outflow z bt and z et are the reservoir capacity at the beginning and end of the period respectively u t j is the average upstream outflow in time period t j and j is the length of the delay time 3 case study 3 1 study area 3 1 1 basin information we tested the real time control system proposed in this paper at the shaping hydropower station sp in the dadu river basin of sichuan province mainland china with selected operational data on reservoir water level power generation output floodgate opening downstream water level and upstream reservoir discharge for 2 years 2019 and 2020 the location of the reservoir is shown in fig 5 a and a simplified schematic diagram of the inflow and outflow at sp is shown in fig 5 b the main purpose of the sp is to generate electricity while ensuring flood control the dead water level of sp is 550 0 m and the normal storage level is 554 0 m the reservoir regulation capacity is only 5 85 million m3 and the average annual runoff of the dadu river is 1 500 m3 s at the initial water level of 553 5 m and an increase of 200 m3 s in the inflow sp will exceed the normal storage level within one hour showing that the reservoir regulation capacity of sp is very small because of the high flow of flood discharge and elevated tailwater level and to improve the economic efficiency of hydropower and keep the output of generating units unimpeded sp needs to maintain a higher water level further reducing the regulation range of the reservoir the upstream of the sp is the zhentouba hydropower station ztb the tributary flow between the two stations is extremely small compared to the main stream therefore the incoming flow of sp is mainly influenced by the discharge of the ztb causing the water level of the sp to be very sensitive to the outflow from the upstream ztb 3 1 2 data processing in the real time optimization to maintain the economic operation of the hydropower plant 552 5 553 5 m was selected as the desired interval of optimized operating water level the operation and scheduling of the power generation output plan of sp must obey the unified arrangement of higher departments and follow the unified planning of the entire power grid when the dispatchers of sp need to change the power generation output according to the actual situation of the power station they must apply to the central control center this process usually results in a response time of 15 to 25 min after the application is submitted and historical data show that the majority of applications were approved the power station should not apply for another output change within 3 h after approval the floodgate is controlled by the sp and the gate status can be changed at any time if the time step is discrete to 5 min the change time of the generation output can be controlled in three moments from 15 to 25 min and changed only once the gate action is controlled twice the first time for the next moment of the control moment and the second time for one of the three moments between 15 and 25 min based on the historical data and the machine characteristics the generation output and the gate can be changed based on the current state at 100 mw and 5 m respectively and the discrete steps are 5 mw and 0 5 m accordingly the operation data of sp in 2019 was selected and the delay time from the release of ztb to sp was projected to be 75 min using eqs 19 and 20 historical data show that the annual variation of the 2019 pillow dam flow exceeded 10 of the flow and the previous moment only accounted for 4 8 of the year therefore 75 min was used as a reliable prediction horizon and 105 min was selected as the reference prediction horizon the inflows in the reference prediction time horizon are all the inflows at 75 min the total prediction time horizon was 3 h and 5 min was selected as the control time horizon by integrating the frequency and quality of data collection 3 2 water level prediction model we obtained the lstm neural network model for water level prediction using the 2019 data to form the training and validation sets to increase the model robustness the model training data formed from the 2019 measured data were divided into two types based on whether the gates were all closed or opened for the three hour water level prediction in the historical data of 2020 the reservoir inflow in the input data is the sequence of outflows of the ztb from 75 min ago to the moment of calculation the power generation output and gate opening were adopted from the historical actual data where the upstream water level and downstream water level at the current moment of the calculation period were used as the initial state of the reservoir we devised eight methods to predict water levels 1 neural network model nn 2 neural network model with feedback correction cnn 3 water balance model wb 4 water balance model with feedback correction cwb 5 neural network model coupled with water balance model nn wb 6 neural network model with feedback correction coupled with water balance model cnn wb 7 neural network model coupled with water balance with feedback correction nn cwb and 8 neural network model with feedback correction coupled with water balance with feedback correction cnn cwb all the weights for each combination model are calculated separately table 1 shows the water level predictions for each model throughout 2020 the error of the cwb improved significantly compared to wb and the cnn corrected by error feedback did not enhance noticeably compared to nn the performance of the cwb coupled nn was the best under the no gate opening condition and the average error within 90 min could be maintained at approximately 10 cm which is 63 better than the accuracy of nn and 65 better than that of wb under the gate opening condition cwb cnn and cwb nn performed similarly the cwb cnn effect was slightly better the average error could be maintained at approximately 23 36 cm in 90 min and the accuracy was improved by 45 compared with that of nn and 67 compared with that of wb therefore cwb nn was chosen as the prediction model for the no gate opening condition and cwb cnn was chosen as the prediction model for the gate opening condition fig 6 shows the typical results for 2020 wb showed more obvious water level trend changes than nn and the curve was relatively smooth however the model simulation results often do not accurately match the actual trend of water level changes resulting in large errors in the water level prediction of wb it is usually assumed that the upstream and downstream water level during the calculation period is a fixed average water level and this is used as the boundary condition for the generator set or the floodgate to calculate the discharge however in practice the boundary conditions during the calculation period are not fixed as wb is calculated by iteratively solving the water level sequence when the calculated water level is high at a certain time period the discharge of the same unit output will be small this results in a higher water level in the next time period and the error accumulates with each iteration the wb model has the characteristic of error accumulation and the model will continuously magnify the error of a time period thus yielding results that deviate from reality meanwhile various types of a priori relationships are also very sensitive to the accuracy of the wb such as the water level capacity curve unit characteristics curve and gate discharge curve some of these relationships will gradually change with the increase in reservoir operation time thus the original design relationship sometimes does not reflect the real physical situation the nn results in fig 6 are jagged and the trend of water level change is not obvious which sometimes produces the opposite trend of the actual water level change this is because the data driven model is a black box model and does not have a more reasonable explanation of the mechanistic properties at the same time the data driven model requires high data quality and the measured historical data in the training sample should meet a certain quality for the model to achieve high accuracy the results of the weights of nn cwb for each time period for the model with the best coupling effect are shown in fig 7 the trend of the weight gradually decreases because the wb error increases cumulatively with time and the error of nn does not have an error accumulation effect the overall proportion of weights with gates was smaller than that without gates probably because the cumulative effect of wb errors was further magnified by the addition of gates as a variable the coupled model of wb and nn can reduce the impact of individual models with large errors on the prediction value according to the error of individual models at different time periods so as to achieve the goal of improving accuracy however when all individual models have large errors it is difficult to further reduce the error 3 3 real time optimal operation as shown in fig 1 the real time optimization module is invoked when the water level predicted by the operation plan is not within the expected water level range table 2 shows the average results of the optimization in different ways without reduced decision space rds pso and de algorithms had long computation times and had difficulty converging to the optimal solution owing to the large decision space thus these algorithms cannot meet the demand of real time scheduling and their wcr was also poor combining the optimization algorithm with the rds can fully exploit the advantages of the optimization algorithm reducing the computation time by 46 compared to the exhaustive reduced decision space while producing similar scheduling results compared with the optimization algorithm without decision space constraints it decreased the optimization time by 83 on an average with the same termination optimization conditions and achieved better scheduling results in rds the economical and safe strategies formed by the optimization algorithm and the exhaustive method both advanced the load and gate actions avoiding frequent or excessive load and gate actions and maintaining a low wcr on january 17 the algorithm lowered the generation output in advance to avoid a gradual reduction of the water level in the actual action leading to a decreased generation fig 8 on april 4 the algorithm recommended keeping the generation output constant and maintaining high head generation while maintaining the water level in a safe range on july 23 the algorithm suggested raising the generation output and reducing the gate opening to enhance the generation efficiency on november 10 the algorithm suggested an early generation output increase reducing the number of load changes while maintaining high water level operation although the optimization algorithm with rds was faster in terms of computation than the exhaustive method with rds and the scheduling results were similar we still chose to use the exhaustive method for scheduling decisions this was because exhaustive enumeration can guarantee that the optimal solution in the decision space and the computation time can meet the demand of real time scheduling the optimization algorithm was faster but the computation time and effect were still uncertain our model has the following advantages over traditional methods 1 the model has a higher accuracy than traditional methods and improves decision executability 2 the model computation time can meet the real time scheduling requirements and can guarantee the optimal solution 3 the model can correct the decision with real time feedback to improve the efficiency of decision execution 4 discussion for the prediction results of multiple forecasting models the error distribution of each type of model for different calculation time periods differed significantly this problem can be solved using eq 6 table 1 shows that eqs 17 and 18 can reflect the unobserved or inaccurate measurements in the reservoir scheduling system high accuracy of water level prediction could make the decision acceptable to the dispatcher and it is important to regulate the actual operation of hydropower stations table 2 shows the tremendous improvement in the efficiency of the optimization computation by reducing the decision space the exhaustive decision space is also feasible in real time scheduling the method proposed in this study can be applied to hydropower plants of various sizes and is highly effective in run of river hydropower plants with small reservoir capacity however if reservoir inflow cannot be projected from upstream reservoir discharge this leads to a significant challenge for the decision because of the high uncertainty of hydrological forecasts the setting of the time step is one of the directions that can be further investigated and the influence of the time step on the decision needs to be further elaborated 5 conclusion the study proposes a real time control method for hydropower stations the three main highlights of the study are as follows 1 the prediction accuracy was improved by coupling the physics based wb model and the data driven nn model through weights 2 the decision space was reduced based on the actual operation of the reservoir avoiding a dimensional disaster that leads to a surge in computation time and non convergence to the optimization solution and 3 the time period error in rolling optimization was converted into incoming reservoir flow thus adapting to the reservoir time variability with imperfect monitoring system and upgrading the prediction accuracy therefore this study can be applied to the real time scheduling of run of river power plants that currently have a large amount of historical operational data imperfect monitoring systems and vague scheduling processes future research can focus on building nn models for water level prediction and refining the weights in different cases to further improve

2381,both blue water and green water contribute to agricultural water scarcity which is subjected to impacts of precipitation variations in the context of climate change however an explicit quantification of the possible effects of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity index awsi under historical and future climate is absent in this study we applied an integrated awsi which incorporates blue water and green water to estimate agricultural water scarcity in china and to determine the association of awsi with precipitation variations over the historical 1971 2010 and future 2031 2070 periods precipitation variations have substantial effects on changes in awsi especially during extremely dry years with precipitation anomaly lower than 2 standard deviation changes of awsi from the multi year average could be as high as 31 future climate change would further intensify awsi and amplify the effects of precipitation variations particularly in inner mongolia with changes of awsi over 200 southwestern china could also experience expanding agricultural water scarcity under future climate scenarios improving irrigation efficiency has potential to alleviate water scarcity by up to 30 this study provides valuable information for scientists and policy decision makers to cope with the impacts of precipitation variations on awsi keywords blue water green water

under which water requirements of agricultural economic social and environmental sectors cannot be satisfied by available water resources oki and kanae 2006 it has become an increasing threat to humans and ecosystems sustainability and is expected to be more seriously under future climate change conditions hoekstra 2014 richter et al 2020 schewe et al 2014 agriculture is the world s largest water user and is prominently impacted by climate change and population growth gerten et al 2020 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 zhang et al 2020 continuously increases in irrigation water withdrawal have led to growing water scarcity in many places of the world falkenmark 2013 postel et al 1996 qin et al 2019 as a consequence aggravation of water scarcity in agriculture affects food production and thus threatens food security huang et al 2017 liu et al 2022a pastor et al 2019 a proper assessment of water scarcity is the first step to address the water scarcity issues most previous researches on water scarcity have largely focused on blue water i e available freshwater from groundwater streams and lakes liu et al 2017 although green water the water store in soil aquifer and can be used as evapotranspiration by crops alone accounts for roughly 85 of crop water demand across the world hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 liu et al 2009 it has often been ignored in water resources and scarcity evaluations liu et al 2022a xie et al 2020 however evaluations based on only blue water may not sufficiently reflect the realistic water scarcity conditions in major crop production regions nunez et al 2013 quinteiro et al 2018 that is because green water is the only water resources for rainfed cultivations and an important part of water resources for irrigated lands as a result concurrent variations in both blue and green water availability and consumption will affect water scarcity in agriculture liu et al 2017 veettil and mishra 2016 which makes agriculture more sensitive to climatic change in many places there have been some efforts to incorporate blue and green water scarcity in an integrated water scarcity assessment liu et al 2022a developed a comprehensive agricultural water scarcity index awsi that incorporates both green and blue water availability and consumption and compared it with conventional water scarcity index focusing only on blue water over the period 1971 2010 on a global scale after that liu et al 2022b applied this index to assess the possible impacts of future climate change on awsi however liu et al 2022b only explored the average changes of agricultural water scarcity during the period 2026 2050 the major limitation of these integrated studies is that the impacts of precipitation variations on awsi were overlooked for both historical and future climate conditions renewable water resources will be influenced by expected changes in climate especially changes in precipitation therefore leading to variations in water scarcity moursi et al 2017 recently several studies have investigated the effects of precipitation changes on water scarcity on different spatiotemporal scales gampe et al 2016 gao et al 2021 for example coffel et al 2019 found that future hot and dry climate could worsen blue water scarcity in the nile river basin despite projected increases in future precipitation quinteiro et al 2019 assessed how climate in future could affect future green water poverty under a reference period 1986 2005 and a future period 2046 2065 climate in portugal kummu et al 2014 quantified the effects of hydroclimatic change on global blue and green water resources availability and requirements based on historical climate forcing datasets during the historical period 1977 2006 besides they also determined the frequency of water scarcity by quantifying the number of years falling in the water scarcity although it is already known that precipitation has direct impact on water scarcity the level to which precipitation variations would affect the integrated water scarcity incorporating blue and green water is still unclear especially during extremely wet and dry years under both historical and future climate conditions this absent information impairs the formulation of robust policy decision for coping with climate change effects on awsi to address the above research gaps this study applied an integrated awsi via combining green water and blue water availability and use as well as environmental flow requirements efr liu et al 2022a to assess historical and future changes in awsi and the linkages to changes in precipitation the mainland china was taken as the study area given that china is facing and will still experience severe water scarcity under the current and future climate conditions cao et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ren et al 2021 zhao et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 the long term changes in awsi in china was verified for the historical 1971 2010 and future 2031 2070 periods at the grid 0 5 arc degree and province levels locations of each province and separation of northern and southern provinces are provided in fig s1 agricultural blue and green water availability and use were simulated by a large scale hydrological model namely pcr globwb wada et al 2014 we considered two future representative concentration pathway rcp climate scenarios i e low emission scenario rcp2 6 and no mitigation scenario rcp6 0 this study explicitly and quantitatively determined the possible impacts of precipitation variations on awsi under the historical and future periods which provides useful information for policy decision makers to formulate robust measures to tackle the water scarcity issues 2 methods and data 2 1 agricultural water scarcity index the agricultural water scarcity index awsi was calculated as a ratio of crop water demand without water limitation to total water availability considering green water blue water and efr liu et al 2022a this index measures the degree to which total water availability including blue and green water could meet crop water demand when awsi 1 it indicates that the total water availability is not enough to meet the crop water demand otherwise there is no agricultural water scarcity it could be estimated as 1 awsi i 1 n etc i wa g wa b 2 wa b q ww os e f r i e where etci is the unstressed water demand for crop i m3 mon 1 which was calculated by the product of potential evapotranspiration pet and crop specific coefficients allen et al 1998 n is the number of crops considered which equals to 19 in this study wag is agricultural green water availability m3 mon 1 which includes water evaporated from soil moisture or rainwater from rainfed and irrigated cropland wab is agricultural blue water availability m3 mon 1 ie is irrigation efficiency dimensionless q is total blue water resources estimated as streamflow m3 mon 1 wwos is water withdrawal for other sectors except irrigation including domestic industrial and livestock m3 mon 1 efr is environmental flow requirements m3 mon 1 which is estimated by the variable monthly flow vmf method pastor et al 2014 the vmf method is a valid hydrological method for estimating environmental flow requirements on a large scale which uses simple algorithm and takes into account intra annual variability it improves environmental flow calculations due to increased time resolution from an annual to monthly basis and has been widely used jagermeyr et al 2017 pastor et al 2019 the vmf method allocates 60 of water resources to efr during low flow months monthly streamflow 0 4 times the long term average 45 of water resources to efr during medium flow months monthly flow 0 4 0 8 times the long term average and 30 of water resources to efr during high flow months monthly flow 0 8 times the long term average the estimated efr shows high value in the river channels especially in the lower reach of the yangtze river basin fig s2 in this study we first estimated monthly awsi and then obtained annual awsi by averaging the monthly awsi within each year for every province average awsi for grid cells in that province was treated as the provincial awsi 2 2 defining precipitation conditions we applied the standardized anomaly method to define the extent to which annual precipitation departs from its average condition which has been previously used to define dry and wet years jones and hulme 1996 li et al 2019 standardized anomaly sa can be regarded as the change of climate condition precipitation in this study for a given year t prt from its multi year average condition pr normalized by the standard deviation σ 3 s a t pr t pr σ where sat is the standardized anomaly of precipitation in year t we calculated the sa values of annual precipitation from 1971 to 2010 for each province then annual precipitation was divided into different categories based on the sa values at an interval of 0 5 i e 2σ 2σ 1 5σ 1 5σ 1 0σ 1 0σ 0 5σ 0 5σ 0 0 0 5σ 0 5σ 1 0σ 1 0σ 1 5σ 1 5σ 2σ 2σ 2 5σ 2 5σ according to li et al 2019 dry wet years were defined as years with sa lower than 1σ larger than 1σ we considered extremely dry years with sa lower than 2σ similarly moderately dry moderately wet years were defined as years with sa between 1σ and 0 between 0 and 1σ precipitation standardized anomaly which approximates to 0 is considered to be more akin to normal or average condition after this step we could identify the province specific dry and wet conditions based on the local climate condition of each province 2 3 impacts of different precipitation conditions on agricultural water scarcity index the impacts of precipitation variations on awsi with a specific province was quantified via comparing the average awsi falling into a specific sa category to the average awsi over the long term period e g 1971 2010 for the historical period and 2031 2070 for the future period 4 δ a w s i p i awsi p i awsi p m awsi p m 100 where δ a w s i p i is the relative change of awsi over years with sa falling in the i sa category to multi year average awsi in province p awsi p i is the average awsi over years with sa in the i category awsi p m is the average awsi over the multi year this relative change reflects the changes of awsi from its long term trend because of precipitation variation after obtaining the relative change in awsi and the corresponding precipitation anomalies of each year in each province the national average effects of precipitation variations on aswi can be derived by integrating all province year combinations with an area weight aggregation method li et al 2019 in addition we further quantified the changes of awsi over the dry moderately dry moderately wet and wet years from the multi year average for each province 2 4 changes in future agricultural water scarcity index and effects of irrigation efficiency future awsi was estimated by using eq 1 but with water availability and water demand data simulated by future climate data over the period 2031 2070 similar to historical period we estimated the sa values according to future precipitation and divided the sa into different categories we computed multi year average awsi over all future years 2031 2070 awsifut m and future dry years awsifut d for all provinces the relative changes of awsifut m and awsifut d to multi year average awsi over all historical years 1971 2010 awsihist m and historical dry years awsihist d were quantified to indicate the impacts of future climate change on awsi 5 ecc m m awsi fut m awsi hist m awsi hist m 100 6 ecc d m awsi fut d awsi hist m awsi hist m 100 7 ecc d d awsi fut d awsi hist d awsi hist d 100 where ecc m m is the effect of climate change on awsi over all future years to all historical years ecc d m the effect of climate change over the future dry years to all historical years ecc d d the effect of climate change over the future dry years to historical dry years awsi hist m and awsi fut m are the average awsi for all historical and future years awsi hist d and awsi fut d are the average awsi for the historical and future dry years to isolate the effects of pure future climate change on awsi we used the historical ie around the year 2010 which is the earliest available province specific ie data to estimate historical and future awsi besides we also determined the possible mitigation on awsi by increasing ie in 2010 to two proposed ie scenarios in 2030 we kept the future irrigation areas consistent with the historical period given large uncertainties in projecting future irrigation areas 2 5 data source this study was conducted for the mainland china at grid cell a spatial resolution of 0 5 arc degree and province levels for the historical 1971 2010 and future 2031 2070 periods historical and future monthly pet water withdrawals evaporated water from soil water or rainwater were simulated by the pcr globwb model pcr globwb is a grid based large scale hydrology and water resources model wada et al 2014 pcr globwb was developed to estimate global daily surface water balance at a spatial resolution of 0 5 arc degree and to represent different water withdrawals for meeting diverse water demands it can estimate water withdrawals for irrigation industry domestic and livestock which are influenced by irrigation area crop water demand population gross domestic product gdp per capita and livestock density more details of the model could be found in wada et al 2014 this model has been widely used globally sutanudjaja et al 2018 wanders and wada 2015 these data were provided by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip phase 2a historical period and 2b future period over the historical period three different climate datasets were used to force the pcr globwb model namely gswp3 dirmeyer et al 2006 watch wfdei weedon et al 2014 weedon et al 2011 and princeton sheffield et al 2006 following the isimip 2a protocol for the future simulations four general circulation models gcms i e gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 were used to drive the pcr globwb model following the isimip2b protocol two rcps i e rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 were considered for future projections isimip2b was particularly designed for a 1 5 degree warming scenario therefore simulations under scenario rcp8 5 were not provided we used the average of different variables simulated by different climate forcing data for both historical and future periods to reduce uncertainties associated with climate inputs in this study we adopted the simulations of monthly streamflow the variable dis in the isimip protocol to estimate blue water availability the variable arainfusegreen for rainfed cropland and airrusegreen for irrigated cropland from the isimip archive were used to compute agricultural green water availability liu et al 2022b the etc data were estimated by the method of liu et al 2022a for 19 crops including barley cassava citrus cotton grapes groundnut maize millet potato pulses rapeseed rice rye sorghum soybean sugar beet sugar cane sunflower and wheat the mirca2000 dataset portmann et al 2010 was used to locate the irrigated and rainfed croplands as well as the growing period for each crop other information for estimating etc e g crop growth stage and crop specific coefficient for scaling pet to etc were obtained from allen et al 1998 the historical simulations by the pcr globwb model considered a continuous change in human activities while the socioeconomic conditions e g population gross domestic production and land use were fixed at the year 2005 for the future period which was designed by the isimip2b protocol to keep the historical and future awsi comparable i e both under the socioeconomic condition of 2005 we de trended the historical awsi by removing the multi year linear trend and scaled it to the year 2005 the ie data in the year 2010 obtained from the bulletin of water resources in china at the provincial level cpgprc 2012 was used for estimation of historical awsi we used the ie data in 2010 to estimate future awsi for the purposes of isolating the pure effects of climate change on awsi in addition projected ie in 2030 was used to reveal the impacts of improving ie on mitigating awsi table s1 the chinese government reported that national average ie in 2025 and 2030 would reach to 0 58 and 0 60 respectively and provided province specific ie in 2025 mwrc and ndrcc 2022 we multiplied provincial ie in 2025 by the ratio of average ie in 2030 to average ie in 2025 0 60 0 58 to obtain the province specific ie in 2030 besides we also used a high national average ie 0 70 in 2030 to estimate future awsi for the period 2031 2070 3 results 3 1 water scarcity assessment during the historical period the average awsi of per grid cell over the period 1971 2010 varies largely throughout the mainland china fig 1 a regions with high awsi values awsi 1 are mainly distributed in the northwestern northern and central eastern parts of china particularly in the north china plain on the other hand awsi is generally low in the southern china at the provincial level the estimated average awsi also changes substantially between the southern and northern provinces over the historical period fig 1b severe agricultural water scarcity is found in shandong tianjin hebei jiangsu henan and liaoning provinces average awsi in the southern china is generally lower than 0 5 with awsi of being lower than 0 2 in the southwestern part of china 3 2 impacts of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity index fig s3a shows that coefficient of variation cv the ratio of standard deviation to mean of precipitation is relatively large in northern china provinces especially in xinjiang beijing and tianjin provinces meanwhile there are strong negative correlations between annual precipitation and awsi over the period 1971 2010 fig s3b unlike the cv the correlations are more significant among the southern provinces to explore the possible impacts of precipitation variations on awsi we plotted the awsi precipitation interaction in a water scarce northern province fig 2 a shandong province and a water abundant southern province fig 2b guangdong province the variations of annual precipitation in shandong and guangdong are relatively large with σ being 131 mm and 252 mm respectively for all dry years with precipitation anomaly lower than 1σ over the 1971 2010 period the awsi values are highest and above the multi year average for both shandong and guangdong provinces with respect to wet years with precipitation anomaly higher than 1σ the awsi values are the lowest for each province awsi during the historical dry years experienced considerable positive changes from the multi year average particularly in xinjiang shanxi beijing and zhejiang provinces with the changes over than 30 fig 3 on the other hand during the wet years awsi presents substantially negative changes from the multi year average these positive and negative departures show large spatial variability over china generally the northern provinces and eastern provinces show larger changes compared to the southern and western provinces which is consistent with spatial distribution of the cv of precipitation over the historical period fig s3a we further found that the anomalies of awsi during dry or wet years present statistically significant p 0 05 relationship with cv of precipitation fig s4 anomalies of awsi tend to be large when cv of precipitation is high we aggregated percentage changes of awsi from province year samples on the national scale to show water scarcity response to precipitation anomalies during the historical period in china fig 4 exhibits the ratios of province year combinations in each precipitation anomaly ranging from dry to wet conditions and the changes of awsi from provinces multi year awsi average it is clear that moderately dry precipitation anomalies have significantly p 0 05 increased awsi especially for the province year combinations with precipitation anomaly lower than 2 0σ average awsi in this category is 31 higher than the multi year mean although the sample ratio is only about 2 on the other hand awsi in moderately wet years is lower than the multi year average with 29 decrease for the precipitation anomaly higher than 2 5σ generally awsi during dry years could be 21 higher than the multi year average fig s5 3 3 changes in agricultural water scarcity index under future climate change awsi under future climate would have substantial changes compared to the historical awsi figs s6 s7 future precipitation variations will also induce strong influences on awsi figs s8 s9 therefore future climate change could have big effects on awsi in terms of the relative changes of awsi during all future years and future dry years to those during all historical years and historical dry years fig 5 the eccm m shows positive values in 19 provinces under the rcp2 6 scenario and 20 provinces under the rcp6 0 scenario fig 5a and b indicating increases in future averaged awsi the inner mongolia province has the largest increases in awsi over 200 on the other hand future awsi would have a decreasing trend over the provinces with high historical awsi e g tianjin hebei henan and liaoning provinces interestingly we found that future climate change would have more pronounced effects on changes of agricultural water scarcity compared to the effect of historical precipitation variations figs 3 and 5 the awsi of future dry years has more dramatic increases relative to the awsi of all historical years fig 5c and d with 24 and 26 provinces showing increasing awsi under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios in addition we found that the eccd m are even higher than 100 in 8 and 7 provinces under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios respectively it means that awsi over future dry years would more than double the current average awsi in those provinces by comparing awsi of dry years between future and historical periods there are more provinces presenting positive eccd d values than provinces with negative eccd d values fig 5e and f it implies that future dry conditions would have more pronounced impacts on awsi than historical dry conditions over the provinces with positive eccd d values especially in the southwest part of china however the eccd d values are in quantity lower than eccd m 3 4 impacts of irrigation efficiency on agricultural water scarcity improving ie irrigation efficiency has potential to decrease the negative impacts of future dry precipitation condition on awsi fig 6 for example estimated awsi during future dry years in jiangsu province using ie in 2010 has the highest value among the 31 provinces in china this high awsi could decrease by 11 and 20 if china s national average ie could increase to 0 6 and 0 7 generally improving ie has stronger effects on declining awsi in the provinces with lower awsi for example awsi in future dry years could decrease by 10 and 18 with national ie changing to 0 6 and 0 7 for the provinces with awsi by using ie in 2010 lower than 1 while these decreases are only 7 and 13 for the province with awsi by using ie in 2010 higher than 1 under the rcp2 6 scenario tibet has the highest decrease in awsi about 20 30 by improving ie these effects also hold for average awsi over all future years fig s10 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity precipitation variations could have direct impacts on the availability of streamflow in the river systems blue water and soil moisture green water for crop production resulting in changes in agricultural water scarcity although it was well recognized that precipitation variations could have impacts on water scarcity coffel et al 2019 there is no a quantitative study to determine the changes of water scarcity from multi year average along different precipitation anomalies for both historical and future climate in this study we applied the integrated water scarcity index combining blue water and green water to estimate awsi in china and for this first time to our knowledge explicitly revealed the percentage changes of awsi relative to multi year average under different precipitation anomalies our study demonstrates that precipitation variations under both current and future climate conditions have substantial impacts on the awsi during the historical dry years precipitation anomaly lower than 1σ awsi is at least 20 higher than the multi year average fig 4 and fig s5 especially under historical extreme dry condition precipitation anomaly lower than 2σ awsi could be 30 higher than the average indicating strong negative impacts of precipitation variations on awsi future climate change would further amplify these impacts with possible changes over than 200 in inner mongolia and qinghai provinces fig 5 awsi exhibits distinct spatial patterns in responses to precipitation variations which is mainly regulated by the cv of precipitation and the correlation between precipitation and awsi figs s3 and s4 therefore particular attentions should be paid to the provinces with strong negative correlation and high precipitation variations during the dry years for example the provinces of xinjiang shanxi and beijing where awsi during dry years were 30 higher than multi year averages over the historical period fig 3 this study provides useful knowledge to tackling future water scarcity by explicitly identifying these regions 4 2 measurements to tackle the impacts of precipitation variations future climate change would worsen agricultural water scarcity in many provinces of china for example inner mongolia and several southwest provinces moreover variations of future precipitation towards dry condition further exacerbate the already water scarcity condition there fig 5 in such cases different technologies and political measurements should be taken into consideration to alleviate the water scarcity issues our study shows that improving ie is a useful approach fig 6 however the effects of improving ie on decreasing awsi is constrained in the regions with already high awsi this is mainly because ie is used to scale the blue water availability according to the awsi estimation method with little blue water availability improving ie can only have minor effects on awsi alleviation also attentions should be paid to the unintended increases in overall water uses when attempts to increase ie given the paradox of ie grafton et al 2018 redistribution of water resources between different seasons and different years would partially offset the effects of hydrological variations but requiring smart water management technologies e g reliable precipitation forecast and rainwater harvest in addition to the strategies to increasing or stabilizing water resources measurements to reducing crop water demand e g sustainable intensification liu et al 2018 reducing food losses and wastes xue et al 2021 optimization of crop cultivation areas davis et al 2017 would also have high potentials to alleviate agricultural water scarcity 4 3 future research dimension of integrated water scarcity and the climate change impacts we applied the integrated awsi which incorporates blue water and green water in the estimation to detect the impacts of precipitation variations under current and future climate conditions on water scarcity this integrated index is also with limitation for example it cannot detect water scarcity associated with water uses for other sectors than agriculture also water quality and other resources e g recycled water and desalinated water and groundwater should also be included in a more comprehensive water scarcity index considering water quality and other water resources could also have effects on water scarcity van vliet et al 2021 and future climate would significantly affect water quality and water resources liu et al 2020 however proposing such a comprehensive water scarcity index is out of the scope of this study but deserves attention in the future research in addition to providing a more general and comprehensive water scarcity indicator several other directions regarding the analyses of water scarcity index should be highlighted the awsi accounting covers a few key processes of crop growth human activities and hydrological cycles it therefore is subjected to uncertainties from different resources e g from crop water use estimates liu et al 2016 to water resource calculation greve et al 2018 it could be found that the pcr glbowb simulated hydrological variables by using different climate forcing datasets could induce different estimations of awsi while the estimated awsi using gswp3 tends to be closer to the average value fig s11 therefore we used the average of hydrological simulations driven by multi climate datasets of historical and future periods to reduce possible uncertainties more aspects of uncertainties should be included in future research e g from the choice of potential evapotranspiration estimation method global hydrological models and land use scenarios besides we demonstrate significant impacts of precipitation variations on awsi and the impacts are associated with cv of precipitation and correlation between precipitation and awsi in china however our analyses were conducted at the provincial level mainly due to coarse resolution of simulated water resources data from isimip however the large size of province ignores the spatial variability of green water blue water as well as crop water demand within a province which could dim the significance of the results future studies could apply the similar approach to finer spatial scales e g local river basin level which will facilitate the detection of precipitation variations and correlation between precipitation and water scarcity hence the impacts of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity 5 conclusions in this research we evaluated an integrated agricultural water scarcity index i e awsi which incorporates green water and blue water and linked the changes of awsi to precipitation variations in china for the historical 1971 2010 and future 2031 2070 periods we explicitly quantified the changes of awsi from the long term averages annual precipitation shows high temporal variations while awsi and precipitation presents strong negative correlations awsi during extremely dry years precipitation anomaly lower than 2σ and dry years precipitation anomaly lower than 1σ can be 31 and 21 higher than the multi year average respectively future climate change would further intensify agricultural water scarcity in many provinces especially during future dry years with 24 and 26 provinces showing increasing awsi under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 qinghai and inner mongolia provinces would have particularly high increases in awsi under future dry condition improving irrigation efficiency has potential to alleviate agricultural water scarcity but with lower effects in the already water scarce regions the high positive changes of agricultural water scarcity from multi year average under both historical and future periods call for special attentions to deal with the impacts of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity future studies should propose more comprehensive water scarcity index and investigate the precipitation variation

2381,both blue water and green water contribute to agricultural water scarcity which is subjected to impacts of precipitation variations in the context of climate change however an explicit quantification of the possible effects of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity index awsi under historical and future climate is absent in this study we applied an integrated awsi which incorporates blue water and green water to estimate agricultural water scarcity in china and to determine the association of awsi with precipitation variations over the historical 1971 2010 and future 2031 2070 periods precipitation variations have substantial effects on changes in awsi especially during extremely dry years with precipitation anomaly lower than 2 standard deviation changes of awsi from the multi year average could be as high as 31 future climate change would further intensify awsi and amplify the effects of precipitation variations particularly in inner mongolia with changes of awsi over 200 southwestern china could also experience expanding agricultural water scarcity under future climate scenarios improving irrigation efficiency has potential to alleviate water scarcity by up to 30 this study provides valuable information for scientists and policy decision makers to cope with the impacts of precipitation variations on awsi keywords blue water green water

to climatic change in many places there have been some efforts to incorporate blue and green water scarcity in an integrated water scarcity assessment liu et al 2022a developed a comprehensive agricultural water scarcity index awsi that incorporates both green and blue water availability and consumption and compared it with conventional water scarcity index focusing only on blue water over the period 1971 2010 on a global scale after that liu et al 2022b applied this index to assess the possible impacts of future climate change on awsi however liu et al 2022b only explored the average changes of agricultural water scarcity during the period 2026 2050 the major limitation of these integrated studies is that the impacts of precipitation variations on awsi were overlooked for both historical and future climate conditions renewable water resources will be influenced by expected changes in climate especially changes in precipitation therefore leading to variations in water scarcity moursi et al 2017 recently several studies have investigated the effects of precipitation changes on water scarcity on different spatiotemporal scales gampe et al 2016 gao et al 2021 for example coffel et al 2019 found that future hot and dry climate could worsen blue water scarcity in the nile river basin despite projected increases in future precipitation quinteiro et al 2019 assessed how climate in future could affect future green water poverty under a reference period 1986 2005 and a future period 2046 2065 climate in portugal kummu et al 2014 quantified the effects of hydroclimatic change on global blue and green water resources availability and requirements based on historical climate forcing datasets during the historical period 1977 2006 besides they also determined the frequency of water scarcity by quantifying the number of years falling in the water scarcity although it is already known that precipitation has direct impact on water scarcity the level to which precipitation variations would affect the integrated water scarcity incorporating blue and green water is still unclear especially during extremely wet and dry years under both historical and future climate conditions this absent information impairs the formulation of robust policy decision for coping with climate change effects on awsi to address the above research gaps this study applied an integrated awsi via combining green water and blue water availability and use as well as environmental flow requirements efr liu et al 2022a to assess historical and future changes in awsi and the linkages to changes in precipitation the mainland china was taken as the study area given that china is facing and will still experience severe water scarcity under the current and future climate conditions cao et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ren et al 2021 zhao et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 the long term changes in awsi in china was verified for the historical 1971 2010 and future 2031 2070 periods at the grid 0 5 arc degree and province levels locations of each province and separation of northern and southern provinces are provided in fig s1 agricultural blue and green water availability and use were simulated by a large scale hydrological model namely pcr globwb wada et al 2014 we considered two future representative concentration pathway rcp climate scenarios i e low emission scenario rcp2 6 and no mitigation scenario rcp6 0 this study explicitly and quantitatively determined the possible impacts of precipitation variations on awsi under the historical and future periods which provides useful information for policy decision makers to formulate robust measures to tackle the water scarcity issues 2 methods and data 2 1 agricultural water scarcity index the agricultural water scarcity index awsi was calculated as a ratio of crop water demand without water limitation to total water availability considering green water blue water and efr liu et al 2022a this index measures the degree to which total water availability including blue and green water could meet crop water demand when awsi 1 it indicates that the total water availability is not enough to meet the crop water demand otherwise there is no agricultural water scarcity it could be estimated as 1 awsi i 1 n etc i wa g wa b 2 wa b q ww os e f r i e where etci is the unstressed water demand for crop i m3 mon 1 which was calculated by the product of potential evapotranspiration pet and crop specific coefficients allen et al 1998 n is the number of crops considered which equals to 19 in this study wag is agricultural green water availability m3 mon 1 which includes water evaporated from soil moisture or rainwater from rainfed and irrigated cropland wab is agricultural blue water availability m3 mon 1 ie is irrigation efficiency dimensionless q is total blue water resources estimated as streamflow m3 mon 1 wwos is water withdrawal for other sectors except irrigation including domestic industrial and livestock m3 mon 1 efr is environmental flow requirements m3 mon 1 which is estimated by the variable monthly flow vmf method pastor et al 2014 the vmf method is a valid hydrological method for estimating environmental flow requirements on a large scale which uses simple algorithm and takes into account intra annual variability it improves environmental flow calculations due to increased time resolution from an annual to monthly basis and has been widely used jagermeyr et al 2017 pastor et al 2019 the vmf method allocates 60 of water resources to efr during low flow months monthly streamflow 0 4 times the long term average 45 of water resources to efr during medium flow months monthly flow 0 4 0 8 times the long term average and 30 of water resources to efr during high flow months monthly flow 0 8 times the long term average the estimated efr shows high value in the river channels especially in the lower reach of the yangtze river basin fig s2 in this study we first estimated monthly awsi and then obtained annual awsi by averaging the monthly awsi within each year for every province average awsi for grid cells in that province was treated as the provincial awsi 2 2 defining precipitation conditions we applied the standardized anomaly method to define the extent to which annual precipitation departs from its average condition which has been previously used to define dry and wet years jones and hulme 1996 li et al 2019 standardized anomaly sa can be regarded as the change of climate condition precipitation in this study for a given year t prt from its multi year average condition pr normalized by the standard deviation σ 3 s a t pr t pr σ where sat is the standardized anomaly of precipitation in year t we calculated the sa values of annual precipitation from 1971 to 2010 for each province then annual precipitation was divided into different categories based on the sa values at an interval of 0 5 i e 2σ 2σ 1 5σ 1 5σ 1 0σ 1 0σ 0 5σ 0 5σ 0 0 0 5σ 0 5σ 1 0σ 1 0σ 1 5σ 1 5σ 2σ 2σ 2 5σ 2 5σ according to li et al 2019 dry wet years were defined as years with sa lower than 1σ larger than 1σ we considered extremely dry years with sa lower than 2σ similarly moderately dry moderately wet years were defined as years with sa between 1σ and 0 between 0 and 1σ precipitation standardized anomaly which approximates to 0 is considered to be more akin to normal or average condition after this step we could identify the province specific dry and wet conditions based on the local climate condition of each province 2 3 impacts of different precipitation conditions on agricultural water scarcity index the impacts of precipitation variations on awsi with a specific province was quantified via comparing the average awsi falling into a specific sa category to the average awsi over the long term period e g 1971 2010 for the historical period and 2031 2070 for the future period 4 δ a w s i p i awsi p i awsi p m awsi p m 100 where δ a w s i p i is the relative change of awsi over years with sa falling in the i sa category to multi year average awsi in province p awsi p i is the average awsi over years with sa in the i category awsi p m is the average awsi over the multi year this relative change reflects the changes of awsi from its long term trend because of precipitation variation after obtaining the relative change in awsi and the corresponding precipitation anomalies of each year in each province the national average effects of precipitation variations on aswi can be derived by integrating all province year combinations with an area weight aggregation method li et al 2019 in addition we further quantified the changes of awsi over the dry moderately dry moderately wet and wet years from the multi year average for each province 2 4 changes in future agricultural water scarcity index and effects of irrigation efficiency future awsi was estimated by using eq 1 but with water availability and water demand data simulated by future climate data over the period 2031 2070 similar to historical period we estimated the sa values according to future precipitation and divided the sa into different categories we computed multi year average awsi over all future years 2031 2070 awsifut m and future dry years awsifut d for all provinces the relative changes of awsifut m and awsifut d to multi year average awsi over all historical years 1971 2010 awsihist m and historical dry years awsihist d were quantified to indicate the impacts of future climate change on awsi 5 ecc m m awsi fut m awsi hist m awsi hist m 100 6 ecc d m awsi fut d awsi hist m awsi hist m 100 7 ecc d d awsi fut d awsi hist d awsi hist d 100 where ecc m m is the effect of climate change on awsi over all future years to all historical years ecc d m the effect of climate change over the future dry years to all historical years ecc d d the effect of climate change over the future dry years to historical dry years awsi hist m and awsi fut m are the average awsi for all historical and future years awsi hist d and awsi fut d are the average awsi for the historical and future dry years to isolate the effects of pure future climate change on awsi we used the historical ie around the year 2010 which is the earliest available province specific ie data to estimate historical and future awsi besides we also determined the possible mitigation on awsi by increasing ie in 2010 to two proposed ie scenarios in 2030 we kept the future irrigation areas consistent with the historical period given large uncertainties in projecting future irrigation areas 2 5 data source this study was conducted for the mainland china at grid cell a spatial resolution of 0 5 arc degree and province levels for the historical 1971 2010 and future 2031 2070 periods historical and future monthly pet water withdrawals evaporated water from soil water or rainwater were simulated by the pcr globwb model pcr globwb is a grid based large scale hydrology and water resources model wada et al 2014 pcr globwb was developed to estimate global daily surface water balance at a spatial resolution of 0 5 arc degree and to represent different water withdrawals for meeting diverse water demands it can estimate water withdrawals for irrigation industry domestic and livestock which are influenced by irrigation area crop water demand population gross domestic product gdp per capita and livestock density more details of the model could be found in wada et al 2014 this model has been widely used globally sutanudjaja et al 2018 wanders and wada 2015 these data were provided by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip phase 2a historical period and 2b future period over the historical period three different climate datasets were used to force the pcr globwb model namely gswp3 dirmeyer et al 2006 watch wfdei weedon et al 2014 weedon et al 2011 and princeton sheffield et al 2006 following the isimip 2a protocol for the future simulations four general circulation models gcms i e gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 were used to drive the pcr globwb model following the isimip2b protocol two rcps i e rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 were considered for future projections isimip2b was particularly designed for a 1 5 degree warming scenario therefore simulations under scenario rcp8 5 were not provided we used the average of different variables simulated by different climate forcing data for both historical and future periods to reduce uncertainties associated with climate inputs in this study we adopted the simulations of monthly streamflow the variable dis in the isimip protocol to estimate blue water availability the variable arainfusegreen for rainfed cropland and airrusegreen for irrigated cropland from the isimip archive were used to compute agricultural green water availability liu et al 2022b the etc data were estimated by the method of liu et al 2022a for 19 crops including barley cassava citrus cotton grapes groundnut maize millet potato pulses rapeseed rice rye sorghum soybean sugar beet sugar cane sunflower and wheat the mirca2000 dataset portmann et al 2010 was used to locate the irrigated and rainfed croplands as well as the growing period for each crop other information for estimating etc e g crop growth stage and crop specific coefficient for scaling pet to etc were obtained from allen et al 1998 the historical simulations by the pcr globwb model considered a continuous change in human activities while the socioeconomic conditions e g population gross domestic production and land use were fixed at the year 2005 for the future period which was designed by the isimip2b protocol to keep the historical and future awsi comparable i e both under the socioeconomic condition of 2005 we de trended the historical awsi by removing the multi year linear trend and scaled it to the year 2005 the ie data in the year 2010 obtained from the bulletin of water resources in china at the provincial level cpgprc 2012 was used for estimation of historical awsi we used the ie data in 2010 to estimate future awsi for the purposes of isolating the pure effects of climate change on awsi in addition projected ie in 2030 was used to reveal the impacts of improving ie on mitigating awsi table s1 the chinese government reported that national average ie in 2025 and 2030 would reach to 0 58 and 0 60 respectively and provided province specific ie in 2025 mwrc and ndrcc 2022 we multiplied provincial ie in 2025 by the ratio of average ie in 2030 to average ie in 2025 0 60 0 58 to obtain the province specific ie in 2030 besides we also used a high national average ie 0 70 in 2030 to estimate future awsi for the period 2031 2070 3 results 3 1 water scarcity assessment during the historical period the average awsi of per grid cell over the period 1971 2010 varies largely throughout the mainland china fig 1 a regions with high awsi values awsi 1 are mainly distributed in the northwestern northern and central eastern parts of china particularly in the north china plain on the other hand awsi is generally low in the southern china at the provincial level the estimated average awsi also changes substantially between the southern and northern provinces over the historical period fig 1b severe agricultural water scarcity is found in shandong tianjin hebei jiangsu henan and liaoning provinces average awsi in the southern china is generally lower than 0 5 with awsi of being lower than 0 2 in the southwestern part of china 3 2 impacts of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity index fig s3a shows that coefficient of variation cv the ratio of standard deviation to mean of precipitation is relatively large in northern china provinces especially in xinjiang beijing and tianjin provinces meanwhile there are strong negative correlations between annual precipitation and awsi over the period 1971 2010 fig s3b unlike the cv the correlations are more significant among the southern provinces to explore the possible impacts of precipitation variations on awsi we plotted the awsi precipitation interaction in a water scarce northern province fig 2 a shandong province and a water abundant southern province fig 2b guangdong province the variations of annual precipitation in shandong and guangdong are relatively large with σ being 131 mm and 252 mm respectively for all dry years with precipitation anomaly lower than 1σ over the 1971 2010 period the awsi values are highest and above the multi year average for both shandong and guangdong provinces with respect to wet years with precipitation anomaly higher than 1σ the awsi values are the lowest for each province awsi during the historical dry years experienced considerable positive changes from the multi year average particularly in xinjiang shanxi beijing and zhejiang provinces with the changes over than 30 fig 3 on the other hand during the wet years awsi presents substantially negative changes from the multi year average these positive and negative departures show large spatial variability over china generally the northern provinces and eastern provinces show larger changes compared to the southern and western provinces which is consistent with spatial distribution of the cv of precipitation over the historical period fig s3a we further found that the anomalies of awsi during dry or wet years present statistically significant p 0 05 relationship with cv of precipitation fig s4 anomalies of awsi tend to be large when cv of precipitation is high we aggregated percentage changes of awsi from province year samples on the national scale to show water scarcity response to precipitation anomalies during the historical period in china fig 4 exhibits the ratios of province year combinations in each precipitation anomaly ranging from dry to wet conditions and the changes of awsi from provinces multi year awsi average it is clear that moderately dry precipitation anomalies have significantly p 0 05 increased awsi especially for the province year combinations with precipitation anomaly lower than 2 0σ average awsi in this category is 31 higher than the multi year mean although the sample ratio is only about 2 on the other hand awsi in moderately wet years is lower than the multi year average with 29 decrease for the precipitation anomaly higher than 2 5σ generally awsi during dry years could be 21 higher than the multi year average fig s5 3 3 changes in agricultural water scarcity index under future climate change awsi under future climate would have substantial changes compared to the historical awsi figs s6 s7 future precipitation variations will also induce strong influences on awsi figs s8 s9 therefore future climate change could have big effects on awsi in terms of the relative changes of awsi during all future years and future dry years to those during all historical years and historical dry years fig 5 the eccm m shows positive values in 19 provinces under the rcp2 6 scenario and 20 provinces under the rcp6 0 scenario fig 5a and b indicating increases in future averaged awsi the inner mongolia province has the largest increases in awsi over 200 on the other hand future awsi would have a decreasing trend over the provinces with high historical awsi e g tianjin hebei henan and liaoning provinces interestingly we found that future climate change would have more pronounced effects on changes of agricultural water scarcity compared to the effect of historical precipitation variations figs 3 and 5 the awsi of future dry years has more dramatic increases relative to the awsi of all historical years fig 5c and d with 24 and 26 provinces showing increasing awsi under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios in addition we found that the eccd m are even higher than 100 in 8 and 7 provinces under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios respectively it means that awsi over future dry years would more than double the current average awsi in those provinces by comparing awsi of dry years between future and historical periods there are more provinces presenting positive eccd d values than provinces with negative eccd d values fig 5e and f it implies that future dry conditions would have more pronounced impacts on awsi than historical dry conditions over the provinces with positive eccd d values especially in the southwest part of china however the eccd d values are in quantity lower than eccd m 3 4 impacts of irrigation efficiency on agricultural water scarcity improving ie irrigation efficiency has potential to decrease the negative impacts of future dry precipitation condition on awsi fig 6 for example estimated awsi during future dry years in jiangsu province using ie in 2010 has the highest value among the 31 provinces in china this high awsi could decrease by 11 and 20 if china s national average ie could increase to 0 6 and 0 7 generally improving ie has stronger effects on declining awsi in the provinces with lower awsi for example awsi in future dry years could decrease by 10 and 18 with national ie changing to 0 6 and 0 7 for the provinces with awsi by using ie in 2010 lower than 1 while these decreases are only 7 and 13 for the province with awsi by using ie in 2010 higher than 1 under the rcp2 6 scenario tibet has the highest decrease in awsi about 20 30 by improving ie these effects also hold for average awsi over all future years fig s10 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity precipitation variations could have direct impacts on the availability of streamflow in the river systems blue water and soil moisture green water for crop production resulting in changes in agricultural water scarcity although it was well recognized that precipitation variations could have impacts on water scarcity coffel et al 2019 there is no a quantitative study to determine the changes of water scarcity from multi year average along different precipitation anomalies for both historical and future climate in this study we applied the integrated water scarcity index combining blue water and green water to estimate awsi in china and for this first time to our knowledge explicitly revealed the percentage changes of awsi relative to multi year average under different precipitation anomalies our study demonstrates that precipitation variations under both current and future climate conditions have substantial impacts on the awsi during the historical dry years precipitation anomaly lower than 1σ awsi is at least 20 higher than the multi year average fig 4 and fig s5 especially under historical extreme dry condition precipitation anomaly lower than 2σ awsi could be 30 higher than the average indicating strong negative impacts of precipitation variations on awsi future climate change would further amplify these impacts with possible changes over than 200 in inner mongolia and qinghai provinces fig 5 awsi exhibits distinct spatial patterns in responses to precipitation variations which is mainly regulated by the cv of precipitation and the correlation between precipitation and awsi figs s3 and s4 therefore particular attentions should be paid to the provinces with strong negative correlation and high precipitation variations during the dry years for example the provinces of xinjiang shanxi and beijing where awsi during dry years were 30 higher than multi year averages over the historical period fig 3 this study provides useful knowledge to tackling future water scarcity by explicitly identifying these regions 4 2 measurements to tackle the impacts of precipitation variations future climate change would worsen agricultural water scarcity in many provinces of china for example inner mongolia and several southwest provinces moreover variations of future precipitation towards dry condition further exacerbate the already water scarcity condition there fig 5 in such cases different technologies and political measurements should be taken into consideration to alleviate the water scarcity issues our study shows that improving ie is a useful approach fig 6 however the effects of improving ie on decreasing awsi is constrained in the regions with already high awsi this is mainly because ie is used to scale the blue water availability according to the awsi estimation method with little blue water availability improving ie can only have minor effects on awsi alleviation also attentions should be paid to the unintended increases in overall water uses when attempts to increase ie given the paradox of ie grafton et al 2018 redistribution of water resources between different seasons and different years would partially offset the effects of hydrological variations but requiring smart water management technologies e g reliable precipitation forecast and rainwater harvest in addition to the strategies to increasing or stabilizing water resources measurements to reducing crop water demand e g sustainable intensification liu et al 2018 reducing food losses and wastes xue et al 2021 optimization of crop cultivation areas davis et al 2017 would also have high potentials to alleviate agricultural water scarcity 4 3 future research dimension of integrated water scarcity and the climate change impacts we applied the integrated awsi which incorporates blue water and green water in the estimation to detect the impacts of precipitation variations under current and future climate conditions on water scarcity this integrated index is also with limitation for example it cannot detect water scarcity associated with water uses for other sectors than agriculture also water quality and other resources e g recycled water and desalinated water and groundwater should also be included in a more comprehensive water scarcity index considering water quality and other water resources could also have effects on water scarcity van vliet et al 2021 and future climate would significantly affect water quality and water resources liu et al 2020 however proposing such a comprehensive water scarcity index is out of the scope of this study but deserves attention in the future research in addition to providing a more general and comprehensive water scarcity indicator several other directions regarding the analyses of water scarcity index should be highlighted the awsi accounting covers a few key processes of crop growth human activities and hydrological cycles it therefore is subjected to uncertainties from different resources e g from crop water use estimates liu et al 2016 to water resource calculation greve et al 2018 it could be found that the pcr glbowb simulated hydrological variables by using different climate forcing datasets could induce different estimations of awsi while the estimated awsi using gswp3 tends to be closer to the average value fig s11 therefore we used the average of hydrological simulations driven by multi climate datasets of historical and future periods to reduce possible uncertainties more aspects of uncertainties should be included in future research e g from the choice of potential evapotranspiration estimation method global hydrological models and land use scenarios besides we demonstrate significant impacts of precipitation variations on awsi and the impacts are associated with cv of precipitation and correlation between precipitation and awsi in china however our analyses were conducted at the provincial level mainly due to coarse resolution of simulated water resources data from isimip however the large size of province ignores the spatial variability of green water blue water as well as crop water demand within a province which could dim the significance of the results future studies could apply the similar approach to finer spatial scales e g local river basin level which will facilitate the detection of precipitation variations and correlation between precipitation and water scarcity hence the impacts of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity 5 conclusions in this research we evaluated an integrated agricultural water scarcity index i e awsi which incorporates green water and blue water and linked the changes of awsi to precipitation variations in china for the historical 1971 2010 and future 2031 2070 periods we explicitly quantified the changes of awsi from the long term averages annual precipitation shows high temporal variations while awsi and precipitation presents strong negative correlations awsi during extremely dry years precipitation anomaly lower than 2σ and dry years precipitation anomaly lower than 1σ can be 31 and 21 higher than the multi year average respectively future climate change would further intensify agricultural water scarcity in many provinces especially during future dry years with 24 and 26 provinces showing increasing awsi under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 qinghai and inner mongolia provinces would have particularly high increases in awsi under future dry condition improving irrigation efficiency has potential to alleviate agricultural water scarcity but with lower effects in the already water scarce regions the high positive changes of agricultural water scarcity from multi year average under both historical and future periods call for special attentions to deal with the impacts of precipitation variations on agricultural water scarcity future studies should propose more comprehensive water scarcity index and investigate the precipitation variation

2382,one of the most difficult transitions early career scientists must make is entering into the highly competitive federal funding landscape this commentary briefly reviews the readily available demographics of major united states federal funding agencies that support hydrologic research three suggestions on how to improve your odds of being awarded funding are discussed choosing the right team persistent proposal submissions and starting early in your career keywords funding demographics academia hydrology data availability no data were used for the research described in the article one of the most difficult transitions early career scientists must make is entering into the highly competitive funding landscape as graduate students we are commonly provided with feedback on our research questions experimental designs analysis and manuscript publishing but it is less common for graduate training to include packaging our skills and interests into compelling research proposals proposal writing at the graduate level is frequently limited to short 5 10 pages proposals with the largest awards being funding to support tuition and stipends and more commonly small awards to purchase some supplies or to support travel to a conference during my phd program i aggressively sought funding to support my research goals even to the detriment of finishing my degree in a timely fashion i had great mentors who were always willing to provide feedback on proposals and consequently i enjoyed success in securing funding which in turn helped me get interviews for desirable faculty positions i was feeling well prepared to enter into the competitions for federal funds once starting my faculty position i was not prepared for the large increase in expectations for a federal proposal nor was i prepared for the intense scrutiny that my proposals would receive each time a proposal was declined i would question if i was in the right field here i would like to provide some tips on what i have learned regarding funding as a mid career faculty member and as a former rotator program officer with the national science foundation nsf funding rates and demographics much misinformation is circulated about funding rates and demographics of funding from federal agencies typically via word of mouth or social media rather than data funding is extremely competitive but learning about current funding rates from various federal agencies and programs can help determine where your efforts should be targeted the nsf reports their annual funding rates and demographic data to the national science board a presidentially appointed board that establishes the policies of the nsf and serves as advisors to congress and the president and past years reports can be found on the nsf website https www nsf gov nsb publications pubmeritreview jsp during fiscal year 2020 the funding rate for nsf research proposals was 28 overall and 42 in the directorate for geosciences which houses the division of earth sciences and the hydrologic sciences program national science foundation 2021 principal investigators pis who self identified as female had a better funding rate than the agency average with an overall success rate of 32 additionally pis who self identified as white had a greater success rate 31 while rates for proposals from multi racial hispanic or latinx black african american and asian pis ranged from 25 to 28 national science foundation 2021 chen et al 2022 highlight the longstanding disparity in funding rates at the nsf where white pis have been consistently funded at higher rates than most non white pis from 1996 to 2019 funding demographics for other federal agencies that fund hydrologic science are more difficult to assess based on data available on line the national aeronautics and space administration nasa reported inferred gender demographics for the entire science mission directorate nasa 2018 and found the overall award rate to be 24 1 but for pis who were inferred to identify as female the award rate was 21 6 these rates did not significantly vary among the science divisions after recognizing the gender based disparities in awards for observing time on the hubble space telescope peer review conducted by the space telescope science institute stsci moved to a dual anonymous review system that resulted in pis who identify as female having higher success rate than those identifying as male for the first time since the stsci has kept track strolger and natarajan 2019 nasa s science mission directorate has now moved to dual anonymous review for its research opportunities in space and earth sciences roses programs and there has been a significant increase in the percentage of proposals from female identifying pis ranked in the top three proposals across panels 20 increased to 32 demographics for the department of energy doe office of science awards were not available during a town hall meeting at the american geophysical union 2021 fall meeting the doe office of scientific workforce diversity equity and inclusion detailed the actions doe was taking to improve the tracking of the diversity of applicants awardees and reviewers but it is a work in progress at these early stages u s doe 2021 the reporting of simple averages as i have done here may not be particularly useful but is one attribute of the ever changing funding landscape more and more funding agencies are taking a closer look at their practices and policies that have created or supported biases in awards and are looking to make improvements until practices and policies are effective in dismantling biases what is a researcher to do to stack the odds in their favor towards a funded project here i outline three main tactics to improve your chances for success how to improve your odds under intense competition in a fluid funding landscape 1 first and foremost choose your team wisely i cannot emphasize this point enough academia is filled with real and perceived power structures that leave early career and historically marginalized individuals vulnerable to being taken advantage of while it can be flattering to be invited to be part of a collaborative research proposal one should take the time to get to know the research culture and expectations of the co pis and ultimately ask oneself is it worth it in my personal research journey i have had the most fun and created the products i am most proud of when my collaborators and i have had equal enthusiasm and commitment to a project this should become apparent at the proposal discussion and writing stage are you bouncing ideas off one another and becoming energized about future possibilities or is one pi the driving force pulling others along the way if you are doing the majority of the heavy lifting at the proposal stage you should not anticipate that the dynamic will change once the proposal is funded be honest with your collaborators about expectations for how much you each are willing to support one another in terms of the administrative loads advising students sharing budgets and what warrants co authorship the demands on faculty time are ever increasing and it is a wonderful thing when you have a collaborator who is willing to step up in times of need and who knows you will do the same for them that being said it is also important to not restrict yourself to always working with the same mix of team members multiple studies have shown that science is maximized when multiple perspectives are included and participate in research discussions project design and project implementation rey 2008 nielsen bloch and schiebinger 2018 yang et al 2022 2 don t give up as an early career faculty member it appeared to me that some individuals had the midas touch where every proposal they submitted was funded what i learned from my time as a program officer is that this is definitely not the case those folks who appeared

2382,one of the most difficult transitions early career scientists must make is entering into the highly competitive federal funding landscape this commentary briefly reviews the readily available demographics of major united states federal funding agencies that support hydrologic research three suggestions on how to improve your odds of being awarded funding are discussed choosing the right team persistent proposal submissions and starting early in your career keywords funding demographics academia hydrology data availability no data were used for the research described in the article one of the most difficult transitions early career scientists must make is entering into the highly competitive funding landscape as graduate students we are commonly provided with feedback on our research questions experimental designs analysis and manuscript publishing but it is less common for graduate training to include packaging our skills and interests into compelling research proposals proposal writing at the graduate level is frequently limited to short 5 10 pages proposals with the largest awards being funding to support tuition and stipends and more commonly small awards to purchase some supplies or to support travel to a conference during my phd program i aggressively sought funding to support my research goals even to the detriment of finishing my degree in a timely fashion i had great mentors who were always willing to provide feedback on proposals and consequently i enjoyed success in securing funding which in turn helped me get interviews for desirable faculty positions i was feeling well prepared to enter into the competitions for federal funds once starting my faculty position i was not prepared for the large increase in expectations for a federal proposal nor was i prepared for the intense scrutiny that my proposals would receive each time a proposal was declined i would question if i was in the right field here i would like to provide some tips on what i have learned regarding funding as a mid career faculty member and as a former rotator program officer with the national science foundation nsf funding rates and demographics much misinformation is circulated about funding rates and demographics of funding from federal agencies typically via word of mouth or social media rather than data funding is extremely competitive but learning about current funding rates from various federal agencies and programs can help determine where your efforts should be targeted the nsf reports their annual funding rates and demographic data to the national science board a presidentially appointed board that establishes the policies of the nsf and serves as advisors to congress and the president and past years reports can be found on the nsf website https www nsf gov nsb publications pubmeritreview jsp during fiscal year 2020 the funding rate for nsf research proposals was 28 overall and 42 in the directorate for geosciences which houses the division of earth sciences and the hydrologic sciences program national science foundation 2021 principal investigators pis who self identified as female had a better funding rate than the agency average with an overall success rate of 32 additionally pis who self identified as white had a greater success rate 31 while rates for proposals from multi racial hispanic or latinx black african american and asian pis ranged from 25 to 28 national science foundation 2021 chen et al 2022 highlight the longstanding disparity in funding rates at the nsf where white pis have been consistently funded at higher rates than most non white pis from 1996 to 2019 funding demographics for other federal agencies that fund hydrologic science are more difficult to assess based on data available on line the national aeronautics and space administration nasa reported inferred gender demographics for the entire science mission directorate nasa 2018 and found the overall award rate to be 24 1 but for pis who were inferred to identify as female the award rate was 21 6 these rates did not significantly vary among the science divisions after recognizing the gender based disparities in awards for observing time on the hubble space telescope peer review conducted by the space telescope science institute stsci moved to a dual anonymous review system that resulted in pis who identify as female having higher success rate than those identifying as male for the first time since the stsci has kept track strolger and natarajan 2019 nasa s science mission directorate has now moved to dual anonymous review for its research opportunities in space and earth sciences roses programs and there has been a significant increase in the percentage of proposals from female identifying pis ranked in the top three proposals across panels 20 increased to 32 demographics for the department of energy doe office of science awards were not available during a town hall meeting at the american geophysical union 2021 fall meeting the doe office of scientific workforce diversity equity and inclusion detailed the actions doe was taking to improve the tracking of the diversity of applicants awardees and reviewers but it is a work in progress at these early stages u s doe 2021 the reporting of simple averages as i have done here may not be particularly useful but is one attribute of the ever changing funding landscape more and more funding agencies are taking a closer look at their practices and policies that have created or supported biases in awards and are looking to make improvements until practices and policies are effective in dismantling biases what is a researcher to do to stack the odds in their favor towards a funded project here i outline three main tactics to improve your chances for success how to improve your odds under intense competition in a fluid funding landscape 1 first and foremost choose your team wisely i cannot emphasize this point enough academia is filled with real and perceived power structures that leave early career and historically marginalized individuals vulnerable to being taken advantage of while it can be flattering to be invited to be part of a collaborative research proposal one should take the time to get to know the research culture and expectations of the co pis and ultimately ask oneself is it worth it in my personal research journey i have had the most fun and created the products i am most proud of when my collaborators and i have had equal enthusiasm and commitment to a project this should become apparent at the proposal discussion and writing stage are you bouncing ideas off one another and becoming energized about future possibilities or is one pi the driving force pulling others along the way if you are doing the majority of the heavy lifting at the proposal stage you should not anticipate that the dynamic will change once the proposal is funded be honest with your collaborators about expectations for how much you each are willing to support one another in terms of the administrative loads advising students sharing budgets and what warrants co authorship the demands on faculty time are ever increasing and it is a wonderful thing when you have a collaborator who is willing to step up in times of need and who knows you will do the same for them that being said it is also important to not restrict yourself to always working with the same mix of team members multiple studies have shown that science is maximized when multiple perspectives are included and participate in research discussions project design and project implementation rey 2008 nielsen bloch and schiebinger 2018 yang et al 2022 2 don t give up as an early career faculty member it appeared to me that some individuals had the midas touch where every proposal they submitted was funded what i learned from my time as a program officer is that this is definitely not the case those folks who appeared disproportionately successful also submitted a disproportionately higher number of proposals and their proposals were not always targeted at the same funding institutions or the same programs they

2383,accurate estimates of nutrient loads are necessary to identify critical source areas and quantify the impact of management practices on pollutant export previous studies have investigated nutrient load estimate uncertainty but they often focus on nutrient loads estimated using an interpolation method for large scale watersheds with short term datasets the study objective was to quantify uncertainty in soluble reactive phosphorus srp total phosphorus tp and suspended solids ss load estimates from two small 103 km2 agricultural watersheds in the western lake erie basin resulting from different sampling frequencies each watershed had high temporal resolution datasets of discharge 15 min and nutrient concentration 1 to 3 samples per day collected over a 30 year period 1990 2020 firstly srp tp and ss loads were calculated using the high temporal resolution datasets which was assumed as true loads secondly the high temporal concentration data were decomposed to semiweekly weekly biweekly and monthly sampling and annual loads were estimated using four common load estimation methods to assess the effect of sampling frequency and load estimation method on load estimate error across the four different methods the composite method had the lowest relative root mean square and absolute bias but the rectangular interpolation method was the most precise however even with semiweekly sampling the composite method resulted in an unacceptable level of precision average imprecision 39 while the interpolation method resulted in an unacceptable bias average absolute bias 16 because neither method could provide acceptable accuracy and precision at the lowest decrease in sampling e t semiweekly sampling continued daily sampling is recommended in these

2007 robertson 2003 williams et al 2015 to estimate nutrient loads when concentration observations are infrequent various load estimation methods lems have been developed lems have been categorized into three general classes averaging interpolation approaches regression models and ratio estimators aulenbach et al 2016 lee et al 2016 many of these lems have been made accessible to researchers through open source software packages such as loadflex riverload and egret appling et al 2015 aulenbach and hooper 2006 hirsch and de cicco 2015 lee et al 2016 nava et al 2019 the multitude of available methods provides researchers with variety of choices when quantifying a pollutant load and selecting the appropriate one can be very challenging thus it is imperative to evaluate performance of these lems so that researchers can better understand their choices and make more informed decisions a key metric for lem performance is load estimate uncertainty there are several sources of uncertainty related to water quality data field instruments sampling location and representativeness laboratory analysis and load calculation harmel et al 2006 rode and suhr 2007 in this study we focused on the uncertainty associated with the load calculation load uncertainty is defined as the relative difference also called relative error between the lem estimated load load estimate and the true load which is calculated as load estimate true load true load and expressed as a percentage additionally measures of bias median relative error and imprecision variation in relative error can be used to quantify load uncertainty birgand et al 2010 williams et al 2015 the ideal lem would be both accurate low bias and consistent in its error high precision several previous studies have attempted to assess the load uncertainty associated with nutrient load estimates appling et al 2015 aulenbach et al 2016 birgand et al 2010 2011 johnes 2007 kelly et al 2018 lee et al 2016 2019 moatar et al 2013 quilbé et al 2006 williams et al 2015 many of those studies found that the accuracy of load estimates depended on sampling frequency therefore sampling strategy can substantially affect load estimate uncertainty however they focused on load uncertainty using a single lem category e g averaging interpolation approaches moatar and meybeck 2005 or regression model approaches stenback et al 2011 with limited comparisons across lem categories and sampling frequencies in addition these studies were performed either on large scale watersheds 103 km2 or field scale drainage plot 10 km2 instead of the smaller watersheds 103 km2 assessing load estimate uncertainty is especially important for these smaller watersheds which often lack the sampling budget of large scale watersheds to determine the effects of management practices and create a baseline for future management decisions and practices easton 2017 harmel et al 2018b kalcic 2016 2018 finally previous studies were typically performed with short term monitoring data for example the highly relevant johnes 2007 study which studied 17 watersheds in the uk analyzed only one to two years of monitoring data per watershed the primary objective of this study was to quantify how sampling frequencies affect uncertainty in annual srp tp and ss load estimates for two small agricultural watersheds using long term monitoring data 30 year with multiple lems categories more detailed objectives were to i quantify the systematic bias and precision in the load estimates for each pollutant lem and sampling frequency combination ii assess the influence of decreasing sampling frequency on load estimation uncertainty within each lem results from this study would help to address concerns if sampling frequency can be reduced the national center for water quality research ncwqr has and help researchers understand the influence of reduced sampling frequency and several lems on load estimate uncertainty in addition these results will help researchers select appropriate sampling frequency and lem and guide sampling planning and monitoring budget estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the analyses were focused on honey and rock creeks which are both agriculturally dominated small tributaries of the sandusky river ohio usa the sandusky river feeds directly into the sandusky bay at the edge of the western lake erie basin wleb fig 1 both honey and rock creek are intensively sampled by the ncwqr at heidelberg university in tiffin oh and the united states geological survey usgs the sampling station for honey creek is located 3 km upstream of the usgs gauge in melmore ohio usa usgs 04197100 from the sampling location the upstream watershed covers an area of approximately 30 700 ha the sampling station for rock creek is located at the usgs gauge in tiffin ohio usa usgs 04197170 the upstream watershed covers approximately 8970 ha 2 2 data collection and preparation the ncwqr collects data on constituent concentrations using the study plan and quality assurance quality control measures described in the heidelberg tributary loading program htlp study plan ncwqr 2017 under this study plan refrigerated isco teledyne isco lincoln ne usa autosamplers collect water samples from honey and rock creeks three times a day at 04 00 12 00 and 20 00 for low flow days only one of the water samples was analyzed for high flow days or during storm events all three water samples were analyzed and then averaged to produce a daily concentration researchers retrieve water samples on a weekly basis and analyze the samples for constituent concentrations at ncwqr laboratories using accepted published epa analytical methods ncwqr 2017 water samples are analyzed for total suspended solids ss soluble reactive phosphorus srp total phosphorus tp combined nitrate and nitrite no3 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn chloride cl and sulfate so4 concentrations this study focused on srp tp and ss concentrations for the honey creek watershed concentration and flow data were available from october 1 1978 to september 30 2020 42 water years for the rock creek watershed concentration and flow data were available from october 1 1982 to september 30 2020 37 water years data of 30 year period from wy1990 through wy2019 were used for this study the average number of days sampled during the 30 year period ranged from 330 to 345 per year the ncqwr used an internal fortran code based on the beale ratio estimator bre baker et al 2014 richards 1998 to fill in the missing concentration and or load values and estimate the annual loads which were assumed to represent the true loads herein referred to as true loads because i the bre method has been the historically accepted method for calculating annual loads in the wleb dolan et al 1981 dolan and chapra 2012 kane et al 2014 maccoux et al 2016 richards et al 1996 rowland 2020 and ii comprehensive sampling minimizes the uncertainty associated with the bre baker 2014 richards 2013 artificial sampling frequencies were imposed by trimming the 30 water years of daily data to generate a series of replicate semiweekly weekly biweekly i e every other week or monthly data sets for each watershed table 1 2 3 load estimation annual pollutant loads were estimated using the r package loadflex appling et al 2015 which allows the user to select several common lems table 2 to estimate annual load for various sampling frequencies table 1 as shown in table 2 the four methods were 1 rectangular interpolation 2 five parameter regression 3 seven parameter regression and 4 the composite method the rectangular interpolation is the simplest approach and is mathematically equivalent to a period weighted average the five and seven parameter regression models are derived from the usgs package rloadest and use relationships between concentration flow season and time to predict unknown concentrations in these models the logarithm transformed daily flow decimal time and seasonal factors are used as parameters lorenz et al 2015 finally the composite method is a modified regression method combined a period weighted approach which uses model residuals to adjust predictions towards the observed concentrations aulenbach 2013 a more complete description of each lem can be found in appling et al 2015 and kelly et al 2018 2 3 1 lem selection and its sources of uncertainty and limitation the selected lems had the potential to provide accurate load estimate across different sampling frequencies from semiweekly to monthly sampling the interpolation works best when concentration data are abundant and regression can provide accurate load estimates when concentration data are sparse rectangular interpolation was selected as the interpolation approach five and seven parameter regression models were selected as the primary regression methods in addition to these three lems the composite method which combines a regression model with interpolation has the potential to improve on both pure interpolation and pure regression lems appling et al 2015 all lems are sensitive to sampling frequency and the relationship between concentration and discharge richards and holloway 1987 for example interpolation method can misapply baseflow concentrations to high flow events or high flow event concentrations to baseflow if concentration varies significantly with streamflow because baseflow periods are more common and therefore more likely to be captured in water quality sampling the interpolation method can bias load estimates toward baseflow concentrations furthermore this bias can be increased as sampling frequency is reduced aulenbach et al 2016 alternatively regression methods use the relationship between concentration and discharge along with additional parameters to predict missing concentration values thus significant variation of concentration with discharge does not necessarily produce greater uncertainty instead the strength of the relationship between concentration and discharge is the key source of uncertainty and reduced sampling frequency can produce a poor concentration and discharge relationship which can bias load estimates therefore regression methods are more robust comparing to interpretation method as sampling frequency is decreased this study focused primarily on the uncertainty derived from changes in sampling frequency however this does not imply that this is the only possible source of uncertainty in load estimates other sources of uncertainty such as the choice of coefficient of regression method are beyond the scope of this study and not discussed both quilbé et al 2006 and aulenbach et al 2016 developed rough guidelines for initial method selection these guidelines focus on the concentration discharge relationship quilbé et al 2006 suggest that regression models are the most appropriate when the relationship is strong r2 0 5 aulenbach et al 2016 provide a slightly different guideline and suggest that regression models including the composite model may be most appropriate when r2 0 3 if this condition is not met then both studies suggest that an interpolation or averaging approach should be selected thus the r2 of concentration discharge relationship was analyzed 2 3 2 calibration period aulenbach 2013 demonstrated that long term calibration datasets can artificially decrease precision in load estimates using regression models e g rl5 and rl7 likely due to year to year variations in the pollutant discharge relationships to minimize this effect we reduced the 30 water years to six 5 year periods 1990 1994 1995 1999 2000 2004 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2019 and run each 5 year period separately in loadflex we then combined the 6 datasets of load estimates to produce a complete 30 year dataset for each location and pollutant 2 4 uncertainty analysis when a true load is assumed usually calculated from high sampling frequency e g daily data load estimation error can be quantified and used to determine reliability often called load uncertainty appling et al 2015 aulenbach et al 2016 birgand et al 2010 2011 johnes 2007 kelly et al 2018 moatar et al 2013 walling and webb 1981 williams et al 2015 measures of load estimate error are defined as uncertainty or more specifically epistemic uncertainty because the actual true load is unknown a true load would require continuous samples see eq 1 which is an impossibility when using discrete sampling therefore the true load used here is also an estimate although it should be considered the best possible estimate made as it has been made from a more complete dataset oberkampf et al 2002 load uncertainty provides a metric for selecting the most appropriate lem and sampling frequency 2 4 1 calculating load uncertainty annual srp tp and ss load estimates for each location lem sampling frequency were compared to the true annual loads using relative difference or uncertainty e eq 2 2 e e s t i m a t e d l o a d t r u e l o a d true l o a d 100 where e is the relative difference estimate is the annual load estimate kg ha and true is the true annual load kg ha the e values from each sampling frequency were aggregated for each water year using the median e value to produce one annual e for each location pollutant method and frequency combination note the assessments presented herein do not account for measurement error in sample collection sample preservation or laboratory analysis as discussed in harmel et al 2006 rode and suhr 2007 annual e values were summarized using several uncertainty descriptors including relative root mean square error rrmse bias and imprecision calculated over the entire study period appling et al 2015 birgand et al 2011 moatar et al 2013 williams et al 2015 further descriptions formulas and performance criteria are provided for each uncertainty descriptor table 3 2 4 2 contextualizing load uncertainty in nutrient loads variability can come from many different sources including discharge variability i e the flashiness of a water body and pollutant transport variability i e pollutant type pollutant source and pathways to water body to ensure that similar systems are being compared to each other the load duration index m2 can be used as a metric for load variability m2 is defined as the cumulative load discharged during the greatest 2 of daily flows for the period of interest moatar and meybeck 2007 moatar et al 2013 williams et al 2015 often this value is calculated over a period of several years instead of annually to fully assess interannual biases and imprecisions in load estimates from 1990 to 2019 m2 bias and imprecision were calculated for each site for each of the three decades included in the periods 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 with m2 for each site the load uncertainty at honey and rock creek could be compared to similar watersheds previous studies have also identified m2 as a robust indicator of bias and precision for loads estimated using the int method moatar et al 2013 however no study has investigated the use of m2 as a predictor of load reliability in watersheds less than 103 km2 these smaller watersheds are important to monitor if we want to determine the individual effects of or create a baseline for future management decisions and practices easton 2017 harmel et al 2018b kalcic 2016 2018 however using m2 as a predictor of uncertainty requires data with a high temporal frequency to circumvent this requirement m2 can be estimated using hydrologic variability w2 and pollutant transport behavior b50sup moatar et al 2013 w2 is the cumulative flow volume discharged in the top 2 of daily flows and can be calculated from high frequency discharge data b50sup represents the relationship between concentration and flow when only the upper half of flows q q50 are used notably b50sup can be calculated from infrequent sampling collected during initial stages of monitoring if b50sup is positive pollutant transport follows a concentration behavior i e increasing concentration with increasing q which is typical of nonpoint source pollution alternatively if b50sup is negative transport follows a dilution behavior decreasing concentration with increasing q which is typical for point source pollution e g wastewater treatment plants all analyses were conducted using r software r core team 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration discharge relationship across both sites model r2 values were the greatest for tp r2 0 32 0 40 and the lowest for srp r2 0 10 0 15 table 4 the greater r2 values for tp indicated that the regression lems had the potential to provide more accurate load estimates for tp the poor concentration discharge relationships for srp indicated that interpolation approaches should be used unlike tp and srp concentration discharge relationships for ss were different at honey creek and rock creek table 4 interpolation method would likely provide better load estimates at honey creek while regression method would likely provide better load estimates at rock creek 3 2 load estimates among the four lems cmp estimated mean annual loads were the closest to the true loads fig 2 the int method produced the lowest mean annual loads all lower than the true loads fig 2 while the seven parameter regression method rl7 estimated the highest mean annual loads fig 2 the five parameter regression method rl5 estimated similar but slightly lower annual loads than rl7 load estimates fig 2 the cmp estimated mean annual srp loads ranging from 0 42 to 0 43 kg ha in honey creek true load 0 38 and 0 31 to 0 38 kg ha in rock creek true load 0 25 the cmp estimated mean annual tp loads were similar to true loads and they ranged from 1 4 to 1 5 kg ha in honey creek true load 1 54 and 1 8 to 2 1 kg ha in rock creek true load 1 61 respectively similar to tp the cmp method produced similar ss loads as true loads fig 2 and the mean annual loads ranged from 450 to 540 kg ha in honey creek true load 489 and 750 to 1100 kg ha in rock creek true load 837 when using the int method load estimates decreased in magnitude as sampling frequency decreased alternatively the regression models stayed relatively consistent this consistency is likely attributable to the stable concentration discharge relationship across sampling frequencies table 4 3 3 load uncertainty 3 3 1 lem performance comparison of the three regression methods cmp was more accurate than rl5 and rl7 fig 3 which was also found in appling et al 2015 aulenbach et al 2016 kelly et al 2018 on average rrmse values for cmp were 18 and 53 smaller than those for rl5 and rl7 respectively although the rl5 method did not perform as well as cmp it was more accurate than int at lower sampling frequencies fig 3 for example the average rrmse for monthly sampling was 43 for rl5 and 54 for int unlike rl5 which performed better than int at lower frequencies rl7 only outperformed int for srp loads from honey creek when sampling frequency was reduced to monthly due to the poor performance of rl5 and rl7 relative to cmp they were removed from further analysis as the best regression method cmp was compared to the simpler int method at low sampling frequencies i e sample intervals longer than a week cmp was more successful at accurately estimating pollutant loads in both watersheds fig 3 but their performance was similar at high sampling frequencies with semiweekly or weekly sampling frequencies cmp was better at estimating tp loads in honey creek and tp and ss loads in rock creek fig 3 meanwhile int was better at estimating srp loads in rock creek fig 3 in the honey creek watershed srp and ss load were best estimated by int when sampling was conducted two times per week but best estimated by cmp with weekly to monthly sampling to further analyze method performance load estimate uncertainty was separated into bias and precision measured as imprecision cmp was generally less biased than int average absolute biases of 8 and 36 respectively table 5 based on the qualitative criteria developed by aulenbach et al 2016 and presented in table 3 load estimates from cmp had an acceptable level of bias except for tp at rock creek table 5 on the other hand the level of bias from int was generally poor for all sampling frequencies pollutants and sites table 5 additionally all biases from int were negative which indicated consistent underestimation of the two methods int was more precise than cmp for all load estimations average imprecisions of 22 and 54 respectively interestingly consistent uncertainty can be more important than accurate estimates for studies aimed at quantifying the difference in load over time from a baseline or from a control watershed which is often the case for nutrient reduction practices and policies williams et al 2015 because int was more precise across all sampling intervals it is likely to be the best method to estimate srp tp and ss loads for comparison studies despite the greater bias and higher rrmse values however if the aim of the study is to estimate pollutant load most accurately then cmp should be used especially when sampling on biweekly or monthly intervals 3 3 2 sampling frequency comparison as expected semiweekly sampling provided the most accurate load estimates regardless of the method used cmp or int using cmp estimates from semiweekly weekly and biweekly sampling had acceptable biases average absolute biases 5 10 and 7 respectively but unacceptably low precisions average imprecisions 39 46 and 63 respectively the general trend of acceptable bias but unacceptable precision in estimates calculated using cmp continued for nearly all sampling frequencies when broken down by pollutant and location table 4 because of the acceptable biases at semiweekly weekly and biweekly sampling all three sample frequencies could provide relatively reliable annual load estimates however the lack of precision in cmp estimates would make it difficult to use these estimates to determine temporal changes in annual loads on the other hand load estimates calculated using int were acceptably precise for both the semiweekly and weekly sampling average imprecisions 17 and 19 respectively but unacceptably biased average absolute bias 16 and 30 respectively although these biases were considered unacceptably poor based on the criteria in aulenbach 2013 the average absolute bias of 16 with semiweekly sampling may be acceptable when trying to determine larger nutrient reductions such as the 40 reduction in srp load needed in the welb however a further investigation into the bias with semiweekly sampling showed that biases were greater than the 10 threshold for tp and ss at honey creek 10 and 12 respectively and srp tp and ss at rock creek 13 24 32 table 5 furthermore precision was low for ss estimates at both watersheds imprecision 21 and 23 for honey and rock creek respectively table 5 thus even at the semiweekly sampling load estimates calculated using either method lacked the desired accuracy and precision furthermore the greater bias and lower precision in the rock creek watershed suggested that load uncertainty was likely to be greater in smaller watersheds 103 km2 within the basin based on these results we recommend continued daily sampling for small watersheds 103 km2 across the wleb 3 4 contextualizing uncertainty small agricultural watersheds with extensive tile drainage have been shown to be more hydrologically reactive than larger watersheds hanrahan et al 2021 king et al 2014 moatar and meybeck 2007 williams et al 2015 the rock creek watershed is smaller than honey creek watershed and the annual richards baker index a measure of hydrologic reactivity showed that rock creek was more hydrologically reactive i e flashier fig 4 this increased hydrologic reactivity likely explains the greater precision and lower absolute bias in annual load estimates for the honey creek watershed regardless of pollutant species table 5 fig 4 across the two watersheds the m2 a method for contextualizing uncertainty ranged from 32 to 46 for srp 29 to 57 for tp and 29 to 64 for ss table 6 for each pollutant m2 was greater in rock creek as expected because rock creek had a greater r b index i e flashiness index fig 4 notably the load estimates for rock creek also had greater uncertainty when compared to other studies m2 values for tp srp and ss were greater than the median m2 values for similar pollutants tp phosphate and suspended particulate matter respectively in larger watersheds in temperate regions in fact the m2 values for tp at rock creek greater than the max m2 moatar et al 2013 alternatively the m2 values for srp from both sites were similar to those observed in a headwater watershed in ohio 389 ha 73 agricultural which had m2 ranging from 45 to 55 and two tile drained agricultural fields in ohio 14 ha 100 agricultural which had m2 ranging from 40 to 65 williams et al 2015 although limited by the small number of sites these results suggested that m2 is inversely proportional to watershed size for agricultural watersheds furthermore these results indicated that a greater m2 corresponded to greater load uncertainty for example a similar ohio watershed with a greater m2 was found to have greater bias and lower precision relative to the honey and rock creek watersheds for srp table 7 williams et al 2015 if m2 is inversely proportional to watershed size then load uncertainty is likely to be greater as watershed size decreases ultimately this suggests that smaller watersheds will require a greater sampling frequency which is reasonable based on hydrologic response times and event durations 3 5 load uncertainty predictors across the period of interest w2 ranged from 23 to 28 for honey creek and 35 to 40 for rock creek in other words 23 to 28 of the cumulative volume were released in the highest 2 of daily flows from the honey creek meanwhile b50sup values ranged from 0 3 for srp to 0 4 for tp to 0 5 for ss all b50sup values were positive indicating that concentration behavior and nonpoint sources dominated in the watershed in this study the relationship between m2 and w2 for a specific b50sup value was similar to the one found in moatar et al 2013 and could be best expressed as follows m2 w2 29 18b50sup r2 0 92 n 18 fig 5 3 to predict uncertainty descriptors e g e50 e90 10 for annual loads at specific sampling frequencies moatar et al 2013 developed an uncertainty matrix using relationships between w2 and b50sup while the results from moatar et al 2013 may not be directly applicable to small agricultural watersheds their methodology may be reapplied to develop results that can provide regional guidelines for sampling frequencies and expected load uncertainties in the wleb specifically for smaller watersheds for example birgand et al 2011 developed regional sampling frequency charts to predict load uncertainty using nine watersheds ranging from 4 to 252 km2 for the brittany region of france which is a similar research project to the wleb when equation 3 was used with a b50sup of 0 35 to represent p transport from tile drained agricultural land and a w2 of 40 to represent small agricultural watersheds in the midwestern united states m2 was estimated to be 55 then uncertainty descriptors can be estimated eqs 4 6 e 50 0 0078 m 2 2 0 33 m 2 r 2 0 74 e 10 0 004 m 2 2 0 916 m 2 r 2 0 73 e 90 0 005 m 2 2 0 078 m 2 r 2 0 29 using these relationships we would predict that annual load estimates from int with weekly sampling in the wleb would have a bias of 36 and an imprecision of 45 which are unacceptably high therefore continued daily sampling seems to be necessary in the wleb 3 6 future directions while annual loads are important to determine long term trends there are often smaller periods of interest that have the potential to have an oversized influence on water quality like spring april june in agricultural watersheds or specifically march july in the wleb stumpf et al 2016 the next step in this research will be to determine the accuracy and precision of each method on a monthly or seasonal basis sampling frequencies may also need to be revisited over the course of a monitoring study because the relationships between flow and constituent relationships are dynamic johnes 2007 4 conclusion we evaluated the accuracy bias and precision of four lems int cmp rl5 and rl7 and four sampling frequencies semiweekly weekly biweekly and monthly for estimating srp tp and ss loads in two small agricultural watersheds in the wleb reducing sampling frequency from daily to semiweekly generally produced sampling led to load estimates with good bias but poor precision for cmp and poor bias but acceptable precision for int a further decrease in sampling frequency led to even poorer biases and precision for both methods from these results we recommend maintaining daily sampling to reliably estimate annual srp tp and ss loads as for load estimation methodology if a daily sampling interval is not feasible we suggest using cmp to limit bias however int is recommended when comparing load estimates to a baseline load or from a control watershed finally results from exploring the influence of lems and sampling frequencies on load estimates by using the parameters w2 and b50sup adapted from a method developed by moatar et al 2013 on large watersheds provide a way to quantify nutrient load uncertainty which can be used for sampling planning and justifying sampling budgets hirsch et al 2010 labeau et al 2013 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

2383,accurate estimates of nutrient loads are necessary to identify critical source areas and quantify the impact of management practices on pollutant export previous studies have investigated nutrient load estimate uncertainty but they often focus on nutrient loads estimated using an interpolation method for large scale watersheds with short term datasets the study objective was to quantify uncertainty in soluble reactive phosphorus srp total phosphorus tp and suspended solids ss load estimates from two small 103 km2 agricultural watersheds in the western lake erie basin resulting from different sampling frequencies each watershed had high temporal resolution datasets of discharge 15 min and nutrient concentration 1 to 3 samples per day collected over a 30 year period 1990 2020 firstly srp tp and ss loads were calculated using the high temporal resolution datasets which was assumed as true loads secondly the high temporal concentration data were decomposed to semiweekly weekly biweekly and monthly sampling and annual loads were estimated using four common load estimation methods to assess the effect of sampling frequency and load estimation method on load estimate error across the four different methods the composite method had the lowest relative root mean square and absolute bias but the rectangular interpolation method was the most precise however even with semiweekly sampling the composite method resulted in an unacceptable level of precision average imprecision 39 while the interpolation method resulted in an unacceptable bias average absolute bias 16 because neither method could provide acceptable accuracy and precision at the lowest decrease in sampling e t semiweekly sampling continued daily sampling is recommended in these

2007 robertson 2003 williams et al 2015 to estimate nutrient loads when concentration observations are infrequent various load estimation methods lems have been developed lems have been categorized into three general classes averaging interpolation approaches regression models and ratio estimators aulenbach et al 2016 lee et al 2016 many of these lems have been made accessible to researchers through open source software packages such as loadflex riverload and egret appling et al 2015 aulenbach and hooper 2006 hirsch and de cicco 2015 lee et al 2016 nava et al 2019 the multitude of available methods provides researchers with variety of choices when quantifying a pollutant load and selecting the appropriate one can be very challenging thus it is imperative to evaluate performance of these lems so that researchers can better understand their choices and make more informed decisions a key metric for lem performance is load estimate uncertainty there are several sources of uncertainty related to water quality data field instruments sampling location and representativeness laboratory analysis and load calculation harmel et al 2006 rode and suhr 2007 in this study we focused on the uncertainty associated with the load calculation load uncertainty is defined as the relative difference also called relative error between the lem estimated load load estimate and the true load which is calculated as load estimate true load true load and expressed as a percentage additionally measures of bias median relative error and imprecision variation in relative error can be used to quantify load uncertainty birgand et al 2010 williams et al 2015 the ideal lem would be both accurate low bias and consistent in its error high precision several previous studies have attempted to assess the load uncertainty associated with nutrient load estimates appling et al 2015 aulenbach et al 2016 birgand et al 2010 2011 johnes 2007 kelly et al 2018 lee et al 2016 2019 moatar et al 2013 quilbé et al 2006 williams et al 2015 many of those studies found that the accuracy of load estimates depended on sampling frequency therefore sampling strategy can substantially affect load estimate uncertainty however they focused on load uncertainty using a single lem category e g averaging interpolation approaches moatar and meybeck 2005 or regression model approaches stenback et al 2011 with limited comparisons across lem categories and sampling frequencies in addition these studies were performed either on large scale watersheds 103 km2 or field scale drainage plot 10 km2 instead of the smaller watersheds 103 km2 assessing load estimate uncertainty is especially important for these smaller watersheds which often lack the sampling budget of large scale watersheds to determine the effects of management practices and create a baseline for future management decisions and practices easton 2017 harmel et al 2018b kalcic 2016 2018 finally previous studies were typically performed with short term monitoring data for example the highly relevant johnes 2007 study which studied 17 watersheds in the uk analyzed only one to two years of monitoring data per watershed the primary objective of this study was to quantify how sampling frequencies affect uncertainty in annual srp tp and ss load estimates for two small agricultural watersheds using long term monitoring data 30 year with multiple lems categories more detailed objectives were to i quantify the systematic bias and precision in the load estimates for each pollutant lem and sampling frequency combination ii assess the influence of decreasing sampling frequency on load estimation uncertainty within each lem results from this study would help to address concerns if sampling frequency can be reduced the national center for water quality research ncwqr has and help researchers understand the influence of reduced sampling frequency and several lems on load estimate uncertainty in addition these results will help researchers select appropriate sampling frequency and lem and guide sampling planning and monitoring budget estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the analyses were focused on honey and rock creeks which are both agriculturally dominated small tributaries of the sandusky river ohio usa the sandusky river feeds directly into the sandusky bay at the edge of the western lake erie basin wleb fig 1 both honey and rock creek are intensively sampled by the ncwqr at heidelberg university in tiffin oh and the united states geological survey usgs the sampling station for honey creek is located 3 km upstream of the usgs gauge in melmore ohio usa usgs 04197100 from the sampling location the upstream watershed covers an area of approximately 30 700 ha the sampling station for rock creek is located at the usgs gauge in tiffin ohio usa usgs 04197170 the upstream watershed covers approximately 8970 ha 2 2 data collection and preparation the ncwqr collects data on constituent concentrations using the study plan and quality assurance quality control measures described in the heidelberg tributary loading program htlp study plan ncwqr 2017 under this study plan refrigerated isco teledyne isco lincoln ne usa autosamplers collect water samples from honey and rock creeks three times a day at 04 00 12 00 and 20 00 for low flow days only one of the water samples was analyzed for high flow days or during storm events all three water samples were analyzed and then averaged to produce a daily concentration researchers retrieve water samples on a weekly basis and analyze the samples for constituent concentrations at ncwqr laboratories using accepted published epa analytical methods ncwqr 2017 water samples are analyzed for total suspended solids ss soluble reactive phosphorus srp total phosphorus tp combined nitrate and nitrite no3 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn chloride cl and sulfate so4 concentrations this study focused on srp tp and ss concentrations for the honey creek watershed concentration and flow data were available from october 1 1978 to september 30 2020 42 water years for the rock creek watershed concentration and flow data were available from october 1 1982 to september 30 2020 37 water years data of 30 year period from wy1990 through wy2019 were used for this study the average number of days sampled during the 30 year period ranged from 330 to 345 per year the ncqwr used an internal fortran code based on the beale ratio estimator bre baker et al 2014 richards 1998 to fill in the missing concentration and or load values and estimate the annual loads which were assumed to represent the true loads herein referred to as true loads because i the bre method has been the historically accepted method for calculating annual loads in the wleb dolan et al 1981 dolan and chapra 2012 kane et al 2014 maccoux et al 2016 richards et al 1996 rowland 2020 and ii comprehensive sampling minimizes the uncertainty associated with the bre baker 2014 richards 2013 artificial sampling frequencies were imposed by trimming the 30 water years of daily data to generate a series of replicate semiweekly weekly biweekly i e every other week or monthly data sets for each watershed table 1 2 3 load estimation annual pollutant loads were estimated using the r package loadflex appling et al 2015 which allows the user to select several common lems table 2 to estimate annual load for various sampling frequencies table 1 as shown in table 2 the four methods were 1 rectangular interpolation 2 five parameter regression 3 seven parameter regression and 4 the composite method the rectangular interpolation is the simplest approach and is mathematically equivalent to a period weighted average the five and seven parameter regression models are derived from the usgs package rloadest and use relationships between concentration flow season and time to predict unknown concentrations in these models the logarithm transformed daily flow decimal time and seasonal factors are used as parameters lorenz et al 2015 finally the composite method is a modified regression method combined a period weighted approach which uses model residuals to adjust predictions towards the observed concentrations aulenbach 2013 a more complete description of each lem can be found in appling et al 2015 and kelly et al 2018 2 3 1 lem selection and its sources of uncertainty and limitation the selected lems had the potential to provide accurate load estimate across different sampling frequencies from semiweekly to monthly sampling the interpolation works best when concentration data are abundant and regression can provide accurate load estimates when concentration data are sparse rectangular interpolation was selected as the interpolation approach five and seven parameter regression models were selected as the primary regression methods in addition to these three lems the composite method which combines a regression model with interpolation has the potential to improve on both pure interpolation and pure regression lems appling et al 2015 all lems are sensitive to sampling frequency and the relationship between concentration and discharge richards and holloway 1987 for example interpolation method can misapply baseflow concentrations to high flow events or high flow event concentrations to baseflow if concentration varies significantly with streamflow because baseflow periods are more common and therefore more likely to be captured in water quality sampling the interpolation method can bias load estimates toward baseflow concentrations furthermore this bias can be increased as sampling frequency is reduced aulenbach et al 2016 alternatively regression methods use the relationship between concentration and discharge along with additional parameters to predict missing concentration values thus significant variation of concentration with discharge does not necessarily produce greater uncertainty instead the strength of the relationship between concentration and discharge is the key source of uncertainty and reduced sampling frequency can produce a poor concentration and discharge relationship which can bias load estimates therefore regression methods are more robust comparing to interpretation method as sampling frequency is decreased this study focused primarily on the uncertainty derived from changes in sampling frequency however this does not imply that this is the only possible source of uncertainty in load estimates other sources of uncertainty such as the choice of coefficient of regression method are beyond the scope of this study and not discussed both quilbé et al 2006 and aulenbach et al 2016 developed rough guidelines for initial method selection these guidelines focus on the concentration discharge relationship quilbé et al 2006 suggest that regression models are the most appropriate when the relationship is strong r2 0 5 aulenbach et al 2016 provide a slightly different guideline and suggest that regression models including the composite model may be most appropriate when r2 0 3 if this condition is not met then both studies suggest that an interpolation or averaging approach should be selected thus the r2 of concentration discharge relationship was analyzed 2 3 2 calibration period aulenbach 2013 demonstrated that long term calibration datasets can artificially decrease precision in load estimates using regression models e g rl5 and rl7 likely due to year to year variations in the pollutant discharge relationships to minimize this effect we reduced the 30 water years to six 5 year periods 1990 1994 1995 1999 2000 2004 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2019 and run each 5 year period separately in loadflex we then combined the 6 datasets of load estimates to produce a complete 30 year dataset for each location and pollutant 2 4 uncertainty analysis when a true load is assumed usually calculated from high sampling frequency e g daily data load estimation error can be quantified and used to determine reliability often called load uncertainty appling et al 2015 aulenbach et al 2016 birgand et al 2010 2011 johnes 2007 kelly et al 2018 moatar et al 2013 walling and webb 1981 williams et al 2015 measures of load estimate error are defined as uncertainty or more specifically epistemic uncertainty because the actual true load is unknown a true load would require continuous samples see eq 1 which is an impossibility when using discrete sampling therefore the true load used here is also an estimate although it should be considered the best possible estimate made as it has been made from a more complete dataset oberkampf et al 2002 load uncertainty provides a metric for selecting the most appropriate lem and sampling frequency 2 4 1 calculating load uncertainty annual srp tp and ss load estimates for each location lem sampling frequency were compared to the true annual loads using relative difference or uncertainty e eq 2 2 e e s t i m a t e d l o a d t r u e l o a d true l o a d 100 where e is the relative difference estimate is the annual load estimate kg ha and true is the true annual load kg ha the e values from each sampling frequency were aggregated for each water year using the median e value to produce one annual e for each location pollutant method and frequency combination note the assessments presented herein do not account for measurement error in sample collection sample preservation or laboratory analysis as discussed in harmel et al 2006 rode and suhr 2007 annual e values were summarized using several uncertainty descriptors including relative root mean square error rrmse bias and imprecision calculated over the entire study period appling et al 2015 birgand et al 2011 moatar et al 2013 williams et al 2015 further descriptions formulas and performance criteria are provided for each uncertainty descriptor table 3 2 4 2 contextualizing load uncertainty in nutrient loads variability can come from many different sources including discharge variability i e the flashiness of a water body and pollutant transport variability i e pollutant type pollutant source and pathways to water body to ensure that similar systems are being compared to each other the load duration index m2 can be used as a metric for load variability m2 is defined as the cumulative load discharged during the greatest 2 of daily flows for the period of interest moatar and meybeck 2007 moatar et al 2013 williams et al 2015 often this value is calculated over a period of several years instead of annually to fully assess interannual biases and imprecisions in load estimates from 1990 to 2019 m2 bias and imprecision were calculated for each site for each of the three decades included in the periods 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 with m2 for each site the load uncertainty at honey and rock creek could be compared to similar watersheds previous studies have also identified m2 as a robust indicator of bias and precision for loads estimated using the int method moatar et al 2013 however no study has investigated the use of m2 as a predictor of load reliability in watersheds less than 103 km2 these smaller watersheds are important to monitor if we want to determine the individual effects of or create a baseline for future management decisions and practices easton 2017 harmel et al 2018b kalcic 2016 2018 however using m2 as a predictor of uncertainty requires data with a high temporal frequency to circumvent this requirement m2 can be estimated using hydrologic variability w2 and pollutant transport behavior b50sup moatar et al 2013 w2 is the cumulative flow volume discharged in the top 2 of daily flows and can be calculated from high frequency discharge data b50sup represents the relationship between concentration and flow when only the upper half of flows q q50 are used notably b50sup can be calculated from infrequent sampling collected during initial stages of monitoring if b50sup is positive pollutant transport follows a concentration behavior i e increasing concentration with increasing q which is typical of nonpoint source pollution alternatively if b50sup is negative transport follows a dilution behavior decreasing concentration with increasing q which is typical for point source pollution e g wastewater treatment plants all analyses were conducted using r software r core team 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration discharge relationship across both sites model r2 values were the greatest for tp r2 0 32 0 40 and the lowest for srp r2 0 10 0 15 table 4 the greater r2 values for tp indicated that the regression lems had the potential to provide more accurate load estimates for tp the poor concentration discharge relationships for srp indicated that interpolation approaches should be used unlike tp and srp concentration discharge relationships for ss were different at honey creek and rock creek table 4 interpolation method would likely provide better load estimates at honey creek while regression method would likely provide better load estimates at rock creek 3 2 load estimates among the four lems cmp estimated mean annual loads were the closest to the true loads fig 2 the int method produced the lowest mean annual loads all lower than the true loads fig 2 while the seven parameter regression method rl7 estimated the highest mean annual loads fig 2 the five parameter regression method rl5 estimated similar but slightly lower annual loads than rl7 load estimates fig 2 the cmp estimated mean annual srp loads ranging from 0 42 to 0 43 kg ha in honey creek true load 0 38 and 0 31 to 0 38 kg ha in rock creek true load 0 25 the cmp estimated mean annual tp loads were similar to true loads and they ranged from 1 4 to 1 5 kg ha in honey creek true load 1 54 and 1 8 to 2 1 kg ha in rock creek true load 1 61 respectively similar to tp the cmp method produced similar ss loads as true loads fig 2 and the mean annual loads ranged from 450 to 540 kg ha in honey creek true load 489 and 750 to 1100 kg ha in rock creek true load 837 when using the int method load estimates decreased in magnitude as sampling frequency decreased alternatively the regression models stayed relatively consistent this consistency is likely attributable to the stable concentration discharge relationship across sampling frequencies table 4 3 3 load uncertainty 3 3 1 lem performance comparison of the three regression methods cmp was more accurate than rl5 and rl7 fig 3 which was also found in appling et al 2015 aulenbach et al 2016 kelly et al 2018 on average rrmse values for cmp were 18 and 53 smaller than those for rl5 and rl7 respectively although the rl5 method did not perform as well as cmp it was more accurate than int at lower sampling frequencies fig 3 for example the average rrmse for monthly sampling was 43 for rl5 and 54 for int unlike rl5 which performed better than int at lower frequencies rl7 only outperformed int for srp loads from honey creek when sampling frequency was reduced to monthly due to the poor performance of rl5 and rl7 relative to cmp they were removed from further analysis as the best regression method cmp was compared to the simpler int method at low sampling frequencies i e sample intervals longer than a week cmp was more successful at accurately estimating pollutant loads in both watersheds fig 3 but their performance was similar at high sampling frequencies with semiweekly or weekly sampling frequencies cmp was better at estimating tp loads in honey creek and tp and ss loads in rock creek fig 3 meanwhile int was better at estimating srp loads in rock creek fig 3 in the honey creek watershed srp and ss load were best estimated by int when sampling was conducted two times per week but best estimated by cmp with weekly to monthly sampling to further analyze method performance load estimate uncertainty was separated into bias and precision measured as imprecision cmp was generally less biased than int average absolute biases of 8 and 36 respectively table 5 based on the qualitative criteria developed by aulenbach et al 2016 and presented in table 3 load estimates from cmp had an acceptable level of bias except for tp at rock creek table 5 on the other hand the level of bias from int was generally poor for all sampling frequencies pollutants and sites table 5 additionally all biases from int were negative which indicated consistent underestimation of the two methods int was more precise than cmp for all load estimations average imprecisions of 22 and 54 respectively interestingly consistent uncertainty can be more important than accurate estimates for studies aimed at quantifying the difference in load over time from a baseline or from a control watershed which is often the case for nutrient reduction practices and policies williams et al 2015 because int was more precise across all sampling intervals it is likely to be the best method to estimate srp tp and ss loads for comparison studies despite the greater bias and higher rrmse values however if the aim of the study is to estimate pollutant load most accurately then cmp should be used especially when sampling on biweekly or monthly intervals 3 3 2 sampling frequency comparison as expected semiweekly sampling provided the most accurate load estimates regardless of the method used cmp or int using cmp estimates from semiweekly weekly and biweekly sampling had acceptable biases average absolute biases 5 10 and 7 respectively but unacceptably low precisions average imprecisions 39 46 and 63 respectively the general trend of acceptable bias but unacceptable precision in estimates calculated using cmp continued for nearly all sampling frequencies when broken down by pollutant and location table 4 because of the acceptable biases at semiweekly weekly and biweekly sampling all three sample frequencies could provide relatively reliable annual load estimates however the lack of precision in cmp estimates would make it difficult to use these estimates to determine temporal changes in annual loads on the other hand load estimates calculated using int were acceptably precise for both the semiweekly and weekly sampling average imprecisions 17 and 19 respectively but unacceptably biased average absolute bias 16 and 30 respectively although these biases were considered unacceptably poor based on the criteria in aulenbach 2013 the average absolute bias of 16 with semiweekly sampling may be acceptable when trying to determine larger nutrient reductions such as the 40 reduction in srp load needed in the welb however a further investigation into the bias with semiweekly sampling showed that biases were greater than the 10 threshold for tp and ss at honey creek 10 and 12 respectively and srp tp and ss at rock creek 13 24 32 table 5 furthermore precision was low for ss estimates at both watersheds imprecision 21 and 23 for honey and rock creek respectively table 5 thus even at the semiweekly sampling load estimates calculated using either method lacked the desired accuracy and precision furthermore the greater bias and lower precision in the rock creek watershed suggested that load uncertainty was likely to be greater in smaller watersheds 103 km2 within the basin based on these results we recommend continued daily sampling for small watersheds 103 km2 across the wleb 3 4 contextualizing uncertainty small agricultural watersheds with extensive tile drainage have been shown to be more hydrologically reactive than larger watersheds hanrahan et al 2021 king et al 2014 moatar and meybeck 2007 williams et al 2015 the rock creek watershed is smaller than honey creek watershed and the annual richards baker index a measure of hydrologic reactivity showed that rock creek was more hydrologically reactive i e flashier fig 4 this increased hydrologic reactivity likely explains the greater precision and lower absolute bias in annual load estimates for the honey creek watershed regardless of pollutant species table 5 fig 4 across the two watersheds the m2 a method for contextualizing uncertainty ranged from 32 to 46 for srp 29 to 57 for tp and 29 to 64 for ss table 6 for each pollutant m2 was greater in rock creek as expected because rock creek had a greater r b index i e flashiness index fig 4 notably the load estimates for rock creek also had greater uncertainty when compared to other studies m2 values for tp srp and ss were greater than the median m2 values for similar pollutants tp phosphate and suspended particulate matter respectively in larger watersheds in temperate regions in fact the m2 values for tp at rock creek greater than the max m2 moatar et al 2013 alternatively the m2 values for srp from both sites were similar to those observed in a headwater watershed in ohio 389 ha 73 agricultural which had m2 ranging from 45 to 55 and two tile drained agricultural fields in ohio 14 ha 100 agricultural which had m2 ranging from 40 to 65 williams et al 2015 although limited by the small number of sites these results suggested that m2 is inversely proportional to watershed size for agricultural watersheds furthermore these results indicated that a greater m2 corresponded to greater load uncertainty for example a similar ohio watershed with a greater m2 was found to have greater bias and lower precision relative to the honey and rock creek watersheds for srp table 7 williams et al 2015 if m2 is inversely proportional to watershed size then load uncertainty is likely to be greater as watershed size decreases ultimately this suggests that smaller watersheds will require a greater sampling frequency which is reasonable based on hydrologic response times and event durations 3 5 load uncertainty predictors across the period of interest w2 ranged from 23 to 28 for honey creek and 35 to 40 for rock creek in other words 23 to 28 of the cumulative volume were released in the highest 2 of daily flows from the honey creek meanwhile b50sup values ranged from 0 3 for srp to 0 4 for tp to 0 5 for ss all b50sup values were positive indicating that concentration behavior and nonpoint sources dominated in the watershed in this study the relationship between m2 and w2 for a specific b50sup value was similar to the one found in moatar et al 2013 and could be best expressed as follows m2 w2 29 18b50sup r2 0 92 n 18 fig 5 3 to predict uncertainty descriptors e g e50 e90 10 for annual loads at specific sampling frequencies moatar et al 2013 developed an uncertainty matrix using relationships between w2 and b50sup while the results from moatar et al 2013 may not be directly applicable to small agricultural watersheds their methodology may be reapplied to develop results that can provide regional guidelines for sampling frequencies and expected load uncertainties in the wleb specifically for smaller watersheds for example birgand et al 2011 developed regional sampling frequency charts to predict load uncertainty using nine watersheds ranging from 4 to 252 km2 for the brittany region of france which is a similar research project to the wleb when equation 3 was used with a b50sup of 0 35 to represent p transport from tile drained agricultural land and a w2 of 40 to represent small agricultural watersheds in the midwestern united states m2 was estimated to be 55 then uncertainty descriptors can be estimated eqs 4 6 e 50 0 0078 m 2 2 0 33 m 2 r 2 0 74 e 10 0 004 m 2 2 0 916 m 2 r 2 0 73 e 90 0 005 m 2 2 0 078 m 2 r 2 0 29 using these relationships we would predict that annual load estimates from int with weekly sampling in the wleb would have a bias of 36 and an imprecision of 45 which are unacceptably high therefore continued daily sampling seems to be necessary in the wleb 3 6 future directions while annual loads are important to determine long term trends there are often smaller periods of interest that have the potential to have an oversized influence on water quality like spring april june in agricultural watersheds or specifically march july in the wleb stumpf et al 2016 the next step in this research will be to determine the accuracy and precision of each method on a monthly or seasonal basis sampling frequencies may also need to be revisited over the course of a monitoring study because the relationships between flow and constituent relationships are dynamic johnes 2007 4 conclusion we evaluated the accuracy bias and precision of four lems int cmp rl5 and rl7 and four sampling frequencies semiweekly weekly biweekly and monthly for estimating srp tp and ss loads in two small agricultural watersheds in the wleb reducing sampling frequency from daily to semiweekly generally produced sampling led to load estimates with good bias but poor precision for cmp and poor bias but acceptable precision for int a further decrease in sampling frequency led to even poorer biases and precision for both methods from these results we recommend maintaining daily sampling to reliably estimate annual srp tp and ss loads as for load estimation methodology if a daily sampling interval is not feasible we suggest using cmp to limit bias however int is recommended when comparing load estimates to a baseline load or from a control watershed finally results from exploring the influence of lems and sampling frequencies on load estimates by using the parameters w2 and b50sup adapted from a method developed by moatar et al 2013 on large watersheds provide a way to quantify nutrient load uncertainty which can be used for sampling planning and justifying sampling budgets hirsch et al 2010 labeau et al 2013 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

present the glaciological 2014 2019 geodetic 2000 2014 and reconstructed 1980 2019 mb of the kolahoi glacier kg in the kashmir himalaya india during the five year observation period the average in

four distinct glacier recession episodes since 1980 the period i 1980 1990 showed a reduced mass loss of 0 27 0 42 m w e a 1 with four years of positive mass balance the period ii 2000 2010 on the other hand experienced the highest mass loss of 1 18 m w e a 1 throughout the entire reconstructed mb series all three mb measurement in situ geodetic and simulated agreed well the mb showed an excellent correspondence with the observed temperature and precipitation analysis of the data revealed that the mb is sensitive to temperature at the rate of 0 65 m w e a 1 c 1 but the sensitivity is only 0 13 m w e a 1 for a 10 change in precipitation furthermore there is a good correlation between the simulated glacier mass loss and depleting glacier melt in the autumn streamflow the mass loss of the kg is expected to exacerbate in future as a result of the projected climate change and thus further diminishing the streamflow of the transboundary rivers emanating from the region it is

region bolch et al 2012 inconsistent reports on the status and behaviour of glaciers in the himalaya reflect insufficient information knowledge gaps and ambiguity cruz et al 2007 cogley et al 2010 rashid and abdullah 2016 only 15 of the 32 392 glaciers in the indian himalaya sac 2010 have been investigated using in situ glacier mass balance mb measurements and majority of these observations are limited to a few years between 1975 and 1990 singh et al 2018 vincent et al 2013 chhota shigri is the only glacier in the indian himalaya that has been studied for mass balance for more than a decade wagnon et al 2007 azam et al 2012 singh et al 2018 although jammu kashmir and ladakh himalaya have 15 000 glaciers abdullah et al 2020 in situ mass balance data of only 6 glaciers are available 4 in the kashmir himalaya one in the zanskar range gsi 2001 kaul 1986 romshoo et al 2022b sangewar and siddique 2006 srivastava 2001 and one in ladakh mountain range soheb et al 2020 these observations however are brief 1 year mass balance for the kolahoi and shishram 9 years for the nehnar glacier in the kashmir himalaya 2 years for the rulung in the zanskar and 5 years for stok glacier in the ladakh mountain range in light of various constraints for undertaking glaciological mb geodetic mb has emerged as a suitable alternative approach to assess glacier mass balance changes and there has been significant increase in the publications reporting geodetically derived glacier mass balances at local and regional scales in the entire hindu kush himalayan hkh region kääb et al 2015 brun et al 2019 muhammad et al 2019b however the intra annual variability of mass balance is not captured in geodetic mb estimates which are often carried out between long time gaps because of the lack of the appropriate elevation data given the limited time series of glaciological mass balances and data constraints for geodetic mb measurements it is necessary to use models to simulate long term mass balance budget of the himalayan glaciers duly validated with observations to better understand glacier response to changing climate and to assess the impacts of climate change on glacier dynamics and health melt models are widely employed for mb reconstruction and are broadly classified into two types temperature index models johannesson et al 1995 hock 2003 and energy balance models hock and holmgren 2005 mölg et al 2012 energy balance models require a large set of meteorological observations at glacier site hock et al 2007 the availability of which is a major challenge in the hkh the temperature index models on the other hand have a simple structure hock 2003 furthermore because temperature data which is usually the only input parameter required is readily available the approach has been widely employed in a variety of studies in the mountainous regions with a few improvements and modifications here and there carenzo et al 2016 finsterwalder and schunk 1887 pellicciotti et al 2005 tobin et al 2013 vincent and six 2013 wmo 1986 the use of temperature index model in the current study is further justified by the fact that the kolahoi glacier kg is similar to the mid latitude glaciers with ablation and accumulation restricted to summer and winter respectively sicart et al 2008 the mass balance gradient of the kg is similar to that of the alps glaciers where the temperature index model for mass balance reconstruction has usually performed very well wagnon et al 2007 the goal of the current study is therefore to gain a better understanding of the recent long term mass balance of the kg using direct geodetic and reconstructed mb approaches the direct mass balance measurements on such glaciers in the data scarce kashmir himalaya are of great importance for cryospheric and hydrological process understanding and modelling since the streamflow in the region is significantly influenced by glacier melt and the fact that the indicators of climate change indicators are very evident in the region mukhopadhyay and khan 2014a zaz et al 2019 muhammad et al 2019b it is therefore imperative to generate knowledge about the behaviour and health of glaciers to inform strategies for the sustainable management of the diminishing transboundary water resources in the himalayan region 2 study area the jammu and kashmir himalaya hosts some of the largest and most magnificent glaciers in the hkh region abdullah et al 2020 the kg the largest glacier in the kashmir valley s jhelum basin one of the five major tributaries of the indus river has an area of 11 km2 rashid et al 2017 and is situated between 34 07 to 34 12 n latitude and 75 16 to 75 23 e longitude fig 1 the glacier altitude ranges from 3600 to 5020 m asl with mainly northwest orientation meltwaters from the kg emerge as the west liddar river which joins the east lidder river originating from the sheshram glacier at pahalgam 35 km from the present snout before draining into the centrally flowing jhelum river downstream a small fraction 0 54 km2 of the kg is covered by supra glacial debris cover the equilibrium line altitude ela of the kg glacier settled around 4400 m asl corresponding to accumulation area ratio aar of 0 57 during 2014 2019 based on the satellite and field observations the kg has witnessed deglaciation 25 18 1 29 during 1992 2020 with the highest recession 13 66 observed during the 2000 2010 the lidder valley has a mediterranean climate with four distinct seasons winter december to february spring march to may summer june to august and autumn from september to november khattak et al 2011 the lidder valley receives most of its precipitation in the form of snow during winter and early spring marazi and romshoo 2018 as of 2018 glaciers covered around 33 5 2 0 km2 of the lidder valley corresponding to 2 7 of the total basin area romshoo et al 2020a and are sustained by snowfall received during the winter months dar and romshoo 2012

temperature and precipitation at pahalgam from 1980 and 2019 3 data sets 3 1 mass balance data the previous mb measurement of the kg is available only for the year 1983 84 kaul 1986 the in situ mass balance monitoring of the glacier was re established by the centre of excellence for glacial studies university of kashmir in 2014 and the measurements are conducted annually since then at the end of the ablation season which typically ends in september or early october the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of february 2000 version 4 and high mountain asia hma dems october 2014 were used for estimating geodetic mass balance of the kg shean et al 2020 3 2 hydro meteorological data the nearest meteorological observatory situated at phalagam has a record of meteorological data from 1980 and is located 35 km downstream of the kg daily temperature minimum and maximum and precipitation data from 1980 to 2019 was used to reconstruct the glacier mb the air temperature both minimum and maximum are recorded on daily basis using traditional thermometers the daily mean temperature is computed by averaging the mean maximum and minimum temperatures for the day the temperature record is nearly complete with a few small data gaps which were filled using the data from the two preceding and following observations of the missing data using linear interpolation approach azam et al 2014 the daily precipitation data is collected using the tipping bucket rain gauge the precipitation data gaps 2 were filled up by utilizing the average precipitation from the preceding and succeeding year of the missing date azam et al 2014 we also analysed the streamflow data 1980 2019 of the lidder stream at the botkote pahalgam station which originates from the kg and flows through pahalgam town the streamflow data is collected only 3 4 times a month by the department of flood and irrigation department govt of jammu and kashmir since the contribution of the glacier melt is thought to be more pronounced during autumn when practically all of the seasonal snow has melted bookhagen and burbank 2010 dar et al 2014 we analysed discharge data of the autumn season only from 1980 to 2019 to establish a link between the depleting streamflow and glacier mass balance 4 methods 4 1 glaciological mass balance during the first glacier field expedition to the kg in september 2014 undertaken to set up glaciological mass balance measurements 10 bamboo stakes were drilled more than 3 m deep into the ice for ablation measurements fig 3 a b using the heucke steam drill heucke 1999 the stakes were only emplaced on the west flank of the glacier as the access to the eastern flank is limited due to the steep slope and large crevasses since 2014 the stake network has been improved year after year to better capture the glacier ablation and accumulation the number of stakes for ablation measurements was increased to 19 in 2015 fig 1 as and when the stakes are displaced or melt out of the ice for whatever reasons they were replaced at the original locations on yearly basis ice density value of 900 kg m 3 was used to convert the ablation measurements at the stake positions into water equivalent wagnon et al 2007 to account for the snow accumulation at least two snow pits were dug in the accumulation zone deep up to the previous yeaŕs summer horizon each year during the observation period fig 3c a number of snow probe measurements were made annually along the observeŕs path to the snow pits to augment the snow accumulation measurements from the two snow pits to ensure a good sample more than five snow probe measurements were taken around each probe position to arrive at the average measurement fig 3d the snow probes were increased from 5 in 2015 to 8 in the following years the mass balance observation dates vary slightly from year to year and could not be fixed to the same date every year owing to limited access security and other logistical constraints the profile approach was used to extrapolate the mass balance from individual stakes to glacier wide mass balance b assuming that the local mass balance values vary only as a function of glacier elevation f z escher vetter et al 2009 1 b i 0 n f z i a z i a glacier the mass balance was analysed for 50 m elevation bands zi with glacier area a and n being the number of elevation bands the profile method is advantageous as it can be applied to any glacier where area altitude and local mass balance measurements are available however sometimes local snow redistribution may require application of more sophisticated function type to estimate glacier mass balance as a function of altitude escher vetter et al 2009 4 2 geodetic mass balance the hma dem shean 2017 and srtm dem rankl and braun 2016 both with date specific information provide an excellent opportunity to assess glacier mass changes over the topographically challenging and data scarce himalayan region neckel et al 2014 between 2000 and 2014 changes in the glacier surface altitude dh dt were measured by differencing the hma and srtm dems to compute changes in glacier volume δv shean 2017 the geodetic mass balance bgeo was calculated by multiplying the glacier volume change δv by glacier density ρ as follows 2 b geo δ v ρ the ice density of 850 60 kg m 3 was used to convert volume estimates into mass balance huss 2013 the density value used in this research accommodates for the varied densities of ice firn and snow the appropriate correction for radar ice penetration was made for srtm dem prior to using the data for estimating ice thickness changes mukherjee et al 2018 furthermore since the participating dems have different spatial resolutions therefore the hma dem with 8 m resolution was resampled to match with the 30 m srtm dem resolution using the kriging interpolation algorithm in the arcgis environment lv et al 2020 4 3 mass balance reconstruction a temperature index model temperature index models relate ice melt with positive temperatures and despite their simplicity they usually perform well in comparison to the data intensive and complex energy balance models braithwaite and olesen 1989 wmo 1986 the amount of melt ablation m is computed as a function of positive air temperatures and a proportionality factor known as degree day factor ddf as follows ddf ice s n o w d e b r i s t t t m 0 t t m where ddf is expressed as mm d 1 c 1 and varies for ice snow and debris covered surfaces t is the daily extrapolated temperatures c at the glacier altitudes and tm represents the critical temperature for melt the accumulation a on the glacier surface is estimated using the following equation 4 a p t t p 0 t t p where p is the daily precipitation extrapolated to the glacier altitudes tp is the threshold temperature to determine the form of precipitation rain or snow the annual mass balance was computed by adding up ablation and accumulation at 50 m elevation bands for the whole hydrological year starting from 1st of october to 30th of september the following year the ddfs used depend upon the state of the glacier surface viz snow clean and debris cover table 1 the mass gain due to the liquid precipitation and refreezing of meltwater is not accounted for in this study because its contribution is assumed to be negligible for temperate glaciers braithwaite and zhang 2000 b model parameter analysis table 1 lists the model parameters that were used in this study due to the scarcity of hydro meteorological observations in the indian himalayan in general and the kashmir himalaya in particular romshoo et al 2020b a simple yet robust model requiring a minimum number of input parameters sicart et al 2008 was used to reconstruct the glacier mass balance since 1980 the model parameters were calculated at the glacier site and also selected from the literature or adjusted as per the model output azam et al 2014 the ddfs for snow ice and debris were calculated using field based melt measurements and temperature data a range of threshold temperatures for melt and snow rain are reported in the literature and their variability has little effect on glacier mass balance azam et al 2014 the monthly temperature lapse rates reported by romshoo et al 2018 for the study area were used to extrapolate the daily temperatures to the glacier altitudes the altitudinal precipitation gradient was the only adjusted parameter used in the model due to the lack of the observation data c temperature lapse rates in view of the scanty hydro meteorological observational network in the mountainous terrains including the himalaya researchers have used the standard temperature lapse rate stlr to model various hydrological meteorological and glaciological processes adnan et al 2017 dar and romshoo 2012 romshoo et al 2015 many studies have reported variations in temperature lapse rate tlr in both space altitudinal and time panday et al 2014 winiger et al 2005 romshoo et al 2018 based on the observed and satellite derived temperatures reported the space time variations in tlrs across different altitudinal ranges over the study region to simulate mass balance temperature index models usually use a single tlr for the entire hydrological year johannesson et al 1995 vincent 2002 however for simulating kg s mb we employed several tlrs for the hydrological year provided by romshoo et al 2018 to accurately represent the temporal and altitudinal variability of temperature d precipitation gradient precipitation has a substantially steeper vertical gradient than temperature making it more difficult to estimate particularly in the data deficient mountainous regions immerzeel et al 2012 jiang et al 2022 as a result the precipitation gradient value was therefore selected from the literature and adjusted till the modelled mass balance best represents the observed mass balance of the glacier we started with the precipitation gradient of 0 2 m km 1 that considerably overestimated the mb wulf et al 2010 the mb was recalculated iteratively by reducing the precipitation gradient by 0 01 m km 1 until the least rmse was achieved between the in situ and modelled mb the precipitation gradient of 0 11 m km 1 so obtained was in good accord with the precipitation gradients recorded in the other himalayan regions azam et al 2014 wulf et al 2010 winiger et al 2005 considering that precipitation increases linearly with altitude immerzeel et al 2012 the precipitation at the glacier altitudes was estimated using the precipitation gradient from the pahalgam meteorological observatory e degree day factors degree day factors ddf for ice snow and debris on the kg site during the 2015 2018 period were computed using the melt measurements at several stakes positioned at different glacier altitudes the ddfs were computed using the following mathematical formulation 5 i 1 n m d d f t d t the eq 5 relates the melt m in mm with positive temperatures t c during a period of n time intervals the ddf is represented in mm d 1 c 1 generally computed using temperatures integrated over daily time intervals however positive temperatures integrated over monthly time scales were also used to compute ddfs hock 2003 the melt measurements were recorded for time intervals lasting between a few days to over a week to minimize the uncertainty days with substantial amount of snowfall were excluded from analysis azam et al 2014 the stake data with ablation 150 mm w e was not considered for ddf estimation due to the uncertainty of 150 mm w e in the observed stake melt measurements which is attributed to the uncertainty in snow ice density snow water equivalent and stake measurements thibert et al 2008 the ddfs thus obtained for snow ice and debris surfaces are comparable to those obtained for glaciers in the other himalayan regions and elsewhere singh et al 2000 4 4 model calibration the in situ mass balance measurements of the kg conducted from 2014 to 15 to 2018 19 were used to calibrate the mass balance model the model was run iteratively till the modelled mass balance best matched the field observations the ddf monthly tlrs threshold temperature values tp 1 c and tm 0 c precipitation gradient annual observed mass balance 2014 2019 and geodetic mass balance 2000 2014 were used for the model calibration process 4 5 sensitivity analysis in several climate change impact studies sensitivity of glacier mass balance to climatic variability assessed employing temperature index models has been commonly used as a climate proxy solomon et al 2007 shea et al 2009 wu et al 2011 the sensitivity analysis of the kg mass balance to climate was carried out by simulating the annual glacier mass balance of the glacier during 1980 2019 assuming 1 c change in the temperature and 10 change in the precipitation during the simulation period glacier mb sensitivity to temperature dmb dt and precipitation dmb dp was calculated after oerlemans et al 1998 as follows 6 dmb dt m b 1 c m b 1 c 2 m b 1 c m b 0 c 7 dmb dp m b p 10 m b p 10 2 m b 10 m b p 4 6 uncertainty analysis variations of stake length anchored into ablation zone and snow pits dug up to the summer horizon in the accumulation zone during a hydrological year are used to calculate glacier mass balance the common errors in point stake measurements are essentially caused by human error in stake height measurements tilted stakes floating stakes and insufficient representativeness of stakes in a given elevation band thibert et al 2008 annual ablation measurements at similar locations and altitudes revealed a difference ranging from 0 02 to 0 19 m w e and this was considered as the stake representative error σstake in this study and used to estimate the ablation error σab angchuk et al 2021 to estimate the stake representativeness and the ablation error estimates we specifically installed ablation stakes at similar locations in the same elevation bands except the small debris covered area to account for the uncertainty in the accumulation measurements σacc we followed kenzhebaev et al 2017 who used three different approaches including using a single constant accumulation value for all the glacier elevation bands in the accumulation zone a linear gradient in accumulation values and inverse gradient of the highest two elevation bands of the accumulation zone to account for the uncertainty in annual accumulation the standard deviation of the accumulation measurement was interpreted as the uncertainty associated with accumulation measurements kenzhebaev et al 2017 we derived annual glacier wide mass balance uncertainty σba of 0 34 m w e a 1 for the kg based on the accumulation and ablation uncertainties as follows 8 σ ba σ a b 2 σ a c 2 the uncertainty in the in situ mb data used for model calibration as well as the uncertainty associated with the model formulation are the primary causes of errors in the modelled mb kronenberg et al 2016 kenzhebaev et al 2017 we compared the simulated mb from 2014 to 2019 with the field observed mb from the same time to estimate the average annual mb error associated with the model which was estimated to be 0 08 m w e in absence of any observed mb data for the kg prior to 2014 the estimated error was considered to be valid for the entire simulation period 1980 2019 the simulated mb estimates was therefore found to have a cumulative uncertainty of 0 42 m w e sum of the in situ and model uncertainty the commonly used normalized median absolute deviation nmad approach was employed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the elevation difference estimates höhle and höhle 2009 neelmeijer et al 2017 brun et al 2019 the impact of outliers is significantly minimised in this approach which is determined as below 9 nmad 1 4826 m e d i a n δ h j m δ h where δhj and mδh denotes the individual elevation changes and median of all the δhj respectively 5 results 5 1 observed mass balance table 2 shows the annual glaciological mb data of the kg between 2014 and 15 to 2018 19 hydrological years which is negative for the entire 5 year observation period and varied considerably from the lowest of 0 14 0 34 m w e in 2014 15 based on 10 stakes to the highest of 1 53 0 34 m w e in 2016 17 based on 19 stakes for the rest of the observation period the annual mb ranged from 0 31 0 34 m w e to 1 23 0 34 m w e table 2 based on the 5 year mb data the mean annual observed mb of the kg is 0 84 0 34 m w e with considerable inter annual and altitudinal variability largely is response to the variability in meteorological parameters observed during the period the highest mass loss was observed in 2016 17 and is largely controlled by the highest average summer temperature and the lowest winter precipitation of 16 27 c and 0 55 m respectively contrary the mean summer temperature of 15 c and the winter precipitation of 0 9 m observed in the year 2014 15 is responsible for the lowest mass loss of 0 14 0 34 m w e observed during the year as shown in fig 4 mb of the kg varies linearly with glacier altitude with higher mass loss observed at lower altitudes however the horizontal variations in point mass balance measurements is not very considerable except at the lowest elevation zone where a difference of around 0 44 m w e was observed between two stakes anchored in the debris covered and clean part of the glacier in the same elevation band it is noteworthy that only a small fraction of the kg fig 4f is debris covered 0 54 km2 which contributes marginally to the overall mb budget of the glacier the mean vertical mb gradient of the kg varies from 0 7 m w e 100 m 1 in 2018 19 to 0 8 m w e 100 m 1 in 2014 15 with a mean gradient of 0 76 m w e 100 m 1 during the five year observation period excluding the debris covered portion of the glacier 5 2 geodetic mass balance the dem differencing analysis of the kg indicated a mean annual mb of 0 90 0 09 m w e estimated between 2000 and 2014 which is consistent with the glaciological mb of 0 83 0 34 m w e though it belongs to the 2014 2019 period however the agreement with the simulated average mb of 1 29 0 42 m w e of the glacier for the same time period is not as good but both are comparable furthermore the linear relationship of the observed mb was also corroborated from the geodetic mb measurements for the kg with higher mass loss of around 3 6 m w e a 1 observed in the lower ablation zone of the glacier supplementary fig s1 owing to the steeper slope the resultant higher mass turn near the ice fall on the eastern flank of the glacier is well captured by the geodetic mb however the difference in the melt rates of the clean and debris covered parts of the glacier were not well captured by the geodetic mb probably due to the fact that only a small part of the glacier is debris covered 5 3 simulated mass balance the reconstructed annual mb of the glacier from 1980 to 2019 varied from 0 66 0 42 m w e to 2 18 0 42 m w e with a standard deviation of 0 73 m w e fig 5 the annual mb of the kg was negative for the most part of the simulated period 87 of the time except during the four hydrological years of 1982 83 1983 84 1987 88 and 1989 90 which showed a positive mb of 0 004 0 42 0 19 0 42 0 66 0 42 and 0 37 0 42 m w e respectively during rest of the reconstructed period the mass balances were negative fig 5 it is pertinent to mention that the simulated average mb of the glacier during 2014 2019 0 92 0 42 m w e which corresponds to the direct field observations is very close to the mean annual glaciological mb of 0 83 0 34 m w e which is however to be expected given that the mb data from this period was used for the model calibration the simulated mb for the hydrological year 1983 84 0 19 0 34 m w e a 1 is much higher than the mb reported by kaul 1986 0 27 m w e a 1 it is important to report that azam et al 2018 questioned the mb of the glacier by kaul 1986 due to the lack of detailed information about mb measurement approach over all the kg has lost ice mass at rate of 0 95 0 42 m w e a 1 over the entire simulated period 1980 2019 the reconstructed annual mb showed a wide range from 0 66 0 42 m w e to 2 18 0 42 m w e analysis of the 39 year reconstructed kg mb series revealed that four distinct periods of mb each lasting around a decade are distinguished from the analysis of the data provided in fig 6 the period i 1981 1990 is the only timeframe with four years of positive mb of 0 004 0 42 0 19 0 42 0 66 0 42 and 0 37 0 42 m w e during the hydrological years of 1982 83 1983 84 1987 88 and 1989 90 respectively as a result the glacier has had the least average mass loss during the decade 0 27 0 42 m w e a 1 during the period ii from 1990 to 2000 and period iv from 2000 to 2019 the glacier lost mass at the average rate of 1 01 0 42 m w e a 1 and 1 13 0 42 m w e a 1 respectively during the period iii from 2000 to 2010 the kg showed the highest average mass loss of 1 18 0 42 m w e a 1 5 4 model validation the observed and simulated mass balance estimates showed a very good agreement with an average rmse of 0 91 m w e during the hydrological years from 2014 to 15 to 2018 19 fig 7 the agreement is best during the hydrological year 2015 16 rmse of 0 54 m w e and worst during the year 2017 18 rmse of 1 37 m w e the rsme values for the other three years varied from 0 56 to 0 94 m w e fig 7 the model slightly overestimated the mass balances and the discrepancies are more obvious in the ablation zone mostly 4350 m asl 5 5 mass balance and streamflow relationship analysis of the time series streamflow data measured at pahalgam from 1980 to 2019 indicated a significantly decreasing trend at a 0 05 in the autumn streamflow which is entirely contributed by glacier melt marazi and romshoo 2018 the analysis revealed that the average autumn streamflow has reduced from around 2407 cusecs during 1980 1990 to 1752 cusecs between 2010 and 2019 indicating 27 decline the analysis of the reconstructed mb showed around 1 5 times greater glacier mass loss during 2010 2019 compared to that of 1980 1990 period fig 8 the results showed a good correspondence between glacier mass loss and streamflow as depicted in fig 8 an increase in the autumn streamflow was noticeable in response to the enhanced the glacier melt more negative mass balance and vice versa though a similar pattern and correspondence of the annual streamflow and mass balance was quite discernible but the correlation is more prominent during the autumn season overall the autumn streamflow has witnessed a decline of around 27 observed between 1980 and 1990 and 2010 2019 corresponding to mass balance of 0 44 m w e a 1 and 1 12 m we a 1 respectively 6 discussion 6 1 observed and geodetic mass balances both observed and geodetic mb showed higher mass losses at lower altitudes typical of the mountain glaciers owing to the altitudinal variation of meteorological parameters wagnon et al 2007 dobhal et al 2008 which is in line with the previous studies conducted over the himalayan region azam et al 2014 angchuk et al 2021 soheb et al 2020 generally the observed mass balance of the kg is relatively higher than most of the glaciers studied for mb in the western himalaya table 4 and the same is attributed to climatic and topographic conditions rashid et al 2017 similarly the geodetic mb of the kg is also consistent with the average geodetic mb estimate of 0 90 m w e a 1 reported by kääb et al 2012 during 2000 2008 period for various glaciers in the kashmir region it was observed that compared to the clean ice glacier melt at the debris covered part of the glacier was lower by around 0 40 m w e in the same elevation band it is noteworthy that debris covers only a small fraction of the glacier with debris thickness ranging from 1 35 cm excluding large sparsely distributed boulders greater than 1 m in size the efficiency of thick debris in retarding glacier melt has been well documented in the previous studies nicholson and benn 2006 nüsser and schmidt 2021 furthermore the inter annual mass balance variability of the kg is well explained by the changes observed in the summer temperature and winter precipitation over the study area for instance the higher mass loss observed in the hydrological years 2016 17 and 2018 19 is well correlated with the higher summer temperatures and lower winter precipitation observed during these years fig 6 we also analysed the vertical mb gradient which is expected to change in response to climatic variability dyurgerov 2003 oerlemans and hoogendoorn 1989 for instance in warmer climate many glaciers have shown increased accumulation while others have shown increased ablation steepening the mb gradients dyurgerov and dwyer 2001 the observed mb gradients of the kg are similar to those found in other parts of the himalaya wagnon et al 2007 the alps and mid latitude glaciers rabatel et al 2005 zemp et al 2009 shea et al 2015 wagnon et al 2013 but are smaller than those observed in the tropical glaciers kaser 2001 we also analysed the changes in the annual vertical mb gradient of the kg since 1980 however there was no discernible trend in the mb gradient though the mb gradient was slightly more negative by 0 07 m w e 100 m 1 during 1980 90 than during the recent decade 2010 19 this is ascribed to the increase in winter precipitation observed during some of the years in the decade in the himalaya mb gradient has been previously used to develop glacier melt models at basin scale racoviteanu et al 2013 and is considered as one of the most important indicators of climate change oerlemans and hoogendoorn 1989 dyurgerov and dwyer 2001 6 2 mass balance and the climatic drivers in order to understand the influence of climate on mass loss of the kg the average annual summer temperatures and winter precipitation at the pahalgam observatory were analysed fig 6 during the 39 year simulation period period i the only period with a positive average decadal mass balance also had the highest inter annual mb variability in the decade the period is characterized by the low average summer temperature 15 11 c and considerable winter precipitation 650 mm the average summer temperature during the period was 0 61 c lower than the average long term summer temperature observed and the average winter precipitation during the period i was 46 mm higher than the long term average during 1980 2019 the highest simulated average mass loss during period iii which corresponds to the years between 2000 and 2010 is corroborated by the higher observed summer temperatures and lower winter precipitation compared to the long term observed averages the period is characterised by the higher average summer temperature of 0 41 c and the lower winter precipitation of 64 mm than the long term averages the average summer temperature during the simulation periods ii and iv are 15 71 c and 15 89 c respectively which are similar to the long term average summer temperature 15 72 c of the simulated period table 3 the winter precipitation during period ii 620 mm is marginally higher by 16 mm than the long term average 604 mm while the winter precipitation during period iv 610 mm is almost similar to the long term average of 1980 2019 the marginally higher simulated mass loss during the period iv compared to the period ii is explained by the marginally higher temperature and lower winter precipitation observed during period iv the average mass loss of 0 92 0 42 m w e simulated for the 2014 19 period is closer to the average glaciological mass loss of the glacier during the same 5 year period 0 83 0 34 m w e with an average rmse of 0 91 furthermore the simulated 1 17 0 42 m w e and geodetic 0 90 0 09 m w e mb during 2000 2014 agrees well within the error limits rashid et al 2017 observed higher glacier area loss of 8 65 from 2000 to 2010 and snout recession of 22 2 m a 1 from 2000 to 2006 for the kg corroborating the higher simulated mass loss of the glacier found between 2000 and 2010 they also found a smaller glacier area recession of 2 84 during 1962 1992 which corresponds with the lowest mass loss predicted between 1981 and 1990 as was found in this study azam et al 2014 also found that the chotta shigri glacier in the western himalaya had positive mass balance for several years during 1980s 6 3 mass balance and glacier melt streamflow the streamflow data from 1980 to 2019 showed a significantly decreasing trend at a 0 05 the streamflow and mb data during the period showed a good correlation which was particularly prominent during the autumn season when the glacier melt is the dominant contribution to the lidder streamflow marazi and romshoo 2018 it is important to note that though the spatio temporal changes in the streamflow are a function of multiple factors including the changes in precipitation temperature and cryosphere burn and elnur 2002 however in the glaciated himalayan basins glacier melt is reported to be the dominant contributor to streamflow especially during summer and autumn seasons lutz et al 2016 which is quite evident from the results of this study depicted in fig 8 the melting glaciers are initially supposed to increase streamflow considerably for a short period of time followed by a decline in the streamflow as the glacier melting reaches the tipping point thayyen and gergan 2010 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014b marazi and romshoo 2018 romshoo and marazi 2022 considerable increase in the streamflow attributed to the enhanced glacier melting was also reported in the study area from 1971 to 1995 marazi and romshoo 2018 thereafter during 1996 2012 the observed decline in streamflow despite increase in the precipitation has been attributed to reduced contribution of the glacier melt to the streamflow because of the reduced ice mass in the basin marazi and romshoo 2018 furthermore previous studies romshoo et al 2015 marazi and romshoo 2018 romshoo and marazi 2022 suggest that the tipping point in the lidder stream has already reached in mid 1990 s wherefrom the streamflow kept declining because of the reduction in the glacier melt contribution under changing climate the projected climate ending 21st century under the plausible climate change scenario romshoo et al 2020b would exacerbate glacier mass loss in the future which would further reduce the streamflow with serious implications on the transboundary water availability and regional hydrological regime in the uib the observed and long term reconstructed mb reported in the present study shall fill the knowledge gaps and help in addressing some key issues in the uib given the dependence of people particularly the mountain communities on glacier melt for domestic and agriculture purposes nüsser et al 2019 orr et al 2022 the present study forms an important baseline for devising water resource management and adaptation strategies as a result of the shrinking cryosphere and the consequent declining streamflow under changing climate furthermore because glaciers form the headwaters of the transboundary rivers the current study will guide the present and future water sharing mechanisms in the basin affected by climate change in order to ensure the region s geopolitical and socioeconomic stability orr et al 2022 furthermore the findings of the present study will facilitate the understanding of the changing hydrological processes yang et al 2014 ma et al 2020 ma and zhang 2022 and associated hazards ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 over the asian water tower in general and over the uib in particular 6 4 comparison with other studies in the himalaya the study reports direct glaciological mass balance measurements from kashmir himalaya after a long gap since 1985 the simulated mb of 1 02 0 42 from 2003 to 2008 is consistent with the average geodetic mb estimates of 0 90 0 09 m w e a 1 for the kashmir valley during the same time period reported by kääb et al 2012 the geodetic mass balance of the kg is however relatively higher than the glacier thinning reported over a few of the glaciers in the nanga parbat region of the uib nüsser and schmidt 2021 except for the hamta glacier the kg has had higher mass losses than most of the glaciers studied in the western himalaya table 4 only three glaciers in the kashmir valley have had direct mass balance measurements in contrast to the simulated mass gain of 0 19 0 42 m w e a 1 during the same year the kolahoi and shishram glaciers reported observed annual mass losses of 0 27 m w e and 0 29 m w e respectively during the hydrological year 1983 84 which was nevertheless questioned by azam et al 2018 the neh nar is the only glacier in the kashmir himalaya with the direct mb measurement from 1975 to 1984 with a mean mass loss of 0 43 m w e a 1 gsi 2001 the simulated mb measurements of the kg kolahoi 0 42 0 42 m w e and the observed mb of the neh nar glacier 0 34 m w e during 1980 and 1984 situated in the similar topographic and climatic setting are in good agreement the glaciological geodetic and simulated mass losses of the kg are well corroborated by several geodetic mass loss studies conducted over the kashmir himalaya recently kääb et al 2015 gardelle et al 2013 brun et al 2019 the higher mass losses simulated since 2000 agrees with bolch et al 2012 findings the area and snout changes reported for various glaciers by various researchers in the region murtaza and romshoo 2017 marazi and romshoo 2018 rashid et al 2017 nüsser and schmidt 2021 corroborate with the mass loss of the kg found in this study 6 5 mass balance sensitivity to temperature and precipitation sensitivity of the simulated mb to temperature changes was found to be 0 65 m w e a 1 c 1 which is slightly higher than that of the chotta shigri glacier 0 52 m w e a 1 c 1 in the western himalaya azam et al 2014 and also that of the zhadang glacier 0 47 m w e a 1 c 1 in the tibetan plateau mölg et al 2012 sensitivity of the kg to temperature is highest 1 0 m w e a 1 c 1 near the snout at an altitude of 3600 m asl with the increasing altitude the sensitivity decreases until it reaches its lowest point 0 40 m w e a 1 c 1 at 5000 m asl fig 9 the observations support the theory that glacier ablation is predominantly controlled by air temperature meaning that the mb in the melt dominated lower ablation zone is more susceptible to temperature increase the mb sensitivity of 0 63 w e a 1 c 1 for the kg at ela 4413 m asl is comparable to the sensitivity of 0 52 m w e a 1 c 1 at ela 2900 for the glaciers in the french alps vincent 2002 and slightly lower than the sensitivity of 0 73 w e a 1 c 1 observed for chotta shigri glacier at the ela 4900 m asl azam et al 2014 the glacier mb showed a sensitivity of 0 13 m w e a 1 in response to 10 increase in precipitation which is comparable with 0 16 m w e a 1 sensitivity of the chotta shigri glacier mb azam et al 2014 and also that of the zhadang glacier having a sensitivity of 0 14 m w e a 1 mölg et al 2012 furthermore the model was run iteratively varying the precipitation amount only to determine the amount of precipitation required to offset the effect of 1 c temperature shift on mb of the kg the analyses showed that to counteract the effect of 1 c temperature rise on glacier melting a 48 increase in precipitation is necessary the findings are for the most part consistent with the findings of other studies braithwaite et al 2002 braithwaite and raper 2007 azam et al 2014 according to these studies a 30 40 increase in precipitation is required to offset the effects of a 1 c rise in temperature 7 conclusions the glaciological 2014 2019 geodetic 2000 2014 and reconstructed mass balances 1980 2019 for the kg located in the uib were reported after a long gap of about 35 years for any glacier in the kashmir himalaya the three approaches employed for mb estimations of the kg were found to be in good agreement with each other during the simulation period the kg lost an average of 0 91 0 42 m w e a 1 of its mass which is higher than most of the western himalayan glaciers evaluated for mb during the same period 1980 2019 the simulated mb data showed four distinct melt periods as well as a clear link with summer temperature and winter precipitation the mb has remained negative throughout the simulation period with the exception of a few years between 1980 and 1990 the glacier suffered the greatest mass loss of 1 18 0 42 m w e a 1 between 2000 and 2010 while the lowest mass loss of 0 27 0 42 m w e a 1 occurred between 1980 and 1990 according to the sensitivity analysis of mb to temperature and precipitation a 48 increase in precipitation is required to offset the effect of a 1 c increase in temperature on the glacier mb the study also demonstrated a good correspondence between streamflow and glacier mass balance particularly during the autumn season when the contribution of glacier melt to streamflow is considered to be more dominant given the projected climate change across the kashmir himalayan region glacier mass loss could enhance with serious implications for regional water availability hydrological regimes and transboundary sharing of waters emanating from the region particularly during the lean period when glacier melt dominates the streamflow given the melting of glaciers due to climate change the glacier melt contribution to streamflow in the indus basin will further diminish in the future this will have an impact on the hydrograph especially during summer and autumn seasons in particular food energy and water security as well as the dependent livelihoods in the lower indus basin will be significantly impacted by the melting of glaciers changes in the hydrograph and overall reduction of streamflow this study in the data scarce himalaya would form a valuable dataset for understanding glacier climate interactions and the implications of shrinking cryosphere on local and regional hydrology and thus informing water resource management and planning strategies under changing climate in the upper indus basin the waters of which are shared between the neighbouring countries under the indus water

2384,knowledge of glacier mass balance mb is critical for understanding glacier climate interactions and projecting future water availability in the data scarce himalayan region in this study we present the glaciological 2014 2019 geodetic 2000 2014 and reconstructed 1980 2019 mb of the kolahoi glacier kg in the kashmir himalaya india during the five year observation period the average in situ mb of the glacier was 0 83 0 34 m w e a 1 with significant inter annual variation the mean annual geodetic mb of the kg between 2000 and 2014 was 0 90 0 09 m w e the reconstructed mb revealed four distinct glacier recession episodes since 1980 the period i 1980 1990 showed a reduced mass loss of 0 27 0 42 m w e a 1 with four years of positive mass balance the period ii 2000 2010 on the other hand experienced the highest mass loss of 1 18 m w e a 1 throughout the entire reconstructed mb series all three mb measurement in situ geodetic and simulated agreed well the mb showed an excellent correspondence with the observed temperature and precipitation analysis of the data revealed that the mb is sensitive to temperature at the rate of 0 65 m w e a 1 c 1 but the sensitivity is only 0 13 m w e a 1 for a 10 change in precipitation furthermore there is a good correlation between the simulated glacier mass loss and depleting glacier melt in the autumn streamflow the mass loss of the kg is expected to exacerbate in future as a result of the projected climate change and thus further diminishing the streamflow of the transboundary rivers emanating from the region it is envisaged that the findings will contribute to a better understanding of glacier climate interactions and their implications for future water availability in the kashmir himalaya keywords

despite the huge human dependence the polices and water managements practices and strategies in the region are ineffective and are largely focused on increasing the water supply irrespective of the financial social or environmental implications orr et al 2022 this has resulted in the uib being particularly vulnerable to water stress which is likely to worsen in the future nüsser et al 2019

generate knowledge about the behaviour of the himalayan glaciers under changing climate particularly after the publication of the unfounded claims of glacier disappearance solomon et al 2007 cogley

schmidt 2021 glacier studies were initiated in the himalayan region despite the crucial role of the himalayan glaciers for future water availability sea level rise regional climate and hazards associated with the melting of glaciers the field based glaciological studies are few and far between dyurgerov and meier 2005 owing to the remoteness rugged terrain and security concerns of the region bolch et al 2012 inconsistent reports on the status and behaviour of glaciers in the himalaya reflect insufficient information knowledge gaps and ambiguity cruz et al 2007 cogley et al 2010 rashid and abdullah 2016 only 15 of the 32 392 glaciers in the indian himalaya sac 2010 have been investigated using in situ glacier mass balance mb measurements and majority of these observations are limited to a few years between 1975 and 1990 singh et al 2018 vincent et al 2013 chhota shigri is the only glacier in the indian himalaya that has been studied for mass balance for more than a decade wagnon et al 2007 azam et al 2012 singh et al 2018 although jammu kashmir and ladakh himalaya have 15 000 glaciers abdullah et al 2020 in situ mass balance data of only 6 glaciers are available 4 in the kashmir himalaya one in the zanskar range gsi 2001 kaul 1986 romshoo et al 2022b sangewar and siddique 2006 srivastava 2001 and one in ladakh mountain range soheb et al 2020 these observations however are brief 1 year mass balance for the kolahoi and shishram 9 years for the nehnar glacier in the kashmir himalaya 2 years for the rulung in the zanskar and 5 years for stok glacier in the ladakh mountain range in light of various constraints for undertaking glaciological mb geodetic mb has emerged as a suitable alternative approach to assess glacier mass balance changes and there has been significant increase in the publications reporting geodetically derived glacier mass balances at local and regional scales in the entire hindu kush himalayan hkh region kääb et al 2015 brun et al 2019 muhammad et al 2019b however the intra annual variability of mass balance is not captured in geodetic mb estimates which are often carried out between long time gaps because of the lack of the appropriate elevation data given the limited time series of glaciological mass balances and data constraints for geodetic mb measurements it is necessary to use models to simulate long term mass balance budget of the himalayan glaciers duly validated with observations to better understand glacier response to changing climate and to assess the impacts of climate change on glacier dynamics and health melt models are widely employed for mb reconstruction and are broadly classified into two types temperature index models johannesson et al 1995 hock 2003 and energy balance models hock and holmgren 2005 mölg et al 2012 energy balance models require a large set of meteorological observations at glacier site hock et al 2007 the availability of which is a major challenge in the hkh the temperature index models on the other hand have a simple structure hock 2003 furthermore because temperature data which is usually the only input parameter required is readily available the approach has been widely employed in a variety of studies in the mountainous regions with a few improvements and modifications here and there carenzo et al 2016 finsterwalder and schunk 1887 pellicciotti et al 2005 tobin et al 2013 vincent and six 2013 wmo 1986 the use of temperature index model in the current study is further justified by the fact that the kolahoi glacier kg is similar to the mid latitude glaciers with ablation and accumulation restricted to summer and winter respectively sicart et al 2008 the mass balance gradient of the kg is similar to that of the alps glaciers where the temperature index model for mass balance reconstruction has usually performed very well wagnon et al 2007 the goal of the current study is therefore to gain a better understanding of the recent long term mass balance of the kg using direct geodetic and reconstructed mb approaches the direct mass balance measurements on such glaciers in the data scarce kashmir himalaya are of great importance for cryospheric and hydrological process understanding and modelling since the streamflow in the region is significantly influenced by glacier melt and the fact that the indicators of climate change indicators are very evident in the region mukhopadhyay and khan 2014a zaz et al 2019 muhammad et al 2019b it is therefore imperative to generate knowledge about the behaviour and health of glaciers to inform strategies for the sustainable management of the diminishing transboundary water resources in the himalayan region 2 study area the jammu and kashmir himalaya hosts some of the largest and most magnificent glaciers in the hkh region abdullah et al 2020 the kg the largest glacier in the kashmir valley s jhelum basin one of the five major tributaries of the indus river has an area of 11 km2 rashid et al 2017 and is situated between 34 07 to 34 12 n latitude and 75 16 to 75 23 e longitude fig 1 the glacier altitude ranges from 3600 to 5020 m asl with mainly northwest orientation meltwaters from the kg emerge as the west liddar river which joins the east lidder river originating from the sheshram glacier at pahalgam 35 km from the present snout before draining into the centrally flowing jhelum river downstream a small fraction 0 54 km2 of the kg is covered by supra glacial debris cover the equilibrium line altitude ela of the kg glacier settled around 4400 m asl corresponding to accumulation area ratio aar of 0 57 during 2014 2019 based on the satellite and field observations the kg has witnessed deglaciation 25 18 1 29 during 1992 2020 with the highest recession 13 66 observed during the 2000 2010 the lidder valley has a mediterranean climate with four distinct seasons winter december to february spring march to may summer june to august and autumn from september to november khattak et al 2011 the lidder valley receives most of its precipitation in the form of snow during winter and early spring marazi and romshoo 2018 as of 2018 glaciers covered around 33 5 2 0 km2 of the lidder valley corresponding to 2 7 of the total basin area romshoo et al 2020a and are sustained by snowfall received during the winter months dar and romshoo 2012 at the pahalagam observatory the mean annual precipitation is 1240 mm and the mean temperature varies from 19 c in july to 1 7 c in january marazi and romshoo 2018 fig 2 depicts the mean monthly temperature and precipitation at pahalgam from 1980 and 2019 3 data sets 3 1 mass balance data the previous mb measurement of the kg is available only for the year 1983 84 kaul 1986 the in situ mass balance monitoring of the glacier was re established by the centre of excellence for glacial studies university of kashmir in 2014 and the measurements are conducted annually since then at the end of the ablation season which typically ends in september or early october the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of february 2000 version 4 and high mountain asia hma dems october 2014 were used for estimating geodetic mass balance of the kg shean et al 2020 3 2 hydro meteorological data the nearest meteorological observatory situated at phalagam has a record of meteorological data from 1980 and is located 35 km downstream of the kg daily temperature minimum and maximum and precipitation data from 1980 to 2019 was used to reconstruct the glacier mb the air temperature both minimum and maximum are recorded on daily basis using traditional thermometers the daily mean temperature is computed by averaging the mean maximum and minimum temperatures for the day the temperature record is nearly complete with a few small data gaps which were filled using the data from the two preceding and following observations of the missing data using linear interpolation approach azam et al 2014 the daily precipitation data is collected using the tipping bucket rain gauge the precipitation data gaps 2 were filled up by utilizing the average precipitation from the preceding and succeeding year of the missing date azam et al 2014 we also analysed the streamflow data 1980 2019 of the lidder stream at the botkote pahalgam station which originates from the kg and flows through pahalgam town the streamflow data is collected only 3 4 times a month by the department of flood and irrigation department govt of jammu and kashmir since the contribution of the glacier melt is thought to be more pronounced during autumn when practically all of the seasonal snow has melted bookhagen and burbank 2010 dar et al 2014 we analysed discharge data of the autumn season only from 1980 to 2019 to establish a link between the depleting streamflow and glacier mass balance 4 methods 4 1 glaciological mass balance during the first glacier field expedition to the kg in september 2014 undertaken to set up glaciological mass balance measurements 10 bamboo stakes were drilled more than 3 m deep into the ice for ablation measurements fig 3 a b using the heucke steam drill heucke 1999 the stakes were only emplaced on the west flank of the glacier as the access to the eastern flank is limited due to the steep slope and large crevasses since 2014 the stake network has been improved year after year to better capture the glacier ablation and accumulation the number of stakes for ablation measurements was increased to 19 in 2015 fig 1 as and when the stakes are displaced or melt out of the ice for whatever reasons they were replaced at the original locations on yearly basis ice density value of 900 kg m 3 was used to convert the ablation measurements at the stake positions into water equivalent wagnon et al 2007 to account for the snow accumulation at least two snow pits were dug in the accumulation zone deep up to the previous yeaŕs summer horizon each year during the observation period fig 3c a number of snow probe measurements were made annually along the observeŕs path to the snow pits to augment the snow accumulation measurements from the two snow pits to ensure a good sample more than five snow probe measurements were taken around each probe position to arrive at the average measurement fig 3d the snow probes were increased from 5 in 2015 to 8 in the following years the mass balance observation dates vary slightly from year to year and could not be fixed to the same date every year owing to limited access security and other logistical constraints the profile approach was used to extrapolate the mass balance from individual stakes to glacier wide mass balance b assuming that the local mass balance values vary only as a function of glacier elevation f z escher vetter et al 2009 1 b i 0 n f z i a z i a glacier the mass balance was analysed for 50 m elevation bands zi with glacier area a and n being the number of elevation bands the profile method is advantageous as it can be applied to any glacier where area altitude and local mass balance measurements are available however sometimes local snow redistribution may require application of more sophisticated function type to estimate glacier mass balance as a function of altitude escher vetter et al 2009 4 2 geodetic mass balance the hma dem shean 2017 and srtm dem rankl and braun 2016 both with date specific information provide an excellent opportunity to assess glacier mass changes over the topographically challenging and data scarce himalayan region neckel et al 2014 between 2000 and 2014 changes in the glacier surface altitude dh dt were measured by differencing the hma and srtm dems to compute changes in glacier volume δv shean 2017 the geodetic mass balance bgeo was calculated by multiplying the glacier volume change δv by glacier density ρ as follows 2 b geo δ v ρ the ice density of 850 60 kg m 3 was used to convert volume estimates into mass balance huss 2013 the density value used in this research accommodates for the varied densities of ice firn and snow the appropriate correction for radar ice penetration was made for srtm dem prior to using the data for estimating ice thickness changes mukherjee et al 2018 furthermore since the participating dems have different spatial resolutions therefore the hma dem with 8 m resolution was resampled to match with the 30 m srtm dem resolution using the kriging interpolation algorithm in the arcgis environment lv et al 2020 4 3 mass balance reconstruction a temperature index model temperature index models relate ice melt with positive temperatures and despite their simplicity they usually perform well in comparison to the data intensive and complex energy balance models braithwaite and olesen 1989 wmo 1986 the amount of melt ablation m is computed as a function of positive air temperatures and a proportionality factor known as degree day factor ddf as follows ddf ice s n o w d e b r i s t t t m 0 t t m where ddf is expressed as mm d 1 c 1 and varies for ice snow and debris covered surfaces t is the daily extrapolated temperatures c at the glacier altitudes and tm represents the critical temperature for melt the accumulation a on the glacier surface is estimated using the following equation 4 a p t t p 0 t t p where p is the daily precipitation extrapolated to the glacier altitudes tp is the threshold temperature to determine the form of precipitation rain or snow the annual mass balance was computed by adding up ablation and accumulation at 50 m elevation bands for the whole hydrological year starting from 1st of october to 30th of september the following year the ddfs used depend upon the state of the glacier surface viz snow clean and debris cover table 1 the mass gain due to the liquid precipitation and refreezing of meltwater is not accounted for in this study because its contribution is assumed to be negligible for temperate glaciers braithwaite and zhang 2000 b model parameter analysis table 1 lists the model parameters that were used in this study due to the scarcity of hydro meteorological observations in the indian himalayan in general and the kashmir himalaya in particular romshoo et al 2020b a simple yet robust model requiring a minimum number of input parameters sicart et al 2008 was used to reconstruct the glacier mass balance since 1980 the model parameters were calculated at the glacier site and also selected from the literature or adjusted as per the model output azam et al 2014 the ddfs for snow ice and debris were calculated using field based melt measurements and temperature data a range of threshold temperatures for melt and snow rain are reported in the literature and their variability has little effect on glacier mass balance azam et al 2014 the monthly temperature lapse rates reported by romshoo et al 2018 for the study area were used to extrapolate the daily temperatures to the glacier altitudes the altitudinal precipitation gradient was the only adjusted parameter used in the model due to the lack of the observation data c temperature lapse rates in view of the scanty hydro meteorological observational network in the mountainous terrains including the himalaya researchers have used the standard temperature lapse rate stlr to model various hydrological meteorological and glaciological processes adnan et al 2017 dar and romshoo 2012 romshoo et al 2015 many studies have reported variations in temperature lapse rate tlr in both space altitudinal and time panday et al 2014 winiger et al 2005 romshoo et al 2018 based on the observed and satellite derived temperatures reported the space time variations in tlrs across different altitudinal ranges over the study region to simulate mass balance temperature index models usually use a single tlr for the entire hydrological year johannesson et al 1995 vincent 2002 however for simulating kg s mb we employed several tlrs for the hydrological year provided by romshoo et al 2018 to accurately represent the temporal and altitudinal variability of temperature d precipitation gradient precipitation has a substantially steeper vertical gradient than temperature making it more difficult to estimate particularly in the data deficient mountainous regions immerzeel et al 2012 jiang et al 2022 as a result the precipitation gradient value was therefore selected from the literature and adjusted till the modelled mass balance best represents the observed mass balance of the glacier we started with the precipitation gradient of 0 2 m km 1 that considerably overestimated the mb wulf et al 2010 the mb was recalculated iteratively by reducing the precipitation gradient by 0 01 m km 1 until the least rmse was achieved between the in situ and modelled mb the precipitation gradient of 0 11 m km 1 so obtained was in good accord with the precipitation gradients recorded in the other himalayan regions azam et al 2014 wulf et al 2010 winiger et al 2005 considering that precipitation increases linearly with altitude immerzeel et al 2012 the precipitation at the glacier altitudes was estimated using the precipitation gradient from the pahalgam meteorological observatory e degree day factors degree day factors ddf for ice snow and debris on the kg site during the 2015 2018 period were computed using the melt measurements at several stakes positioned at different glacier altitudes the ddfs were computed using the following mathematical formulation 5 i 1 n m d d f t d t the eq 5 relates the melt m in mm with positive temperatures t c during a period of n time intervals the ddf is represented in mm d 1 c 1 generally computed using temperatures integrated over daily time intervals however positive temperatures integrated over monthly time scales were also used to compute ddfs hock 2003 the melt measurements were recorded for time intervals lasting between a few days to over a week to minimize the uncertainty days with substantial amount of snowfall were excluded from analysis azam et al 2014 the stake data with ablation 150 mm w e was not considered for ddf estimation due to the uncertainty of 150 mm w e in the observed stake melt measurements which is attributed to the uncertainty in snow ice density snow water equivalent and stake measurements thibert et al 2008 the ddfs thus obtained for snow ice and debris surfaces are comparable to those obtained for glaciers in the other himalayan regions and elsewhere singh et al 2000 4 4 model calibration the in situ mass balance measurements of the kg conducted from 2014 to 15 to 2018 19 were used to calibrate the mass balance model the model was run iteratively till the modelled mass balance best matched the field observations the ddf monthly tlrs threshold temperature values tp 1 c and tm 0 c precipitation gradient annual observed mass balance 2014 2019 and geodetic mass balance 2000 2014 were used for the model calibration process 4 5 sensitivity analysis in several climate change impact studies sensitivity of glacier mass balance to climatic variability assessed employing temperature index models has been commonly used as a climate proxy solomon et al 2007 shea et al 2009 wu et al 2011 the sensitivity analysis of the kg mass balance to climate was carried out by simulating the annual glacier mass balance of the glacier during 1980 2019 assuming 1 c change in the temperature and 10 change in the precipitation during the simulation period glacier mb sensitivity to temperature dmb dt and precipitation dmb dp was calculated after oerlemans et al 1998 as follows 6 dmb dt m b 1 c m b 1 c 2 m b 1 c m b 0 c 7 dmb dp m b p 10 m b p 10 2 m b 10 m b p 4 6 uncertainty analysis variations of stake length anchored into ablation zone and snow pits dug up to the summer horizon in the accumulation zone during a hydrological year are used to calculate glacier mass balance the common errors in point stake measurements are essentially caused by human error in stake height measurements tilted stakes floating stakes and insufficient representativeness of stakes in a given elevation band thibert et al 2008 annual ablation measurements at similar locations and altitudes revealed a difference ranging from 0 02 to 0 19 m w e and this was considered as the stake representative error σstake in this study and used to estimate the ablation error σab angchuk et al 2021 to estimate the stake representativeness and the ablation error estimates we specifically installed ablation stakes at similar locations in the same elevation bands except the small debris covered area to account for the uncertainty in the accumulation measurements σacc we followed kenzhebaev et al 2017 who used three different approaches including using a single constant accumulation value for all the glacier elevation bands in the accumulation zone a linear gradient in accumulation values and inverse gradient of the highest two elevation bands of the accumulation zone to account for the uncertainty in annual accumulation the standard deviation of the accumulation measurement was interpreted as the uncertainty associated with accumulation measurements kenzhebaev et al 2017 we derived annual glacier wide mass balance uncertainty σba of 0 34 m w e a 1 for the kg based on the accumulation and ablation uncertainties as follows 8 σ ba σ a b 2 σ a c 2 the uncertainty in the in situ mb data used for model calibration as well as the uncertainty associated with the model formulation are the primary causes of errors in the modelled mb kronenberg et al 2016 kenzhebaev et al 2017 we compared the simulated mb from 2014 to 2019 with the field observed mb from the same time to estimate the average annual mb error associated with the model which was estimated to be 0 08 m w e in absence of any observed mb data for the kg prior to 2014 the estimated error was considered to be valid for the entire simulation period 1980 2019 the simulated mb estimates was therefore found to have a cumulative uncertainty of 0 42 m w e sum of the in situ and model uncertainty the commonly used normalized median absolute deviation nmad approach was employed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the elevation difference estimates höhle and höhle 2009 neelmeijer et al 2017 brun et al 2019 the impact of outliers is significantly minimised in this approach which is determined as below 9 nmad 1 4826 m e d i a n δ h j m δ h where δhj and mδh denotes the individual elevation changes and median of all the δhj respectively 5 results 5 1 observed mass balance table 2 shows the annual glaciological mb data of the kg between 2014 and 15 to 2018 19 hydrological years which is negative for the entire 5 year observation period and varied considerably from the lowest of 0 14 0 34 m w e in 2014 15 based on 10 stakes to the highest of 1 53 0 34 m w e in 2016 17 based on 19 stakes for the rest of the observation period the annual mb ranged from 0 31 0 34 m w e to 1 23 0 34 m w e table 2 based on the 5 year mb data the mean annual observed mb of the kg is 0 84 0 34 m w e with considerable inter annual and altitudinal variability largely is response to the variability in meteorological parameters observed during the period the highest mass loss was observed in 2016 17 and is largely controlled by the highest average summer temperature and the lowest winter precipitation of 16 27 c and 0 55 m respectively contrary the mean summer temperature of 15 c and the winter precipitation of 0 9 m observed in the year 2014 15 is responsible for the lowest mass loss of 0 14 0 34 m w e observed during the year as shown in fig 4 mb of the kg varies linearly with glacier altitude with higher mass loss observed at lower altitudes however the horizontal variations in point mass balance measurements is not very considerable except at the lowest elevation zone where a difference of around 0 44 m w e was observed between two stakes anchored in the debris covered and clean part of the glacier in the same elevation band it is noteworthy that only a small fraction of the kg fig 4f is debris covered 0 54 km2 which contributes marginally to the overall mb budget of the glacier the mean vertical mb gradient of the kg varies from 0 7 m w e 100 m 1 in 2018 19 to 0 8 m w e 100 m 1 in 2014 15 with a mean gradient of 0 76 m w e 100 m 1 during the five year observation period excluding the debris covered portion of the glacier 5 2 geodetic mass balance the dem differencing analysis of the kg indicated a mean annual mb of 0 90 0 09 m w e estimated between 2000 and 2014 which is consistent with the glaciological mb of 0 83 0 34 m w e though it belongs to the 2014 2019 period however the agreement with the simulated average mb of 1 29 0 42 m w e of the glacier for the same time period is not as good but both are comparable furthermore the linear relationship of the observed mb was also corroborated from the geodetic mb measurements for the kg with higher mass loss of around 3 6 m w e a 1 observed in the lower ablation zone of the glacier supplementary fig s1 owing to the steeper slope the resultant higher mass turn near the ice fall on the eastern flank of the glacier is well captured by the geodetic mb however the difference in the melt rates of the clean and debris covered parts of the glacier were not well captured by the geodetic mb probably due to the fact that only a small part of the glacier is debris covered 5 3 simulated mass balance the reconstructed annual mb of the glacier from 1980 to 2019 varied from 0 66 0 42 m w e to 2 18 0 42 m w e with a standard deviation of 0 73 m w e fig 5 the annual mb of the kg was negative for the most part of the simulated period 87 of the time except during the four hydrological years of 1982 83 1983 84 1987 88 and 1989 90 which showed a positive mb of 0 004 0 42 0 19 0 42 0 66 0 42 and 0 37 0 42 m w e respectively during rest of the reconstructed period the mass balances were negative fig 5 it is pertinent to mention that the simulated average mb of the glacier during 2014 2019 0 92 0 42 m w e which corresponds to the direct field observations is very close to the mean annual glaciological mb of 0 83 0 34 m w e which is however to be expected given that the mb data from this period was used for the model calibration the simulated mb for the hydrological year 1983 84 0 19 0 34 m w e a 1 is much higher than the mb reported by kaul 1986 0 27 m w e a 1 it is important to report that azam et al 2018 questioned the mb of the glacier by kaul 1986 due to the lack of detailed information about mb measurement approach over all the kg has lost ice mass at rate of 0 95 0 42 m w e a 1 over the entire simulated period 1980 2019 the reconstructed annual mb showed a wide range from 0 66 0 42 m w e to 2 18 0 42 m w e analysis of the 39 year reconstructed kg mb series revealed that four distinct periods of mb each lasting around a decade are distinguished from the analysis of the data provided in fig 6 the period i 1981 1990 is the only timeframe with four years of positive mb of 0 004 0 42 0 19 0 42 0 66 0 42 and 0 37 0 42 m w e during the hydrological years of 1982 83 1983 84 1987 88 and 1989 90 respectively as a result the glacier has had the least average mass loss during the decade 0 27 0 42 m w e a 1 during the period ii from 1990 to 2000 and period iv from 2000 to 2019 the glacier lost mass at the average rate of 1 01 0 42 m w e a 1 and 1 13 0 42 m w e a 1 respectively during the period iii from 2000 to 2010 the kg showed the highest average mass loss of 1 18 0 42 m w e a 1 5 4 model validation the observed and simulated mass balance estimates showed a very good agreement with an average rmse of 0 91 m w e during the hydrological years from 2014 to 15 to 2018 19 fig 7 the agreement is best during the hydrological year 2015 16 rmse of 0 54 m w e and worst during the year 2017 18 rmse of 1 37 m w e the rsme values for the other three years varied from 0 56 to 0 94 m w e fig 7 the model slightly overestimated the mass balances and the discrepancies are more obvious in the ablation zone mostly 4350 m asl 5 5 mass balance and streamflow relationship analysis of the time series streamflow data measured at pahalgam from 1980 to 2019 indicated a significantly decreasing trend at a 0 05 in the autumn streamflow which is entirely contributed by glacier melt marazi and romshoo 2018 the analysis revealed that the average autumn streamflow has reduced from around 2407 cusecs during 1980 1990 to 1752 cusecs between 2010 and 2019 indicating 27 decline the analysis of the reconstructed mb showed around 1 5 times greater glacier mass loss during 2010 2019 compared to that of 1980 1990 period fig 8 the results showed a good correspondence between glacier mass loss and streamflow as depicted in fig 8 an increase in the autumn streamflow was noticeable in response to the enhanced the glacier melt more negative mass balance and vice versa though a similar pattern and correspondence of the annual streamflow and mass balance was quite discernible but the correlation is more prominent during the autumn season overall the autumn streamflow has witnessed a decline of around 27 observed between 1980 and 1990 and 2010 2019 corresponding to mass balance of 0 44 m w e a 1 and 1 12 m we a 1 respectively 6 discussion 6 1 observed and geodetic mass balances both observed and geodetic mb showed higher mass losses at lower altitudes typical of the mountain glaciers owing to the altitudinal variation of meteorological parameters wagnon et al 2007 dobhal et al 2008 which is in line with the previous studies conducted over the himalayan region azam et al 2014 angchuk et al 2021 soheb et al 2020 generally the observed mass balance of the kg is relatively higher than most of the glaciers studied for mb in the western himalaya table 4 and the same is attributed to climatic and topographic conditions rashid et al 2017 similarly the geodetic mb of the kg is also consistent with the average geodetic mb estimate of 0 90 m w e a 1 reported by kääb et al 2012 during 2000 2008 period for various glaciers in the kashmir region it was observed that compared to the clean ice glacier melt at the debris covered part of the glacier was lower by around 0 40 m w e in the same elevation band it is noteworthy that debris covers only a small fraction of the glacier with debris thickness ranging from 1 35 cm excluding large sparsely distributed boulders greater than 1 m in size the efficiency of thick debris in retarding glacier melt has been well documented in the previous studies nicholson and benn 2006 nüsser and schmidt 2021 furthermore the inter annual mass balance variability of the kg is well explained by the changes observed in the summer temperature and winter precipitation over the study area for instance the higher mass loss observed in the hydrological years 2016 17 and 2018 19 is well correlated with the higher summer temperatures and lower winter precipitation observed during these years fig 6 we also analysed the vertical mb gradient which is expected to change in response to climatic variability dyurgerov 2003 oerlemans and hoogendoorn 1989 for instance in warmer climate many glaciers have shown increased accumulation while others have shown increased ablation steepening the mb gradients dyurgerov and dwyer 2001 the observed mb gradients of the kg are similar to those found in other parts of the himalaya wagnon et al 2007 the alps and mid latitude glaciers rabatel et al 2005 zemp et al 2009 shea et al 2015 wagnon et al 2013 but are smaller than those observed in the tropical glaciers kaser 2001 we also analysed the changes in the annual vertical mb gradient of the kg since 1980 however there was no discernible trend in the mb gradient though the mb gradient was slightly more negative by 0 07 m w e 100 m 1 during 1980 90 than during the recent decade 2010 19 this is ascribed to the increase in winter precipitation observed during some of the years in the decade in the himalaya mb gradient has been previously used to develop glacier melt models at basin scale racoviteanu et al 2013 and is considered as one of the most important indicators of climate change oerlemans and hoogendoorn 1989 dyurgerov and dwyer 2001 6 2 mass balance and the climatic drivers in order to understand the influence of climate on mass loss of the kg the average annual summer temperatures and winter precipitation at the pahalgam observatory were analysed fig 6 during the 39 year simulation period period i the only period with a positive average decadal mass balance also had the highest inter annual mb variability in the decade the period is characterized by the low average summer temperature 15 11 c and considerable winter precipitation 650 mm the average summer temperature during the period was 0 61 c lower than the average long term summer temperature observed and the average winter precipitation during the period i was 46 mm higher than the long term average during 1980 2019 the highest simulated average mass loss during period iii which corresponds to the years between 2000 and 2010 is corroborated by the higher observed summer temperatures and lower winter precipitation compared to the long term observed averages the period is characterised by the higher average summer temperature of 0 41 c and the lower winter precipitation of 64 mm than the long term averages the average summer temperature during the simulation periods ii and iv are 15 71 c and 15 89 c respectively which are similar to the long term average summer temperature 15 72 c of the simulated period table 3 the winter precipitation during period ii 620 mm is marginally higher by 16 mm than the long term average 604 mm while the winter precipitation during period iv 610 mm is almost similar to the long term average of 1980 2019 the marginally higher simulated mass loss during the period iv compared to the period ii is explained by the marginally higher temperature and lower winter precipitation observed during period iv the average mass loss of 0 92 0 42 m w e simulated for the 2014 19 period is closer to the average glaciological mass loss of the glacier during the same 5 year period 0 83 0 34 m w e with an average rmse of 0 91 furthermore the simulated 1 17 0 42 m w e and geodetic 0 90 0 09 m w e mb during 2000 2014 agrees well within the error limits rashid et al 2017 observed higher glacier area loss of 8 65 from 2000 to 2010 and snout recession of 22 2 m a 1 from 2000 to 2006 for the kg corroborating the higher simulated mass loss of the glacier found between 2000 and 2010 they also found a smaller glacier area recession of 2 84 during 1962 1992 which corresponds with the lowest mass loss predicted between 1981 and 1990 as was found in this study azam et al 2014 also found that the chotta shigri glacier in the western himalaya had positive mass balance for several years during 1980s 6 3 mass balance and glacier melt streamflow the streamflow data from 1980 to 2019 showed a significantly decreasing trend at a 0 05 the streamflow and mb data during the period showed a good correlation which was particularly prominent during the autumn season when the glacier melt is the dominant contribution to the lidder streamflow marazi and romshoo 2018 it is important to note that though the spatio temporal changes in the streamflow are a function of multiple factors including the changes in precipitation temperature and cryosphere burn and elnur 2002 however in the glaciated himalayan basins glacier melt is reported to be the dominant contributor to streamflow especially during summer and autumn seasons lutz et al 2016 which is quite evident from the results of this study depicted in fig 8 the melting glaciers are initially supposed to increase streamflow considerably for a short period of time followed by a decline in the streamflow as the glacier melting reaches the tipping point thayyen and gergan 2010 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014b marazi and romshoo 2018 romshoo and marazi 2022 considerable increase in the streamflow attributed to the enhanced glacier melting was also reported in the study area from 1971 to 1995 marazi and romshoo 2018 thereafter during 1996 2012 the observed decline in streamflow despite increase in the precipitation has been attributed to reduced contribution of the glacier melt to the streamflow because of the reduced ice mass in the basin marazi and romshoo 2018 furthermore previous studies romshoo et al 2015 marazi and romshoo 2018 romshoo and marazi 2022 suggest that the tipping point in the lidder stream has already reached in mid 1990 s wherefrom the streamflow kept declining because of the reduction in the glacier melt contribution under changing climate the projected climate ending 21st century under the plausible climate change scenario romshoo et al 2020b would exacerbate glacier mass loss in the future which would further reduce the streamflow with serious implications on the transboundary water availability and regional hydrological regime in the uib the observed and long term reconstructed mb reported in the present study shall fill the knowledge gaps and help in addressing some key issues in the uib given the dependence of people particularly the mountain communities on glacier melt for domestic and agriculture purposes nüsser et al 2019 orr et al 2022 the present study forms an important baseline for devising water resource management and adaptation strategies as a result of the shrinking cryosphere and the consequent declining streamflow under changing climate furthermore because glaciers form the headwaters of the transboundary rivers the current study will guide the present and future water sharing mechanisms in the basin affected by climate change in order to ensure the region s geopolitical and socioeconomic stability orr et al 2022 furthermore the findings of the present study will facilitate the understanding of the changing hydrological processes yang et al 2014 ma et al 2020 ma and zhang 2022 and associated hazards ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 over the asian water tower in general and over the uib in particular 6 4 comparison with other studies in the himalaya the study reports direct glaciological mass balance measurements from kashmir himalaya after a long gap since 1985 the simulated mb of 1 02 0 42 from 2003 to 2008 is consistent with the average geodetic mb estimates of 0 90 0 09 m w e a 1 for the kashmir valley during the same time period reported by kääb et al 2012 the geodetic mass balance of the kg is however relatively higher than the glacier thinning reported over a few of the glaciers in the nanga parbat region of the uib nüsser and schmidt 2021 except for the hamta glacier the kg has had higher mass losses than most of the glaciers studied in the western himalaya table 4 only three glaciers in the kashmir valley have had direct mass balance measurements in contrast to the simulated mass gain of 0 19 0 42 m w e a 1 during the same year the kolahoi and shishram glaciers reported observed annual mass losses of 0 27 m w e and 0 29 m w e respectively during the hydrological year 1983 84 which was nevertheless questioned by azam et al 2018 the neh nar is the only glacier in the kashmir himalaya with the direct mb measurement from 1975 to 1984 with a mean mass loss of 0 43 m w e a 1 gsi 2001 the simulated mb measurements of the kg kolahoi 0 42 0 42 m w e and the observed mb of the neh nar glacier 0 34 m w e during 1980 and 1984 situated in the similar topographic and climatic setting are in good agreement the glaciological geodetic and simulated mass losses of the kg are well corroborated by several geodetic mass loss studies conducted over the kashmir himalaya recently kääb et al 2015 gardelle et al 2013 brun et al 2019 the higher mass losses simulated since 2000 agrees with bolch et al 2012 findings the area and snout changes reported for various glaciers by various researchers in the region murtaza and romshoo 2017 marazi and romshoo 2018 rashid et al 2017 nüsser and schmidt 2021 corroborate with the mass loss of the kg found in this study 6 5 mass balance sensitivity to temperature and precipitation sensitivity of the simulated mb to temperature changes was found to be 0 65 m w e a 1 c 1 which is slightly higher than that of the chotta shigri glacier 0 52 m w e a 1 c 1 in the western himalaya azam et al 2014 and also that of the zhadang glacier 0 47 m w e a 1 c 1 in the tibetan plateau mölg et al 2012 sensitivity of the kg to temperature is highest 1 0 m w e a 1 c 1 near the snout at an altitude of 3600 m asl with the increasing altitude the sensitivity decreases until it reaches its lowest point 0 40 m w e a 1 c 1 at 5000 m asl fig 9 the observations support the theory that glacier ablation is predominantly controlled by air temperature meaning that the mb in the melt dominated lower ablation zone is more susceptible to temperature increase the mb sensitivity of 0 63 w e a 1 c 1 for the kg at ela 4413 m asl is comparable to the sensitivity of 0 52 m w e a 1 c 1 at ela 2900 for the glaciers in the french alps vincent 2002 and slightly lower than the sensitivity of 0 73 w e a 1 c 1 observed for chotta shigri glacier at the ela 4900 m asl azam et al 2014 the glacier mb showed a sensitivity of 0 13 m w e a 1 in response to 10 increase in precipitation which is comparable with 0 16 m w e a 1 sensitivity of the chotta shigri glacier mb azam et al 2014 and also that of the zhadang glacier having a sensitivity of 0 14 m w e a 1 mölg et al 2012 furthermore the model was run iteratively varying the precipitation amount only to determine the amount of precipitation required to offset the effect of 1 c temperature shift on mb of the kg the analyses showed that to counteract the effect of 1 c temperature rise on glacier melting a 48 increase in precipitation is necessary the findings are for the most part consistent with the findings of other studies braithwaite et al 2002 braithwaite and raper 2007 azam et al 2014 according to these studies a 30 40 increase in precipitation is required to offset the effects of a 1 c rise in temperature 7 conclusions the glaciological 2014 2019 geodetic 2000 2014 and reconstructed mass balances 1980 2019 for the kg located in the uib were reported after a long gap of about 35 years for any glacier in the kashmir himalaya the three approaches employed for mb estimations of the kg were found to be in good agreement with each other during the simulation period the kg lost an average of 0 91 0 42 m w e a 1 of its mass which is higher than most of the western himalayan glaciers evaluated for mb during the same period 1980 2019 the simulated mb data showed four distinct melt periods as well as a clear link with summer temperature and winter precipitation the mb has remained negative throughout the simulation period with the exception of a few years between 1980 and 1990 the glacier suffered the greatest mass loss of 1 18 0 42 m w e a 1 between 2000 and 2010 while the lowest mass loss of 0 27 0 42 m w e a 1 occurred between 1980 and 1990 according to the sensitivity analysis of mb to temperature and precipitation a 48 increase in precipitation is required to offset the effect of a 1 c increase in temperature on the glacier mb the study also demonstrated a good correspondence between streamflow and glacier mass balance particularly during the autumn season when the contribution of glacier melt to streamflow is considered to be more dominant given the projected climate change across the kashmir himalayan region glacier mass loss could enhance with serious implications for regional water availability hydrological regimes and transboundary sharing of waters emanating from the region particularly during the lean period when glacier melt dominates the streamflow given the melting of glaciers due to climate change the glacier melt contribution to streamflow in the indus basin will further diminish in the future this will have an impact on the hydrograph especially during summer and autumn seasons in particular food energy and water security as well as the dependent livelihoods in the lower indus basin will be significantly impacted by the melting of glaciers changes in the hydrograph and overall reduction of streamflow this study in the data scarce himalaya would form a valuable dataset for understanding glacier climate interactions and the implications of shrinking cryosphere on local and regional hydrology and thus informing water resource management and planning strategies under changing climate in the upper indus basin the waters of which are shared between the neighbouring countries under the indus water
