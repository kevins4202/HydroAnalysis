8145,study region seven climatic regions of china study focus this study compared and assessed the standardized moisture anomaly index szi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and self calibrated palmer drought severity index scpdsi over seven climatic regions of china based on simulations from general circulation models gcm participated in the 6th coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 under climate change then szi was calculated using downscaled and multi model ensemble mme simulations for drought projection and drought characteristics were determined based on szi from 1985 to 2100 new hydrological insights for the region results showed that szi was more robust and performed better in identifying and projecting multi scalar and multi category drought especially in comprehensive drought identification in different climatic regions under global warming the performance of scpdsi in identifying multi category drought decreased with the increase of time scales beyond 12 months the szi series calculated with downscaled and mme simulations showed that most parts of china arid semi arid and semi humid regions were projected to become wetter over the 21st century however drought is expected to be more widespread in southern humid regions of china under a warmer climate in the future the results provide a new choice for future drought projection and valuable information for regional drought mitigation under climate change keywords climate change cmip6 multi category drought drought projection china 1 introduction drought is a recurring and creeping hazard which may occur in nearly all regions and could cause severe consequences for agricultural production ecosystem and socio economy ayantobo and wei 2019 chen et al 2019 cook et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a drought always occurs due to the deficit of precipitation p and is aggravated by higher temperature t and evapotranspiration et than normal conditions leading to a reduction of available water resources huang et al 2017a b vicente serrano et al 2014 yang et al 2017w with climate warming drought occurred frequently in the last few decades feng et al 2019 for example the 2019 severe drought occurred for a half year in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and affected 7 provinces causing economic losses of 15 billion chinese yuan ran et al 2021 therefore it is meaningful to project how drought evolves under climate change which will help develop strategies for managers to mitigate or prevent drought however differences in drought related variables make it difficult to precisely define drought and a single drought index e g the deficit in p may not capture drought in all aspects mishra and singh 2010 thus drought is generally classified into meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts from natural perspectives american meteorological society 2004 recently groundwater ecological and socio economic droughts have also been proposed to assess the impacts of deficit in water resources on the ecological environment and socio economy crausbay et al 2017 mehran et al 2017 to quantify different types of drought numerous drought indicators have been proposed such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 standardized runoff index sri nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 shukla and wood 2008 palmer s drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among those spi sri and ssi are commonly used to track meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought but these drought indices can only depict a single aspect of drought as they consider only one variable representing the water supply of one component in hydrological processes ford and labosier 2017 otkin et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a however drought is associated with multiple variables and is caused by water imbalance thus only one variable is insufficient for depicting different aspects of drought it is therefore important to characterize drought from multiple perspectives considering different hydrological variables spei a multi scalar drought index that measures considering climatic water balance drought conditions based on the differences between p representing water supply and potential evapotranspiration pet representing atmospheric water demand ayantobo and wei 2019 hao and singh 2015b zhang et al 2019a 2019b due to its physical meaning and simple method of calculation multi scalar and multi category features spei has been broadly used for characterizing multi category drought for drought monitoring and projection under climate change ayantobo et al 2017 chen et al 2019 cook et al 2014 guo et al 2018 hao et al 2015a however there are limitations for spei applications in different climatic regions ayantobo and wei 2019 such as 1 et nearly satisfies the water demand in water limited regions where it is counter balanced by p thus using pet representing atmospheric water demand is inappropriate to some extent huang et al 2016 xu et al 2013g yang et al 2006g 2015 2018c 2 spei is a meteorological drought index and may misrepresent other types of drought dai 2011 sheffield et al 2006 unlike the simple water balance represented in spei pdsi adopts a two layer bucket model to quantify the cumulative moisture departure in estimating the surface water energy balance in which surface runoff et and changes in soil moisture sm are used to represent the water balance wells et al 2004 zhang et al 2019b therefore pdsi has been widely used for drought evaluation using observed climate variables chen et al 2019 sheffield et al 2012 and for future drought projection by incorporating simulations of general circulation models gcms cook et al 2014 2015 gizaw and gan 2016 however pdsi has drawbacks including the high sensitivity to the calibration period and temperature variation difficulty in spatial comparability and fixed time scale sheffield et al 2012 some drawbacks have been overcome wells et al 2004 by replacing fixed parameters based on local climatic conditions and proposition of self calibrating pdsi scpdsi which makes pdsi spatially comparable but other drawbacks still exist to overcome the drawback of the fixed time scale in scpdsi liu et al 2017b proposed a new drought index scpdsix by modifying the duration factors of scpdsi to identify drought with different time scales scpdsix exhibits greater stability in identifying short term and long term droughts however it is not simple to calculate scpdsix which makes its application difficult considering the abovementioned drawbacks of pdsi and spei zhang et al 2015 developed a novel drought index named standardized moisture anomaly index szi by incorporating the advantages of spei and pdsi whose performance has been verified on regional zhang et al 2015 national ayantobo and wei 2019 and global scales zhang et al 2019a 2019b for historical drought identification the szi employs a water energy balance model to estimate the aggregate moisture departure and also incorporates a multi scalar feature to monitor drought which makes it describing the multi category and multi scalar droughts better but it has not yet been applied for future drought projections under climate change with the global climate change the severity and frequency of drought would likely increase in many regions based on offline drought indices berg et al 2016 cook et al 2015 2020 dai 2012 dai et al 2018 gizaw and gan 2016 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2020 but contradictory conclusions have been reported based on the direct outputs of gcms cook et al 2020 greve et al 2017 milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2018b therefore it is necessary to compare and evaluate different drought indices in drought projection under climate change in different climatic regions however outputs of gcms remain coarse resolution and biases which prevents their direct use in drought prediction and other research yang et al 2018a it is necessary to downscale and bias correct gcms simulations before application among various downscaling approaches biascorrection and spatial downscaling bcsd method has been verified in downscaling gcms simulations well in china yang et al 2019 recently new simulations from climate models that participated in cmip6 have become available eyring et al 2016 which have more robust and higher resolution simulations for analyzing climate change and its influences on drought cook et al 2020 thus the main objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the szi spei and scpdsi indices for multi category drought projection at different time scales under climate change over seven different climatic regions of china based on the original outputs of cmip6 gcms 2 to analyze the spatio temporal variations of drought characteristics using the drought index that outperforms other indices evaluated in step 1 based on downscaled gcms simulations in seven climatic regions under climate warming 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area due to the complex topography and large expansion china contains a wide range of climate regimes yao et al 2020 zhai et al 2010 zhao 1983 divided mainland china into 7 regions based on climate and topography fig 1 and this division has been widely applied for drought related research ayantobo and wei 2019 yao et al 2018 2020 zhang et al 2021b these 7 regions are northwest desert areas region i inner mongolia steppe region region ii qinghai tibet plateau region iii northeast humid semi humid warm region region ⅳ north china humid semi humid temperate region region ⅴ central and southern china humid subtropical region region ⅵ and south china humid tropical region region ⅶ respectively the precipitation is the smallest 134 mm in region ⅰ and the largest 1600 mm in region ⅶ table 1 2 2 observational and reanalysis data monthly gridded precipitation relative humidity maximum temperature and minimum temperature data were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic of china http data cma cn en these data were generated by thin plate smoothing splines based on over 2400 observation stations from 1961 to date in china with spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the wind and radiation data were derived from era5 monthly averaged data https cds climate copernicus eu with spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and were regrrided into 0 5 0 5 resolution with the bilinear interpolation method these data were used to correct and downscale raw cmip6 simulations 2 3 cmip6 simulations historical and future simulations across china were obtained from 20 cmip6 gcms outputs table 2 for the future period considering the data availability simulations from two ssp scenarios were selected namely ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 which are the most commonly used scenarios that may occur in the future with a potential 1 5 and 2 0 increase in this study climate variables including precipitation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature wind speed surface downwelling longwave flux surface upwelling longwave flux surface downwelling shortwave flux and surface upwelling shortwave flux were downloaded from the cmip6 archives https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 for calculation of scpdsi spei and szi surface soil moisture content total surface runoff and evapotranspiration were also collected for the calculation of ssi sri and standardized water energy index swi liu et al 2017a co2 concentration data were collected from the website of the university of melbourne https greenhousegases science unimelb edu au for the convenience of comparison these variables were interpolated into 1 5 1 5 resolution grid using the bilinear method and averaged into an ensemble dataset 3 methodology 3 1 drought indices the pet calculation is a key step in the calculation of spei scpdsi and szi the penman monteith pm formula considering co2 concentration was used to calculate pet in the current study allen et al 1998 yang et al 2018b 1 p e t 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 μ 2 e s e a δ γ 1 u 2 0 34 2 4 10 4 c o 2 300

was calculated at multiple time scales 1 48 months using monthly differences between p and pet the three parameter log logistic distribution function was used to fit the cumulative probability the scpdsi and szi were estimated from the differences between p and climatically appropriate precipitation p ˆ where p ˆ is calculated based on surface water balance using four actual variables consisting of et runoff ro loss l and recharge r and the corresponding potential variables by dividing soil column into two layers the four potential variables were weighted according to the local climate using weighting factors α β γ δ to express them as p ˆ 3 p ˆ α j p e t β j p r γ j p r o δ j p l j 1 2 3 12 where pr represents potential recharge pro represents potential runoff and pl represents potential moisture loss the moisture departure d was calculated as 4 d p p ˆ then d was used to calculate scpdsi and details of the calculation procedure were based on wells et al 2004 the three parameters log logistic distribution was used for fitting d to obtain szi at different time scales following zhang et al 2019a 5 f x 1 α d γ β 1 where α β and γ are the location parameters then the szi series were calculated with standardized transformation 6 szi φ 1 f x where φ 1 represent inverse gaussian distribution to examine these three drought indices in the projection of different types of drought hydrological agricultural and comprehensive droughts were calculated with p ro sm and the residual water energy ratio wer via sri shukla and wood 2008 ssi aghakouchak 2014 hao et al 2017 and swi liu et al 2017a at 1 48 month scales in 7 climatic regions of china to avoid the spatio temporal inconsistency and statistical incomparability the nonparametric method was used to fit probabilities to calculate sri and ssi farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 generally p correlates t negatively during drought episodes which indicates that the residual energy is generally higher and the residual available water is usually lower under dry conditions ayantobo and wei 2019 liu et al 2017a yin et al 2014g therefore the ratio of p et to pet et was selected as the drought variable and was named wer liu et al 2017a which was defined as 7 w e r p e t p e t e t the indices ssi sri and swi were calculated at different time scales the pearson correlation coefficients r between szi scpdsi and spei and sri ssi and swi were calculated to evaluate the performances of these drought indices in the projection of different types of drought in the 7 climatic regions of china the drought indices used in the current study were listed in table 3 3 2 downscaling and multi model ensemble to quantify the agreement between observational and gcms simulation a skill score taylor 2001 was used to evaluate the performance of gcms in modeling precipitation and temperature the equation of the skill score s score is 8 s 1 r 4 4 s d r 1 s d r 2 where r is the pattern correlation between gcms simulations and observations sdr is the ratio of spatial standard deviation in gcms simulations against observations hirota and takayabu 2013 to correct the bias of original gcm s outputs and to improve their spatial resolution the bcsd method wood et al 2004 was used to downscale gcm simulations based on historical data to reduce the uncertainties of gcm simulations the bayesian model averaging bma was used to combine downscaled data from different gcms and generate multi model ensemble mme simulations the pearson s correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the downscaled and mme results 9 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 10 n s e 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 11 m a e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 3 3 drought identification and characteristics extraction the run theory yevjevich 1967 is a commonly used method for the characterization of drought events liu et al 2017b a drought event is defined as a continuous negative run of index values for at least three consecutive months with the lowest szi less than 1 for each grid according to mckee et al 1993 once a drought event is identified it can be characterized in terms of drought duration drought frequency drought severity etc for more details one can refer to guo et al 2018 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the gcms simulations and the downscaled mme the individual gcms showed varying skills in reproducing precipitation and temperature over china fig 2 ec earth3 and noresm2 mm exhibited better skills in reproducing precipitation with s scores of 0 86 and 0 83 respectively fgoals g3 showed the worst performance in reproducing precipitation with s score of less than 0 2 in terms of temperature cesm2 and noresm2 mm exhibited better skills with s scores of 0 95 and 0 94 respectively likewise fgoals g3 is the worst gcm in reproducing temperature distribution with s score of less than 0 75 generally the s scores for temperature were higher than that for precipitation which indicating that gcms were better and more stable in simulating temperature than precipitation finally according to the s scores of gcms in reproducing precipitation and temperature 10 gcms were selected for further study including access esm 1 5 bcc csm2 mr cesm2 ec earth3 gfdl cm4 hadgem3 gc31 ll miroc6 mpi esm1 2 hr mri esm2 0 and noresm2 mm the performances of the downscaled and mme precipitation and temperature generated by bcsd and bma methods from the 10 selected gcms were evaluated with r nse and mae fig 3 fig 3 shows that the mme exhibits a higher r and nse and lower mae than individual gcms for both precipitation and temperature the r and nse between mme and observational precipitation are higher than 0 80 and 0 60 respectively and the mae is lower than 10 mm the r and nse between mme and observational temperature are higher than 0 97 and the mae is lower than 0 75 in addition the mme has a narrower range of r nse and mae than the individual gcms indicating a better simulation performance and higher stability of the mme fig 4 presents the pet differences and relationships between cmip6 mme and observational meteorological data from 1985 to 2014 generally the differences between these two pet data are relatively low in most regions ranging from 30 to 20 the pet calculated with cmip6 mme data was lower higher than that calculated with observational data in most regions of qinghai tibetan plateau northwest china fig 4a in other regions the differences between these two pet data approximately ranged from 10 to 10 the pet calculated with cmip6 mme data strongly agreed with that calculated with observed meteorological data r2 0 87 slope 1 18 which indicates that the pet data calculated with downscaled and multimodel ensemble cmip6 simulations were reliable enough to use for the calculation of the drought indices 4 2 performances of szi scpdsi and spei in projecting hydrological agricultural and comprehensive droughts 4 2 1 performances of szi scpdsi and spei in terms of runoff generally szi scpdsi and spei were used to monitor meteorological drought so it is meaningful to explore the ability of these indices for identifying other types of drought to better understand the performances of these three drought indices in monitoring and projecting hydrological drought at varying time scales the correlations between the drought index specified by runoff and these three drought indices were examined as shown in fig s1 szi performed better than did scpdsi and spei in identifying hydrological drought in northwestern china region ⅰ at 1 to 48 month scales under both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios the r values for szi sri ranged from 0 33 to 0 41 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario average 0 34 and from 0 32 to 0 49 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario average 0 41 in region ⅰ in regions ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ scpdsi generally performed slightly better than szi and significantly better than spei in identifying hydrological drought the averaged r values for scpdsi sri were 0 39 0 41 and 0 42 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and were 0 54 0 43 0 49 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ which were slightly higher than those for szi sri with averaged r values of 0 36 0 38 and 0 32 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 46 0 31 and 0 27 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ and higher than those for spei sri with averaged r values of 0 06 0 30 and 0 28 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 33 0 05 and 0 09 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ in humid regions regions ⅵ and ⅶ the r values for spei sri with averaged r values of 0 52 and 0 53 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 22 and 0 38 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅵ and ⅶ were higher than those for szi sri with averaged r values of 0 46 and 0 43 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 24 and 0 33 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅵ and ⅶ and scpdsi sri with averaged r values of 0 37 and 0 28 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 16 and 0 17 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅵ and ⅶ the r values for spei sri showed an obvious decreasing trend with the increase of time scales in almost all regions except for region ⅲ the r values for spei sri showed an increasing trend with the increase of wetness index p pet wi at all time scales under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios fig 5 however at longer time scales 12 months the r values for scpdsi sri and szi sri showed a decreasing trend especially under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the discrepancies of correlations between szi sri and spei sri are the lowest at 1 month scale 6 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 11 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario and highest at 48 month scale 71 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 150 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the divergence of correlations between szi sri and spei sri was higher in non humid regions than that in humid regions especially at long term time scales 6 months the divergences between r values for szi sri and scpdsi sri were lower than those for spei sri szi and scpdsi performed better than spei in arid regions and szi and spei outperformed scpdsi in humid regions indicating that szi showed a stable capability in identifying hydrological drought in different climatic regions 4 2 2 performances of szi scpdsi and spei in terms of soil moisture agricultural drought is mainly caused by the shortage of soil moisture which consequently influences crop growth and agricultural production therefore the correlations for ssi szi ssi scpdsi and ssi spei were calculated at different time scales for assessing the performances of different drought indices as shown in fig s2 in arid region ⅰ and humid regions regions ⅵ and ⅶ szi outperformed scpdsi and spei in identifying agricultural drought at 1 to 48 month scales under both climate scenarios in northwestern china region ⅰ the r values between szi and ssi ranged from 0 37 to 0 53 average 0 42 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and ranged from 0 45 to 0 54 average 0 48 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario which were higher than those for scpdsi ssi average 0 29 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 33 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario and spei ssi average 0 10 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 15 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario in central and southern humid regions regions ⅵ and ⅶ the r values for ssi szi scpdsi spei were generally higher than those in arid regions which indicated that these drought indices performed better in humid regions than in arid regions in identifying agricultural drought especially for spei that outperformed scpdsi in humid regions fig 6 shows the trend of r values for ssi szi scpdsi spei with wi the discrepancies of correlation between szi ssi and spei ssi were the lowest at 1 month scale 8 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 26 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario and highest at 48 month scale 45 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 84 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the discrepancies between r values for szi ssi and spei ssi showed a decreasing trend with the increase of wi with the highest in northwestern china region ⅰ and the lowest in southern china region ⅶ at short term time scales 12 months scpdsi better performed than did szi and spei in regions with wi 1 0 at long term time scales 12 months szi always better performed than did scpdsi and spei in different climatic regions in identifying agricultural drought 4 2 3 performances of szi scpdsi and spei in terms of wer the performances of szi scpdsi and spei in identifying comprehensive drought against swi were also examined in seven climatic regions of china the correlations between regionally averaged swi and szi spei and scpdsi at different time scales under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 climate scenarios are shown in fig s3 the correlations between szi and swi were higher than those between scpdsi and swi and between spei and swi in most regions the r values for szi swi ranged from 0 16 0 15 to 0 68 0 68 under the ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 climate scenario which was higher than those between spei and swi between 0 05 and 0 64 under the ssp2 4 5 climate scenario and between 0 12 and 0 40 under the ssp5 8 5 climate scenario and scpdsi swi between 0 11 and 0 53 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and between 0 15 and 0 56 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the discrepancies between correlations for szi swi and spei swi were the highest in northwestern china region ⅰ and the lowest in southern humid regions regions ⅵ and ⅶ fig 7 this indicated spei underperformed szi and scpdsi in identifying comprehensive drought when wi was higher especially over arid and semi arid regions in contrast the discrepancies between the r values for szi swi and scpdsi swi were higher at short term time scales 6 months and decreased slightly with the increase of time scales figs s4 and s5 show the spatial distribution of r values corresponding to figs s3 and 7 the r values for szi swi were generally higher than those for scpdsi swi at different time scales and for spei swi at most regions especially in non humid regions similarly the r values for spei swi showed the highest discrepancy averaged r 0 16 between the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios at non humid regions regions ⅰ ⅴ this indicated that spei performed worse in identifying the comprehensive drought under the higher forcing pathway in contrast szi and scpdsi showed more robust performances in identifying the comprehensive drought under different forcing scenarios overall szi can adequately depict the comprehensive drought at different time scales in different climatic regions under climate change 4 3 comparison with historical drought events to verify the performances of szi in drought monitoring three drought events were selected for comparison including the 2009 2010 southwestern drought the 2013 southern drought and the 2007 northeastern drought the 2009 2010 southwestern drought was the driest drought event that occurred in july 2009 and ended in april 2010 which caused serious economic losses nearly us 30 billion yang et al 2011 the szi monitored that drought center was located in guangxi guizhou and hunan provinces in february 2010 which was consistent with the drought record and related research fig 8 a huang et al 2012 zhang et al 2021a drought that occurred over southern china in 2013 affected several provinces and the huge drought centers were located in guizhou hunan and zhejiang provinces in july 2013 which was accurately monitored by szi fig 8b the result was consistent with soil moisture deficit and precipitation anomaly reported by zhang et al 2021a and yuan et al 2016 in 2007 a severe drought occurred in northeastern china attacking most parts of the heilongjiang province and eastern parts of inner mongolia and reducing crop growth and productivity http www weather com cn drought ghsj 2007 05 442481 shtml the drought event monitored by szi in july 2007 was similar with drought records and heilongjiang province was in the condition of severe drought fig 8c by comparing szi monitored results with three drought events occurred in different regions it was demonstrated that szi was capable of detecting and describing the spatial patterns of drought events 4 4 temporal variations of drought the abovementioned analysis about drought indices indicated that szi was more robust in identifying different categories of drought in different climatic regions of china therefore we selected szi to assess future drought characteristics we downscaled meteorological variables of 10 gcms to the 0 5 0 5 resolution using the bcsd method and then integrated them into the ensemble model using the bma method szi was calculated based on the multimodel ensemble simulations for each pixel across china the temporal variations of szi in seven climatic regions under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios over 1985 2100 are illustrated in fig 9 szi shows a significant increasing trend p 0 01 in regions ⅰ ⅴ fig 9b f and a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 in regions ⅵ and ⅶ fig 9g h szi values in regions ⅰ and ⅱ increased from about 0 5 to nearly 0 5 from 1985 to 2100 under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios indicating that the majority of northwestern china and inner mongolia are expected to continue experiencing a transfer from drying to wetting in the future similarly northeastern china and northern china are expected to become wetter but with a lower wetting speed than northwestern china and inner mongolia in tibetan plateau szi had a higher increasing trend under the ssp5 8 5 scenario 0 008 yr than that under the ssp2 4 5 scenario 0 005 yr the szi values in central china and southern china decreased from about 0 3 to 0 3 indicating humid regions of china were expected to experience a transfer from wet to drought because the majority of china regions ⅰ ⅴ are becoming wetter mainland china is expected to become wetter in the future fig 9a with increasing trends for szi of 0 004 yr fig 10 shows temporal variations in the mme values of relative drought area rda szi 1 in mainland china and seven climatic regions over 1985 2100 the decreasing trends in rda were found in mainland china fig 10a and in regions ⅰ ⅴ fig 10b f over 1985 2100 in the historical period and under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios rda showed more apparent decreasing trends in northwestern china and inner mongolia p 0 05 with less than 20 of regions under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios suffering moderate to severe droughts by the end of the 21st century in contrast rda showed increasing trends in central and southern china fig 10g h indicating these regions were expected to experience more severe and extended droughts in the future overall the decreasing trends of rda were observed over mainland china indicating mainland china is projected to experience wetter patterns under global warming the trends for rda were consistent with those of the annual variations of szi in different climatic regions in general the northern parts of china are projected to get wetter and the southern parts get drier most parts of northern china were projected to become wetter over the 21 st century which is mainly attributed to the projected increase in precipitation across china under co2 forcing the mean precipitation will increase more rapidly over land than over oceans according to the clausius clapeyron scaling under a warmer climate the atmospheric moisture is expected to be higher for the near surface atmospheric water holding capacity and will increase at about 7 per c of warming precipitation is expected to increase by up to 15 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 24 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively and the rate of increase in precipitation is projected to be higher in winter than in summer fig s6 the results were consistent with cook et al 2020 who reported that precipitation runoff and soil moisture would increase in these regions beyond that warming also increases the snowmelt runoff which makes these regions getting wetter at the same time vegetation coverage would increase in the future and the rising atmospheric co2 concentrations also increase plant water use efficiency in models potentially modulating surface drying lemordant et al 2018 swann et al 2016 trugman et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b 4 5 spatial distributions of drought characteristics the spatial distributions of annual drought occurrence times adot total drought

noting that adot represented drought frequency at a certain period and frequent drought events may not result in longer drought durations and severer drought intensity fig 11 shows that central and southern china were projected to experience increasingly frequent droughts in future periods under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios by 2071 2100 adot under the ssp2 4 5 scenario average 0 37 in region ⅵ and average 0 42 in region ⅶ were slightly greater than those under the ssp5 8 5 scenario average 0 31 in region ⅵ and average 0 38 in region ⅶ in contrast southern regions of northwestern china inner mongolia and western regions of the tibetan plateau would experience decreasing adot from 1985 to 2100 especially under the ssp5 8 5 scenario in general adot was greater under the ssp2 4 5 scenario than those under the ssp5 8 5 scenario at the same period by the end of the 21st century the adot would be 0 3 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 25 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario in mainland china and adot would be less than 0 3 in 58 and 71 of regions over mainland china respectively under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios fig 12 shows the spatial patterns of annual drought durations add the sum of dry months characterized by szi 1 divided by the number of years averaged by mme over four periods 1985 2014 2015 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 in general the spatial patterns of add were consistent with adot the southern parts of northwestern china inner mongolia southern parts of northern china and northwestern tibetan plateau had longer drought durations than other regions for 1985 2014 and were expected to experience shorter drought durations for 2015 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 by the end of the 21st century the average add would be 2 5 and 2 6 in northwestern china and would be 2 6 and 2 2 in inner mongolia respectively under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in contrast the eastern parts of the tibetan plateau central china and southern china had shorter drought durations for 1985 2014 and would experience longer drought durations in the future periods by the end of the 21st century drought would last more than 6 months per year at nearly half parts of central china 44 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 45 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario and some parts of southern china 24 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 64 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario in the southeastern parts of northeastern china the drought lasted for longer than 4 months per year for 1985 2014 and would last for shorter 2 months per year for 2071 2100 indicating these regions were projected to get wetter in the future the spatial patterns of annual drought severity ads the sum of absolute values of szi 1 divided by the number of years averaged by the mme over four periods 1985 2014 2015 2040

droughts ads 6 than other regions in the historical period 1985 2014 and then these regions would experience mild drought severity in the future periods ads 2 for 2071 2100 inner mongolia southern

especially under the ssp5 8 5 scenario ads 6 at 57 regions 5 discussion of results it is necessary to understand the drought evolutions under climate warming for the planning of adaptation strategies to promote drought preparedness however due to the divergences of drought definitions different drought indices always focus on particular aspects e g meteorological hydrological and agricultural leading to uncertainties in drought identification for a specific drought event to capture droughts from different perspectives a combined water energy balance approach provides us with an opportunity to generate comprehensive composite drought indices simultaneously considering water supply and atmospheric water demand through a series of comparisons and evaluations with sri ssi and swi we found that szi had a more robust ability and better performance in identifying multi scalar and multi category drought in different climatic regions under global warming due to the fixed time scale the performance of scpdsi in identifying multicategory drought decreased with the increase of time scales beyond 12 month scales spei exhibited similarly good performance in identifying different types of drought compared to szi in humid regions but it performed worse in arid regions besides spei showed the highest discrepancy between the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in non humid regions indicating that spei performed worse in identifying drought under the higher forcing pathway with the increase of temperature and net radiation pet will increase more sharply than will p under the ssp5 8 5 scenario which makes spei more dependent on pet and incapable of identifying droughts with warming especially in arid regions the differences in representing the atmospheric water demand in szi p ˆ and scpdsi p ˆ and spei pet were the main cause of discrepancies in identifying drought in non humid regions pet was generally much higher than et which made spei in which pet representing atmospheric water demand exhibit misrepresentation of different types of drought due to the good performance of szi in identifying multi scalar and multi category drought it was used to project future drought evolutions based on downscaled and mme cmip6 simulations drought is projected to be more widespread in the 21st century in southern humid regions of china which may be attributed to the increase in water vapor deficit or evaporative demand of the atmosphere dai et al 2018 and greater water use by vegetation under a warmer climate in the future drought results projected with szi are inconsistent with drought projections estimated using pet based indices spei or wi by huang et al 2017a b wei et al 2019 yao et al 2020 and zhang et al 2021b who reported that china especially the northwestern arid desert was projected to experience severer drought drylands expansion in the future under climate warming actually pet based indices may overestimate the severity of drought under global warming as pet is much higher than et and p under the climate warming impact which makes spei tends to perform poorly in arid regions therefore the choice of appropriate drought indices is critical for drought assessment and projection for comprehensive composite drought monitoring and projections szi may be more suitable as its more physically based budget approach 6 conclusions the applicability of three comprehensive drought indices szi spei and scpdsi was evaluated for projecting different types of drought in different climatic regions of china using simulations from 10 gcms in cmip6 forcing also we projected the spatiotemporal variations of drought characteristics derived from szi drought index based on downscaled gcms simulations in seven climatic regions in four periods 1985 2014 2015 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 the key findings are as follows i pet is much higher than et in water limited regions which leads to a misrepresentation of drought based on spei pet based drought index in contrast szi and scpdsi p ˆ based drought indices exhibit better performances in drought identification than does spei at non humid regions under global warming ii compared to spei szi and scpdsi can better represent different categories of drought especially in non humid regions northwestern china and inner mongolia furthermore szi outperforms scpdsi especially in identifying comprehensive drought at long term time scales across most regions of china iii in northwestern china inner mongolia tibetan plateau northeastern china and northern china szi increases significantly p 0 01 and drought area shows a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 with obvious wetting trends in the 21st century in central and southern china szi series and drought areas show opposite trends with obvious drying trends in general mainland china is expected to become wetter in the future iv central and southern humid regions of china are projected to experience increasingly frequent severer and longer duration droughts in the future periods in contrast the southern parts of northwestern china inner mongolia and western parts of the tibetan plateau are projected to experience more mild droughts in the future periods especially at the end of the 21st century than over the historical period authorship contributions conception and design of study g zhang analysis and or interpretation

8145,study region seven climatic regions of china study focus this study compared and assessed the standardized moisture anomaly index szi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and self calibrated palmer drought severity index scpdsi over seven climatic regions of china based on simulations from general circulation models gcm participated in the 6th coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 under climate change then szi was calculated using downscaled and multi model ensemble mme simulations for drought projection and drought characteristics were determined based on szi from 1985 to 2100 new hydrological insights for the region results showed that szi was more robust and performed better in identifying and projecting multi scalar and multi category drought especially in comprehensive drought identification in different climatic regions under global warming the performance of scpdsi in identifying multi category drought decreased with the increase of time scales beyond 12 months the szi series calculated with downscaled and mme simulations showed that most parts of china arid semi arid and semi humid regions were projected to become wetter over the 21st century however drought is expected to be more widespread in southern humid regions of china under a warmer climate in the future the results provide a new choice for future drought projection and valuable information for regional drought mitigation under climate change keywords climate change cmip6 multi category drought drought projection china 1 introduction drought is a recurring and creeping hazard which may occur in nearly all regions and could cause severe consequences for agricultural production ecosystem and socio economy ayantobo and wei 2019 chen et al 2019 cook et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a drought always occurs due to the deficit of precipitation p and is aggravated by higher temperature t and evapotranspiration et than normal conditions leading to a reduction of available water resources huang et al 2017a b vicente serrano et al 2014 yang et al 2017w with climate warming drought occurred frequently in the last few decades feng et al 2019 for example the 2019 severe drought occurred for a half year in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and affected 7 provinces causing economic losses of 15 billion chinese yuan ran et al 2021 therefore it is meaningful to project how drought evolves under climate change which will help develop strategies for managers to mitigate or prevent drought however differences in drought related variables make it difficult to precisely define drought and a single drought index e g the deficit in p may not capture drought in all aspects mishra and singh 2010 thus drought is generally classified into meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts from natural perspectives american meteorological society 2004 recently groundwater ecological and socio economic droughts have also been proposed to assess the impacts of deficit in water resources on the ecological environment and socio economy crausbay et al 2017 mehran et al 2017 to quantify different types of drought numerous drought indicators have been proposed such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 standardized runoff index sri nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 shukla and wood 2008 palmer s drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among those spi sri and ssi are commonly used to track meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought but these drought indices can only depict a single aspect of drought as they consider only one variable representing the water supply of one component in hydrological processes ford and labosier 2017 otkin et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a however drought is associated with multiple variables and is caused by water imbalance thus only one variable is insufficient for depicting different aspects of drought it is therefore important to characterize drought from multiple perspectives considering different hydrological variables spei a multi scalar drought index that measures considering climatic water balance drought conditions based on the differences between p representing water supply and potential evapotranspiration pet representing atmospheric water demand ayantobo and wei 2019 hao and singh 2015b zhang et al 2019a 2019b due to its physical meaning and simple method of calculation multi scalar and multi category features spei has been broadly used for characterizing multi category drought for drought monitoring and projection under climate change ayantobo et al 2017 chen et al 2019 cook et al 2014 guo et al 2018 hao et al 2015a however there are limitations for spei applications in different climatic regions ayantobo and wei 2019 such as 1 et nearly satisfies the water demand in water limited regions where it is counter balanced by p thus using pet representing atmospheric water demand is inappropriate to some extent huang et al 2016 xu et al 2013g yang et al 2006g 2015 2018c 2 spei is a meteorological drought index and may misrepresent other types of drought dai 2011 sheffield et al 2006 unlike the simple water balance represented in spei pdsi adopts a two layer bucket model to quantify the cumulative moisture departure in estimating the surface water energy balance in which surface runoff et and changes in soil moisture sm are used to represent the water balance wells et al 2004 zhang et al 2019b therefore pdsi has been widely used for drought evaluation using observed climate variables chen et al 2019 sheffield et al 2012 and for future drought projection by incorporating simulations of general circulation models gcms cook et al 2014 2015 gizaw and gan 2016 however pdsi has drawbacks including the high sensitivity to the calibration period and temperature variation difficulty in spatial comparability and fixed time scale sheffield et al 2012 some drawbacks have been overcome wells et al 2004 by replacing fixed parameters based on local climatic conditions and proposition of self calibrating pdsi scpdsi which makes pdsi spatially comparable but other drawbacks still exist to overcome the drawback of the fixed time scale in scpdsi liu et al 2017b proposed a new drought index scpdsix by modifying the duration factors of scpdsi to identify drought with different time scales scpdsix exhibits greater stability in identifying short term and long term droughts however it is not simple to calculate scpdsix which makes its application difficult considering the abovementioned drawbacks of pdsi and spei zhang et al 2015 developed a novel drought index named standardized moisture anomaly index szi by incorporating the advantages of spei and pdsi whose performance has been verified on regional zhang et al 2015 national ayantobo and wei 2019 and global scales zhang et al 2019a 2019b for historical drought identification the szi employs a water energy balance model to estimate the aggregate moisture departure and also incorporates a multi scalar feature to monitor drought which makes it describing the multi category and multi scalar droughts better but it has not yet been applied for future drought projections under climate change with the global climate change the severity and frequency of drought would likely increase in many regions based on offline drought indices berg et al 2016 cook et al 2015 2020 dai 2012 dai et al 2018 gizaw and gan 2016 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2020 but contradictory conclusions have been reported based on the direct outputs of gcms cook et al 2020 greve et al 2017 milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2018b therefore it is necessary to compare and evaluate different drought indices in drought projection under climate change in different climatic regions however outputs of gcms remain coarse resolution and biases which prevents their direct use in drought prediction and other research yang et al 2018a it is necessary to downscale and bias correct gcms simulations before application among various downscaling approaches biascorrection and spatial downscaling bcsd method has been verified in downscaling gcms simulations well in china yang et al 2019 recently new simulations from climate models that participated in cmip6 have become available eyring et al 2016 which have more robust and higher resolution simulations for analyzing climate change and its influences on drought cook et al 2020 thus the main objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the szi spei and scpdsi indices for multi category drought projection at different time scales under climate change over seven different climatic regions of china based on the original outputs of cmip6 gcms 2 to analyze the spatio temporal variations of drought characteristics using the drought index that outperforms other indices evaluated in step 1 based on downscaled gcms simulations in seven climatic regions under climate warming 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area due to the complex topography and large expansion china contains a wide range of climate regimes yao et al 2020 zhai et al 2010 zhao 1983 divided mainland china into 7 regions based on climate and topography fig 1 and this division has been widely applied for drought related research ayantobo and wei 2019 yao et al 2018 2020 zhang et al 2021b these 7 regions are northwest desert areas region i inner mongolia steppe region region ii qinghai tibet plateau region iii northeast humid semi humid warm region region ⅳ north china humid semi humid temperate region region ⅴ central and southern china humid subtropical region region ⅵ and south china humid tropical region region ⅶ respectively the precipitation is the smallest 134 mm in region ⅰ and the largest 1600 mm in region ⅶ table 1 2 2 observational and reanalysis data monthly gridded precipitation relative humidity maximum temperature and minimum temperature data were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic of china http data cma cn en these data

monthly averaged data https cds climate copernicus eu with spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and were regrrided into 0 5 0 5 resolution with the bilinear interpolation method these data were used to correct and downscale raw cmip6 simulations 2 3 cmip6 simulations historical and future simulations across china were obtained from 20 cmip6 gcms outputs table 2 for the future period considering the data availability simulations from two ssp scenarios were selected namely ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 which are the most commonly used scenarios that may occur in the future with a potential 1 5 and 2 0

downwelling shortwave flux and surface upwelling shortwave flux were downloaded from the cmip6 archives https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 for calculation of scpdsi spei and szi surface soil moisture content total surface runoff and evapotranspiration were also collected for the calculation of ssi sri and standardized water energy index swi liu et al 2017a co2 concentration data were collected from the website of the university of melbourne https greenhousegases science unimelb edu au for the convenience of comparison these variables were interpolated into 1 5 1 5 resolution grid using the bilinear method and averaged into an ensemble dataset 3 methodology 3 1 drought indices the pet calculation is a key step in the calculation of spei scpdsi and szi the penman monteith pm

was calculated at multiple time scales 1 48 months using monthly differences between p and pet the three parameter log logistic distribution function was used to fit the cumulative probability the scpdsi and szi were estimated from the differences between p and climatically appropriate precipitation p ˆ where p ˆ is calculated based on surface water balance using four actual variables consisting of et runoff ro loss l and recharge r and the corresponding potential variables by dividing soil column into two layers the four potential variables were weighted according to the local climate using weighting factors α β γ δ to express them as p ˆ 3 p ˆ α j p e t β j p r γ j p r o δ j p l j 1 2 3 12 where pr represents potential recharge pro represents potential runoff and pl represents potential moisture loss the moisture departure d was calculated as 4 d p p ˆ then d was used to calculate scpdsi and details of the calculation procedure were based on wells et al 2004 the three parameters log logistic distribution was used for fitting d to obtain szi at different time scales following zhang et al 2019a 5 f x 1 α d γ β 1 where α β and γ are the location parameters then the szi series were calculated with standardized transformation 6 szi φ 1 f x where φ 1 represent inverse gaussian distribution to examine these three drought indices in the projection of different types of drought hydrological agricultural and comprehensive droughts were calculated with p ro sm and the residual water energy ratio wer via sri shukla and wood 2008 ssi aghakouchak 2014 hao et al 2017 and swi liu et al 2017a at 1 48 month scales in 7 climatic regions of china to avoid the spatio temporal inconsistency and statistical incomparability the nonparametric method was used to fit probabilities to calculate sri and ssi farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 generally p correlates t negatively during drought episodes which indicates that the residual energy is generally higher and the residual available water is usually lower under dry conditions ayantobo and wei 2019 liu et al 2017a yin et al 2014g therefore the ratio of p et to pet et was selected as the drought variable and was named wer liu et al 2017a which was defined as 7 w e r p e t p e t e t the indices ssi sri and swi were calculated at different time scales the pearson correlation coefficients r between szi scpdsi and spei and sri ssi and swi were calculated to evaluate the performances of these drought indices in the projection of different types of drought in the 7 climatic regions of china the drought indices used in the current study were listed in table 3 3 2 downscaling and multi model ensemble to quantify the agreement between observational and gcms simulation a skill score taylor 2001 was used to evaluate the performance of gcms in modeling precipitation and temperature the equation of the skill score s score is 8 s 1 r 4 4 s d r 1 s d r 2 where r is the pattern correlation between gcms simulations and observations sdr is the ratio of spatial standard deviation in gcms simulations against observations hirota and takayabu 2013 to correct the bias of original gcm s outputs and to improve their spatial resolution the bcsd method wood et al 2004 was used to downscale gcm simulations based on historical data to reduce the uncertainties of gcm simulations the bayesian model

defined as a continuous negative run of index values for at least three consecutive months with the lowest szi less than 1 for each grid according to mckee et al 1993 once a drought event is identified it can be characterized in terms of drought duration drought frequency drought severity etc for more details one can refer to guo et al 2018 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the gcms simulations and the downscaled mme the individual gcms showed varying skills in reproducing precipitation and temperature over china fig 2 ec earth3 and noresm2 mm exhibited better skills in reproducing precipitation with s scores of 0 86 and 0 83 respectively fgoals g3 showed the worst performance in reproducing precipitation with s score of less than 0 2 in terms of temperature cesm2 and noresm2 mm exhibited better skills with s scores of 0 95 and 0 94 respectively likewise fgoals g3 is the worst gcm in reproducing temperature distribution with s score of less than 0 75 generally the s scores for temperature were higher than that for precipitation which indicating that gcms were better and more stable in simulating temperature than precipitation finally according to the s scores of gcms in reproducing precipitation and temperature 10 gcms were selected for further study including access esm 1 5 bcc csm2 mr cesm2 ec earth3 gfdl cm4 hadgem3 gc31 ll miroc6 mpi esm1 2 hr mri esm2 0 and noresm2 mm the performances of the downscaled and mme precipitation and temperature generated by bcsd and bma methods from the 10 selected gcms were evaluated with r nse and mae fig 3 fig 3 shows that the mme exhibits a higher r and nse and lower mae than individual gcms for both precipitation and temperature the r and nse between mme and observational precipitation are higher than 0 80 and 0 60 respectively and the mae is lower than 10 mm the r and nse between mme and observational temperature are higher than 0 97 and the mae is lower than 0 75 in addition the mme has a narrower range of r nse and mae than the individual gcms indicating a better simulation performance and higher stability of the mme fig 4 presents the pet differences and relationships between cmip6 mme and observational meteorological data from 1985 to 2014 generally the differences between these two pet data are relatively low in most regions ranging from 30 to 20 the pet calculated with cmip6 mme data was lower higher than that calculated with observational data in most regions of qinghai tibetan plateau northwest china fig 4a in other regions the differences between these two pet data approximately ranged from 10 to 10 the pet calculated with cmip6 mme data strongly agreed with that calculated with observed meteorological data r2 0 87 slope 1 18 which indicates that the pet data calculated with downscaled and multimodel ensemble cmip6 simulations were reliable enough to use for the calculation of the drought indices 4 2 performances of szi scpdsi and spei in projecting hydrological agricultural and comprehensive droughts 4 2 1 performances of szi scpdsi and spei in terms of runoff generally szi scpdsi and spei were used to monitor meteorological drought so it is meaningful to explore the ability of these indices for identifying other types of drought to better understand the performances of these three drought indices in monitoring and projecting hydrological drought at varying time scales the correlations between the drought index specified by runoff and these three drought indices were examined as shown in fig s1 szi performed better than did scpdsi and spei in identifying hydrological drought in northwestern china region ⅰ at 1 to 48 month scales under both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios the r values for szi sri ranged from 0 33 to 0 41 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario average 0 34 and from 0 32 to 0 49 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario average 0 41 in region ⅰ in regions ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ scpdsi generally performed slightly better than szi and significantly better than spei in identifying hydrological drought the averaged r values for scpdsi sri were 0 39 0 41 and 0 42 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and were 0 54 0 43 0 49 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ which were slightly higher than those for szi sri with averaged r values of 0 36 0 38 and 0 32 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 46 0 31 and 0 27 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ and higher than those for spei sri with averaged r values of 0 06 0 30 and 0 28 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 33 0 05 and 0 09 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ in humid regions regions ⅵ and ⅶ the r values for spei sri with averaged r values of 0 52 and 0 53 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 22 and 0 38 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅵ and ⅶ were higher than those for szi sri with averaged r values of 0 46 and 0 43 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 24 and 0 33 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅵ and ⅶ and scpdsi sri with averaged r values of 0 37 and 0 28 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 16 and 0 17 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively in regions ⅵ and ⅶ the r values for spei sri showed an obvious decreasing trend with the increase of time scales in almost all regions except for region ⅲ the r values for spei sri showed an increasing trend with the increase of wetness index p pet wi at all time scales under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios fig 5 however at longer time scales 12 months the r values for scpdsi sri and szi sri showed a decreasing trend especially under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the discrepancies of correlations between szi sri and spei sri are the lowest at 1 month scale 6 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 11 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario and highest at 48 month scale 71 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 150 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the divergence of correlations between szi sri and spei sri was higher in non humid regions than that in humid regions especially at long term time scales 6 months the divergences between r values for szi sri and scpdsi sri were lower than those for spei sri szi and scpdsi performed better than spei in arid regions and szi and spei outperformed scpdsi in humid regions indicating that szi showed a stable capability in identifying hydrological drought in different climatic regions 4 2 2 performances of szi scpdsi and spei in terms of soil moisture agricultural drought is mainly caused by the shortage of soil moisture which consequently influences crop growth and agricultural production therefore the correlations for ssi szi ssi scpdsi and ssi spei were calculated at different time scales for assessing the performances of different drought indices as shown in fig s2 in arid region ⅰ and humid regions regions ⅵ and ⅶ szi outperformed scpdsi and spei in identifying agricultural drought at 1 to 48 month scales under both climate scenarios in northwestern china region ⅰ the r values between szi and ssi ranged from 0 37 to 0 53 average 0 42 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and ranged from 0 45 to 0 54 average 0 48 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario which were higher than those for scpdsi ssi average 0 29 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 33 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario and spei ssi average 0 10 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 15 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario in central and southern humid regions regions ⅵ and ⅶ the r values for ssi szi scpdsi spei were generally higher than those in arid regions which indicated that these drought indices performed better in humid regions than in arid regions in identifying agricultural drought especially for spei that outperformed scpdsi in humid regions fig 6 shows the trend of r values for ssi szi scpdsi spei with wi the discrepancies of correlation between szi ssi and spei ssi were the lowest at 1 month scale 8 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 26 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario and highest at 48 month scale 45 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 84 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the discrepancies between r values for szi ssi and spei ssi showed a decreasing trend with the increase of wi with the highest in northwestern china region ⅰ and the lowest in southern china region ⅶ at short term time scales 12 months scpdsi better performed than did szi and spei in regions with wi 1 0 at long term time scales 12 months szi always better performed than did scpdsi and spei in different climatic regions in identifying agricultural drought 4 2 3 performances of szi scpdsi and spei in terms of wer the performances of szi scpdsi and spei in identifying comprehensive drought against swi were also examined in seven climatic regions of china the correlations between regionally averaged swi and szi spei and scpdsi at different time scales under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 climate scenarios are shown in fig s3 the correlations between szi and swi were higher than those between scpdsi and swi and between spei and swi in most regions the r values for szi swi ranged from 0 16 0 15 to 0 68 0 68 under the ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 climate scenario which was higher than those between spei and swi between 0 05 and 0 64 under the ssp2 4 5 climate scenario and between 0 12 and 0 40 under the ssp5 8 5 climate scenario and scpdsi swi between 0 11 and 0 53 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and between 0 15 and 0 56 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the discrepancies between correlations for szi swi and spei swi were the highest in northwestern china region ⅰ and the lowest in southern humid regions regions ⅵ and ⅶ fig 7 this indicated spei underperformed szi and scpdsi in identifying comprehensive drought when wi was higher especially over arid and semi arid regions in contrast the discrepancies between the r values for szi swi and scpdsi swi were higher at short term time scales 6 months and decreased slightly with the increase of time scales figs s4 and s5 show the spatial distribution of r values corresponding to figs s3 and 7 the r values for szi swi were generally higher than those for scpdsi swi at different time scales and for spei swi at most regions especially in non humid regions similarly the r values for spei swi showed the highest discrepancy averaged r 0 16 between the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios at non humid regions regions ⅰ ⅴ this indicated that spei performed worse in identifying the comprehensive drought under the higher forcing pathway in contrast szi and scpdsi showed more robust performances in identifying the comprehensive drought under different forcing scenarios overall szi can adequately depict the comprehensive drought at different time scales in different climatic regions under climate change 4 3 comparison with historical drought events to verify the performances of szi in drought monitoring three drought events were selected for comparison including the 2009 2010 southwestern drought the 2013 southern drought and the 2007 northeastern drought the 2009 2010 southwestern drought was the driest drought event that occurred in july 2009 and ended in april 2010 which caused serious economic losses nearly us 30 billion yang et al 2011 the szi monitored that drought center was located in guangxi guizhou and hunan provinces in february 2010 which was consistent with the drought record and related research fig 8 a huang et al 2012 zhang et al 2021a drought that occurred over southern china in 2013 affected several provinces and the huge drought centers were located in guizhou hunan and zhejiang provinces in july 2013 which was accurately monitored by szi fig 8b the result was consistent with soil moisture deficit and precipitation anomaly reported by zhang et al 2021a and yuan et al 2016 in 2007 a severe drought occurred in northeastern china attacking most parts of the heilongjiang province and eastern parts of inner mongolia and reducing crop growth and productivity http www weather com cn drought ghsj 2007 05 442481 shtml the drought event monitored by szi in july 2007 was similar with drought records and heilongjiang province was in the condition of severe drought fig 8c by comparing szi monitored results with three drought events occurred in different regions it was demonstrated that szi was capable of detecting and describing the spatial patterns of drought events 4 4 temporal variations of drought the abovementioned analysis about drought indices indicated that szi was more robust in identifying different categories of drought in different climatic regions of china therefore we selected szi to assess future drought characteristics we downscaled meteorological variables of 10 gcms to the 0 5 0 5 resolution using the bcsd method and then integrated them into the ensemble model using the bma method szi was calculated based on the multimodel ensemble simulations for each pixel across china the temporal variations of szi in seven climatic regions under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios over 1985 2100 are illustrated in fig 9 szi shows a significant increasing trend p 0 01 in regions ⅰ ⅴ fig 9b f and a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 in regions ⅵ and ⅶ fig 9g h szi values in regions ⅰ and ⅱ increased from about 0 5 to nearly 0 5 from 1985 to 2100 under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios indicating that the majority of northwestern china and inner mongolia are expected to continue experiencing a transfer from drying to wetting in the future similarly northeastern china and northern china are expected to become wetter but with a lower wetting speed than northwestern china and inner mongolia in tibetan plateau szi had a higher increasing trend under the ssp5 8 5 scenario 0 008 yr than that under the ssp2 4 5 scenario 0 005 yr the szi values in central china and southern china decreased from about 0 3 to 0 3 indicating humid regions of china were expected to experience a transfer from wet to drought because the majority of china regions ⅰ ⅴ are becoming wetter mainland china is expected to become wetter in the future fig 9a with increasing trends for szi of 0 004 yr fig 10 shows temporal variations in the mme values of relative drought area rda szi 1 in mainland china and seven climatic regions over 1985 2100 the decreasing trends in rda were found in mainland china fig 10a and in regions ⅰ ⅴ fig 10b f over 1985 2100 in the historical period and under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios rda showed more apparent decreasing trends in northwestern china and inner mongolia p 0 05 with less than 20 of regions under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios suffering moderate to severe droughts by the end of the 21st century in contrast rda showed increasing trends in central and southern china fig 10g h indicating these regions were expected to experience more severe and extended droughts in the future overall the decreasing trends of rda were observed over mainland china indicating mainland china is projected to experience wetter patterns under global warming the trends for rda were consistent with those of the annual variations of szi in different climatic regions in general the northern parts of china are projected to get wetter and the southern parts get drier most parts of northern china were projected to become wetter over the 21 st century which is mainly attributed to the projected increase in precipitation across china under co2 forcing the mean precipitation will increase more rapidly over land than over oceans according to the clausius clapeyron scaling under a warmer climate the atmospheric moisture is expected to be higher for the near surface atmospheric water holding capacity and will increase at about 7 per c of warming precipitation is expected to increase by up to 15 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 24 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively and the rate of increase in precipitation is projected to be higher in winter than in summer fig s6 the results were consistent with cook et al 2020 who reported that precipitation runoff and soil moisture would increase in these regions beyond that warming also increases the snowmelt runoff which makes these regions getting wetter at the same time vegetation coverage would increase in the future and the rising atmospheric co2 concentrations also increase plant water use efficiency in models potentially modulating surface drying lemordant et al 2018 swann et al 2016 trugman et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b 4 5 spatial distributions of drought characteristics the spatial distributions of annual drought occurrence times adot total drought occurrence times divided by the number of years averaged by mme over four periods 1985 2014 2015 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios are shown in fig 11 it is worth noting that adot represented drought frequency at a certain period and frequent drought events may not result in longer drought durations and severer drought intensity fig 11 shows that central and southern china were projected to experience increasingly frequent droughts in future periods under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios by 2071 2100 adot under the ssp2 4 5 scenario average 0 37 in region ⅵ and average 0 42 in region ⅶ were slightly greater than those under the ssp5 8 5 scenario average 0 31 in region ⅵ and average 0 38 in region ⅶ in contrast southern regions of northwestern china inner mongolia and western regions of the tibetan plateau would experience decreasing adot from 1985 to 2100 especially under the ssp5 8 5 scenario in general adot was greater under the ssp2 4 5 scenario than those under the ssp5 8 5 scenario at the same period by the end of the 21st century the adot would be 0 3 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 0 25 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario in mainland china and adot would be less than 0 3 in 58 and 71 of regions over mainland china respectively under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios fig 12 shows the spatial patterns of annual drought durations add the sum of dry months characterized by szi 1 divided by the number of years averaged by mme over four periods 1985 2014 2015 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 in general the spatial patterns of add were consistent with adot the southern parts of northwestern china inner mongolia southern parts of northern china and northwestern tibetan plateau had longer drought durations than other regions for 1985 2014 and were expected to experience shorter drought durations for 2015 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 by the end of the 21st century the average add would be 2 5 and 2 6 in northwestern china and would be 2 6 and 2 2 in inner mongolia respectively under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in contrast the eastern parts of the tibetan plateau central china and southern china had shorter drought durations for 1985 2014 and would experience longer drought durations in the future periods by the end of the 21st century drought would last more than 6 months per year at nearly half parts of central china 44 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 45 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario and some parts of southern china 24 under the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 64 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario in the southeastern parts of northeastern china the drought lasted for longer than 4 months per year for 1985 2014 and would last for shorter 2 months per year for 2071 2100 indicating these regions were projected to get wetter in the future the spatial patterns of annual drought severity ads the sum of absolute values of szi 1 divided by the number of years averaged by the mme over four periods 1985 2014 2015 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 were consistent with the spatial patterns of annual drought durations fig 13 the southern parts of northwestern china and northern parts of tibetan plateau experienced severer droughts ads 6 than other regions in the historical period 1985 2014 and then these regions would experience mild drought severity in the future periods ads 2 for 2071 2100 inner mongolia southern parts of northeastern china and eastern parts of northern china also experienced severer droughts in the historical period than in the future periods but with more smooth transfers from dry to wet ads 4 6 in the historical period transferring to ads 0 3 for 2071 2100 period in contrast central and southern china would experience severer droughts for the 2071 2100 period than in other periods especially under the ssp5 8 5 scenario ads 6 at 57 regions 5 discussion of results it is necessary to understand the drought evolutions under climate warming for the planning of adaptation strategies to promote drought preparedness however due to the divergences of drought definitions different drought indices always focus on particular aspects e g meteorological hydrological and agricultural leading to uncertainties in drought identification for a specific drought event to capture droughts from different perspectives a combined water energy balance approach provides us with an opportunity to generate comprehensive composite drought indices simultaneously considering water supply and atmospheric water demand through a series of comparisons and evaluations with sri ssi and swi we found that szi had a more robust ability and better performance in identifying multi scalar and multi category drought in different climatic regions under global warming due to the fixed time scale the performance of scpdsi in identifying multicategory drought decreased with the increase of time scales beyond 12 month scales spei exhibited similarly good performance in identifying different types of drought compared to szi in humid regions but it performed worse in arid regions besides spei showed the highest discrepancy between the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in non humid regions indicating that spei performed worse in identifying drought under the higher forcing pathway with the increase of temperature and net radiation pet will increase more sharply than will p under the ssp5 8 5 scenario which makes spei more dependent on pet and incapable of identifying droughts with warming especially in arid regions the differences in representing the atmospheric water demand in szi p ˆ and scpdsi p ˆ and spei pet were the main cause of discrepancies in identifying drought in non humid regions pet was generally much higher than et which made spei in which pet representing atmospheric water demand exhibit misrepresentation of different types of drought due to the good performance of szi in identifying multi scalar and multi category drought it was used to project future drought evolutions based on downscaled and mme cmip6 simulations drought is projected to be more widespread in the 21st century in southern humid regions of china which may be attributed to the increase in water vapor deficit or evaporative demand of the atmosphere dai et al 2018 and greater water use by vegetation under a warmer climate in the future drought results projected with szi are inconsistent with drought projections estimated using pet based indices spei or wi by huang et al 2017a b wei et al 2019 yao et al 2020 and zhang et al 2021b who reported that china especially the northwestern arid desert was projected to experience severer drought drylands expansion in the future under climate warming actually pet based indices may overestimate the severity of drought under global warming as pet is much higher than et and p under the climate warming impact which makes spei tends to perform poorly in arid regions therefore the choice of appropriate drought indices is critical for drought assessment and projection for comprehensive composite drought monitoring and projections szi may be more suitable as its more physically based budget approach 6 conclusions the applicability of three comprehensive drought indices szi spei and scpdsi was evaluated for projecting different types of drought in different climatic regions of china using simulations from 10 gcms in cmip6 forcing also we projected the spatiotemporal variations of drought characteristics derived from szi drought index based on downscaled gcms simulations in seven climatic regions in four periods 1985 2014 2015 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 the key findings are as follows i pet is much higher than et in water limited regions which leads to a misrepresentation of drought based on spei pet based drought index in contrast szi and scpdsi p ˆ based drought indices exhibit better performances in drought identification than does spei at non humid regions under global warming ii compared to spei szi and scpdsi can better represent different categories of drought especially in non humid regions northwestern china and inner mongolia furthermore szi outperforms scpdsi especially in identifying comprehensive drought at long term time scales across most regions of china iii in northwestern china inner mongolia tibetan plateau northeastern china and northern china szi increases significantly p 0 01 and drought area shows a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 with obvious wetting trends in the 21st century in central and southern china szi series and drought areas show opposite trends with obvious drying trends in general mainland china is expected to become wetter in the future iv central and southern humid regions of china are projected to experience increasingly frequent severer and longer duration droughts in the future periods in contrast the southern parts of northwestern china inner mongolia and western parts of the tibetan plateau are projected to experience more mild droughts in the future periods especially at the end of the 21st century than over the historical period authorship contributions conception and design of study g zhang analysis and or interpretation

8146,study region robit bata watershed upper blue nile basin ethiopia study focus stable isotopes of water oxygen 18 and deuterium were used as tracers to estimate the contribution of groundwater in shallow hillslope aquifers to streamflow in the robit bata watershed to assess the spatiotemporal variability of shallow groundwater and develop a hydrograph separation technique we collected rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow samples and analyzed their δ18o and δ2h isotopic compositions the local meteoric water line lmwl and local evaporative line lel of the study area were determined and compared with the global meteoric water line gmwl a standard unweighted two component isotope based hydrograph separation model was used to determine the percentage contribution of shallow groundwater to streamflow new hydrological insights for the region the lmwl δ2h 8 63 δ18o 18 2 mostly showed heavy isotopic enrichment relative to gmwl and the lel δ2h 5 45 δ18o 6 96 indicated isotopic enrichment compared to ethiopian lakes shallow groundwater responded rapidly to rainfall with good spatial correlation depending on topographic positions of wells pre event water contributed 50 to peak discharge in july but 90 when the watershed reached maximum storage this finding gives insight towards the predominant runoff generation process and has significant implications for sustainable dry season irrigation expansion in the area as the sub surface flow drains out of the watershed from october onwards reducing water tables in the shallow wells keywords baseflow isotope based hydrograph separation stable oxygen isotope stable deuterium isotope runoff generation process drought prone 1 introduction baseflow is the portion of previously stored subsurface water in groundwater aquifers that enters the streamflow regardless of rainfall events hewlett and hibbert 1967 it is also the slowly responding component of streamflow with long lasting effect on the flow duncan 2019 baseflow in streams is termed pre event water it can significantly contribute to streamflow depending on climate watershed hydrogeology and the main rainfall runoff mechanisms sklash and farvolden 1979 moore 1989 ogunkoya and jenkins 1991 gonzales et al 2009 camacho suarez et al 2015 estimating available baseflow from shallow groundwater resources is of paramount importance for supporting adaptive integrated water resource management in agriculture led economies however estimating the baseflow contribution remains difficult especially in mountainous areas with hillslope aquifers conventional techniques for baseflow separation include graphical and empirical approaches linsley and kohler 1958 and the use of geochemical tracers pinder and jones 1969 most engineering practices still use various empirically based straight line graphical techniques e g te et al 1988 mccuen 2005 subramanya 2013 to separate baseflow from the storm hydrograph the numerous proposed baseflow separation models and algorithms use different assumptions e g sloto and crouse 1996 rutledge 1998 arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2005 lim et al 2005 piggott et al 2005 tongal and booij 2018 but they all rely on the availability of continuous streamflow measurements and hydrologic datasets which is a major problem in the global south where networks of hydro meteorological stations are sparse and may be poorly maintained in data scarce and complex landscapes isotopic techniques are proven alternatives for determining hydrological processes and the contribution of baseflow to a storm hydrograph kebede 2012 the first isotope based hydrograph separation ihs techniques developed in the early 1970s used tritium which is naturally abundant and is not adsorbed by soil particles crouzet et al 1970 dincer et al 1970 martinec et al 1974 subsequent studies used the naturally abundant stable isotopes oxygen 18 δ18o dincer et al 1970 sklash et al 1976 and deuterium δ2h herrmann and stichler 1980 during the past 50 years the use of naturally abundant stable isotopes has greatly advanced the field of watershed hydrology klaus and mcdonnell 2013 ihs methods have been widely used in humid temperate regions and they have also been successfully applied in other climatic regions and in watersheds with complex hydrogeology kebede 2012 camacho suarez et al 2015 hydrograph separation techniques based on the δ18o and δ2h isotopic compositions of water have advantages over graphical and geochemical techniques because they do not depend on the pressure response in the channel klaus and mcdonnell 2013 instead δ18o and δ2h are stable and occur naturally in water making them ideal conservative tracers they occur naturally in rainfall and their fractionation is influenced by evaporation and condensation bonell et al 1990 buttle 1994 they can thus be used to trace rainwater as it follows the hydrological pathways in a watershed and mixes with groundwater and stream water beven 2011 although studies with relatively coarse spatial and temporal sampling resolutions have been conducted in medium and large basins only a few attempts have been made to use isotopic approaches to characterize shallow groundwater behavior in the upper blue nile ubn basin and estimate its contribution to streamflow e g kebede et al 2006 2011 tekleab et al 2014 furthermore these studies did not address the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of isotopic signatures in local rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow in small scale watersheds blume et al 2008 camacho suarez et al 2015 the mid term and long term future climate change predictions of the 21st century for the ubn basin projected a decline in rainfall and a rise in temperature which will result in a decrease in the total water yield and an increase in evapotranspiration mengistu et al 2021 worku et al 2021 in addition climate change is projected to impact groundwater resources by decreasing the contribution of groundwater to streamflow tigabu et al 2020 or declining the contribution of baseflow to total water yield mengistu et al 2021 therefore estimating the available groundwater resource is vital for future groundwater utilization in support of food and nutrition security in the region especially for drought prone areas the aim of this study therefore was to characterize the contribution of shallow groundwater to streamflow in a small scale watershed with a hillslope aquifer in the sub humid ethiopian highlands the specific objectives were 1 to characterize the watershed according to the local isotopic signatures of rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow by sampling them at high spatiotemporal resolution and 2 to develop a model using the isotopic values of the endmembers to quantify the shallow groundwater contribution pre event water to streamflow by providing important input to stakeholders and decision makers the findings of this study will promote the sustainable intensification of agriculture through small scale irrigation as part of an integrated watershed management approach and contribute to national efforts to build climate resilience in smallholder farming systems in areas of ethiopia with similar hydrogeology 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area the robit bata watershed 37 26 49 37 29 57 e 11 38 30 11 40 59 n is an experimental watershed in the ubn basin southeast of lake tana that drains into the lake fig 1 the watershed area is about 1 034 ha measured using the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm 30 m digital elevation model dem https earthexplorer usgs gov it ranges in elevation from 1 800 to 2 029 m a s l with an average elevation of 1 913 m a s l slope gradients range from 0 to 37 and in more than 50 of the area the slope gradient exceeds 7 the spatial analyses were carried out in the arcgis environment the watershed is located in a region of the ethiopian highlands with a wet weyna dega sub humid agro ecological climate hurni et al 2016 where most 75 of rain falls from june to september during the kiremt summer rainy season and the remaining 25 from march to may during the belg spring rainy season nmsa 1996 kebede and travi 2012 seasonal moisture sources in the ethiopian highlands are strongly influenced by the migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the moisture for summer rains in northwestern ethiopia is derived mainly from the atlantic ocean whereas the northern indian ocean is the source for spring rains in the study area the mean daily temperature is about 20 c and the average annual rainfall exceeds 1 400 mm based on long term records of the bahir dar meteorological station since 1961 fig 2 in the watershed massive basalt bedrock crops out in riverbeds and occasionally on steeper slopes and in quarries on broad hillslopes a weathered basalt regolith overlies the bedrock and red soils with a limited tillage depth 30 cm have developed in the upper part of the regolith floodplains in the watershed are composed of thick clayey alluvial sediments chromic vertisols are predominant in the lower part of the watershed and eutric nitosols are predominant in the upper part abidela hussein et al 2019 land use in 85 of the watershed consists of crop livestock systems and 13 of the agricultural land is irrigated using shallow groundwater during the dry season land cover in the rest of the watershed is bush land or eucalyptus tree forest the main annual crops are finger millet and maize which are grown during the kiremt or monsoon june october vegetables are grown in the dry season october march and fruits and khat are perennial crops that are grown with supplemental irrigation during the dry season the watershed was first established in 2015 as an experimental watershed through a collaboration between bahir dar university and the international water management institute the collaboratoin aims to improve rural livelihoods through the development of sustainable shallow groundwater irrigation hence to estimate the potential of shallow groundwater for irrigation instruments were installed in the watershed for investigating the interaction of surface and subsurface waters this instrumentation included rain gauges and rain samplers depth to water monitoring equipment in hand dug wells and gauges at the watershed outlet and at outlets of sub watersheds 2 2 measurements sampling and laboratory analyses spatial and temporal variations in the δ2h and δ18o isotopic compositions of water were used to characterize the watershed water samples were collected from three different sources rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow the measurement and sampling frequencies depended on the water source the time of the year and the purpose of the analysis a total of 352 samples were collected for isotopic measurements between july 2016 and october 2017 53 from rainfall 225 from shallow groundwater and the remaining 74 samples from streamflow table 1 about 280 discrete samples from rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow were used to characterize the watershed whereas samples collected during three rainfall events occurring near the beginning 7 july middle 23 august and end 12 october of the 2017 rainy season were used for pre event water estimation during each event 24 samples were collected 12 from rainfall and 12 from streamflow discrete rainfall samples were collected during the dry season in march and both discrete and continuous samples were collected during the rainy season from july to october the sampling interval during the rainy season was based on rainfall intensity but the maximum time interval between consecutive samplings did not exceed 30 minutes because a longer interval was considered to indicate the beginning of another rainfall event nyssen et al 2005 the samples were collected by using standard palmex rs1 rain sampler equipment http www rainsampler com portfolio page rain sampler rs1 rainwater enters the collecting bottle mounted in the rain sampler after passing through a funnel and a spiral intake tube designed to prevent isotopic fractionation wire spikes attached to the rim of the funnel keep birds away and a stainless steel mesh inside the funnel prevents dirt from entering the bottle among the more than 40 actively monitored hand dug wells 10 were selected for detailed assessments table 2 and fig 1 these 10 wells were selected to represent spatial differences in well cover status well depth and topography the topographic positions of the wells were classified as downslope mid slope or upslope tilahun et al 2020 depth to water fluctuations in all wells were monitored weekly and samples were collected monthly furthermore depth to water in two wells well 3 1 the most upstream well and well 11 4 the most downstream well were monitored and sampled weekly to assess spatial and temporal variations of the shallow groundwater during periods of low or no flow the water level depth at the watershed outlet was measured with a graduated staff gauge twice a day in the morning and evening at 08 00 and 18 00 local time streamflow samples were collected monthly from july 2016 until the stream dried up during the rainy season from june until october event based streamflow samples were also collected the stage depth discharge rating curve determined by fitting a power relationship developed by tilahun et al 2020 to the available depth and discharge measurements supplementary fig a 1 was used to estimate the stream flow rate at a given flow stage standard protocols of the international atomic energy agency iaea were followed for sample collection and δ18o and δ2h analyses mook and rozanski 2000 moges et al 2016 samples were collected in standard high density polyethylene bottles to reduce the effect of sunlight on isotopic fractionation samples were bottled capped and immediately sealed with parafilm sealing film to prevent isotopic fractionation due to leakage contamination condensation or evaporation the δ18o and δ2h isotopic compositions of the samples were determined at the isotope hydrology laboratory of the school of earth sciences at addis ababa university by using an lgr dlt 100 liquid water isotope analyzer precision 2 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o the 18o and 2h isotopic compositions are denoted as δ18o

rainy seasons as well as the annual lmwl by fitting a straight line to the δ18o δ2h relationship kebede and travi 2012 lemma et al 2020 the variations in the isotopic compositions of shallow groundwater in the study area were used to assess seasonal and spatial differences similarly the δ18o and δ2h values of the streamflow samples were used to construct the local evaporative line lel of the watershed the source of the streamflow can even be identified by intersecting the lmwl of the study area with the lel kebede et al 2009 liu et al 2016 2 4 determining the baseflow contribution of the hillslope aquifer to streamflow a two component ihs model was used to isolate the rapid and slow flow components of the streamflow hydrograph which correspond to direct runoff and baseflow respectively the flow components are assumed to be mixed before the flow reaches the watershed outlet the runoff represented by the fast response flow following a rainfall event usually lasts for only a short time whereas the baseflow is a slowly responding flow of subsurface origin that continues for an extended period following a rainfall event te et al 1988 mccuen 2005 the baseflow hydrograph of the watershed can be calculated by using eqs 3 5 and the rating curve of the watershed supplementary fig a 1 the pre event water fraction which is the contribution of the baseflow to streamflow was derived by the simple mass balance approach mcdonnell et al 1990 tekleab et al 2014 3 q t q p q e 4 c t q t c p q p c e q e where q t is streamflow q p and q e are the pre event baseflow and event water direct runoff contributions respectively and c t c p and c e are the isotopic compositions of the streamflow pre event and event waters respectively therefore the baseflow pre event water contribution was estimated by combining eqs 3 and 4 5 f p q p q t c t c e c p c e where f p is the baseflow pre event water contribution to streamflow thus the baseflow was calculated as 6 b f f p s f where f p is the estimated baseflow pre event water contribution expressed as a percentage and b f and s f are the baseflow and streamflow magnitudes respectively after the percentage contribution of baseflow pre event water over the storm duration was determined the predominant runoff generation mechanism of the three selected events i e at the beginning middle and end of the summer rainy season of 2017 was evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 wet and dry season local meteoric water lines for the robit bata watershed the isotopic compositions of rainfall in the watershed varied from 8 19 to 0 32 for δ18o and from 56 50 to 21 96 for δ2h fig 3 tekleab et al 2014 lemma et al 2020 and bedaso et al 2020 reported a similar large spatial and temporal variation in the isotopic composition of ethiopian rainfall the majority of the rainfall samples during the rainy season were enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 craig and gordon 1965 the constructed annual lmwl δ2h 8 63 δ18o 18 2 n 17 r 2 0 91 agrees with those reported by dansgaard 1964 kebede et al 2011 and tekleab et al 2014 tekleab et al 2014 and kebede et al 2011 obtained lmwls of δ2h 7 58 δ18o 17 6 and δ2h 8 δ18o 15 for the ubn basin and the lake tana sub basin respectively dansgaard 1964 also reported that the slope of the lmwl for ethiopian rainfall is exceptionally high between 8 and 10 and levin et al 2009 reported unusually higher isotopic values compared to those in similar environmental settings in africa and other parts of the world the lmwl of the robit bata watershed generally showed enrichment in heavy isotopes relative to the meteoric waters in the lake tana sub basin and addis ababa and it showed depletion relative to the lmwl of the ubn basin fig 4 a this isotopic enrichment of the ubn basin might result from greater interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere leading to a contribution from transpired moisture levin et al 2009 tekleab et al 2014 recently lemma et al 2020 and bedaso et al 2020 have even reported enriched rainfall signatures in the ethiopian highlands comparable to the lmwl of the study area furthermore the isotopic compositions of rainfall samples collected during the summer rainy season varied over a larger range than those of samples collected in march during the dry season and the lmwls also differed between the rainy δ2h 9 54 δ18o 24 07 n 12 r 2 0 97 and dry δ2h 3 81 δ18o 3 86 n 5 r 2 0 97 seasons fig 4b and 4c although the mean isotopic compositions of rainfall in the rainy and dry seasons differed between addis ababa and the robit bata watershed the rainy season lmwls of both showed heavy isotopic enrichment compared to the gmwl kebede and travi 2012 the average isotopic compositions of spring march rainfall δ18o 1 5 and δ2h 1 86 in the robit bata watershed were less depleted in heavy isotopes than those of summer rainfall δ18o 3 49 and δ2h 9 26 supplementary table a 1 the observed isotopic compositional variations during the dry and rainy seasons are likely related to seasonal differences in the sources of atmospheric moisture dansgaard 1964 levin et al 2009 costa et al 2014 lemma et al 2020 kebede and travi 2012 reported that the relative depletion of δ18o and the higher than global average d excess value δ2h 8 δ18o of summer rains at addis ababa are typical characteristics of sahel rains similarly the higher d excess values of summer rains 18 69 compared to spring rains 10 14 in the robit bata watershed supplementary table a 1 are mainly attributable to the moisture source and hydrological processes rather than to local evaporative enrichment kebede and travi 2012 bedaso et al 2020 in addition to the local moisture sources and air mass trajectories seasonal changes in ambient temperature and rainfall amount also affect the isotopic variations in rainfall especially spring rainfall rozanski et al 1993 kebede and travi 2012 jeelani et al 2013 another consideration is that the study area received less than the normal rainfall amount in june 2017 only about 50 mm compared to the long term average of more than 160 mm fig 2 which might have altered the isotopic composition of rainfall in the watershed 3 2 local evaporative line for the robit bata watershed the isotopic compositions of the streamflow ranged from 4 72 to 1 29 for δ18o and from 24 80 to 8 90 for δ2h furthermore the slope of the lel δ2h 5 46 δ18o 6 96 n 38 r 2 0 56 see fig 5 is in agreement with the slope of 5 6 reported by kebede et al 2011 for the lake tana sub basin and other ethiopian lakes kebede et al 2009 the higher intercept value obtained herein can be attributed to excessive evaporation due to the shallow depth of the streams in the watershed craig and gordon 1965 which eventually leads rivers and lakes to have different isotopic compositions yin et al 2011 3 3 spatiotemporal variations in shallow groundwater recharge and depth to water the shallow groundwater of the robit bata watershed showed isotopic variations in both space and time supplementary table a 2 table a 3 and fig a 2 the isotopic compositions of shallow groundwater in the watershed varied between 4 68 and 0 93 for δ18o and between 19 20 and 9 50 for δ2h these narrow ranges of isotopic variation compared with those of the local rainfall see fig 3 together with most points falling below the lmwl indicate that the shallow groundwater is being recharged by infiltration of local rainfall kebede 2012 yin et al 2011 tan et al 2016 nigate et al 2016 the isotopic signature of the shallow groundwater in the study area mostly showed heavy isotopic enrichment and was comparable to the local rainfall signature fig 3 this finding further confirms the contribution of rainfall to shallow groundwater levels kebede et al 2001 tan et al 2016 2017 which was supported by high specific yield tilahun et al 2020 and transmissivity values attributable to the highly porous fractured basalt formation and the resulting short residence time nigate et al 2016 however because most of the monitored wells were open table 2 and shallow yin et al 2011 the observed enrichment might partly reflect evaporation kebede 2012 related to higher surface water temperatures in the wells and correspondingly increased evaporation rozanski et al 1993 the weekly recorded depth to water in the monitored wells fluctuated more than those recorded monthly for example a depth to water rise of 9 8 m was measured within just one week between 16 and 23 july 2017 in well 4 4 supplementary table a 4 similarly the depth to water in the upstream and downstream wells wells 3 1 and 11 2 respectively rose by 4 15 and 4 1 m respectively during the same period tilahun et al 2020 reported that groundwater levels in wells are elevated in september near the end of the rainy season and remain elevated in october these rapid rises in the depth to water confirm that the response of the shallow groundwater to rainfall is rapid kebede et al 2001 gonzales et al 2009 tilahun et al 2020 nevertheless there is no clear pattern observed between the depth to water measurements and the isotopic composition in shallow wells fig 6 the δ18o isotopic compositions are found to be less affected by water depth fluctuations than δ2h overall δ2h showed a depletion in heavy isotopes as water tables rose during the summer season the wider range of isotopic variation in the most downstream well well 11 4 compared to the most upstream well well 3 1 supplementary fig a 2 may reflect a combination of atmospheric exposure and hydrological interactions occurring downslope in the aquifer a stronger correlation between δ18o and δ2h was found for the water samples taken in the downslope wells compared to the mid slope and upslope locations fig 7 however the isotopic composition of wells showed significant temporal differences but no considerable spatial variation across the watershed 3 4 determining the shallow groundwater contribution of rainfall events the isotopic values of the most downstream well well 11 4 prior to a rainfall event were used to calculate the shallow groundwater contribution to streamflow blume et al 2008 well 11 4 was assumed to be most representative to pre event water signature of the streamflow given its proximity to the watershed outlet and the fast rainfall runoff response of the watershed a summary of descriptive statistical analyzes were made between endmembers before hydrograph separation supplementary table a 5 the isotopic compositions of rainfall and streamflow samples from the three selected events supplementary table a 6 were used to calculate the percentage of pre event water fractions in this study the bf magnitude was obtained by multiplying the sf magnitude by the pre event fraction at the time of the streamflow measurement eq 6 differences in pre event water estimations were found depending on whether 18o or 2h was used because the latter is more sensitive to fractionation because of its light atomic weight mook and rozanski 2000 the durations of the selected streamflow events in july august and october were about 3 h 10 min 2 h 50 min and 3 h 25 min respectively and the associated peak discharges were 6 3 12 0 and 17 8 m3 s respectively fig 8 table 3 the peak flow of the pre event water occurred about the same time as the peak flow observed in the stream on average pre event water accounted for about 57 of streamflow in july and about 81 in august and october considered together with the spatiotemporal variations in the shallow water table these findings suggest that runoff occurred by two different mechanisms at different times and locations in the watershed in july the pre event water accounted for up to 47 δ18o on the rising limb and up to 88 to 97 δ2h after the peak discharge was reached table 3 overall the watershed showed a relatively high infiltration capacity as rainfall intensity exceeded the infiltration rate by only 2 2 5 at upslope and mid slope locations and by about 20 at downslope locations tilahun et al 2020 hence at the onset of the rainy season when storage space is maximal most of the generated runoff is likely related to low infiltration i e infiltration excess overland flow when rainfall coincides with land preparation abidela hussein et al 2019 because the topsoil is shielded pre event water started to dominate the streamflow in august and october see table 3 and fig 8 as the rainy season progressed and pore spaces filled up the pre event water contribution increased to an average of 79 δ2h or 83 δ18o in august table 3 similarly pre event water in october was estimated to account for from 68 to 95 δ18o or from 45 to 97 δ2h of streamflow table 3 despite the differences in event duration and peak discharge the pre event water contribution to streamflow was the same about 81 for the events in august and october this result suggests that rainfall events contributed less to shallow groundwater as the maximum groundwater storage had been reached tilahun et al 2020 depth to water in the downstream area well 11 4 increased by 1 85 m i e from 2 45 m to 0 6 m depth between july and august but by only 0 1 m i e from 0 6 m to 0 5 m depth between august and october supplementary table a 4 these results indicate that the runoff mechanism around the middle to the end of the rainy season was dominated by saturation excess overland flow as valley bottoms become saturated this was also confirmed by tilahun et al 2020 who identified that the maximum storage in the watershed was reached at the end of the rainy phase in september similar temporal shifts from infiltration to saturation excess runoff generation processes were reported by camacho suarez et al 2015 tekleab et al 2014 and tilahun et al 2016 in different studies in the ubn basin related responses to the different levels of watershed saturation in addition to the subsurface geologic conditions land use land cover and or associated management conditions can also affect the preferential flow path of water in watersheds wenjie et al 2011 orlowski et al 2016 3 5 limitations to determining shallow groundwater contributions of hillslope aquifers with irrigation practices in principle the percentage baseflow pre event water contribution to total streamflow should vary between 0 when streamflow consists entirely of event water and 100 when it consists entirely of pre event water dewalle et al 1988 mcdonnell et al 1991 blume et al 2008 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 however some results in this study were as low as 740 and as high as 681 in july see table 3 although it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of this variability it may be related to contributions to the hillslope aquifer from isotopically different sources such as water in fractures in the basalt bedrock irrigation water in the soil pores that experienced fractionation during several evapotranspiration cycles and or high levels of evaporation from the wells because most of the wells are shallow and open by using the two component ihs method negative pre event fractions were found when the isotopic composition of either the streamflow or pre event water was enriched or depleted in heavy isotopes compared to the event water in contrast unrealistic positive pre event water fractions were found when both the streamflow and pre event water compositions were either enriched or depleted compared to the event water 4 conclusion and recommendations this study characterized the local rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow sources with their isotopic compositions to understand the spatiotemporal variation of shallow groundwater and its contribution to streamflow in robit bata watershed the results indicated that the local rainfall was the main source of water to the hillslope aquifer and responsible for the rapid fluctuations of shallow groundwater levels the contribution of pre event water gradually increased throughout the rainy season as storage increased hence the highest pre event water contribution corresponded to the maximum storage being reached in october this corresponded to earlier studies in the same watershed and confirmed that the dominant runoff generation mechanism changes as watershed storage progresses in the rainy season our results also indicated that the shallow groundwater moves rapidly downslope so in the absence of additional sub surface storage it leaves the watershed and flows into lake tana hence sustainable expansion of irrigation would require a combination of conjunctive and integrated watershed management practices to increase the managed aquifer recharge in the downstream area saturated valley bottoms supporting shallow groundwater use during the dry season and the determination of the ecological flows necessary to preserve ecosystems downstream of robit bata watershed given the current

shallow hillslope aquifers to streamflow in the robit bata watershed to assess the spatiotemporal variability of shallow groundwater and develop a hydrograph separation technique we collected rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow samples and analyzed their δ18o and δ2h isotopic compositions the local meteoric water line lmwl and local evaporative line lel of the study area were determined and compared with the global meteoric water line gmwl a standard unweighted two component isotope based hydrograph separation model was used to determine the percentage contribution of shallow groundwater

separation stable oxygen isotope stable deuterium isotope runoff generation process drought prone 1 introduction baseflow is the portion of previously stored subsurface water in groundwater aquifers that enters the streamflow regardless of rainfall events hewlett and hibbert 1967 it is also the slowly responding component of streamflow with long lasting effect on the flow duncan 2019 baseflow in streams is termed pre event water it can significantly contribute to streamflow depending on climate watershed hydrogeology and the main rainfall runoff mechanisms sklash and farvolden 1979 moore 1989 ogunkoya and jenkins 1991 gonzales et al 2009 camacho suarez et al 2015 estimating available baseflow from shallow groundwater resources is of paramount importance for supporting adaptive integrated water resource management in agriculture led economies however estimating the baseflow contribution remains difficult especially in mountainous areas with hillslope aquifers conventional techniques for baseflow separation include graphical and empirical approaches linsley and kohler 1958 and the use of geochemical tracers pinder and jones 1969 most engineering practices still use various empirically based straight line graphical techniques e g te et al 1988 mccuen 2005 subramanya 2013 to separate baseflow from the storm hydrograph the numerous proposed baseflow separation models and algorithms use different assumptions e g sloto and crouse 1996 rutledge 1998 arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2005 lim et al 2005 piggott et al 2005 tongal and booij 2018 but they all rely on the availability of continuous streamflow measurements and hydrologic datasets which is a major problem in the global south where networks of hydro meteorological stations are sparse and may be poorly maintained in data scarce and complex landscapes isotopic techniques are proven alternatives for determining hydrological processes and the contribution of baseflow to a storm hydrograph kebede 2012 the first isotope based hydrograph separation ihs techniques developed in the early 1970s used tritium which is naturally abundant and is not adsorbed by soil particles crouzet et al 1970 dincer et al 1970 martinec et al 1974 subsequent studies used the naturally abundant stable isotopes oxygen 18 δ18o dincer et al 1970 sklash et al 1976 and deuterium δ2h herrmann and stichler 1980 during the past 50 years the use of naturally abundant stable isotopes has greatly advanced the field of watershed hydrology klaus and mcdonnell 2013 ihs methods have been widely used in humid temperate regions and they have also been successfully applied in other climatic regions and in watersheds with complex hydrogeology kebede 2012 camacho suarez et al 2015 hydrograph separation techniques based on the δ18o and δ2h isotopic compositions of water have advantages over graphical and geochemical techniques because they do not depend on the pressure response in the channel klaus and mcdonnell 2013 instead δ18o and δ2h are stable and occur naturally in water making them ideal conservative tracers they occur naturally in rainfall and their fractionation is influenced by evaporation and condensation bonell et al 1990 buttle 1994 they can thus be used to trace rainwater as it follows the hydrological pathways in a watershed and mixes with groundwater and stream water beven 2011 although studies with relatively coarse spatial and temporal sampling resolutions have been conducted in medium and large basins only a few attempts have been made to use isotopic approaches to characterize shallow groundwater behavior in the upper blue nile ubn basin and estimate its contribution to streamflow e g kebede et al 2006 2011 tekleab et al 2014 furthermore these studies did not address the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of isotopic signatures in local rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow in small scale watersheds blume et al 2008 camacho suarez et al 2015 the mid term and long term future climate change predictions of the 21st century for the ubn basin projected a decline in rainfall and a rise in temperature which will result in a decrease in the total water yield and an increase in evapotranspiration mengistu et al 2021 worku et al 2021 in addition climate change is projected to impact groundwater resources by decreasing the contribution of groundwater to streamflow tigabu et al 2020 or declining the contribution of baseflow to total water yield mengistu et al 2021 therefore estimating the available groundwater resource is vital for future groundwater utilization in support of food and nutrition security in the region especially for drought prone areas the aim of this study therefore was to characterize the contribution of shallow groundwater to streamflow in a small scale watershed with a hillslope aquifer in the sub humid ethiopian highlands the specific objectives were 1 to characterize the watershed according to the local isotopic signatures of rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow by sampling them at high spatiotemporal resolution and 2 to develop a model using the isotopic values of the endmembers to quantify the shallow groundwater contribution pre event water to streamflow by providing important input to stakeholders and decision makers the findings of this study will promote the sustainable intensification of agriculture through small scale irrigation as part of an integrated watershed management approach and contribute to national efforts to build climate resilience in smallholder farming systems in areas of ethiopia with similar hydrogeology 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area the robit bata watershed 37 26 49 37 29 57 e 11 38 30 11 40 59 n is an experimental watershed in the ubn basin southeast of lake tana that drains into the lake fig 1 the watershed area is about 1 034 ha measured using the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm 30 m digital elevation model dem https earthexplorer usgs gov it ranges in elevation from 1 800 to 2 029 m a s l with an average elevation of 1 913 m a s l slope gradients range from 0 to 37 and in more than 50 of the area the slope gradient exceeds 7 the spatial analyses were carried out in the arcgis environment the watershed is located in a region of the ethiopian highlands with a wet weyna dega sub humid agro ecological climate hurni et al 2016 where most 75 of rain falls from june to september during the kiremt summer rainy season and the remaining 25 from march to may during the belg spring rainy season nmsa 1996 kebede and travi 2012 seasonal moisture sources in the ethiopian highlands are strongly influenced by the migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the moisture for summer rains in northwestern ethiopia is derived mainly from the atlantic ocean whereas the northern indian ocean is the source for spring rains in the study area the mean daily temperature is about 20 c and the average annual rainfall exceeds 1 400 mm based on long term records of the bahir dar meteorological station since 1961 fig 2 in the watershed massive basalt bedrock crops out in riverbeds and occasionally on steeper slopes and in quarries on broad hillslopes a weathered basalt regolith overlies the bedrock and red soils with a limited tillage depth 30 cm have developed in the upper part of the regolith floodplains in the watershed are composed of thick clayey alluvial sediments chromic vertisols are predominant in the lower part of the watershed and eutric nitosols are predominant in the upper part abidela hussein et al 2019 land use in 85 of the watershed consists of crop livestock systems and 13 of the agricultural land is irrigated using shallow groundwater during the dry season land cover in the rest of the watershed is bush land or eucalyptus tree forest the main annual crops are finger millet and maize which are grown during the kiremt or monsoon june october vegetables are grown in the dry season october march and fruits and khat are perennial crops that are grown with supplemental irrigation during the dry season the watershed was first established in 2015 as an experimental watershed through a collaboration between bahir dar university and the international water management institute the collaboratoin aims to improve rural livelihoods through the development of sustainable shallow groundwater irrigation hence to estimate the potential of shallow groundwater for irrigation instruments were installed in the watershed for investigating the interaction of surface and subsurface waters this instrumentation included rain gauges and rain samplers depth to water monitoring equipment in hand dug wells and gauges at the watershed outlet and at outlets of sub watersheds 2 2 measurements sampling and laboratory analyses spatial and temporal variations in the δ2h and δ18o isotopic compositions of water were used to characterize the watershed water samples were collected from three different sources rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow the measurement and sampling frequencies depended on the water source the time of the year and the purpose of the analysis a total of 352 samples were collected for isotopic measurements between july 2016 and october 2017 53 from rainfall 225 from shallow groundwater and the remaining 74 samples from streamflow table 1 about 280 discrete samples from rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow were used to characterize the watershed whereas samples collected during three rainfall events occurring near the beginning 7 july middle 23 august and end 12 october of the 2017 rainy season were used for pre event water estimation during each event 24 samples were collected 12 from rainfall and 12 from streamflow discrete rainfall samples were collected during the dry season in march and both discrete and continuous samples were collected during the rainy season from july to october the sampling interval during the rainy season was based on rainfall intensity but the maximum time interval between consecutive samplings did not exceed 30 minutes because a longer interval was considered to indicate the beginning of another rainfall event nyssen et al 2005 the samples were collected by using standard palmex rs1 rain sampler equipment http www rainsampler com portfolio page rain sampler rs1 rainwater enters the collecting bottle mounted in the rain sampler after passing through a funnel and a spiral intake tube designed to prevent isotopic fractionation wire spikes attached to the rim of the funnel keep birds away and a stainless steel mesh inside the funnel prevents dirt from entering the bottle among the more than 40 actively monitored hand dug wells 10 were selected for detailed assessments table 2 and fig 1 these 10 wells were selected to represent spatial differences in well cover status well depth and topography the topographic positions of the wells were classified as downslope mid slope or upslope tilahun et al 2020 depth to water fluctuations in all wells were monitored weekly and samples were collected monthly furthermore depth to water in two wells well 3 1 the most upstream well and well 11 4 the most downstream well were monitored and sampled weekly to assess spatial and temporal variations of the shallow groundwater during periods of low or no flow the water level depth at the watershed outlet was measured with a graduated staff gauge twice a day in the morning and evening at 08 00 and 18 00 local time streamflow samples were collected monthly from july 2016 until the stream dried up during the rainy season from june until october event based streamflow samples were also collected the stage depth discharge rating curve determined by fitting a power relationship developed by tilahun et al 2020 to the available depth and discharge measurements supplementary fig a 1 was used to estimate the stream flow rate at a given flow stage standard protocols of the international atomic energy agency iaea were followed for sample collection and δ18o and δ2h analyses mook and rozanski 2000 moges et al 2016 samples were collected in standard high density polyethylene bottles to reduce the effect of sunlight on isotopic fractionation samples were bottled capped and immediately sealed with parafilm sealing film to prevent isotopic fractionation due to leakage contamination condensation or evaporation the δ18o and δ2h isotopic compositions of the samples were determined at the isotope hydrology laboratory of the school of earth sciences at addis ababa university by using an lgr dlt 100 liquid water isotope analyzer precision 2 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o the 18o and 2h isotopic compositions are denoted as δ18o

rainy seasons as well as the annual lmwl by fitting a straight line to the δ18o δ2h relationship kebede and travi 2012 lemma et al 2020 the variations in the isotopic compositions of shallow groundwater in the study area were used to assess seasonal and spatial differences similarly the δ18o and δ2h values of the streamflow samples were used to construct the local evaporative line lel of the watershed the source of the streamflow can even be identified by intersecting the lmwl of the study area with the lel kebede et al 2009 liu et al 2016 2 4 determining the baseflow contribution of the hillslope aquifer to streamflow a two component ihs model was used to isolate the rapid and slow flow components of the streamflow hydrograph which correspond to direct runoff and baseflow respectively the flow components are assumed to be mixed before the flow reaches the watershed outlet the runoff represented by the fast response flow following a rainfall event usually lasts for only a short time whereas the baseflow is a slowly responding flow of subsurface origin that continues for an extended period following a rainfall event te et al 1988 mccuen 2005 the baseflow hydrograph of the watershed can be calculated by using eqs 3 5 and the rating curve of the watershed supplementary fig a 1 the pre event water fraction which is the contribution of the baseflow to streamflow was

water direct runoff contributions respectively and c t c p and c e are the isotopic compositions of the streamflow pre event and event waters respectively therefore the baseflow pre event water contribution was estimated by combining eqs 3 and 4 5 f p q p q t c t c e c p c e where f p is the baseflow pre event water contribution to streamflow thus the baseflow was calculated as 6 b f f p s f where f p is the estimated baseflow pre event water contribution expressed as a percentage and b f and s f are the baseflow and streamflow magnitudes respectively after the percentage contribution of baseflow pre event water over the storm duration was determined the predominant runoff generation mechanism of the three selected events i e at the beginning middle and end of the summer rainy season of 2017 was evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 wet and dry season local meteoric water lines for the robit bata watershed the isotopic compositions of rainfall in the watershed varied from 8 19 to 0 32 for δ18o and from 56 50 to 21 96 for δ2h fig 3 tekleab et al 2014 lemma et al 2020 and bedaso et al 2020 reported a similar large spatial and temporal variation in the isotopic composition of ethiopian rainfall the majority of the rainfall samples during the rainy season were enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 craig and gordon 1965 the constructed annual lmwl δ2h 8 63 δ18o 18 2 n 17 r 2 0 91 agrees with those reported by dansgaard 1964 kebede et al 2011 and tekleab et al 2014 tekleab et al 2014 and kebede et al 2011 obtained lmwls of δ2h 7 58 δ18o 17 6 and δ2h 8 δ18o 15 for the ubn basin and the lake tana sub basin respectively dansgaard 1964 also reported that the slope of the lmwl for ethiopian rainfall is exceptionally high between 8 and 10 and levin et al 2009 reported unusually higher isotopic values compared to those in similar environmental settings in africa and other parts of the world the lmwl of the robit bata watershed generally showed enrichment in heavy isotopes relative to the meteoric waters in the lake tana sub basin and addis ababa and it showed depletion relative to the lmwl of the ubn basin fig 4 a this isotopic enrichment of the ubn basin might result from greater interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere leading to a contribution from transpired moisture levin et al 2009 tekleab et al 2014 recently lemma et al 2020 and bedaso et al 2020 have even reported enriched rainfall signatures in the ethiopian highlands comparable to the lmwl of the study area furthermore the isotopic compositions of rainfall samples collected during the summer rainy season varied over a larger range than those of samples collected in march during the dry season and the lmwls also differed between the rainy δ2h 9 54 δ18o 24 07 n 12 r 2 0 97 and dry δ2h 3 81 δ18o 3 86 n 5 r 2 0 97 seasons fig 4b and 4c although the mean isotopic compositions of rainfall in the rainy and dry seasons differed between addis ababa and the robit bata watershed the rainy season lmwls of both showed heavy isotopic enrichment compared to the gmwl kebede and travi 2012 the average isotopic compositions of spring march rainfall δ18o 1 5 and δ2h 1 86 in the robit bata watershed were less depleted in heavy isotopes than those of summer rainfall δ18o 3 49 and δ2h 9 26 supplementary table a 1 the observed isotopic compositional variations during the dry and rainy seasons are likely related to seasonal differences in the sources of atmospheric moisture dansgaard 1964 levin et al 2009 costa et al 2014 lemma et al 2020 kebede and travi 2012 reported that the relative depletion of δ18o and the higher than global average d excess value δ2h 8 δ18o of summer rains at addis ababa are typical characteristics of sahel rains similarly the higher d excess values of summer rains 18 69 compared to spring rains 10 14 in the robit bata watershed supplementary table a 1 are mainly attributable to the moisture source and hydrological processes rather than to local evaporative enrichment kebede and travi 2012 bedaso et al 2020 in addition to the local moisture sources and air mass trajectories seasonal changes in ambient temperature and rainfall amount also affect the isotopic variations in rainfall especially spring rainfall rozanski et al 1993 kebede and travi 2012 jeelani et al 2013 another consideration is that the study area received less than the normal rainfall amount in june 2017 only about 50 mm compared to the long term average of more than 160 mm fig 2 which might have altered the isotopic composition of rainfall in the watershed 3 2 local evaporative line for the robit bata watershed the isotopic compositions of the streamflow ranged from 4 72 to 1 29 for δ18o and from 24 80 to 8 90 for δ2h furthermore the slope of the lel δ2h 5 46 δ18o 6 96 n 38 r 2 0 56 see fig 5 is in agreement with the slope of 5 6 reported by kebede et al 2011 for the lake tana sub basin and other ethiopian lakes kebede et al 2009 the higher intercept value obtained herein can be attributed to excessive evaporation due to the shallow depth of the streams in the watershed craig and gordon 1965 which eventually leads rivers and lakes to have different isotopic compositions yin et al 2011 3 3 spatiotemporal variations in shallow groundwater recharge and depth to water the shallow groundwater of the robit bata watershed showed isotopic variations in both space and time supplementary table a 2 table a 3 and fig a 2 the isotopic compositions of shallow groundwater in the watershed varied between 4 68 and 0 93 for δ18o and between 19 20 and 9 50 for δ2h these narrow ranges of isotopic variation compared with those of the local rainfall see fig 3 together with most points falling below the lmwl indicate that the shallow groundwater is being recharged by infiltration of local rainfall kebede 2012 yin et al 2011 tan et al 2016 nigate et al 2016 the isotopic signature of the shallow groundwater in the study area mostly showed heavy isotopic enrichment and was comparable to the local rainfall signature fig 3 this finding further confirms the contribution of rainfall to shallow groundwater levels kebede et al 2001 tan et al 2016 2017 which was supported by high specific yield tilahun et al 2020 and transmissivity values attributable to the highly porous fractured basalt formation and the resulting short residence time nigate et al 2016 however because most of the monitored wells were open table 2 and shallow yin et al 2011 the observed enrichment might partly reflect evaporation kebede 2012 related to higher surface water temperatures in the wells and correspondingly increased evaporation rozanski et al 1993 the weekly recorded depth to water in the monitored wells fluctuated more than those recorded monthly for example a depth to water rise of 9 8 m was measured within just one week between 16 and 23 july 2017 in well 4 4 supplementary table a 4 similarly the depth to water in the upstream and downstream wells wells 3 1 and 11 2 respectively rose by 4 15 and 4 1 m respectively during the same period tilahun et al 2020 reported that groundwater levels in wells are elevated in september near the end of the rainy season and remain elevated in october these rapid rises in the depth to water confirm that the response of the shallow groundwater to rainfall is rapid kebede et al 2001 gonzales et al 2009 tilahun et al 2020 nevertheless there is no clear pattern observed between the depth to water measurements and the isotopic composition in shallow wells fig 6 the δ18o isotopic compositions are found to be less affected by water depth fluctuations than δ2h overall δ2h showed a depletion in heavy isotopes as water tables rose during the summer season the wider range of isotopic variation in the most downstream well well 11 4 compared to the most upstream well well 3 1 supplementary fig a 2 may reflect a combination of atmospheric exposure and hydrological interactions occurring downslope in the aquifer a stronger correlation between δ18o and δ2h was found for the water samples taken in the downslope wells compared to the mid slope and upslope locations fig 7 however the isotopic composition of wells showed significant temporal differences but no considerable spatial variation across the watershed 3 4 determining the shallow groundwater contribution of rainfall events the isotopic values of the most downstream well well 11 4 prior to a rainfall event were used to calculate the shallow groundwater contribution to streamflow blume et al 2008 well 11 4 was assumed to be most representative to pre event water signature of the streamflow given its proximity to the watershed outlet and the fast rainfall runoff response of the watershed a summary of descriptive statistical analyzes were made between endmembers before hydrograph separation supplementary table a 5 the isotopic compositions of rainfall and streamflow samples from the three selected events supplementary table a 6 were used to calculate the percentage of pre event water fractions in this study the bf magnitude was obtained by multiplying the sf magnitude by the pre event fraction at the time of the streamflow measurement eq 6 differences in pre event water estimations were found depending on whether 18o or 2h was used because the latter is more sensitive to fractionation because of its light atomic weight mook and rozanski 2000 the durations of the selected streamflow events in july august and october were about 3 h 10 min 2 h 50 min and 3 h 25 min respectively and the associated peak discharges were 6 3 12 0 and 17 8 m3 s respectively fig 8 table 3 the peak flow of the pre event water occurred about the same time as the peak flow observed in the stream on average pre event water accounted for about 57 of streamflow in july and about 81 in august and october considered together with the spatiotemporal variations in the shallow water table these findings suggest that runoff occurred by two different mechanisms at different times and locations in the watershed in july the pre event water accounted for up to 47 δ18o on the rising limb and up to 88 to 97 δ2h after the peak discharge was reached table 3 overall the watershed showed a relatively high infiltration capacity as rainfall intensity exceeded the infiltration rate by only 2 2 5 at upslope and mid slope locations and by about 20 at downslope locations tilahun et al 2020 hence at the onset of the rainy season when storage space is maximal most of the generated runoff is likely related to low infiltration i e infiltration excess overland flow when rainfall coincides with land preparation abidela hussein et al 2019 because the topsoil is shielded pre event water started to dominate the streamflow in august and october see table 3 and fig 8 as the rainy season progressed and pore spaces filled up the pre event water contribution increased to an average of 79 δ2h or 83 δ18o in august table 3 similarly pre event water in october was estimated to account for from 68 to 95 δ18o or from 45 to 97 δ2h of streamflow table 3 despite the differences in event duration and peak discharge the pre event water contribution to streamflow was the same about 81 for the events in august and october this result suggests that rainfall events contributed less to shallow groundwater as the maximum groundwater storage had been reached tilahun et al 2020 depth to water in the downstream area well 11 4 increased by 1 85 m i e from 2 45 m to 0 6 m depth between july and august but by only 0 1 m i e from 0 6 m to 0 5 m depth between august and october supplementary table a 4 these results indicate that the runoff mechanism around the middle to the end of the rainy season was dominated by saturation excess overland flow as valley bottoms become saturated this was also confirmed by tilahun et al 2020 who identified that the maximum storage in the watershed was reached at the end of the rainy phase in september similar temporal shifts from infiltration to saturation excess runoff generation processes were reported by camacho suarez et al 2015 tekleab et al 2014 and tilahun et al 2016 in different studies in the ubn basin related responses to the different levels of watershed saturation in addition to the subsurface geologic conditions land use land cover and or associated management conditions can also affect the preferential flow path of water in watersheds wenjie et al 2011 orlowski et al 2016 3 5 limitations to determining shallow groundwater contributions of hillslope aquifers with irrigation practices in principle the percentage baseflow pre event water contribution to total streamflow should vary between 0 when streamflow consists entirely of event water and 100 when it consists entirely of pre event water dewalle et al 1988 mcdonnell et al 1991 blume et al 2008 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 however some results in this study were as low as 740 and as high as 681 in july see table 3 although it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of this variability it may be related to contributions to the hillslope aquifer from isotopically different sources such as water in fractures in the basalt bedrock irrigation water in the soil pores that experienced fractionation during several evapotranspiration cycles and or high levels of evaporation from the wells because most of the wells are shallow and open by using the two component ihs method negative pre event fractions were found when the isotopic composition of either the streamflow or pre event water was enriched or depleted in heavy isotopes compared to the event water in contrast unrealistic positive pre event water fractions were found when both the streamflow and pre event water compositions were either enriched or depleted compared to the event water 4 conclusion and recommendations this study characterized the local rainfall shallow groundwater and streamflow sources with their isotopic compositions to understand the spatiotemporal variation of shallow groundwater and its contribution to streamflow in robit bata watershed the results indicated that the local rainfall was the main source of water to the hillslope aquifer and responsible for the rapid fluctuations of shallow groundwater levels the contribution of pre event water gradually increased throughout the rainy season as storage increased hence the highest pre event water contribution corresponded to the maximum storage being reached in october this corresponded to earlier studies in the same watershed and confirmed that the dominant runoff generation mechanism changes as watershed storage progresses in the rainy season our results also indicated that the shallow groundwater moves rapidly downslope so in the absence of additional sub surface storage it leaves the watershed and flows into lake tana hence sustainable expansion of irrigation would require a combination of conjunctive and integrated watershed management practices to increase the managed aquifer recharge in the downstream area saturated valley bottoms supporting shallow groundwater use during the dry season and the determination of the ecological flows necessary to preserve ecosystems downstream of robit bata watershed given the current

8147,study region europe a total of 660 522 and 4940 soil samples belonging to grizzly hypres and eu hydi databases respectively were used for parametric evaluation study focus the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions are crucial input information for land surface models determining these functions by using direct methods is hampered by excessive time and unaffordable costs required for field activities and laboratory analyses pedotransfer functions ptfs are widely used indirect techniques enabling soil hydraulic properties to be predicted by using easily retrievable soil information in a parametric evaluation the predictive capability of ptfs is examined by comparing measured and estimated soil water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity yet information about the performance of ptfs for specific modeling applications is mandatory to evaluate ptf effectiveness in greater depth this approach is commonly defined as functional evaluation new hydrological insights for the region the best performing four ptfs selected in the parametric evaluations are tested under two functional evaluations the first encompasses a spatial interpolation with a geostatistical technique whereas the second employs hydrus 1d to simulate the water balance components along an experimental transect our results reinforce and integrate the insights of previous studies about the use of a ptf and highlight the ability or inability of this technique to adequately reproduce the observed spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties and simulated water fluxes keywords water retention function saturated hydraulic conductivity semi variogram kriging functional evaluation hydrus 1d 1 introduction modeling large scale soil water balance for applications in for instance irrigation groundwater recharge or sustainable water resources management requires massive input data of the water retention function wrf and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks direct measurements of wrf are generally determined by conventional laboratory techniques using the hanging water column or the suction tables dane and hopmans 2002 the constant or falling head method is commonly used for measuring ks reynolds and elrick 2002 the simultaneous determination of wrf and hydraulic conductivity function hcf via inverse modeling transient flow experiments is often carried out in the laboratory using composite equipment that is used to impose a multi step outflow or an evaporation process in a soil sample leaving aside for the time being the issue of in situ experiments together with the endless debate between field and laboratory tests so far the hydrological community has considered the above mentioned laboratory techniques as precise and reliable hopmans et al 2002 schelle et al 2010 however despite several attempts at simplification schindler and müller 2006 peters and durner 2008 figueras and gribb 2009 nasta et al 2011 these approaches are still expensive tedious and time consuming hence their use remains quite unrealistic for large scale applications ptfs are statistical tools that relate soil hydraulic properties estimands to easily measurable soil physico chemical parameters predictors guber et al 2006 van looy et al 2017 the availability of recent global scale digital maps of soil physical and chemical properties provides high quality and detailed high spatial resolution information to support the implementation of ptfs for modeling applications such as soilgrids 250 m hengl et al 2017 and its recently updated version soilgrids 2 0 batjes et al 2020 de sousa et al 2021 four main groups categories of ptfs exist tietje and tapkenhinrichs 1993 the first group of ptfs proposes look up tables called class ptfs listing average parameters in each texture class nonetheless the recent availability of basic soil physical and chemical properties at a very high spatial resolution can make this type of ptf obsolete in fact the use of average parameters in a soil texture class oversimplifies model parameterization by completely missing the spatial variability over a study area the second group of ptfs called point ptfs estimates soil water contents at fixed matric head values such as field capacity and wilting point petersen et al 1968 gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 canarache 1993 bruand et al 1994 the third group of ptfs called semi physical ptfs comprises physically sound but semi empirical models based on the assumption of shape similarity between the particle size distribution and pore size distribution arya and paris 1981 haverkamp and parlange 1986 nimmo et al 2007 mohammadi and vanclooster 2011 mohammadi and meskini vishkaee 2013 the fourth group of ptfs called parameter ptfs is based on the data driven estimation of parameters featuring in the most widespread wrf equations van genuchten 1980 brooks and corey 1964 with multiple regression equations or more complex machine learning approaches such as artificial neural networks support vector machines and random forest rudiyanto et al 2021 in general multiple linear regression is often used for developing a ptf in an analytical form that can then be easily implemented by other users ptfs derived by machine learning techniques often outperform the predictions obtained by the multiple linear regression but can be used by other researchers only if they are built in a user friendly platform zhang and schaap 2017 araya and ghezzehei 2019 szabó et al 2021 the predictive capability of a ptf is commonly tested by a parametric evaluation that analyzes the errors between measured and ptf predicted soil hydraulic properties however a parametric evaluation would not necessarily provide information about the performance of a ptf when its predictions should be employed for computer modeling simulations beyond parametric accuracy and precision it is therefore recommended to use functional criteria to compare model outputs when soil behavior is parameterized by using either measured or predicted soil hydraulic properties for this reason vereecken et al 1992 defined functional evaluation as the statistical examination of the variability in the outcome of a simulation model for a specific application when the variability arises solely from uncertainty in the ptfs large scale model applications depend on ptf quality hence on the impact of epistemic uncertainties associated with the spatial variations of predicted soil hydraulic properties or the water fluxes simulated by a hydrological model as pointed out by pringle et al 2007 another issue requiring due attention is the selection of the most suitable spatial scale in which a certain ptf can provide optimal performances in the wake of the paper written by pringle et al 2007 and allowing for the recent progress in the development of ptfs this study aims primarily to investigate the ability of a ptf to reproduce adequately the observed variations in soil hydraulic parameters over a range of spatial scales from relatively large areas to transects the impact of epistemic errors introduced when using a ptf in land surface models is mostly unknown but any effort should be made to reduce them beven 2013 for this reason due consideration should be given to assessing model uncertainty at least in practical field scale modeling applications the objective of this study is twofold i using a parametric evaluation to critically revise a set of existing ptfs on three large european soil hydraulic data sets to select the best performing ones which are subsequently tested under a functional perspective ii running two functional evaluations to analyze the epistemic errors generated when ptf predicted soil hydraulic properties are used instead of those directly measured 2 materials and methods 2 1 inventory of existing pedotransfer functions 2 1 1 estimation of soil water retention function wrf the wrf θ ψ relates the volumetric soil water content θ cm3 cm 3 to soil matric head ψ cm among several options the most widespread equation describing the wrf is the van genuchten model hereafter referred to as vg van genuchten 1980 li et al 2014 1 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m w i t h m 1 1 n where θr cm3 cm 3 and θs cm3 cm 3 are the residual and saturated soil water contents respectively α cm 1 is a scale parameter and m and n are shape parameters θs is measured according to the protocol suggested by topp and ferré 2002 and is slightly lower than soil porosity por as calculated through the following equation kotlar et al 2019 2 p o r 1 ρ b ρ d where ρb is the oven dry soil bulk density g cm 3 and ρd is the particle density g cm 3 assumed on average to be equal to 2 65 g cm 3 the degree of saturation is defined as se θ θr θs θr and varies from 0 θ θr to 1 θ θs knowledge of the wrf enables to determine two key soil hydraulic parameters of bucket type hydrological models romano et al 2011 the first parameter is the soil water content at the permanent wilting point θwp which is commonly computed as θ at the matric head ψ 15 300 cm i e a soil matric head of 15 bars but the validity of this threshold for different plant species is still under debate torres et al 2021 the second parameter is the soil water content at the condition of field capacity θfc field capacity value for short defined as the mean soil water content measured over the entire rooting zone of a soil profile when the water flux at its lower boundary becomes virtually nil during a drainage process romano and santini 2002 alternatively the field capacity value can be obtained in a virtual soil profile where the drainage process is properly described by a richards based hydrological model twarakavi et al 2009 nasta and romano 2016 for the sake of simplicity θfc is often estimated at a fixed soil matric head e g 500 cm or 330 cm or 100 cm depending mainly on the dominant soil textural class in the soil profile romano et al 2011 the θfc value can also be conveniently estimated through the following physically based analytical equation proposed by assouline and or 2014 3 θ fc θ r θ s θ r 1 n 1 n 1 2 n 1 n n that is based on the soil drainage dynamics and makes use of the parameters featuring in the vg equation of the wrf the hydraulic conductivity function hcf describes the ability of the soil to transfer water into the soil zone and relates the soil hydraulic conductivity k cm d 1 to the volumetric soil water content θ or the soil matric head ψ the hcf is commonly described by the following vg based parametric relation van genuchten 1980 4 k s e k s s e τ 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where ks cm d 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity τ represents the tortuosity parameter commonly fixed at τ 0 5 mualem 1976 or τ 1 schaap and leij 2000 but should be constrained to assure monotonicity of the hcf peters et al 2011 the five unknown soil hydraulic parameters α n θr θs and ks featuring in the vg wrf and the hcf should be directly measured θs and ks or fitted α n and θr to measurements in this study we tested eleven ptfs belonging to both point and parametric models see the list in table 1 by ignoring those referred to as class or semi physical models van looy et al 2017 the wey09 model was presented by weynants et al 2009 and subsequently corrected in weihermüller et al 2017 rosetta is based on a machine learning approach artificial neural network but it is easy to use because it is implemented in hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018 and unknown parameters can be manually derived for each soil sample wos99 and euptfv2 are based on european data while rosetta is based on a data set of soil samples collected mainly in north america wos99 ver89 euptfv2 wey09 and rosetta employ the parameters of van genuchten s analytical relation r b85 predicts parameters of the brooks and corey 1964 model and considers soil porosity which was calculated by eq 2 we recall that c s92 sax86 and o c80 adopt different analytical wrf equations the last two point ptfs t h98 and raw82 are based on tabulated regression coefficients at fixed matric head values see appendix a 2 1 2 estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is predicted by ten ptfs reported in table 2 zhang and schaap 2019 provided a comprehensive review of methods to estimate ks and the cos84 and s r06 relations were taken from their appendix a seven methods wos99 euptfv2 rosetta a g19 gup20 cos84 and s r06 are based on an empirical relationship between ks and easily available soil properties in the case of three methods ver89 gua07 r b85 nas13 and wey09 gua07 ks is computed from parameters of the wrf which were previously predicted from basic soil properties guarracino 2007 gua07 proposed an equation to derive ks from the knowledge of the vg water retention parameters as follows 5 k s 4 65 10 4 θ s α 2 when ks is expressed in units of cm d 1 eq 5 is applied to the ver89 and wey09 another option is to use the physically based relation proposed by nasta et al 2013 nas13 based on a simple capillary bundle model laliberte et al 1968 that estimates ks by using the wrf parameters of the brooks and corey 1964 equation 6 k s 3 17 10 5 λ λ 2 θ s ψ b 2 despite the criticism raised on the empirical meaning of the tortuosity parameter ghanbarian et al 2017 proved that eq 6 performs satisfactorily based on its application on a large independent database from the usa eq 6 is applied to r b85 ptf which predicts the parameters λ and ψb of the brooks and corey model see eq a4 in the appendix a 2 2 soil databases in this study we evaluated ptf performance mainly for soils under a temperate climate by using the data stored in the grenoble soil catalog grizzly haverkamp et al 1997 the hydraulic properties of european soils hypres database wösten et al 1999 lilly et al 2008 and the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi dataset weynants et al 2013 since all three databases were obtained from regional datasets there is or might be some overlap between them and the training data of the ptfs analyzed in this paper therefore evaluation of the general performance and no validation could be performed on them to pre select a smaller set of the ptfs for functional analysis the grizzly data set comprises a total of 660 soil samples 382 samples originating from europe 249 samples from the united states and 31 samples outside europe and the united states out of 4030 available soil samples in hypres 541 were provided by the database organizers we removed 19 soil samples and considered 522 soil samples belonging to hypres for our data analysis in the case of the eu hydi we selected 4940 data for wrf out of 14 182 soil samples by omitting the incomplete data from our analysis therefore a total of 6122 data for wrf were obtained from the three databases consisting of measured soil bulk density ρ b g cm 3 percentages of clay silt and sand contents soil organic carbon content in percent laboratory measured water retention data θobs ψ including saturated water content and θ s cm3 cm 3 fig 1 shows the distribution of soil samples of the three datasets in the texture triangle three soil hydraulic parameters θr α n featuring in the vg wrf were optimized by interpolating the vg equation eq 1 on observed soil water content and matric head data pairs for the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks cm d 1 62 soil samples out of 660 were selected in grizzly 253 soil samples out of 522 were selected in hypres and 1811 of 14182 soil samples were selected in eu hydi therefore a total of 2126 soil samples were used to evaluate prediction performance to estimate ks 2 3 evaluation criteria the most common metrics used to quantify the predictive capability of the tested ptfs are root mean square error rmse which combines both bias and lack of precision the coefficient of determination r2 which measures how well the data pairs fit a straight line and the mean relative error mre which quantifies the average under estimation if positive or over estimation if negative these statistical indicators are defined as follows 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 8 r 2 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 9 m r e 1 n i 1 n 1 p i o i 100 where o o and p are the observed mean of observed and predicted values of a variable respectively subscript i is the counter and n is the highest number of counter points we specify that also the relative error re namely re 1 pi oi was used in the data analysis the prediction performance on the wrf was also evaluated by using the integral mean deviation imd which reveals biases in predicting the shape of the observed curve imd 0 means systematic underprediction 10 i m d 1 ξ u ξ l ξ l ξ u θ ξ o b s θ ξ p t f d ξ where ξ ln ψ with ln denoting the natural logarithm whereas the subscripts u and l denote the upper and lower bounds respectively we set the prefixed lower and upper matric head values at 10 cm and 104 2 cm respectively to cover the water retention curve from saturation up to the wilting point the akaike information criterion aic estimates the amount of information lost by a ptf and quantifies the trade off between goodness of fit and model parsimony diks and vrugt 2010 the aic is computed as follows 11 a i c l n n s l n s s e n s 1 l n n s 2 p where ns is the number of soil samples p is the number of predictors employed in a ptf and sse is the sum of squared errors given by 12 s s e i n s o i p i 2 statistical analysis was performed in matlab and r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 for an optimal prediction rmse mre and imd should be close to zero r2 values should be close to 1 whereas aic should be as high as possible romano and palladino 2002 de vos et al 2005 the rmse is widely used in the body of scientific literature and generally spans between 0 020 and 0 12 cm3 cm 3 expressing very high and very low performances respectively schaap et al 2001 cornelis et al 2001 sing et al 2020 ideally perfect performance is obtained when all individual mre and imds are zero while in reality underestimation and overestimation are obtained when mre and imd values are positive or negative respectively the aic penalizes ptfs using a large number of predictors and indicates that model complexity is not always associated with high performance 2 4 functional performance 1 impact of ptfs on assessing the spatial variability of soil water content at field capacity a functional performance analysis was carried out using the data collected in a small experimental catchment called mfc1 located near the village of monteforte cilento in southern italy nasta et al 2019 mfc1 has a drainage area of approximately 5 0 ha and belongs to the upper alento river catchment romano et al 2018 both disturbed soil samples and undisturbed soil cores were collected near the soil surface vertical sampling at a soil depth of 10 17 cm in 44 positions over a regular 25 m 25 m sampling grid see fig 1 in nasta et al 2019 particle size distribution oven dry soil bulk density saturated soil water content and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity were all determined by using standard laboratory methods mebius 1960 gee and or 2002 topp and ferré 2002 reynolds and elrick 2002 for each soil core the vg equation eq 1 was fitted on soil water content and matric head data pairs that were measured by using suction tables and pressure plates romano et al 2002 geostatistics was used to assess the capability of a ptf in quantifying the spatial variability of field capacity that is a key parameter depending on water retention characteristics based on the intrinsic hypothesis the spatial variation of the target variable is quantified by a semi variogram which is the square of the increments of θfc separated by a lag distance h 13 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h θ f c x i θ f c x i h 2 where γ h is the experimental semi variance n h is the number of pairs of observations separated by h and x i is the location of the ith observation the semi variances of the measured and predicted field capacity values were ﬁtted to the gaussian model proposed by wackernagel 2003 14 γ h c 1 e x p h 1 5 r 1 5 where c is the sill and r is a distance parameter this gaussian model approaches the sill asymptotically but a practical range can be approximated as 3 r when the variogram reaches about 95 of the sill the best performing ptfs were selected from the results of the regional scale evaluation presented in section 3 1 in this functional evaluation the objective is to evaluate the ability of the ptfs to describe the spatial variability of field capacity θfc values we used the ordinary kriging method to generate spatial interpolation maps of the observed and ptf predicted θfc values at unvisited locations over the study area mfc1 performance is assessed by considering the rmse values eq 7 and r2 eq 8 if not mentioned otherwise all calculations were performed using matlab scripts 2 5 functional performance 2 impact of ptfs on water balance components simulated in hydrus 1d we quantify the epistemic uncertainty arising when soil water dynamics is described by a richards based model that is parameterized by either observed or ptf predicted soil hydraulic parameters we used hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018 with the same model set up presented in romano and nasta 2016 hydrus 1d solves numerically the following one dimensional richards equation for variably saturated soil water flow 15 θ t z k ψ ψ z 1 ξ z ψ t p where t is time z is a vertical coordinate taken positive upward ψ is matric head θ is the soil volumetric water content and ζ z ψ tp is the volumetric sink term function that describes macroscopic root water uptake briefly the study area is located near acerra a town belonging to the province of naples southern italy where the soil is classified as a typical andosol of vesuvius origin and land use was a peach orchard a total of 89 undisturbed soil cores were collected along a transect at equal distances of 150 cm and a soil depth of 40 cm previous investigations in this area showed that the soil is well drained with a very deep groundwater table and the soil hydraulic properties can be assumed as quite uniform up to a soil depth of approximately 90 cm romano 1993 ciollaro and romano 1995 thirteen years 2000 2012 of weather data for a total of 4749 daily values were acquired by an automated weather station located near the experimental field the crop specific potential evapotranspiration et p is computed from the meteorological data and partitioned into potential evaporation e p cm d 1 and potential transpiration t p cm d 1 precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e p are system dependent upper boundary conditions whereas t p determines the potential root water uptake both ep and tp are reduced by water limitation and stresses to actual evaporation ea and actual transpiration ta hydrus 1d was run in each of the 89 positions along the transect by using the 4749 daily values 13 year long time series of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration while setting a free drainage lower boundary condition at 200 cm soil depth the maximum rooting depth of the peach trees was assumed to be 80 cm we built a set of numerical simulations depending on measured and predicted soil hydraulic vg parameters with ptfs selected from the results of the regional scale evaluation presented in section 3 1 the following four water balance components are considered water storage wsd actual evaporation ea d actual transpiration ta d and drainage flux at the soil depth of 200 cm soil profile bottom qd at a daily time step indicated by subscript d the abovementioned spatial average daily fluxes were aggregated in annual sums a total of 13 spatial average annual sums were obtained in the transect of the 89 positions thereby generating the spatial average annual mean sums of ea y ta y and qy indicated by subscript y the daily water storage values based on observed and ptf estimated soil hydraulic properties were compared by using rmse eq 7 and r2 eq 8 the mrews eq 9 in terms of daily water storage is calculated to quantify the model output discrepancy derived from the use of observed and ptf estimated soil hydraulic properties similarly the relative error re in terms of field capacity refc and saturated hydraulic conductivity reks transformed in log10 values is considered to indicate the difference between direct observations and estimations 3 results and discussion 3 1 regional scale evaluation using the grizzly hypres and eu hydi databases 3 1 1 estimation of water retention function the eleven ptfs listed in table 1 were used to estimate the soil water content value θptf at fixed matric heads n 30 with a regular step between 10 cm i e very close to full saturation and 104 2 cm i e at the conventional permanent wilting point pwp the performance indicators rmse r2 imda aic listed in table 3 show substantially different performances of the tested ptfs when using the three datasets grizzly hypres and eu hydi the imda values reported in table 3 represent the average values of individual imds the imd index depends on the shape of the water retention function minasny and mcbratney 2003 imd values could not be calculated for c s92 t h98 and raw82 most of the ptf estimates show an underestimation tendency as indicated by the positive imd values in table 3 based on the rmse values table 3 the vg based ptfs outperform the others although the european ptfs wey09 ver89 euptfv2 wos99 were trained on soil samples extracted from the grizzly hypres and eu hydi databases this regional analysis does not provide information about the validation of the ptfs but gives a general overview of their performance on large european datasets and suggests a pre selection of a smaller set of ptfs available in the literature the aic indicates a high risk of overfitting when including soil bulk density and organic matter content as predictors without gaining accuracy table 3 those ptfs omitting organic matter and bulk density as predictors obtained lower rmse better imd and higher r2 values indeed the soil organic carbon content and oven dry bulk density are time variant properties as affected by agricultural practices and environmental conditions and very often show seasonal effects therefore their impact on the soil hydraulic properties can be cumbersome by isolating the relationship between soil texture and ptf accuracy it is possible to find room for potential improvement fig 2 graphically illustrates the rmse values distributed in the usda united states department of agriculture soil texture triangle when using four ptfs sax86 ver89 rosetta t h98 high rmse values cluster in specific texture classes for example ver89 fig 2b and rosetta fig 2c were calibrated on coarser textured soil samples and consequently provided relatively high rmse for the finer soil textural classes vereecken et al 1989 zhang and schaap 2019 the particle size distributions of the soil samples depicted in fig 2 in tomasella and hodnett 1998 and fig 1 in saxton et al 1986 are also very different from those shown in fig 4a and d respectively t h98 is less accurate when soil texture is silty or loamy whereas sax86 based only on clay and sand contents as predictors has room for improvement overall of the soil textural classes sax86 rosetta and t h98 were developed by using soil samples collected outside europe usa and brazil whereas ver89 was implemented by using a relatively small number of soil samples collected in belgium therefore these ptfs can be potentially re calibrated in grizzly hypres and eu hydi databases and further improved a fairly uniform distribution of high rmse mostly reddish circles values is observed for c s92 and o c80 not shown while the uniform distribution of low rmse mostly bluish circles values is reported for r b85 wos99 euptfv2 wey09 and raw82 not shown 3 1 2 estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity the ten ptfs listed in table 2 were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity by using 62 523 and 1811 soil samples in grizzly hypres and eu hydi respectively total ns 2126 the performance in terms of rmse and r2 and aic of the ten ptfs in the three data sets for predicting the log10 ks values is listed in table 4 all of the tested ptfs provide rmse values systematically greater than 1 i e greater than at least one order of magnitude and r2 values lower than 0 40 similarly as mentioned in section 3 1 1 this analysis provides information about general regional performance ptfs trained on all or part of grizzly hypres or eu hydi performed better as a matter of course small homogeneous data sets grizzly tend to provide better error metrics than data rich databases eu hydi ks depends on soil structural properties especially in the uppermost soil horizons soil depth of soil samples in uarc refers to 10 17 cm validation of site specific calibrated ptfs usually leads to rmse values spanning between 0 4 and 1 49 and r2 values between 0 15 and 0 87 see table 3 in zhang and schaap 2019 a positive exception is wey09 which takes on lower than expected aic values when compared with other ptfs using the same number of predictors p 4 those ptfs taking advantage of the knowledge of wrf parameters to derive ks guarracino 2007 nasta et al 2013 are useful only if these retention parameters are fairly determined this suggests that the availability of the wrf is precious information when one would guess a ks value within a prediction uncertainty of a few orders of magnitude whereas soil physical and chemical attributes have a poor prediction power to infer ks satisfactorily minasny and hartemink 2011 suggested that the ptf performance depends on data quality rather than ptf complexity in eu hydi the ks values were obtained using several laboratory or in situ techniques the soil sample sizes used for the measurement also vary greatly saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is the scale parameter for the hydraulic conductivity function see eq 4 and presents the drawback of varying over several orders of magnitude when soil matric heads ψ in cm span from full saturation ψ 0 to extreme dryness log10 ψ about 7 numerous empirical data driven analyses found that the intertwining controlling factors in determining ks are soil texture oven dry soil bulk density and soil organic carbon content as a general statement it is well known that ks decreases as the clay content increases with increasing oven dry soil bulk density related to soil porosity in eq 2 instead oven dry soil bulk density is inversely related to soil organic carbon content zhang and schaap 2019 the analytical relationships calculating ks from water retention parameters see eqs 5 and 6 evidence this assumption by posing ks directly proportional to θs close to soil porosity and inversely proportional to the square of bubbling matric head which in turn indirectly depends on soil texture poiseuille s law as it is quite difficult to find empirical relations by using the original data set we group data into 5 clay classes 0 5 5 10 and so on and calculate median values of bulk density log10 oc and log10 ks after testing normality of their statistical distribution not shown in each clay class the decreasing relation between log10 oc and oven dry bulk density is quantified through an empirical regression function with a high r2 value fig 3 a the circles in fig 3a are colored according to log10 ks values that corroborate published data analysis because most probable log10 ks values occur when oven dry soil bulk density is low and organic carbon content is high and tend to increase along the empirical regression line nonetheless this is only a qualitative statement because ks of soils varies over several orders of magnitude and is affected by unpredictable controlling factors another qualitative assessment can be drawn by a visual inspection of fig 3b that relates 5 clay content classes and median log10 ks values the vertical bars indicate 25th and 75th percentiles it is expected that log10 ks values should linearly decrease with increasing clay content this is observed by a decreasing trend with low log10 ks values for very high clay content however the trend line is balanced by the contrasting impact of soil bulk density circles in fig 3b are colored according to soil bulk density that can be considered a crude proxy of soil structure the effect of other unquantifiable controlling factors adds jeopardy and makes the prediction of ks very problematic and rather cumbersome eck et al 2016 ilek et al 2019 in this section four vg based ptfs namely wey09 rosetta euptfv2 and wos99 outperformed the others and are therefore selected for the functional evaluation presented in the relevant sections below 3 2 results of functional performance 1 in this section it is crudely hypothesized that 44 observations are able to fully describe the spatial variability of the soil water content values at field capacity in the study catchment although this relatively small number of available soil samples can be critical in spatial variability studies we are aware that the majority of real world case studies are based on a limited number of soil samples the goal of this section is to evaluate the capability of four ptfs selected in the previous section to map the field capacity θfc values based on the general regional evaluation wey09 rosetta euptfv2 and wos99 performed the best in this case it is important not only to quantify the accuracy at estimating field capacity but also the ability to reproduce the same observed spatial structure in a study area mfc1 spatial prediction provides estimates of field capacity values at unvisited locations we used the ordinary kriging model to assess the spatial uncertainty arising when the error in predicting field capacity values propagates in unsampled locations fig 4 a shows the stable gaussian model eq 13 fitted on the experimental isotropic variograms based on 44 measured field capacity data in mfc1 fig 4b illustrates the 10 m grid size a total of 680 cells interpolation of observed field capacity using ordinary kriging based on the spatial information described by the gaussian model fitted on the observations the gaussian model was fitted also to the isotropic variograms computed using the four ptf predicted field capacity data fig 5 the goodness of fit was quantified in terms of r2 values eq 8 fig 6 shows the maps of the ptf estimated field capacity values interpolated by ordinary kriging top panel in fig 6 wey09 wos99 rosetta euptfv2 in fig 6a d respectively the comparison between these observed and estimated data over the 680 cells of the study area is depicted in the bottom panel of fig 6 wey09 wos99 rosetta euptfv2 in fig 6e h respectively the rmse values as well as r2 values reported in table 5 are used for evaluating prediction performance over the 44 measurement positions parametric evaluation and the 680 cells functional evaluation in the parametric evaluation the rmse values are very low for wey09 acceptable for euptfv2 wos99 and high for rosetta in the functional evaluation the quality of the ordinary kriging deteriorates especially for wey09 and rosetta rmse values referring to the interpolated maps of field capacity functional evaluation are higher than the corresponding rmse referring to field capacity values over the 44 positions parametric evaluation with increments spanning from 3 euptfv2 up to 16 wey09 these results are corroborated by the corresponding r2 values in the functional evaluation that are worse lower than those reported in the parametric evaluation moreover the ptf predictions clearly underestimate the observations as illustrated in fig 6 with highest bias observed for wos99 and rosetta the best ptfs are wey09 and euptfv2 in terms of rmse values these results reflect the similar predictive performance reported on data in the three european databases table 3 the interpolation of soil hydraulic properties at unvisited locations within the study area is strategic to properly implement distributed water balance models deviations from actual values of a spatial dependent variable estimated by a simpliﬁed procedure can have little effect on the calculation of the mean value in a certain area in contrast the distribution in space of the estimated values of the target variable can differ from that of the actual values to alter the patterns of the semi variograms signiﬁcantly romano and santini 1997 compared the variograms ﬁtted on observed water retention data with the predictions generated by four published ptfs they used a spherical model to fit the experimental semi variograms of soil water content at the fixed matric head values the same authors 1997 selected ver89 as the best ptf to predict the spatial variability of the water retention function they concluded that the observed discrepancy in structural information can be considered a penalty to be paid when using a simpliﬁed methodology to obtain a large number of soil hydraulic parameter values few studies have investigated whether ptfs reliably describe spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties in the field liao et al 2011 silva et al 2017 romano 2004 investigated the ability of a ptf to provide a picture of the actual spatial variations exhibited by a soil attribute and more importantly emphasized the fact that when using a ptf one should consider two additional issues i the scale an issue that strongly interacts with the concept of spatial variability see pringle et al 2007 and ii the ultimate goal of obtaining effective parameters to be employed in a governing equation of motion in the case of mapping soil hydraulic properties in the catchment of lake balaton there was no significant difference in performance between ptf based and geostatistical maps when environmental properties e g topography climate vegetation were considered among the predictors alongside basic soil properties however locally extreme values can be better described when residual kriging is added szabó et al 2019b 3 3 results of functional performance 2 this section addresses the question of how and to what extent the epistemic errors that arise from improper use of ptf predicted soil hydraulic parameterization propagate when an annual soil water budget is simulated at the field scale mean annual precipitation py and potential evapotranspiration etp y are 90 13 cm y 1 and 172 37 cm y 1 respectively as in the previous section we used the four ptfs namely wey09 rosetta euptfv2 and wos99 selected in section 3 1 to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters over the 89 positions along the experimental transect table 6 shows the spatial average mean annual ea y ta y qy of the observed and ptf estimated 5 sets namely obs wey09 rosetta euptfv2 and wos99 of numerical simulations relying on 4749 daily values in the 89 positions when considering the numerical simulations controlled by observed soil hydraulic properties the mean annual actual evapotranspiration eta y is 84 87 cm which represents about 94 and 49 of py and etp y respectively ta y is the dominant flux representing about two thirds of eta y qy represents about 5 of py while surface runoff is negligible the use of soil hydraulic properties predicted by the four ptfs leads to water balance components being different from those obtained by simulations based on direct observations table 6 wos99 outperforms the other ptfs obtaining eta y and qy values with errors lower than 1 cm per year rosetta is the worst performing ptf in this exercise the differences reported in terms of annual water balance components ea y ta y qy in table 6 are reflected in terms of total daily water storage values total number of 422661 values is given by 4749 days multiplied by 89 positions the relationship fig 7 between a total of 422661 water storage data based on observed soil hydraulic properties and water storage data based on ptf estimated soil hydraulic properties is evaluated in terms of rmse and r2 for the four ptfs wos99 wey09 rosetta and euptfv2 the lowest rmse is obtained by wey09 while the highest r2 is obtained by wos99 rosetta tends to underpredict water storage data wey09 and euptfv2 tend to overpredict while wos99 obtains the least biased simulations of water storage values yet it is still not possible to determine the best performing ptf hence it is important to interpret and analyze the impact of soil parameterization on the daily water storage simulated in hydrus 1d to this end the differences between measured and predicted soil hydraulic parameters can be evaluated by using the relative error re over the 89 positions in terms of the field capacity refc and log10 ks reks on the other hand we calculate the mean relative error mrews from daily water storage values wsd based on observed and predicted soil hydraulic parameters in each position of the experimental transect eq 9 the impact of using the predicted soil hydraulic properties on the water balance simulated by hydrus 1d is analyzed by relating the relative errors in terms of observed and predicted field capacity values refc with mrews depicted in fig 8 the circles are colored according to relative errors in terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity reks wos99 wey09 and rosetta consistently underestimate observed field capacity as indicated by positive biased values of refc in fig 8 importantly rosetta leads to a relatively high refc ranging from 18 9 to 41 1 whereas euptfv2 is the only ptf leading to a fairly unbiased refc ranging from 17 1 and 24 3 with a virtually zero mean value refc 3 2 the parametric uncertainty propagates in the water balance computed by hydrus 1d the most accurate simulations of soil water storage values are based on wos99 mrews ranging from 24 3 and 19 6 in fig 8a and euptfv2 mrews ranging from 22 6 and 18 3 in fig 8d as the corresponding mrews values are centered around zero which represents the ideal point on the y axis wey09 mre ranging from 32 1 and 13 8 in fig 8b and especially rosetta mrews ranging from 4 9 and 30 4 in fig 8c are biased and their shifts bring about overestimation mostly negative mrews values and underestimation mostly positive mrews values respectively the concept of precision is related to how much the sample data cluster among them and are quite close to their mean value from a quantitative point of view the standard deviation or the variance equivalently indicates a good precision if its value is quite small rosetta is the most precise ptf in terms of soil water storage with a standard deviation of 7 90 cm partly because this indirect method is somewhat unable to reflect large parametric variability in the european data set in contrast wey09 is the least precise ptf with a standard deviation of 10 93 cm the strong positive relationships pearson correlation coefficients are 0 74 0 71 0 63 0 67 for wos99 wey09 rosetta and euptfv2 respectively between refc and mrews indicate the high sensitivity of the numerical computations of soil water storage to the water retention parameters employed to calculate the soil water content at field capacity eq 3 in other words using ptf predicted field capacity values higher than those obtained by direct observation leads to an overestimation in the simulated soil water storage while euptfv2 outperforms the other ptfs in terms of field capacity estimates it is clear that the lack of precision in guessing the soil water storage is due to a weak estimation of ks values bluish circles in fig 8d rosetta shows a significant bias in terms of both field capacity and ks bluish circles in fig 8c wos99 and wey09 are characterized by similar relationships between refc and mrews fig 8a and b nonetheless wey09 is the only ptf able to predict ks reliably with the majority of reks around zero as indicated by the greenish circles in fig 8b several studies present functional evaluations for water balance simulations especially for comparing observed and estimated soil water content patterns nemes et al 2003 abkenar and rasoulzadeh 2019 guber et al 2009 performed a functional evaluation using hydrus 1d to evaluate the impact on various components of the simulated water budget when parameterizing the richards equation with 19 ptfs christiansen and feyen 2001 found that the established saturated hydraulic conductivity and saturated water content were the most influential parameters in determining the uncertainty in the catchment scale water budget all these studies showed that parameterizing a hydrological model with ptf predicted soil hydraulic properties is definitely a promising approach to overcome the issue of data scarcity 4 concluding remarks the parametric evaluation of eleven ptfs to predict the water retention function and ten ptfs to predict the saturated hydraulic conductivity using a relatively large dataset collected over europe enabled us to select the most accurate and reliable ones with respect to different spatial scales of interest the most recent vg based ptfs wey09 wos99 euptfv2 proved to be accurate enough for predicting the water retention function rosetta ver89 sax86 t h98 and r b85 performed acceptably and can be theoretically improved in some textural classes although they were calibrated and validated outside europe under different climatic and environmental conditions the ten ptfs used to predict saturated hydraulic conductivity demonstrated a generally poor performance with uncertainty spanning over one or two orders of magnitude the main predictors soil bulk density organic carbon content and texture are cross correlated and might play contrasting roles in predicting saturated hydraulic conductivity especially due to the lack of its standardized measurement method in this study we evaluated the effectiveness of four vg based ptfs selected based on the outcomes of the parametric evaluations to properly estimate the observed water contents at field capacity by considering a relatively small number of soil samples moreover we also evaluated the ability of the ptfs to reproduce the kriged maps of field capacity reporting a deterioration of prediction performance from 3 to 16 in terms of rmse values compared to parametric evaluation finally we evaluated the impact of parameterizing the richards equation with ptf predicted shp on daily water fluxes as simulated by hydrus 1d within a 2 m thick uniform soil profile we verified the hypothesis for which large discrepancies between observed and ptf predicted key soil hydraulic properties lead to substantial differences in simulated water fluxes although the four ptfs proved satisfactorily equivalent for simulating daily water storage values we stress the importance of describing the

8147,study region europe a total of 660 522 and 4940 soil samples belonging to grizzly hypres and eu hydi databases respectively were used for parametric evaluation study focus the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions are crucial input information for land surface models determining these functions by using direct methods is hampered by excessive time and unaffordable costs required for field activities and laboratory analyses pedotransfer functions ptfs are widely used indirect techniques enabling soil hydraulic properties to be predicted by using easily retrievable soil information in a parametric evaluation the predictive capability of ptfs is examined by comparing measured and estimated soil water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity yet information about the performance of ptfs for specific modeling applications is mandatory to evaluate ptf effectiveness in greater depth this approach is commonly defined as functional evaluation new hydrological insights for the region the best performing four ptfs selected in the parametric evaluations are tested under two functional evaluations the first encompasses a spatial interpolation with a geostatistical technique whereas the second employs hydrus 1d to simulate the water balance components along an experimental transect our results reinforce and integrate the insights of previous studies about the use of a ptf and highlight the ability or inability of this technique to adequately reproduce the observed spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties and simulated water fluxes keywords water retention function saturated hydraulic conductivity semi variogram kriging functional evaluation hydrus 1d 1 introduction modeling large scale soil water balance for applications in for instance irrigation groundwater recharge or sustainable water resources management requires massive input data of the water retention function wrf and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks direct measurements of wrf are generally determined by conventional laboratory techniques using the hanging water column or the suction tables dane and hopmans 2002 the constant or falling head method is commonly used for measuring ks reynolds and elrick 2002 the simultaneous determination of wrf and hydraulic conductivity function hcf via inverse modeling transient flow experiments is often carried out in the laboratory using composite equipment that is used to impose a multi step outflow or an evaporation process in a soil sample leaving aside for the time being the issue of in situ experiments together with the endless debate between field and laboratory tests so far the hydrological community has considered the above mentioned laboratory techniques as precise and reliable hopmans et al 2002 schelle et al 2010 however despite several attempts at simplification schindler and müller 2006 peters and durner 2008 figueras and gribb 2009 nasta et al 2011 these approaches are still expensive tedious and time consuming hence their use remains quite unrealistic for large scale applications ptfs are statistical tools that relate soil hydraulic properties estimands to easily measurable soil physico chemical parameters predictors guber et al 2006 van looy et al 2017 the availability of recent global scale digital maps of soil physical and chemical properties provides high quality and detailed high spatial resolution information to support the implementation of ptfs for modeling applications such as soilgrids 250 m hengl et al 2017 and its recently updated version soilgrids 2 0 batjes et al 2020 de sousa et al 2021 four main groups categories of ptfs exist tietje and tapkenhinrichs 1993 the first group of ptfs proposes look up tables called class ptfs listing average parameters in each texture class nonetheless the recent availability of basic soil physical and chemical properties at a very high spatial resolution can make this type of ptf obsolete in fact the use of average parameters in a soil texture class oversimplifies model parameterization by completely missing the spatial variability over a study area the second group of ptfs called point ptfs estimates soil water contents at fixed matric head values such as field capacity and wilting point petersen et al 1968 gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 canarache 1993 bruand et al 1994 the third group of ptfs called semi physical ptfs comprises physically sound but semi empirical models based on the assumption of shape similarity between the particle size distribution and pore size distribution arya and paris 1981 haverkamp and parlange 1986 nimmo et al 2007 mohammadi and vanclooster 2011 mohammadi and meskini vishkaee 2013 the fourth group of ptfs called parameter ptfs is based on the data driven estimation of parameters featuring in the most widespread wrf equations van genuchten 1980 brooks and corey 1964 with multiple regression equations or more complex machine learning approaches such as artificial neural networks support vector machines and random forest rudiyanto et al 2021 in general multiple linear regression is often used for developing a ptf in an analytical form that can then be easily implemented by other users ptfs derived by machine learning techniques often outperform the predictions obtained by the multiple linear regression but can be used by other researchers only if they are built in a user friendly platform zhang and schaap 2017 araya and ghezzehei 2019 szabó et al 2021 the predictive capability of a ptf is commonly tested by a parametric evaluation that analyzes the errors between measured and ptf predicted soil hydraulic properties however a parametric evaluation would not necessarily provide information about the performance of a ptf when its predictions should be employed for computer modeling simulations beyond parametric accuracy and precision it is therefore recommended to use functional criteria to compare model outputs when soil behavior is parameterized by using either measured or predicted soil hydraulic properties for this reason vereecken et al 1992 defined functional evaluation as the statistical examination of the variability in the outcome of a simulation model for a specific application when the variability arises solely from uncertainty in the ptfs large scale model applications depend on ptf quality hence on the impact of epistemic uncertainties associated with the spatial variations of predicted soil hydraulic properties or the water fluxes simulated by a hydrological model as pointed out by pringle et al 2007 another issue requiring due attention is the selection of the most suitable spatial scale in which a certain ptf can provide optimal performances in the wake of the paper written by pringle et al 2007 and allowing for the recent progress in the development of ptfs this study aims primarily to investigate the ability of a ptf to reproduce adequately the observed variations in soil hydraulic parameters over a range of spatial scales from relatively large areas to transects the impact of epistemic errors introduced when using a ptf in land surface models is mostly unknown but any effort should be made to reduce them beven 2013 for this reason due consideration should be given to assessing model uncertainty at least in practical field scale modeling applications the objective of this study is twofold i using a parametric evaluation to critically revise a set of existing ptfs on three large european soil hydraulic data sets to select the best performing ones which are subsequently tested under a functional perspective ii running two functional evaluations to analyze the epistemic errors generated when ptf predicted soil hydraulic properties are used instead of those directly measured 2 materials and methods 2 1 inventory of existing pedotransfer functions 2 1 1 estimation of soil water retention function wrf the wrf θ ψ relates the volumetric soil water content θ cm3 cm 3 to soil matric head ψ cm among several options the most widespread equation describing the wrf is the van genuchten model hereafter referred to as vg van genuchten 1980 li et al 2014 1 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m w i t h m 1 1 n where θr cm3 cm 3 and θs cm3 cm 3 are the residual and saturated soil water contents respectively α cm 1 is a scale parameter and m and n are shape parameters θs is measured according to the protocol suggested by topp and ferré 2002 and is slightly lower than soil porosity por as calculated through the following equation kotlar et al 2019 2 p o r 1 ρ b ρ d where ρb is the oven dry soil bulk density g cm 3 and ρd is the particle density g cm 3 assumed on average to be equal to 2 65 g cm 3 the degree of saturation is defined as se θ θr θs θr and varies from 0 θ θr to 1 θ θs knowledge of the wrf enables to determine two key soil hydraulic parameters of bucket type hydrological models romano et al 2011 the first parameter is the soil water content at the permanent wilting point θwp which is commonly computed as θ at the matric head ψ 15 300 cm i e a soil matric head of 15 bars but the validity of this threshold for different plant species is still under debate torres et al 2021 the second parameter is the soil water content at the condition of field capacity θfc field capacity value for short defined as the mean soil water content measured over the entire rooting zone of a soil profile when the water flux at its lower boundary becomes virtually nil during a drainage process romano and santini 2002 alternatively the field capacity value can be obtained in a virtual soil profile where the drainage process is properly described by a richards based hydrological model twarakavi et al 2009 nasta and romano 2016 for the sake of simplicity θfc is often estimated at a fixed soil matric head e g 500 cm or 330 cm or 100 cm depending mainly on the dominant soil textural class in the soil profile romano et al 2011 the θfc value can also be conveniently estimated through the following physically based analytical equation proposed by assouline and or 2014 3 θ fc θ r θ s θ r 1 n 1 n 1 2 n 1 n n that is based on the soil drainage dynamics and makes use of the parameters featuring in the vg equation of the wrf the hydraulic conductivity function hcf describes the ability of the soil to transfer water into the soil zone and relates the soil hydraulic conductivity k cm d 1 to the volumetric soil water content θ or the soil matric head ψ the hcf is commonly described by the following vg based parametric relation van genuchten 1980 4 k s e k s s e τ 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where ks cm d 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity τ represents the tortuosity parameter commonly fixed at τ 0 5 mualem 1976 or τ 1 schaap and leij 2000 but should be constrained to assure monotonicity of the hcf peters et al 2011 the five unknown soil hydraulic parameters α n θr θs and ks featuring in the vg wrf and the hcf should be directly measured θs and ks or fitted α n and θr to measurements in this study we tested eleven ptfs belonging to both point and parametric models see the list in table 1 by ignoring those referred to as class or semi physical models van looy et al 2017 the wey09 model was presented by weynants et al 2009 and subsequently corrected in weihermüller et al 2017 rosetta is based on a machine learning approach artificial neural network but it is easy to use because it is implemented in hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018 and unknown parameters can be manually derived for each soil sample wos99 and euptfv2 are based on european data while rosetta is based on a data set of soil samples collected mainly in north america wos99 ver89 euptfv2 wey09 and rosetta employ the parameters of van genuchten s analytical relation r b85 predicts parameters of the brooks and corey 1964 model and considers soil porosity which was calculated by eq 2 we recall that c s92 sax86 and o c80 adopt different analytical wrf equations the last two point ptfs t h98 and raw82 are based on tabulated regression coefficients at fixed matric head values see appendix a 2 1 2 estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is predicted by ten ptfs reported in table 2 zhang and schaap 2019 provided a comprehensive review of methods to estimate ks and the cos84 and s r06 relations were taken from their appendix a seven methods wos99 euptfv2 rosetta a g19 gup20 cos84 and s r06 are based on an empirical relationship between ks and easily available soil properties in the case of three methods ver89 gua07 r b85 nas13 and wey09 gua07 ks is computed from parameters of the wrf which were previously predicted from basic soil properties guarracino 2007 gua07 proposed an equation to derive ks from the knowledge of the vg water retention parameters as follows 5 k s 4 65 10 4 θ s α 2 when ks is expressed in units of cm d 1 eq 5 is applied to the ver89 and wey09 another option is to use the physically based relation proposed by nasta et al 2013 nas13 based on a simple capillary bundle model laliberte et al 1968 that estimates ks by using the wrf parameters of the brooks and corey 1964 equation 6 k s 3 17 10 5 λ λ 2 θ s ψ b 2 despite the criticism raised on the empirical meaning of the tortuosity parameter ghanbarian et al 2017 proved that eq 6 performs satisfactorily based on its application on a large independent database from the usa eq 6 is applied to r b85 ptf which predicts the parameters λ and ψb of the brooks and corey model see eq a4 in the appendix a 2 2 soil databases in this study we evaluated ptf performance mainly for soils under a temperate climate by using the data stored in the grenoble soil catalog grizzly haverkamp et al 1997 the hydraulic properties of european soils hypres database wösten et al 1999 lilly et al 2008 and the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi dataset weynants et al 2013 since all three databases were obtained from regional datasets there is or might be some overlap between them and the training data of the ptfs analyzed in this paper therefore evaluation of the general performance and no validation could be performed on them to pre select a smaller set of the ptfs for functional analysis the grizzly data set comprises a total of 660 soil samples 382 samples originating from europe 249 samples from the united states and 31 samples outside europe and the united states out of 4030 available soil samples in hypres 541 were provided by the database organizers we removed 19 soil samples and considered 522 soil samples belonging to hypres for our data analysis in the case of the eu hydi we selected 4940 data for wrf out of 14 182 soil samples by omitting the incomplete data from our analysis therefore a total of 6122 data for wrf were obtained from the three databases consisting of measured soil bulk density ρ b g cm 3 percentages of clay silt and sand contents soil organic carbon content in percent laboratory measured water retention data θobs ψ including saturated water content and θ s cm3 cm 3 fig 1 shows the distribution of soil samples of the three datasets in the texture triangle three soil hydraulic parameters θr α n featuring in the vg wrf were optimized by interpolating the vg equation eq 1 on observed soil water content and matric head data pairs for the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks cm d 1 62 soil samples out of 660 were selected in grizzly 253 soil samples out of 522 were selected in hypres and 1811 of 14182 soil samples were selected in eu hydi therefore a total of 2126 soil samples were used to evaluate prediction performance to estimate ks 2 3 evaluation criteria the most common metrics used to quantify the predictive capability of the tested ptfs are root mean square error rmse which combines both bias and lack of precision the coefficient of determination r2 which measures how well the data pairs fit a straight line and the mean relative error mre which quantifies the average under estimation if positive or over estimation if negative these statistical indicators are defined as follows 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 8 r 2 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 9 m r e 1 n i 1 n 1 p i o i 100 where o o and p are the observed mean of observed and predicted values of a variable respectively subscript i is the counter and n is the highest number of counter points we specify that also the relative error re namely re 1 pi oi was used in the data analysis the prediction performance on the wrf was also evaluated by using the integral mean deviation imd which reveals biases in predicting the shape of the observed curve imd 0 means systematic underprediction 10 i m d 1 ξ u ξ l ξ l ξ u θ ξ o b s θ ξ p t f d ξ where ξ ln ψ with ln denoting the natural logarithm whereas the subscripts u and l denote the upper and lower bounds respectively we set the prefixed lower and upper matric head values at 10 cm and 104 2 cm respectively to cover the water retention curve from saturation up to the wilting point the akaike information criterion aic estimates the amount of information lost by a ptf and quantifies the trade off between goodness of fit and model parsimony diks and vrugt 2010 the aic is computed as follows 11 a i c l n n s l n s s e n s 1 l n n s 2 p where ns is the number of soil samples p is the number of predictors employed in a ptf and sse is the sum of squared errors given by 12 s s e i n s o i p i 2 statistical analysis was performed in matlab and r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 for an optimal prediction rmse mre and imd should be close to zero r2 values should be close to 1 whereas aic should be as high as possible romano and palladino 2002 de vos et al 2005 the rmse is widely used in the body of scientific literature and generally spans between 0 020 and 0 12 cm3 cm 3 expressing very high and very low performances respectively schaap et al 2001 cornelis et al 2001 sing et al 2020 ideally perfect performance is obtained when all individual mre and imds are zero while in reality underestimation and overestimation are obtained when mre and imd values are positive or negative respectively the aic penalizes ptfs using a large number of predictors and indicates that model complexity is not always associated with high performance 2 4 functional performance 1 impact of ptfs on assessing the spatial variability of soil water content at field capacity a functional performance analysis was carried out using the data collected in a small experimental catchment called mfc1 located near the village of monteforte cilento in southern italy nasta et al 2019 mfc1 has a drainage area of approximately 5 0 ha and belongs to the upper alento river catchment romano et al 2018 both disturbed soil samples and undisturbed soil cores were collected near the soil surface vertical sampling at a soil depth of 10 17 cm in 44 positions over a regular 25 m 25 m sampling grid see fig 1 in nasta et al 2019 particle size distribution oven dry soil bulk density saturated soil water content and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity were all determined by using standard laboratory methods mebius 1960 gee and or 2002 topp and ferré 2002 reynolds and elrick 2002 for each soil core the vg equation eq 1 was fitted on soil water content and matric head data pairs that were measured by using suction tables and pressure plates romano et al 2002 geostatistics was used to assess the capability of a ptf in quantifying the spatial variability of field capacity that is a key parameter depending on water retention characteristics based on the intrinsic hypothesis the spatial variation of the target variable is quantified by a semi variogram which is the square of the increments of θfc separated by a lag distance h 13 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h θ f c x i θ f c x i h 2 where γ h is the experimental semi variance n h is the number of pairs of observations separated by h and x i is the location of the ith observation the semi variances of the measured and predicted field capacity values were ﬁtted to the gaussian model proposed by wackernagel 2003 14 γ h c 1 e x p h 1 5 r 1 5 where c is the sill and r is a distance parameter this gaussian model approaches the sill asymptotically but a practical range can be approximated as 3 r when the variogram reaches about 95 of the sill the best performing ptfs were selected from the results of the regional scale evaluation presented in section 3 1 in this functional evaluation the objective is to evaluate the ability of the ptfs to describe the spatial variability of field capacity θfc values we used the ordinary kriging method to generate spatial interpolation maps of the observed and ptf predicted θfc values at unvisited locations over the study area mfc1 performance is assessed by considering the rmse values eq 7 and r2 eq 8 if not mentioned otherwise all calculations were performed using matlab scripts 2 5 functional performance 2 impact of ptfs on water balance components simulated in hydrus 1d we quantify the epistemic uncertainty arising when soil water dynamics is described by a richards based model that is parameterized by either observed or ptf predicted soil hydraulic parameters we used hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018 with the same model set up presented in romano and nasta 2016 hydrus 1d solves numerically the following one dimensional richards equation for variably saturated soil water flow 15 θ t z k ψ ψ z 1 ξ z ψ t p where t is time z is a vertical coordinate taken positive upward ψ is matric head θ is the soil volumetric water content and ζ z ψ tp is the volumetric sink term function that describes macroscopic root water uptake briefly the study area is located near acerra a town belonging to the province of naples southern italy where the soil is classified as a typical andosol of vesuvius origin and land use was a peach orchard a total of 89 undisturbed soil cores were collected along a transect at equal distances of 150 cm and a soil depth of 40 cm previous investigations in this area showed that the soil is well drained with a very deep groundwater table and the soil hydraulic properties can be assumed as quite uniform up to a soil depth of approximately 90 cm romano 1993 ciollaro and romano 1995 thirteen years 2000 2012 of weather data for a total of 4749 daily values were acquired by an automated weather station located near the experimental field the crop specific potential evapotranspiration et p is computed from the meteorological data and partitioned into potential evaporation e p cm d 1 and potential transpiration t p cm d 1 precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e p are system dependent upper boundary conditions whereas t p determines the potential root water uptake both ep and tp are reduced by water limitation and stresses to actual evaporation ea and actual transpiration ta hydrus 1d was run in each of the 89 positions along the transect by using the 4749 daily values 13 year long time series of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration while setting a free drainage lower boundary condition at 200 cm soil depth the maximum rooting depth of the peach trees was assumed to be 80 cm we built a set of numerical simulations depending on measured and predicted soil hydraulic vg parameters with ptfs selected from the results of the regional scale evaluation presented in section 3 1 the following four water balance components are considered water storage wsd actual evaporation ea d actual transpiration ta d and drainage flux at the soil depth of 200 cm soil profile bottom qd at a daily time step indicated by subscript d the abovementioned spatial average daily fluxes were aggregated in annual sums a total of 13 spatial average annual sums were obtained in the transect of the 89 positions thereby generating the spatial average annual mean sums of ea y ta y and qy indicated by subscript y the daily water storage values based on observed and ptf estimated soil hydraulic properties were compared by using rmse eq 7 and r2 eq 8 the mrews eq 9 in terms of daily water storage is calculated to quantify the model output discrepancy derived from the use of observed and ptf estimated soil hydraulic properties similarly the relative error re in terms of field capacity refc and saturated hydraulic conductivity reks transformed in log10 values is considered to indicate the difference between direct observations and estimations 3 results and discussion 3 1 regional scale evaluation using the grizzly hypres and eu hydi databases 3 1 1 estimation of water retention function the eleven ptfs listed in table 1 were used to estimate the soil water content value θptf at fixed matric heads n 30 with a regular step between 10 cm i e very close to full saturation and 104 2 cm i e at the conventional permanent wilting point pwp the performance indicators rmse r2 imda aic listed in table 3 show substantially different performances of the tested ptfs when using the three datasets grizzly hypres and eu hydi the imda values reported in table 3 represent the average values of individual imds the imd index depends on the shape of the water retention function minasny and mcbratney 2003 imd values could not be calculated for c s92 t h98 and raw82 most of the ptf estimates show an underestimation tendency as indicated by the positive imd values in table 3 based on the rmse values table 3 the vg based ptfs outperform the others although the european ptfs wey09 ver89 euptfv2 wos99 were trained on soil samples extracted from the grizzly hypres and eu hydi databases this regional analysis does not provide information about the validation of the ptfs but gives a general overview of their performance on large european datasets and suggests a pre selection of a smaller set of ptfs available in the literature the aic indicates a high risk of overfitting when including soil bulk density and organic matter content as predictors without gaining accuracy table 3 those ptfs omitting organic matter and bulk density as predictors obtained lower rmse better imd and higher r2 values indeed the soil organic carbon content and oven dry bulk density are time variant properties as affected by agricultural practices and environmental conditions and very often show seasonal effects therefore their impact on the soil hydraulic properties can be cumbersome by isolating the relationship between soil texture and ptf accuracy it is possible to find room for potential improvement fig 2 graphically illustrates the rmse values distributed in the usda united states department of agriculture soil texture triangle when using four ptfs sax86 ver89 rosetta t h98 high rmse values cluster in specific texture classes for example ver89 fig 2b and rosetta fig 2c were calibrated on coarser textured soil samples and consequently provided relatively high rmse for the finer soil textural classes vereecken et al 1989 zhang and schaap 2019 the particle size distributions of the soil samples depicted in fig 2 in tomasella and hodnett 1998 and fig 1 in saxton et al 1986 are also very different from those shown in fig 4a and d respectively t h98 is less accurate when soil texture is silty or loamy whereas sax86 based only on clay and sand contents as predictors has room for improvement overall of the soil textural classes sax86 rosetta and t h98 were developed by using soil samples collected outside europe usa and brazil whereas ver89 was implemented by using a relatively small number of soil samples collected in belgium therefore these ptfs can be potentially re calibrated in grizzly hypres and eu hydi databases and further improved a fairly uniform distribution of high rmse mostly reddish circles values is observed for c s92 and o c80 not shown while the uniform distribution of low rmse mostly bluish circles values is reported for r b85 wos99 euptfv2 wey09 and raw82 not shown 3 1 2 estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity the ten ptfs listed in table 2 were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity by using 62 523 and 1811 soil samples in grizzly hypres and eu hydi respectively total ns 2126 the performance in terms of rmse and r2 and aic of the ten ptfs in the three data sets for predicting the log10 ks values is listed in table 4 all of the tested ptfs provide rmse values systematically greater than 1 i e greater than at least one order of magnitude and r2 values lower than 0 40 similarly as mentioned in section 3 1 1 this analysis provides information about general regional performance ptfs trained on all or part of grizzly hypres or eu hydi performed better as a matter of course small homogeneous data sets grizzly tend to provide better error metrics than data rich databases eu hydi ks depends on soil structural properties especially in the uppermost soil horizons soil depth of soil samples in uarc refers to 10 17 cm validation of site specific calibrated ptfs usually leads to rmse values spanning between 0 4 and 1 49 and r2 values between 0 15 and 0 87 see table 3 in zhang and schaap 2019 a positive exception is wey09 which takes on lower than expected aic values when compared with other ptfs using the same number of predictors p 4 those ptfs taking advantage of the knowledge of wrf parameters to derive ks guarracino 2007 nasta et al 2013 are useful only if these retention parameters are fairly determined this suggests that the availability of the wrf is precious information when one would guess a ks value within a prediction uncertainty of a few orders of magnitude whereas soil physical and chemical attributes have a poor prediction power to infer ks satisfactorily minasny and hartemink 2011 suggested that the ptf performance depends on data quality rather than ptf complexity in eu hydi the ks values were obtained using several laboratory or in situ techniques the soil sample sizes used for the measurement also vary greatly saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is the scale parameter for the hydraulic conductivity function see eq 4 and presents the drawback of varying over several orders of magnitude when soil matric heads ψ in cm span from full saturation ψ 0 to extreme dryness log10 ψ about 7 numerous empirical data driven analyses found that the intertwining controlling factors in determining ks are soil texture oven dry soil bulk density and soil organic carbon content as a general statement it is well known that ks decreases as the clay content increases with increasing oven dry soil bulk density related to soil porosity in eq 2 instead oven dry soil bulk density is inversely related to soil organic carbon content zhang and schaap 2019 the analytical relationships calculating ks from water retention parameters see eqs 5 and 6 evidence this assumption by posing ks directly proportional to θs close to soil porosity and inversely proportional to the square of bubbling matric head which in turn indirectly depends on soil texture poiseuille s law as it is quite difficult to find empirical relations by using the original data set we group data into 5 clay classes 0 5 5 10 and so on and calculate median values of bulk density log10 oc and log10 ks after testing normality of their statistical distribution not shown in each clay class the decreasing relation between log10 oc and oven dry bulk density is quantified through an empirical regression function with a high r2 value fig 3 a the circles in fig 3a are colored according to log10 ks values that corroborate published data analysis because most probable log10 ks values occur when oven dry soil bulk density is low and organic carbon content is high and tend to increase along the empirical regression line nonetheless this is only a qualitative statement because ks of soils varies over several orders of magnitude and is affected by unpredictable controlling factors another qualitative assessment can be drawn by a visual inspection of fig 3b that relates 5 clay content classes and median log10 ks values the vertical bars indicate 25th and 75th percentiles it is expected that log10 ks values should linearly decrease with increasing clay content this is observed by a decreasing trend with low log10 ks values for very high clay content however the trend line is balanced by the contrasting impact of soil bulk density circles in fig 3b are colored according to soil bulk density that can be considered a crude proxy of soil structure the effect of other unquantifiable controlling factors adds jeopardy and makes the prediction of ks very problematic and rather cumbersome eck et al 2016 ilek et al 2019 in this section four vg based ptfs namely wey09 rosetta euptfv2 and wos99 outperformed the others and are therefore selected for the functional evaluation presented in the relevant sections below 3 2 results of functional performance 1 in this section it is crudely hypothesized that 44 observations are able to fully describe the spatial variability of the soil water content values at field capacity in the study catchment although this relatively small number of available soil samples can be critical in spatial variability studies we are aware that the majority of real world case studies are based on a limited number of soil samples the goal of this section is to evaluate the capability of four ptfs selected in the previous section to map the field capacity θfc values based on the general regional evaluation wey09 rosetta euptfv2 and wos99 performed the best in this case it is important not only to quantify the accuracy at estimating field capacity but also the ability to reproduce the same observed spatial structure in a study area mfc1 spatial prediction provides estimates of field capacity values at unvisited locations we used the ordinary kriging model to assess the spatial uncertainty arising when the error in predicting field capacity values propagates in unsampled locations fig 4 a shows the stable gaussian model eq 13 fitted on the experimental isotropic variograms based on 44 measured field capacity data in mfc1 fig 4b illustrates the 10 m grid size a total of 680 cells interpolation of observed field capacity using ordinary kriging based on the spatial information described by the gaussian model fitted on the observations the gaussian model was fitted also to the isotropic variograms computed using the four ptf predicted field capacity data fig 5 the goodness of fit was quantified in terms of r2 values eq 8 fig 6 shows the maps of the ptf estimated field capacity values interpolated by ordinary kriging top panel in fig 6 wey09 wos99 rosetta euptfv2 in fig 6a d respectively the comparison between these observed and estimated data over the 680 cells of the study area is depicted in the bottom panel of fig 6 wey09 wos99 rosetta euptfv2 in fig 6e h respectively the rmse values as well as r2 values reported in table 5 are used for evaluating prediction performance over the 44 measurement positions parametric evaluation and the 680 cells functional evaluation in the parametric evaluation the rmse values are very low for wey09 acceptable for euptfv2 wos99 and high for rosetta in the functional evaluation the quality of the ordinary kriging deteriorates especially for wey09 and rosetta rmse values referring to the interpolated maps of field capacity functional evaluation are higher than the corresponding rmse referring to field capacity values over the 44 positions parametric evaluation with increments spanning from 3 euptfv2 up to 16 wey09 these results are corroborated by the corresponding r2 values in the functional evaluation that are worse lower than those reported in the parametric evaluation moreover the ptf predictions clearly underestimate the observations as illustrated in fig 6 with highest bias observed for wos99 and rosetta the best ptfs are wey09 and euptfv2 in terms of rmse values these results reflect the similar predictive performance reported on data in the three european databases table 3 the interpolation of soil hydraulic properties at unvisited locations within the study area is strategic to properly implement distributed water balance models deviations from actual values of a spatial dependent variable estimated by a simpliﬁed procedure can have little effect on the calculation of the mean value in a certain area in contrast the distribution in space of the estimated values of the target variable can differ from that of the actual values to alter the patterns of the semi variograms signiﬁcantly romano and santini 1997 compared the variograms ﬁtted on observed water retention data with the predictions generated by four published ptfs they used a spherical model to fit the experimental semi variograms of soil water content at the fixed matric head values the same authors 1997 selected ver89 as the best ptf to predict the spatial variability of the water retention function they concluded that the observed discrepancy in structural information can be considered a penalty to be paid when using a simpliﬁed methodology to obtain a large number of soil hydraulic parameter values few studies have investigated whether ptfs reliably describe spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties in the field liao et al 2011 silva et al 2017 romano 2004 investigated the ability of a ptf to provide a picture of the actual spatial variations exhibited by a soil attribute and more importantly emphasized the fact that when using a ptf one should consider two additional issues i the scale an issue that strongly interacts with the concept of spatial variability see pringle et al 2007 and ii the ultimate goal of obtaining effective parameters to be employed in a governing equation of motion in the case of mapping soil hydraulic properties in the catchment of lake balaton there was no significant difference in performance between ptf based and geostatistical maps when environmental properties e g topography climate vegetation were considered among the predictors alongside basic soil properties however locally extreme values can be better described when residual kriging is added szabó et al 2019b 3 3 results of functional performance 2 this section addresses the question of how and to what extent the epistemic errors that arise from improper use of ptf predicted soil hydraulic parameterization propagate when an annual soil water budget is simulated at the field scale mean annual precipitation py and potential evapotranspiration etp y are 90 13 cm y 1 and 172 37 cm y 1 respectively as in the previous section we used the four ptfs namely wey09 rosetta euptfv2 and wos99 selected in section 3 1 to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters over the 89 positions along the experimental transect table 6 shows the spatial average mean annual ea y ta y qy of the observed and ptf estimated 5 sets namely obs wey09 rosetta euptfv2 and wos99 of numerical simulations relying on 4749 daily values in the 89 positions when considering the numerical simulations controlled by observed soil hydraulic properties the mean annual actual evapotranspiration eta y is 84 87 cm which represents about 94 and 49 of py and etp y respectively ta y is the dominant flux representing about two thirds of eta y qy represents about 5 of py while surface runoff is negligible the use of soil hydraulic properties predicted by the four ptfs leads to water balance components being different from those obtained by simulations based on direct observations table 6 wos99 outperforms the other ptfs obtaining eta y and qy values with errors lower than 1 cm per year rosetta is the worst performing ptf in this exercise the differences reported in terms of annual water balance components ea y ta y qy in table 6 are reflected in terms of total daily water storage values total number of 422661 values is given by 4749 days multiplied by 89 positions the relationship fig 7 between a total of 422661 water storage data based on observed soil hydraulic properties and water storage data based on ptf estimated soil hydraulic properties is evaluated in terms of rmse and r2 for the four ptfs wos99 wey09 rosetta and euptfv2 the lowest rmse is obtained by wey09 while the highest r2 is obtained by wos99 rosetta tends to underpredict water storage data wey09 and euptfv2 tend to overpredict while wos99 obtains the least biased simulations of water storage values yet it is still not possible to determine the best performing ptf hence it is important to interpret and analyze the impact of soil parameterization on the daily water storage simulated in hydrus 1d to this end the differences between measured and predicted soil hydraulic parameters can be evaluated by using the relative error re over the 89 positions in terms of the field capacity refc and log10 ks reks on the other hand we calculate the mean relative error mrews from daily water storage values wsd based on observed and predicted soil hydraulic parameters in each position of the experimental transect eq 9 the impact of using the predicted soil hydraulic properties on the water balance simulated by hydrus 1d is analyzed by relating the relative errors in terms of observed and predicted field capacity values refc with mrews depicted in fig 8 the circles are colored according to relative errors in terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity reks wos99 wey09 and rosetta consistently underestimate observed field capacity as indicated by positive biased values of refc in fig 8 importantly rosetta leads to a relatively high refc ranging from 18 9 to 41 1 whereas euptfv2 is the only ptf leading to a fairly unbiased refc ranging from 17 1 and 24 3 with a virtually zero mean value refc 3 2 the parametric uncertainty propagates in the water balance computed by hydrus 1d the most accurate simulations of soil water storage values are based on wos99 mrews ranging from 24 3 and 19 6 in fig 8a and euptfv2 mrews ranging from 22 6 and 18 3 in fig 8d as the corresponding mrews values are centered around zero which represents the ideal point on the y axis wey09 mre ranging from 32 1 and 13 8 in fig 8b and especially rosetta mrews ranging from 4 9 and 30 4 in fig 8c are biased and their shifts bring about overestimation mostly negative mrews values and underestimation mostly positive mrews values respectively the concept of precision is related to how much the sample data cluster among them and are quite close to their mean value from a quantitative point of view the standard deviation or the variance equivalently indicates a good precision if its value is quite small rosetta is the most precise ptf in terms of soil water storage with a standard deviation of 7 90 cm partly because this indirect method is somewhat unable to reflect large parametric variability in the european data set in contrast wey09 is the least precise ptf with a standard deviation of 10 93 cm the strong positive relationships pearson correlation coefficients are 0 74 0 71 0 63 0 67 for wos99 wey09 rosetta and euptfv2 respectively between refc and mrews indicate the high sensitivity of the numerical computations of soil water storage to the water retention parameters employed to calculate the soil water content at field capacity eq 3 in other words using ptf predicted field capacity values higher than those obtained by direct observation leads to an overestimation in the simulated soil water storage while euptfv2 outperforms the other ptfs in terms of field capacity estimates it is clear that the lack of precision in guessing the soil water storage is due to a weak estimation of ks values bluish circles in fig 8d rosetta shows a significant bias in terms of both field capacity and ks bluish circles in fig 8c wos99 and wey09 are characterized by similar relationships between refc and mrews fig 8a and b nonetheless wey09 is the only ptf able to predict ks reliably with the majority of reks around zero as indicated by the greenish circles in fig 8b several studies present functional evaluations for water balance simulations especially for comparing observed and estimated soil water content patterns nemes et al 2003 abkenar and rasoulzadeh 2019 guber et al 2009 performed a functional evaluation using hydrus 1d to evaluate the impact on various components of the simulated water budget when parameterizing the richards equation with 19 ptfs christiansen and feyen 2001 found that the established saturated hydraulic conductivity and saturated water content were the most influential parameters in determining the uncertainty in the catchment scale water budget all these studies showed that parameterizing a hydrological model with ptf predicted soil hydraulic properties is definitely a promising approach to overcome the issue of data scarcity 4 concluding remarks the parametric evaluation of eleven ptfs to predict the water retention function and ten ptfs to predict the saturated hydraulic conductivity using a relatively large dataset collected over europe enabled us to select the most accurate and reliable ones with respect to different spatial scales of interest the most recent vg based ptfs wey09 wos99 euptfv2 proved to be accurate enough for predicting the water retention function rosetta ver89 sax86 t h98 and r b85 performed acceptably and can be theoretically improved in some textural classes although they were calibrated and validated outside europe under different climatic and environmental conditions the ten ptfs used to predict saturated hydraulic conductivity demonstrated a generally poor performance with uncertainty spanning over one or two orders of magnitude the main predictors soil bulk density organic carbon content and texture are cross correlated and might play contrasting roles in predicting saturated hydraulic conductivity especially due to the lack of its standardized measurement method in this study we evaluated the effectiveness of four vg based ptfs selected based on the outcomes of the parametric evaluations to properly estimate the observed water contents at field capacity by considering a relatively small number of soil samples moreover we also evaluated the ability of the ptfs to reproduce the kriged maps of field capacity reporting a deterioration of prediction performance from 3 to 16 in terms of rmse values compared to parametric evaluation finally we evaluated the impact of parameterizing the richards equation with ptf predicted shp on daily water fluxes as simulated by hydrus 1d within a 2 m thick uniform soil profile we verified the hypothesis for which large discrepancies between observed and ptf predicted key soil hydraulic properties lead to substantial differences in simulated water fluxes although the four ptfs proved satisfactorily equivalent for simulating daily water storage values we stress the importance of describing the

8148,study region this study focuses on the simulation of flow and transport of potential contaminants at the riverbank filtration rbf site at embaba cairo rbf has a high potential along the nile in egypt as a pre treatment step for drinking water production as the site in cairo can be affected by low water quality and spills of contaminants the aim was to assess the rbf efficiency under various hydrological geohydraulic and operational conditions study focus modflow mt3d and modpath were used in this study three cases were considered to identify the share of bank filtrate in pumped water and the travel time the first case focused on the river hydrograph and the permeability of the riverbed the second on clay cap thickness aquifer and riverbed hydraulic conductivities and groundwater abstraction downside of the rbf scheme and the third on different rbf well abstraction rates depths screen lengths and distances from the river bank new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that favorable conditions for rbf sites good conditions for rbf include high river stage and riverbed permeability high aquifer hydraulic conductivity and abstraction rates resulting in high portions of bank filtrate design and operation analysis indicate that the abstraction wells should be shallow and located close to the river bank to achieve shorter travel times thus increasing productivity and preventing high manganese concentrations in the pumped bank filtrate due to the natural flow gradient from the nile towards the rbf wells changing conditions have impact on the portions of bank filtrate making the site special keywords riverbank filtration rbf groundwater travel time bank filtrate share modeling 1 introduction the increase in worldwide population causes an increasing water demand by 55 in 2050 compared to the current use boretti and rosa 2019 the middle east and north africa mena region will face an increase in water demand to 393 billion cubic meter bcm yr by 2050 whereas water shortage would increase to 199 bcm yr due to climate change overpopulation and urbanization droogers et al 2012 with the increase in surface water pollution due to its exposure to many pollutants the cost of conventional treatment has also increased forcing us to further use environmentally friendly and low cost techniques for water treatment as long as the population in egypt grows the demand for water increases requiring more efforts to be made to ensure that water resources are protected and more attention is paid to water quality since the middle of the twentieth century increasing attention has been paid to the quality of water supply and delivery of drinking water to all population centers however many egyptian villages still suffer from a lack of potable water in 2018 the united nations un world water development report stated that egypt was below the un s threshold of water poverty and currently facing water scarcity as egypt s annual share of water per capita was around 1000 m3 and significantly heading towards outright water shortage by 500 m3 water 2018 the expected annual share of egypt s water is expected to decrease from 600 to 350 cubic meters per capita m3 c by 2040 unfccc 2010 egypt must cope with water scarcity due to overpopulation the threat of climate change and limited freshwater resources initiative 2005 kachaka 2005 nbi 2005 the nile is egypt s main source for surface water supplies and the country s portion of the nile water is 55 5 billion cubic meters per year bcm yr which represents about 82 1 of egypt s total water resources el atfy 2007 surface water is provided as drinking water in egypt at a rate of 8 80 bcm yr which represents about 91 4 while groundwater and desalination account for 8 3 and 0 24 respectively hcww 2017 egypt is subject to rapid increase in surface and groundwater deterioration due to increasing discharges of pollutants from agriculture household and industrial effluents into the nile and its canals ahmed and ali 2011 the nile water is impaired by three types of pollution the first being agricultural runoff and drainage containing pesticides and herbicides the second consists of industrial and domestic effluents bearing heavy metals and suspended solids and the third is due to frequent discharges of oil waste and other contaminants by ferries and ships moreover about 65 of the industrial water needs are supplied from the nile while the effluents passed back into the nile are more than 57 mohamed et al 2013 high turbidity is caused by torrents coming from the desert border during heavy rainstorms hcww 2017 the history of nile disasters includes the emergence of an oil slick along a 6 km stretch from industrial wastewater plants at edfu city in aswan in 2010 mohamed et al 2013 el safty et al 2017 other spills were reported in 2012 when an old boat burned close to the bank to the south of isna affecting an area of about 1 05 km2 al masry 2012 ewida 2014 and leakage of pesticides from the kafr el zayat factories at kafr el sheik rashid branch led to the death of a large number of fish recently another source of nile pollution has emerged due to effluents from the kima factory and elsayel drain in aswan city additionally in 2016 the upper egypt cities were subjected to flash floods which killed several dozen people and caused damage to infrastructure and property elnazer et al 2017 the ipcc 2014 showed that over the 21st century both surface water and groundwater resources in the driest subtropical zones are expected to decrease due to climatic changes with droughts likely to increase in dry areas while water resources are expected to increase at high latitudes climatic changes are affecting the hydrology of the nile river basin where the average annual precipitation is expected to decrease in egypt agrawala et al 2004 on the other hand kwadijk 2007 showed that a 10 increase in total rainfall over the river basin would lead to river flow increasing by 40 indicating how sensitive the river flow is to basin precipitation moreover climate models predict that precipitation will increase during period i from 2010 to 2039 then decrease later during periods ii and iii between 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 respectively based on climate scenarios produced by the ipcc in 2007 beyene et al 2010 population growth and continuous development are resulting in increased abstraction of groundwater which decreases the aquifer freshwater resources egypt s nile delta aquifer is considered one of the biggest groundwater reservoirs worldwide abd elhamid et al 2019 it has been classified as a semi confined aquifer due to the upper clay layer and its production represents about 85 of total groundwater abstraction in egypt mwri 2013 the effect of climate change has an impact on both surface water and groundwater resources abd elaty et al 2019b so the influence of over pumping and precipitation change on water resources in the nile aquifer has been investigated and studied by various authors abd elaty et al 2016 2019a mabrouk et al 2013 morsy 2009 sherif and singh 1997 since 2011 egypt is facing another major concern the construction of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd on the blue nile at guba the dam has a storage capacity of 74 bcm water will be diverted to the reservoir to develop the required head for power generation tesfa 2013 which may have a serious effect on the discharge of the nile downstream of the gerd within the territories of sudan and egypt based on the required time to fill the reservoir egypt s water share 55 5 bcm may be affected and the water discharge and levels in the nile may decline and may cause a significant reduction in the recharge and quality of the nile delta aquifer riverbank filtration rbf is an eco friendly technique for pretreatment or direct extraction of drinking water using aquifer sediments as a natural filter river water flows through the natural pores in the riverbed and aquifer induced by water abstraction from pumping wells fig 1 through the processes of adsorption filtration and biodegradation the water quality of the infiltrating water bank filtrate is improved rbf has been used for water treatment or pre treatment in europe for more than a century doussan et al 1997 in germany rbf and artificial groundwater recharge account for about 16 of the total drinking water supply dillon et al 2019 oberleitner et al 2020 conducted a field study on two rbf well locations to study the effect of water travel distance on micropollutant removal efficiency rossetto et al 2020 used an interdisciplinary approach involving methods of hydrodynamics hydrochemistry and numerical modelling in order to assess changes in recharge from river to aquifer due to the construction of rbf infrastructure along the serchio river in lucca italy kondor et al 2020 examined the efficiency of rbf along a highly urbanized section of the danube in hungary in india rbf along the ganga river is mainly used for removing turbidity bacteria and organic compounds dash et al 2010 while in the united states rbf along the wabash river attracted great attention due to its capacity to remove disinfection by product precursors and pathogens such as giardia and cryptosporidium weiss et al 2003 moreover in thailand rbf is accepted as an additional water source for municipal and industrial consumption pholkern et al 2015 jaramillo et al 2019 evaluated an rbf system using a numerical and experimental model to simulate pesticide removal kazak and pozdniakov 2021 conducted a series of field investigations and numerical simulations in voronezh russian federation to reveal the potential source of iron in groundwater pumped through riverbank wells covatti and grischek 2020 found that at river water temperatures 10 c the most common source of ammonium in rbf is the mineralization of organic nitrogen occurring in the riverbed which is also relevant for egypt with the new millennium rbf started being increasingly applied in egypt as an alternative to conventional surface water abstraction and treatment and as a cost competitor in the year 2000 the use of rbf in egypt accounted for less than 1 of total drinking water production several desk top and field site studies have been carried out for different sites along the nile to identify feasible locations and evaluate the potential of rbf in egypt ghodeif et al 2016 wahaab et al 2019 the local water companies in egypt had previously constructed rbf test sites as groundwater wells along the nile and main canal banks some of these sites proved successful while others failed after short term operation with very high withdrawal rates due to canal bed blockage other reasons were insufficient hydrogeological investigation incorrect well design and or lack of operational instructions and procedures for operating the system on the other hand the rbf schemes constructed along the nile in upper egypt work successfully receiving substantial amounts of bank filtrate and producing water which complies with the egyptian drinking water standards for organic inorganic and microbial parameters ghodeif et al 2016 with the advancement of simulation and modeling software it has become possible to make actual visualizations of rbf systems which helps in overcoming some of the problems encountered abdalla and shamrukh 2016 between 2015 and 2018 wahaab et al 2019 studied changes in water quality during the initial phase of rbf at three sites in upper egypt the results indicate that rbf wells should be operated continuously for sustainable interaction between the river and wells ongoing research indicates that rbf requires further investigation especially geological studies at specific sites abd elaty et al 2021 simulated rbf at embaba nile delta egypt considering climatic changes in arid and semi arid regions their results show that water supply systems in arid and semi arid regions should be extended through installation and operation of rbf to mitigate some of the negative effects of climatic change in terms of reduction in river stage and aquifer recharge and of increased abstraction due to overpopulation the aim of this study was to investigate the significance of the river hydrograph and the effects of permeability of the riverbed thickness of the clay cap aquifer hydraulic conductivity and abstraction rates the well scheme design for different abstraction rates depths screen lengths and distances from the river bank on the rbf share rbfs and travel time of bank filtrate research on rbf schemes in egypt using numerical simulation models is limited compared to field investigations the study used modflow mt3d and modpath for the base case and different scenarios for river aquifer and well schemes 2 study area description 2 1 the nile delta aquifer and nile river case study area the nile delta is considered one of the most heavily populated agrarian regions in the world with more than 1000 inhabitants per square kilometer aquastat 2013 the study area is located in giza governorate egypt between latitudes 31 4 to 31 16 n and longitudes 30 4 to 30 12 e as presented in fig 2 the nile delta region is warm with cairo experiencing average temperatures in january and july between 12 c and 31 c respectively the area is generally dry with annual rainfall of less than 40 mm humidity varying between 45 and 84 and daily evaporation between 2 5 and 15 mm el arabi et al 2013 the study zone lies in the south west of the nile delta an area composed of quaternary and tertiary deposits and underlain by pliocene clays rigw 1992 it consists of two layers a top layer formed in the holocene age and made up of alternating fine to medium grained sand silt and clay interbeds known as bilqas forming and a bottom layer belonging to the mit ghamr formation and including organic matter and peat beds the latter acts as a semi confining layer for the aquifer said 2017 thus the nile delta quaternary aquifer is classified as a semi conﬁned aquifer ball 1952 sabry 2016 which occupies of the whole nile delta with a gradient thickness reaching 1000 m in the north and gradually decreasing to 200 m in cairo fig 3 where the rbf site is located rigw 1992 the depth of groundwater ranges between two meters in the north to five meters below ground surface mbgs in the south rigw 2002 the annual bulk recharge of the nile delta reservoir comes from river seepage and a wide network of irrigation canals as well as from a large amount of irrigation water overload due to use the traditional irrigation systems al agha et al 2015 omran 2019 sefelnasr and sherif 2014 the estimated average total seepage from the ismailia canal is about 919 870 m3 day hamza et al 1988 over the years the aquifer discharge has increased from 1 60 bcm in 1980 rigw 1989 1992 to 7 00 bcm in 2016 molle et al 2016 as presented in fig 4 with pumping rates of 0 10 bcm per year increasing to 0 20 bcm from 2003 to 2010 mabrouk et al 2013 groundwater flows from south to north with an average gradient of about 0 0002 but a depression has occurred in the western fringes of giza governorate near the sphinx and pyramids in the south west of the study area this is due to over utilization by el golf club and nadi el remaya the shallow aquifer at this site has fresh groundwater but is highly polluted as it is recharged at a rate of 0 50 mm day due to leakage of sewage water seepage from the nile itself and its canals and percolation from irrigation water el arabi et al 2013 2 2 installation of an rbf scheme at embaba giza in 2015 the holding company for water and wastewater hcww drilled rbf wells to support the capacity of the embaba drinking water treatment station near giza fig 2b this station is one of the largest water treatment plants in egypt with a total capacity of 1 2 million cubic meters per day mcm d to meet the growing need for water ghodeif et al 2016 hydraulically the site is suited for rbf where the thickness of the aquifer is about 50 m or more sand and gravel being the main components the nile naturally recharges the aquifer at the site the water flow in the river is very stable after the construction of the aswan high dam which ensures sustainable amounts of water downstream ghodeif et al 2018 based on the report of mwri 2013 the nile s hydrograph at aswan before and after the construction of the high dam and the river water level in meters above sea level masl for the rbf site at embaba recorded by ghodeif et al 2018 are combined in fig 5 this figure shows that the hydrograph used to peak between july and november before the construction of the high dam reaching 21 mcm in september and moreover after the high dam construction the nile flow changed becoming sustainable through the year with maximum discharge controlled between june and september and maximum flow 6 mcm in july another result is that the nile water levels at the embaba plant range between 16 02 16 14 masl in january and december respectively the rbf scheme consists of six production wells about 54 m in depth 450 mm in diameter with a discharge of 150 m3 h for each well the distance between the wells and the river bank ranges between 10 and 15 m in addition to the six production wells four test wells with a depth of 64 m and maximum diameter of 216 mm were drilled to identify the lithology additionally two test wells with a depth of 30 m and a diameter of 100 mm were sunk one at the side of the river and the other further inland ghodeif et al 2018 table 1 presents the total dissolved solids tds values for the nile and rbf well water at embaba indicating a slight increase in mineral content for better understanding of groundwater flow conditions and determination of bank filtrate portions and travel times a numerical groundwater flow model was set up 3 methodology 3 1 design of groundwater flow and transport simulation model numerical modeling was applied to investigate the operation of the rbf scheme and predict the rbf water quality for the current situation and different scenarios using modflow mcdonald et al 2003 mt3d javandel et al 1984 and modpath pollock 1998 harbaugh 2005 the modpath code was used to determine the 3 d particle tracking path lines during steady state and transient conditions the modpath code uses a semi analytical particle tracking scheme based on the assumption that the velocity component in each direction varies linearly in a grid cell in its own coordinate direction this hypothesis allows an analytical expression describing the flow path in the grid cell given the initial position of a particle at any point in a cell it is possible to calculate the coordinates of any other point along its path line within the cell and the travel time between them sws 2010 the model domain covers an area of 502 6 km2 28 km long and 17 95 km wide it was divided into 155 columns and 87 rows with a square mesh size of 40 000 m2 reduced from 10 000 m2 to 625 m2 close to the rbf unit fig 6 presents the study domain the depth of the aquifer was divided into six layers with the first layer representing the clay cap 5 7 m thick while the other layers of the quaternary aquifer are each about 42 m thick the second and third layers were divided into 16 sub layers with an average thickness ranging from 5 to 6 m the fourth layer was divided into four sub layers and the fifth and sixth layers were each divided into two sublayers the boundary conditions were assigned using the river package where the nile was assigned to the east side with a water level starting at 16 30 masl in the south to 15 95 masl in the north while the other side was bounded in the north by el rayah and el behery which share properties between rivers and canals and range from 15 40 masl in the east to 14 40 masl in the west however the southern and western boundaries were defined as no flow boundaries fig 6a shows the study area boundary conditions while the two sections in x and y direction are presented in fig 6b and c the aquifer hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity k storage coefficient s specific storage ss and effective porosity ne are presented in table 2 these parameters are reported by el arabi 2007 morsy 2009 negm et al 2019 and abd elaty et al 2020 the total abstraction rate was set to the planned 50 000 m3 day fig 6 presents the distribution of the pumping wells in the aquifer where the nadi el ramaiya and el golf club are located and where the average recharge is 0 30 mm day the river was assigned a constant tds concentration of 260 ppm while the recharge and initial concentration for the whole study area were set to 1000 ppm omran 2019 the riverbank filtration share rbfs in percent was calculated using the mean values of tds for groundwater gw river water dawoud et al 2005 and pumped water rbf the rbfs was calculated using eq 1 1 r b f s t d s g w t d s r b f t d s g w t d s r i v e r x 100 3 2 model calibration the model calibration process started with a comparison of the simulated heads using measured data from the field observation wells the recorded data were taken from the greater cairo piezometric contour map the flow model was calibrated for steady state by changing the aquifer hydraulic conductivity to match the model results and the calculated head as shown in fig 7 the results show that a high water level occurred around the river zone while a drop occurred at the west side with nadi el remaya and el golf club fig 7 the velocity directions and the locations of observation and pumping wells are presented in fig 8 a it shows that the main groundwater flow direction is from the high level in the north and east towards the low level in the south and west fig 8b shows the location of rbf wells along the nile fig 9 a shows the difference between calculated and observed heads where the root mean square error rms and normalized rms reached 0 187 m and 5 34 respectively and the correlation coefficient reached 98 9 while the absolute residual mean and standard error of estimate reached 0 15 m and 0 03 m respectively moreover the maximum minimum and mean residual reached 0 38 0 002 and 0 09 m respectively fig 9b presents the piezometric contour map of greater cairo area in 1982 published by el arabi et al 2013 the tds results are presented in fig 10 showing the distribution of salinity in the vertical model cross section the solute transport model was calibrated using the field data for tds from ghodeif et al 2018 see table 1 the mt3d results give a good fit with the field data from the observation wells 3 3 definition of model scenarios the model was developed to simulate the study area in the south west of the nile delta aquifer to assess the impacts of different scenarios table 3 on the interaction between surface water and groundwater and thus also on the share of bank filtrate rbfs in the abstracted water and the travel time of particles which were assigned at the river centerline table 3 and fig 11 illustrate the scenarios for the river aquifer and rbf wells to be considered in the design and management of the rbf scheme under different hydrological conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of river hydrograph and seepage on rbf bank filtration share and travel times this case was investigated by decreasing the river stage by 80 60 40 20 and 0 from the base case 100 as presented in table 3 and fig 12 a fig 12b presents the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed with 1 m thickness which was changed from 0 50 m day at base case to 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 1 m day as expected the results show that lower river water level and lower hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed cause a decrease in rbfs to 67 5 62 8 56 5 48 7 and 34 3 and increase the particle travel time from the river center to 230 260 380 505 and 605 days for the river stage respectively the rbfs for the riverbed conductivity scenarios was found to be between 59 7 and 73 5 and travel times reached 190 450 days maintaining high riverbed seepage by removing mud from the riverbed in front of the wells would ensure high productivity of the abstraction wells as indicated in fig 15b as removing mud from the riverbed increases the permeability of the soil which leads to an increase in efficiency of rbf sharing moreover ghodeif et al 2018 indicated that the nile is constantly exposed to these sediments so silt is dredged two or three times annually using appropriate equipment which improves the hydraulic connection between the river and the main underground water reservoir the normal annual water flow at high aswan dam had is 55 5 bcm according to international agreements filling the gerd reservoir by 75 bcm could decrease this share and cause lower water levels in the nile fig 13 shows the effect of the time of filling from 2 years to 12 years on the rbf share simulating 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 years filling by a reduced nile stage by 67 30 33 60 22 40 16 80 13 50 and 11 20 causing a rbfs of 53 3 65 2 67 7 68 6 69 1 and 69 6 respectively these results indicated that shortening the period of filling the gerd may have a negative impact on rbf schemes along the nile 4 2 effect of aquifer parameters and pumping rates on bank filtrate share and travel times different scenarios of aquifer clay cap thickness hydraulic conductivity and abstraction rates were simulated the clay cap thickness was increased from 5 7 m base case to 8 10 12 and 14 m the aquifer hydraulic conductivities were changed from 5 m day base case to 1 2 10 12 and 20 m day moreover a total of 100 abstraction wells are located in the south west of the study area as shown in fig 6a with different pumping rates of 0 50 70 and 100 m3 h compared to 20 m3 h base case for each well the simulation results indicate that the rbfs changes only slightly from 71 1 to 70 5 with increasing clay cap thickness but the travel times increase from 360 to 650 days fig 14 a depending on aquifer hydraulic conductivity rbfs between 54 8 and 79 6 was calculated with respect to travel times between 50 and 380 days fig 14b increased abstraction rates from the aquifer had the most significant effect on rbfs fig 14c shows rbfs values from 5 to 95 4 and travel times from 380 to 100 days with increased abstraction rates these results highlight that the travel times decrease at higher values of aquifer hydraulic conductivity and higher pumping rates as expected thus a major site selection criterion for rbf systems is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity which matches with the hydraulic conductivities criteria presented by hiscock and grischek 2002 in the range of 1 10 2 7 5 10 5 m s along the elbe river in germany 4 3 effect of rbf pumping scheme design on bank filtrate share and travel times further rbf scenarios were simulated with different rbf well abstraction rates which were changed from 10 25 75 225 and 300 m3 h for each rbf well compared to 150 m3 h base case for well depths of 54 m with a screen length of 25 m and a distance of 10 m to the river bank shore line then different well depths 25 75 100 125 and 150 m different lengths of the well screen 29 34 39 44 and 54 m and different distances between the wells and the river bank 25 50 75 100 and 125 m the different discharge rates resulted in rbfs values of 28 4 44 7 63 8 74 3 and 76 6 and 650 595 455 155 and 135 days for particle travel time fig 15a here the individual pumping rates have to be defined based on the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and may be limited to about 150 m3 h working with higher pumping rates in the model creates a strong cone of depression which may not be achieved with a larger number of wells having lower pumping rates but may be achieved using a horizontal collector well different well depths showed a comparatively lower effect on rbfs ranging from 74 6 64 and travel times ranging from 35 to 625 days fig 15b fig 15c shows that the rbfs did not change when different screen lengths were applied but travel times changed from 200 to 140 days the screen length is important for entrance flow velocities and the lifespan of the wells a length of 54 m is just a theoretical value as the screen should remain below the water level in the well during pumping results of changing the distance between the rbf wells and the river bank are presented in fig 15d the rbfs values reached 70 4 69 2 67 4 66 3 and 65 0 as a result of the natural flow gradient towards the wells while the travel times reached 230 260 310 380 and 480 days as expected increased pumping rates led to increased rbfs and decreased travel time increasing the rbf well depth and screen length had less effect on rbfs than on travel times increased distance between the rbf wells and the river bank led to decreased rbfs and increased travel times due to the greater portion of groundwater further away from the riverbank so installing rbf wells close to the river bank is more effective in terms of increasing the rbf portion fig 16 presents the spatial distribution of rbfs at the site at embaba with well locations from the river bank of 25 50 75 100 and 125 m also the current locations of the existing 6 rbf wells are shown the rbfs decreased from 70 4 for a 25 m distance from the shore line to 69 2 67 4 66 3 and 65 0 respectively the results prove rbf wells should be placed close to the river bank to get a higher rbfs to achieve high rbfs values and low manganese concentrations as an effect of short travel times at the site embaba rbf wells should be constructed at shallow depth and close to the river bank and then operated continuously fig 17 moreover continuous operation could reduce the salinity of water in the well zone frequent removal of mud deposits in front of the rbf scheme would enhance infiltration and further reduce mixing with groundwater near the river zone 5 conclusions in this study various scenarios were assessed for an existing rbf scheme on the nile at embaba cairo using modflow mt3d and modpath the impact of a changing river hydrograph hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed clay cap thickness aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer abstraction rates rbf well abstraction rates well depths screen lengths and distances between rbf wells and the river bank were quantified at low river stages the rbf share decreased to 56 compared with 71 in the current situation rbfs reached 73 5 for a high hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed of 1 m day the results from the different aquifer scenarios show that the travel time from the center of the river decreases to 140 days for high values of aquifer hydraulic conductivity 10 m day groundwater abstraction in the south west affects the natural flow gradient so higher groundwater pumping rates result in shorter travel times of bank filtrate pumped from the rbf wells the increase in clay cap thickness has less impact on rbfs than on travel times as long as there is hydraulic contact between the river and the upper sand layer of the aquifer high individual pumping rates of the rbf wells e g 300 m3 h lead to an increase in rbfs to 76 6 and a decrease in travel time to 115 days increasing the rbf well distances from the river bank from 10 to 100 m decrease the rbfs from 69 to 65 only this is not typical for a rbf site and it is a result of the natural flow gradient towards the rbf wells in this case wells could also be operated discontinuously as the river water will pass the wells due to the local flow conditions in general rbf wells should be operated continuously to ensure high rbfs the well screens should be placed at shallow depth and close to the river bank to ensure a high portion of bank filtrate and short travel time and to limit redox reactions in the riverbed and adjacent aquifer resulting in increased manganese concentrations high river stage and high hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed e g due to erosive conditions and high river flow velocity are favorable conditions for rbf at the investigated site the particle travel time is less affected by rbfs and more affected by increased rbf well abstraction rates and screen lengths and by reduced well distance and depth making this site

8148,study region this study focuses on the simulation of flow and transport of potential contaminants at the riverbank filtration rbf site at embaba cairo rbf has a high potential along the nile in egypt as a pre treatment step for drinking water production as the site in cairo can be affected by low water quality and spills of contaminants the aim was to assess the rbf efficiency under various hydrological geohydraulic and operational conditions study focus modflow mt3d and modpath were used in this study three cases were considered to identify the share of bank filtrate in pumped water and the travel time the first case focused on the river hydrograph and the permeability of the riverbed the second on clay cap thickness aquifer and riverbed hydraulic conductivities and groundwater abstraction downside of the rbf scheme and the third on different rbf well abstraction rates depths screen lengths and distances from the river bank new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that favorable conditions for rbf sites good conditions for rbf include high river stage and riverbed permeability high aquifer hydraulic conductivity and abstraction rates resulting in high portions of bank filtrate design and operation analysis indicate that the abstraction wells should be shallow and located close to the river bank to achieve shorter travel times thus increasing productivity and preventing high manganese concentrations in the pumped bank filtrate due to the natural flow gradient from the nile towards the rbf wells changing conditions have impact on the portions of bank filtrate making the site special keywords riverbank filtration rbf groundwater travel time bank filtrate share modeling 1 introduction the increase in worldwide population causes an increasing water demand by 55 in 2050 compared to the current use boretti and rosa 2019 the middle east and north africa mena region will face an increase in water demand to 393 billion cubic meter bcm yr by 2050 whereas water shortage would increase to 199 bcm yr due to climate change overpopulation and urbanization droogers et al 2012 with the increase in surface water pollution due to its exposure to many pollutants the cost of conventional treatment has also increased forcing us to further use environmentally friendly and low cost techniques for water treatment as long as the population in egypt grows the demand for water increases requiring more efforts to be made to ensure that water resources are protected and more attention is paid to water quality since the middle of the twentieth century increasing attention has been paid to the quality of water supply and delivery of drinking water to all population centers however many egyptian villages still suffer from a lack of potable water in 2018 the united nations un world water development report stated that egypt was below the un s threshold of water poverty and currently facing water scarcity as egypt s annual share of water per capita was around 1000 m3 and significantly heading towards outright water shortage by 500 m3 water 2018 the expected annual share of egypt s water is expected to decrease from 600 to 350 cubic meters per capita m3 c by 2040 unfccc 2010 egypt must cope with water scarcity due to overpopulation the threat of climate change and limited freshwater resources initiative 2005 kachaka 2005 nbi 2005 the nile is egypt s main source for surface water supplies and the country s portion of the nile water is 55 5 billion cubic meters per year bcm yr which represents about 82 1 of egypt s total water resources el atfy 2007 surface water is provided as drinking water in egypt at a rate of 8 80 bcm yr which represents about 91 4 while groundwater and desalination account for 8 3 and 0 24 respectively hcww 2017 egypt is subject to rapid increase in surface and groundwater deterioration due to increasing discharges of pollutants from agriculture household and industrial effluents into the nile and its canals ahmed and ali 2011 the nile water is impaired by three types of pollution the first being agricultural runoff and drainage containing pesticides and herbicides the second consists of industrial and domestic effluents bearing heavy metals and suspended solids and the third is due to frequent discharges of oil waste and other contaminants by ferries and ships moreover about 65 of the industrial water needs are supplied from the nile while the effluents passed back into the nile are more than 57 mohamed et al 2013 high turbidity is caused by torrents coming from the desert border during heavy rainstorms hcww 2017 the history of nile disasters includes the emergence of an oil slick along a 6 km stretch from industrial wastewater plants at edfu city in aswan in 2010 mohamed et al 2013 el safty et al 2017 other spills were reported in 2012 when an old boat burned close to the bank to the south of isna affecting an area of about 1 05 km2 al masry 2012 ewida 2014 and leakage of pesticides from the kafr el zayat factories at kafr el sheik rashid branch led to the death of a large number of fish recently another source of nile pollution has emerged due to effluents from the kima factory and elsayel drain in aswan city additionally in 2016 the upper egypt cities were subjected to flash floods which killed several dozen people and caused damage to infrastructure and property elnazer et al 2017 the ipcc 2014 showed that over the 21st century both surface water and groundwater resources in the driest subtropical zones are expected to decrease due to climatic changes with droughts likely to increase in dry areas while water resources are expected to increase at high latitudes climatic changes are affecting the hydrology of the nile river basin where the average annual precipitation is expected to decrease in egypt agrawala et al 2004 on the other hand kwadijk 2007 showed that a 10 increase in total rainfall over the river basin would lead to river flow increasing by 40 indicating how sensitive the river flow is to basin precipitation moreover climate models predict that precipitation will increase during period i from 2010 to 2039 then decrease later during periods ii and iii between 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 respectively based on climate scenarios produced by the ipcc in 2007 beyene et al 2010 population growth and continuous development are resulting in increased abstraction of groundwater which decreases the aquifer freshwater resources egypt s nile delta aquifer is considered one of the biggest groundwater reservoirs worldwide abd elhamid et al 2019 it has been classified as a semi confined aquifer due to the upper clay layer and its production represents about 85 of total groundwater abstraction in egypt mwri 2013 the effect of climate change has an impact on both surface water and groundwater resources abd elaty et al 2019b so the influence of over pumping and precipitation change on water resources in the nile aquifer has been investigated and studied by various authors abd elaty et al 2016 2019a mabrouk et al 2013 morsy 2009 sherif and singh 1997 since 2011 egypt is facing another major concern the construction of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd on the blue nile at guba the dam has a storage capacity of 74 bcm water will be diverted to the reservoir to develop the required head for power generation tesfa 2013 which may have a serious effect on the discharge of the nile downstream of the gerd within the territories of sudan and egypt based on the required time to fill the reservoir egypt s water share 55 5 bcm may be affected and the water discharge and levels in the nile may decline and may cause a significant reduction in the recharge and quality of the nile delta aquifer riverbank filtration rbf is an eco friendly technique for pretreatment or direct extraction of drinking water using aquifer sediments as a natural filter river water flows through the natural pores in the riverbed and aquifer induced by water abstraction from pumping wells fig 1 through the processes of adsorption filtration and biodegradation the water quality of the infiltrating water bank filtrate is improved rbf has been used for water treatment or pre treatment in europe for more than a century doussan et al 1997 in germany rbf and artificial groundwater recharge account for about 16 of the total drinking water supply dillon et al 2019 oberleitner et al 2020 conducted a field study on two rbf well locations to study the effect of water travel distance on micropollutant removal efficiency rossetto et al 2020 used an interdisciplinary approach involving methods of hydrodynamics hydrochemistry and numerical modelling in order to assess changes in recharge from river to aquifer due to the construction of rbf infrastructure along the serchio river in lucca italy kondor et al 2020 examined the efficiency of rbf along a highly urbanized section of the danube in hungary in india rbf along the ganga river is mainly used for removing turbidity bacteria and organic compounds dash et al 2010 while in the united states rbf along the wabash river attracted great attention due to its capacity to remove disinfection by product precursors and pathogens such as giardia and cryptosporidium weiss et al 2003 moreover in thailand rbf is accepted as an additional water source for municipal and industrial consumption pholkern et al 2015 jaramillo et al 2019 evaluated an rbf system using a numerical and experimental model to simulate pesticide removal kazak and pozdniakov 2021 conducted a series of field investigations and numerical simulations in voronezh russian federation to reveal the potential source of iron in groundwater pumped through riverbank wells covatti and grischek 2020 found that at river water temperatures 10 c the most common source of ammonium in rbf is the mineralization of organic nitrogen occurring in the riverbed which is also relevant for egypt with the new millennium rbf started being increasingly applied in egypt as an alternative to conventional surface water abstraction and treatment and as a cost competitor in the year 2000 the use of rbf in egypt accounted for less than 1 of total drinking water production several desk top and field site studies have been carried out for different sites along the nile to identify feasible locations and evaluate the potential of rbf in egypt ghodeif et al 2016 wahaab et al 2019 the local water companies in egypt had previously constructed rbf test sites as groundwater wells along the nile and main canal banks some of these sites proved successful while others failed after short term operation with very high withdrawal rates due to canal bed blockage other reasons were insufficient hydrogeological investigation incorrect well design and or lack of operational instructions and procedures for operating the system on the other hand the rbf schemes constructed along the nile in upper egypt work successfully receiving substantial amounts of bank filtrate and producing water which complies with the egyptian drinking water standards for organic inorganic and microbial parameters ghodeif et al 2016 with the advancement of simulation and modeling software it has become possible to make actual visualizations of rbf systems which helps in overcoming some of the problems encountered abdalla and shamrukh 2016 between 2015 and 2018 wahaab et al 2019 studied changes in water quality during the initial phase of rbf at three sites in upper egypt the results indicate that rbf wells should be operated continuously for sustainable interaction between the river and wells ongoing research indicates that rbf requires further investigation especially geological studies at specific sites abd elaty et al 2021 simulated rbf at embaba nile delta egypt considering climatic changes in arid and semi arid regions their results show that water supply systems in arid and semi arid regions should be extended through installation and operation of rbf to mitigate some of the negative effects of climatic change in terms of reduction in river stage and aquifer recharge and of increased abstraction due to overpopulation the aim of this study was to investigate the significance of the river hydrograph and the effects of permeability of the riverbed thickness of the clay cap aquifer hydraulic conductivity and abstraction rates the well scheme design for different abstraction rates depths screen lengths and distances from the river bank on the rbf share rbfs and travel time of bank filtrate research on rbf schemes in egypt using numerical simulation models is limited compared to field investigations the study used modflow mt3d and modpath for the base case and different scenarios for river aquifer and well schemes 2 study area description 2 1 the nile delta aquifer and nile river case study area the nile delta is considered one of the most heavily populated agrarian regions in the world with more than 1000 inhabitants per square kilometer aquastat 2013 the study area is located in giza governorate egypt between latitudes 31 4 to 31 16 n and longitudes 30 4 to 30 12 e as presented in fig 2 the nile delta region is warm with cairo experiencing average temperatures in january and july between 12 c and 31 c respectively the area is generally dry with annual rainfall of less than 40 mm humidity varying between 45 and 84 and daily evaporation between 2 5 and 15 mm el arabi et al 2013 the study zone lies in the south west of the nile delta an area composed of quaternary and tertiary deposits and underlain by pliocene clays rigw 1992 it consists of two layers a top layer formed in the holocene age and made up of alternating fine to medium grained sand silt and clay interbeds known as bilqas forming and a bottom layer belonging to the mit ghamr formation and including organic matter and peat beds the latter acts as a semi confining layer for the aquifer said 2017 thus the nile delta quaternary aquifer is classified as a semi conﬁned aquifer ball 1952 sabry 2016 which occupies of the whole nile delta with a gradient thickness reaching 1000 m in the north and gradually decreasing to 200 m in cairo fig 3 where the rbf site is located rigw 1992 the depth of groundwater ranges between two meters in the north to five meters below ground surface mbgs in the south rigw 2002 the annual bulk recharge of the nile delta reservoir comes from river seepage and a wide network of irrigation canals as well as from a large amount of irrigation water overload due to use the traditional irrigation systems al agha et al 2015 omran 2019 sefelnasr and sherif 2014 the estimated average total seepage from the ismailia canal is about 919 870 m3 day hamza et al 1988 over the years the aquifer discharge has increased from 1 60 bcm in 1980 rigw 1989 1992 to 7 00 bcm in 2016 molle et al 2016 as presented in fig 4 with pumping rates of 0 10 bcm per year increasing to 0 20 bcm from 2003 to 2010 mabrouk et al 2013 groundwater flows from south to north with an average gradient of about 0 0002 but a depression has occurred in the western fringes of giza governorate near the sphinx and pyramids in the south west of the study area this is due to over utilization by el golf club and nadi el remaya the shallow aquifer at this site has fresh groundwater but is highly polluted as it is recharged at a rate of 0 50 mm day due to leakage of sewage water seepage from the nile itself and its canals and percolation from irrigation water el arabi et al 2013 2 2 installation of an rbf scheme at embaba giza in 2015 the holding company for water and wastewater hcww drilled rbf wells to support the capacity of the embaba drinking water treatment station near giza fig 2b this station is one of the largest water treatment plants in egypt with a total capacity of 1 2 million cubic meters per day mcm d to meet the growing need for water ghodeif et al 2016 hydraulically the site is suited for rbf where the thickness of the aquifer is about 50 m or more sand and gravel being the main components the nile naturally recharges the aquifer at the site the water flow in the river is very stable after the construction of the aswan high dam which ensures sustainable amounts of water downstream ghodeif et al 2018 based on the report of mwri 2013 the nile s hydrograph at aswan before and after the construction of the high dam and the river water level in meters above sea level masl for the rbf site at embaba recorded by ghodeif et al 2018 are combined in fig 5 this figure shows that the hydrograph used to peak between july and november before the construction of the high dam reaching 21 mcm in september and moreover after the high dam construction the nile flow changed becoming sustainable through the year with maximum discharge controlled between june and september and maximum flow 6 mcm in july another result is that the nile water levels at the embaba plant range between 16 02 16 14 masl in january and december respectively the rbf scheme consists of six production wells about 54 m in depth 450 mm in diameter with a discharge of 150 m3 h for each well the distance between the wells and the river bank ranges between 10 and 15 m in addition to the six production wells four test wells with a depth of 64 m and maximum diameter of 216 mm were drilled to identify the lithology additionally two test wells with a depth of 30 m and a diameter of 100 mm were sunk one at the side of the river and the other further inland ghodeif et al 2018 table 1 presents the total dissolved solids tds values for the nile and rbf well water at embaba indicating a slight increase in mineral content for better understanding of groundwater flow conditions and determination of bank filtrate portions and travel times a numerical groundwater flow model was set up 3 methodology 3 1 design of groundwater flow and transport simulation model numerical modeling was applied to investigate the operation of the rbf scheme and predict the rbf water quality for the current situation and different scenarios using modflow mcdonald et al 2003 mt3d javandel et al 1984 and modpath pollock 1998 harbaugh 2005 the modpath code was used to determine the 3 d particle tracking path lines during steady state and transient conditions the modpath code uses a semi analytical particle tracking scheme based on the assumption that the velocity component in each direction varies linearly in a grid cell in its own coordinate direction this hypothesis allows an analytical expression describing the flow path in the grid cell given the initial position of a particle at any point in a cell it is possible to calculate the coordinates of any other point along its path line within the cell and the travel time between them sws 2010 the model domain covers an area of 502 6 km2 28 km long and 17 95 km wide it was divided into 155 columns and 87 rows with a square mesh size of 40 000 m2 reduced from 10 000 m2 to 625 m2 close to the rbf unit fig 6 presents the study domain the depth of the aquifer was divided into six layers with the first layer representing the clay cap 5 7 m thick while the other layers of the quaternary aquifer are each about 42 m thick the second and third layers were divided into 16 sub layers with an average thickness ranging from 5 to 6 m the fourth layer was divided into four sub layers and the fifth and sixth layers were each divided into two sublayers the boundary conditions were assigned using the river package where the nile was assigned to the east side with a water level starting at 16 30 masl in the south to 15 95 masl in the north while the other side was bounded in the north by el rayah and el behery which share properties between rivers and canals and range from 15 40 masl in the east to 14 40 masl in the west however the southern and western boundaries were defined as no flow boundaries fig 6a shows the study area boundary conditions while the two sections in x and y direction are presented in fig 6b and c the aquifer hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity k storage coefficient s specific storage ss and effective porosity ne are presented in table 2 these parameters are reported by el arabi 2007 morsy 2009 negm et al 2019 and abd elaty et al 2020 the total abstraction rate was set to the planned 50 000 m3 day fig 6 presents the distribution of the pumping wells in the aquifer where the nadi el ramaiya and el golf club are located and where the average recharge is 0 30 mm day the river was assigned a constant tds concentration of 260 ppm while the recharge and initial concentration for the whole study area were set to 1000 ppm omran 2019 the riverbank filtration share rbfs in percent was calculated using the mean values of tds for groundwater gw river water dawoud et al 2005 and pumped water rbf the rbfs was calculated using eq 1 1 r b f s t d s g w t d s r b f t d s g w t d s r i v e r x 100 3 2 model calibration the model calibration process started with a comparison of the simulated heads using measured data from the field observation wells the recorded data were taken from the greater cairo piezometric contour map the flow model was calibrated for steady state by changing the aquifer hydraulic conductivity to match the model results and the calculated head as shown in fig 7 the results show that a high water level occurred around the river zone while a drop occurred at the west side with nadi el remaya and el golf club fig 7 the velocity directions and the locations of observation and pumping wells are presented in fig 8 a it shows that the main groundwater flow direction is from the high level in the north and east towards the low level in the south and west fig 8b shows the location of rbf wells along the nile fig 9 a shows the difference between calculated and observed heads where the root mean square error rms and normalized rms reached 0 187 m and 5 34 respectively and the correlation coefficient reached 98 9 while the absolute residual mean and standard error of estimate reached 0 15 m and 0 03 m respectively moreover the maximum minimum and mean residual reached 0 38 0 002 and 0 09 m respectively fig 9b presents the piezometric contour map of greater cairo area in 1982 published by el arabi et al 2013 the tds results are presented in fig 10 showing the distribution of salinity in the vertical model cross section the solute transport model was calibrated using the field data for tds from ghodeif et al 2018 see table 1 the mt3d results give a good fit with the field data from the observation wells 3 3 definition of model scenarios the model was developed to simulate the study area in the south west of the nile delta aquifer to assess the impacts of different scenarios table 3 on the interaction between surface water and groundwater and thus also on the share of bank filtrate rbfs in the abstracted water and the travel time of particles which were assigned at the river centerline table 3 and fig 11 illustrate the scenarios for the river aquifer and rbf wells to be considered in the design and management of the rbf scheme under different hydrological conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of river hydrograph and seepage on rbf bank filtration share and travel times this case was investigated by decreasing the river stage by 80 60 40 20 and 0 from the base case 100 as presented in table 3 and fig 12 a fig 12b presents the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed with 1 m thickness which was changed from 0 50 m day at base case to 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 1 m day as expected the results show that lower river water level and lower hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed cause a decrease in rbfs to 67 5 62 8 56 5 48 7 and 34 3 and increase the particle travel time from the river center to 230 260 380 505 and 605 days for the river stage respectively the rbfs for the riverbed conductivity scenarios was found to be between 59 7 and 73 5 and travel times reached 190 450 days maintaining high riverbed seepage by removing mud from the riverbed in front of the wells would ensure high productivity of the abstraction wells as indicated in fig 15b as removing mud from the riverbed increases the permeability of the soil which leads to an increase in efficiency of rbf sharing moreover ghodeif et al 2018 indicated that the nile is constantly exposed to these sediments so silt is dredged two or three times annually using appropriate equipment which improves the hydraulic connection between the river and the main underground water reservoir the normal annual water flow at high aswan dam had is 55 5 bcm according to international agreements filling the gerd reservoir by 75 bcm could decrease this share and cause lower water levels in the nile fig 13 shows the effect of the time of filling from 2 years to 12 years on the rbf share simulating 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 years filling by a reduced nile stage by 67 30 33 60 22 40 16 80 13 50 and 11 20 causing a rbfs of 53 3 65 2 67 7 68 6 69 1 and 69 6 respectively these results indicated that shortening the period of filling the gerd may have a negative impact on rbf schemes along the nile 4 2 effect of aquifer parameters and pumping rates on bank filtrate share and travel times different scenarios of aquifer clay cap thickness hydraulic conductivity and abstraction rates were simulated the clay cap thickness was increased from 5 7 m base case to 8 10 12 and 14 m the aquifer hydraulic conductivities were changed from 5 m day base case to 1 2 10 12 and 20 m day moreover a total of 100 abstraction wells are located in the south west of the study area as shown in fig 6a with different pumping rates of 0 50 70 and 100 m3 h compared to 20 m3 h base case for each well the simulation results indicate that the rbfs changes only slightly from 71 1 to 70 5 with increasing clay cap thickness but the travel times increase from 360 to 650 days fig 14 a depending on aquifer hydraulic conductivity rbfs between 54 8 and 79 6 was calculated with respect to travel times between 50 and 380 days fig 14b increased abstraction rates from the aquifer had the most significant effect on rbfs fig 14c shows rbfs values from 5 to 95 4 and travel times from 380 to 100 days with increased abstraction rates these results highlight that the travel times decrease at higher values of aquifer hydraulic conductivity and higher pumping rates as expected thus a major site selection criterion for rbf systems is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity which matches with the hydraulic conductivities criteria presented by hiscock and grischek 2002 in the range of 1 10 2 7 5 10 5 m s along the elbe river in germany 4 3 effect of rbf pumping scheme design on bank filtrate share and travel times further rbf scenarios were simulated with different rbf well abstraction rates which were changed from 10 25 75 225 and 300 m3 h for each rbf well compared to 150 m3 h base case for well depths of 54 m with a screen length of 25 m and a distance of 10 m to the river bank shore line then different well depths 25 75 100 125 and 150 m different lengths of the well screen 29 34 39 44 and 54 m and different distances between the wells and the river bank 25 50 75 100 and 125 m the different discharge rates resulted in rbfs values of 28 4 44 7 63 8 74 3 and 76 6 and 650 595 455 155 and 135 days for particle travel time fig 15a here the individual pumping rates have to be defined based on the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and may be limited to about 150 m3 h working with higher pumping rates in the model creates a strong cone of depression which may not be achieved with a larger number of wells having lower pumping rates but may be achieved using a horizontal collector well different well depths showed a comparatively lower effect on rbfs ranging from 74 6 64 and travel times ranging from 35 to 625 days fig 15b fig 15c shows that the rbfs did not change when different screen lengths were applied but travel times changed from 200 to 140 days the screen length is important for entrance flow velocities and the lifespan of the wells a length of 54 m is just a theoretical value as the screen should remain below the water level in the well during pumping results of changing the distance between the rbf wells and the river bank are presented in fig 15d the rbfs values reached 70 4 69 2 67 4 66 3 and 65 0 as a result of the natural flow gradient towards the wells while the travel times reached 230 260 310 380 and 480 days as expected increased pumping rates led to increased rbfs and decreased travel time increasing the rbf well depth and screen length had less effect on rbfs than on travel times increased distance between the rbf wells and the river bank led to decreased rbfs and increased travel times due to the greater portion of groundwater further away from the riverbank so installing rbf wells close to the river bank is more effective in terms of increasing the rbf portion fig 16 presents the spatial distribution of rbfs at the site at embaba with well locations from the river bank of 25 50 75 100 and 125 m also the current locations of the existing 6 rbf wells are shown the rbfs decreased from 70 4 for a 25 m distance from the shore line to 69 2 67 4 66 3 and 65 0 respectively the results prove rbf wells should be placed close to the river bank to get a higher rbfs to achieve high rbfs values and low manganese concentrations as an effect of short travel times at the site embaba rbf wells should be constructed at shallow depth and close to the river bank and then operated continuously fig 17 moreover continuous operation could reduce the salinity of water in the well zone frequent removal of mud deposits in front of the rbf scheme would enhance infiltration and further reduce mixing with groundwater near the river zone 5 conclusions in this study various scenarios were assessed for an existing rbf scheme on the nile at embaba cairo using modflow mt3d and modpath the impact of a changing river hydrograph hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed clay cap thickness aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer abstraction rates rbf well abstraction rates well depths screen lengths and distances between rbf wells and the river bank were quantified at low river stages the rbf share decreased to 56 compared with 71 in the current situation rbfs reached 73 5 for a high hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed of 1 m day the results from the different aquifer scenarios show that the travel time from the center of the river decreases to 140 days for high values of aquifer hydraulic conductivity 10 m day groundwater abstraction in the south west affects the natural flow gradient so higher groundwater pumping rates result in shorter travel times of bank filtrate pumped from the rbf wells the increase in clay cap thickness has less impact on rbfs than on travel times as long as there is hydraulic contact between the river and the upper sand layer of the aquifer high individual pumping rates of the rbf wells e g 300 m3 h lead to an increase in rbfs to 76 6 and a decrease in travel time to 115 days increasing the rbf well distances from the river bank from 10 to 100 m decrease the rbfs from 69 to 65 only this is not typical for a rbf site and it is a result of the natural flow gradient towards the rbf wells in this case wells could also be operated discontinuously as the river water will pass the wells due to the local flow conditions in general rbf wells should be operated continuously to ensure high rbfs the well screens should be placed at

originating from the tibetan plateau this study deals with the impact of climate change on water storage in the lancang river basin which is governed by the south asian monsoon system we evaluated the spatiotemporal distribution of multi source precipitation evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage tws to understand the hydrological system in the region we provide evidence of climate change

region keywords climate change tws river discharge hydrology lancang river basin 1 introduction the tibetan plateau known as asia s freshwater tower is a source region for east and southeast asian rivers that serve nearly half of the world population the region has shown considerable sensitivity to the impacts of climate change and human intervention which affect the headwaters of the rivers that originate therein ferreira et al 2020 therefore water resource measurements are crucial for understanding the hydrological cycle and water resource management in this region observation of climatic variables is a practical approach as changes in climate variables directly affect the hydrosphere especially in transboundary rivers where the food economy and ecosystem health mainly rely on hydrological and climatic conditions liu et al 2014 the lancang river originates from the tibetan plateau and with a total area of 795 000 km2 it is the 12th longest river in the world feeding more than 60 million people in china cambodia thailand vietnam laos and myanmar jing et al 2020 the asian monsoon system especially the east asian monsoon and indian ocean monsoon systems are greatly affected by variability in climatic conditions wang et al 2005 previous studies have recorded a substantial decrease in precipitation over the past several decades in this region see e g hasson et al 2016 global warming accelerates the hydrological cycle process intensifying the variations in river discharge regional evapotranspiration and precipitation hence rising temperatures in the headwaters of the lancang river add further stress and alter the stream flows and their seasonality which has affected food production and ecosystem services in the basin pokhrel 2018 the most significant increase in temperature has been recorded during the winter months pokhrel 2018 water level measurements in the upstream region of the lancang river before and after dam construction demonstrate similar patterns suggesting that temperature variation is the primary driver of variation in water level in the headwater region li and he 2008 likewise terrestrial water storage variations snow surface water vegetation water groundwater and soil water provide critical information for evaluating water resource deficit at a regional scale andrew et al 2017 xie et al 2016 ferreira et al 2020 however large scale monitoring of terrestrial water storage tws variations is challenging as there are limited ground based monitoring networks and direct means of measurements jing et al 2019 to unravel the coupled energy water and carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and land surface land surface models lsms have been developed providing direct and indirect measurements in the context of ecological dynamics and human forcing lsms are perhaps the most sophisticated tools to estimate individual components of tws especially root zone soil moisture and groundwater assessment which are far beyond the capacity of typical microwave and optical sensor based satellites jpl 2018 however to monitor the temporal gravity field changes on earth the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite launched in 2002 provides ease in obtaining unique data tws that reflects mass transport and redistribution above and beneath the surface of earth landerer and swenson 2012b seyoum and

calculated by mass concentration blocks mascons and standard spherical harmonic approaches scanlon et al 2016b landerer and swenson 2012b these grace products have been widely used to investigate tws variations in numerous studies including transboundary river basins e g lancang mekong river basin across the globe long et al 2013 jing et al 2020 bibi et al 2019 in this study we used grace products including sh solutions from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl geoforschungszentrum gfz and the center for space research at the university of texas austin csr and m solutions from the jpl jpl m and csr csr m to calculate river discharge in the lancang river basin using the water balance method we calculated river discharge using the gldas l and surface models gleam and tws and precipitation data from space observations this study provides a comprehensive insight into the spatiotemporal distribution of water balance components and tws in the lancang river basin and how they affect river discharge we discuss the relative importance of climatic factors and their influence on tws variations the primary objectives of this study were 1 to describe spatiotemporal variations in precipitation evapotranspiration temperature and tws trends derived from different solutions using the basin average approach 2 to estimate the total basin discharge in the study region based on the water balance method and 3 to estimate the time lag between precipitation and tws and explore the factors that may impact the time lag these findings could be helpful for water resource management and utilisation in transboundary river basins 2 study area and data resources 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river which originates from the southern tibetan plateau is the 7th largest river in asia the lancang river basin fig 1 21 n 34 n 94 e 102 e is 2354 km long with a drainage area of approximately 165 000 km2 and an elevation range from approximately 486 to 6500 m above sea level tang 2010 the lancang river basin covers different climatic zones with diverse geographic conditions resulting in a striking difference in water resources and heat distribution in this region the annual mean precipitation increases from north to south and ranges from 752 to 1025 mm similarly temperature increases from north to south and ranges between 12 3 and 14 3 c the lancang river basin is located in the tropical monsoon region of southeast asia the seasonal cycle is divided into wet may to october with a peak in august and a dry season november to april most of the area is occupied by forests in the southern part of the basin while grassland is the main land use type in the northern high altitude region fig 2 2 2 grace derived tws 2 2 1 spherical harmonics solutions rl06 the grace satellites provide monthly global total water storage anomalies by measuring gravity field changes on earth the sh solution has been the standard for the first decade of grace observations landerer and swenson 2012b vishwakarma et al 2018 the official grace science data system has continuously released monthly grace solutions from three processing centers 1 center for space research university of texas csr

processing centers were averaged to reduce the uncertainties in the tws estimate different grace solutions use different strategies and parameter choices sakumura et al 2014 2 2 2 the global mascon grace mascon solutions are produced using mass concentration blocks mascons scanlon et al 2016b it is much easier to implement geophysical constraints for mascon solutions and this approach is much more rigorous than the spherical harmonics of empirical post processing filtering landerer and watkins 2016 csr m and jpl m solutions are available at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly

precipitation and temperature data in the present study we obtained temperature and precipitation data sets 2001 2015 from the national meteorological information centre of the meteorological administration of china cma these datasets have a horizontal resolution of 0 5 0 5 and are available at the cma data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn home do the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is a multi satellite precipitation product from nasa available at http trmm gsfc nasa gov data dir data html trmm merges data from various satellite sensors and rainfall gauge observations from the global precipitation climatology centre therefore the rainfall data from trmm were considered to be of good quality for the subsequent analysis 3 methods 3 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration anomalies terrestrial water storage changes from grace solutions are available as anomalies and computed by averaging from january 2004 to december 2009 ramillien et al 2006 therefore we used the same approach to calculate the precipitation and evapotranspiration anomalies for the lancang river basin anomalies were calculated relative to the mean values of precipitation and evapotranspiration averaging from january 2004 to december 2009 3 2 basin discharge calculation the traditional water balance approach eq 1 is the most widely used method and is an integral part of any conceptual model based on the principle of mass conservation the mass balance equation using grace data can be arranged as follows 1 d t w s d t p e t r in previous studies the water balance method has been used to calculate monthly basin discharge gao et al 2010 lv et al 2017 we applied the same approach to calculate the basin discharge for the lancang river basin in our study by rearranging eq 1 recharge can then be calculated as shown in eq 2 2 r p e t d t w s d t where r is the monthly total basin discharge et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation and d t w s d t is the tws anomaly from the five grace solutions the submarine discharge potential interbasin leakage and water diversion were not considered in eq 2 as suggested by ferreira et al 2013 the average et was calculated from gldas averaged from noah vic and clm and precipitation was obtained from trmm in the monthly time series of grace tws data a few months were missing during the study period due to satellite battery management issues these missing months were filled using the spline interpolation method 3 3 trend analysis 3 3 1 linear regression to scrutinise the linear trend of the variables a simple linear regression equation can be written as 3 y x a b x where yx symbolises the parameters at time x the intercept a and slope b are regression coefﬁcients obtained by the least square method student s t test was performed to test the statistical signiﬁcance of the trend 3 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall test has wide ranging applications as a statistical test in climatological and hydrological trend analysis mavromatis 2011 mann kendall trend analysis has two main advantages 1 it is a non parametric test that does not require data to be normally distributed and 2 it is less sensitive to unexpected interruptions in nonhomogeneous time series tabari 2011 for uncertainty against time mann 1945 developed a non parametric test for precise application of kendall s test for correlation which is commonly known as the mann kendall test or kendall t test kendall 1975 he proposed the null hypothesis as h0 for a population x1 x2 xn and h1 as an alternative hypothesis the mann kendall test statistic under h0 is given as follows 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where 5 s g n θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 for independent and randomly distributed random variables when n 8 the s statistic is approximately normally distributed with zero mean and variance as follows 6 σ 2 n n 1 2 n 5 18 consequently the standardised z statistics follow a normal standardised distribution 7 z s 1 θ i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 θ i f s 0 the no trend hypothesis is rejected when z zα eq 7 at a level of significance α in the present work we used mann kendall analysis for spatial interpolation of the tws time series as a few months were missing from the grace record during the study period 4 results 4 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration trends in lancang river basin the lancang river basin comprises diverse topography fig 3 shows considerable variation in the spatial distribution of precipitation amount which was low at high elevation and increased with decreasing elevation ranging between 33 173 mm annual precipitation displayed a decreasing trend and the rate of decrease was 5 03 mm year fig 4 evapotranspiration is a very important climate variable hence careful data selection was crucial for further analysis accordingly we used average evapotranspiration data from the gldas noah vic and clm models and gleam to remove the uncertainty in the results andam akorful et al 2015 both gldas and gleam evapotranspiration had an increasing trend of 4 and 4 1 mm year respectively from 2002 to 2020 fig 5 b fig 6 a illustrates the spatial patterns of evapotranspiration distribution from the gldas noah vic and clm and gleam models the amount of evapotranspiration upstream of the lancang river basin was observed to be much lower than that of the downstream region and ranged between 21 and 105 mm month the spatial m k trend analysis of evapotranspiration from the noah and vic models presented an increasing trend fig 6 b in downstream and most of the upstream regions of the basin whereas the clm model presented a varying trend of an increase decrease in red and no trend in green in the basin gleam also exhibited increasing trends in evapotranspiration both upstream and downstream of the basin fig 7 shows the scatter matrix map between noah vic and clm evapotranspiration of the lancang river basin noah and vic were found to have a stronger correlation than noah and vic with clm therefore using average evapotranspiration from the three gldas models and gleam in further analysis minimises the uncertainty in evapotranspiration estimates in the basin 4 2 grace tws trends 4 2 1 temporal tws trends from different grace solutions and gldas fig 8 a b illustrates the monthly mean linear distribution of tws from the five grace solutions 2002 2016 grace fo 2018 2020 and gldas tws fig 8 b shows the linear trends of grace solutions and gldas tws where the dotted lines represent the linear trends of the five grace tws and gldas tws as shown in fig 8 b all five grace tws and gldas tws show decreasing trends in the lancang river basin csr m and jpl m trends were more significant than sh solutions from csr gfz and jpl because sh products might experience signal leakage in the region which deserves further investigation as this was not addressed in the present study tws from the five grace products exhibited an increasing trend from 2006 to 2008 and then decreased afterwards agreeing with a previous study jin et al 2020 generally all five solutions showed a decreasing trend during the entire study period in the region the gldas tws trends were in good agreement with grace tws with a decreasing trend of 4 0 mm year in the lancang river basin table 1 summarises tws trends derived from the different grace solutions trend analysis revealed that both sh csr gfz and jpl and csr m had a significant decreasing trend in tws during the study period jpl showed a decreasing trend of 3 3 mm year csr 3 5 mm year gfz 3 2 mm year jpl m 6 0 mm year and csr m 5 0 mm year however the jpl m solution revealed a more severe and much wider tws reduction in the study region the gldas tws showed a decreasing trend of 4 0 mm year which was in good agreement with csr gfz and jpl the five grace products and the gldas tws revealed similar seasonal variability regardless of the different volumes between them 4 2 2 spatial tws trends from grace solutions and gldas fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the grace tws derived from the five solutions it can be seen that tws distribution in the lancang river basin opposed the elevation gradient low at high elevation upstream and high at low elevation downstream fig 9 a a substantial loss in tws in the high elevation upstream river source region during the entire period was observed and the declining trend was consistent for all grace solutions fig 9 b previous studies have reported that a massive decline in tws in the indian monsoon dominated tibetan plateau region is caused by rising temperatures and decreased precipitation in the himalayas yao 2012 jing et al 2020 additionally a previous study reported groundwater depletion upstream which added stress to tws in the headwater region of the lancang river yi et al 2016 in downstream water storage was substantially increased but this increase could be due to the construction of large reservoirs in lowland areas which appeared to increase water storage downstream eyler 2020 a previous study reported a significant decrease in river flow recorded at the yungjinghong hydrometric station located downstream of the basin from 1961 to 2015 liu et al 2020 it is clear from fig 9 b that the spatial distribution of tws solutions showed some discrepancies jpl m exhibited a slightly deviating trend from the other four grace solutions previous studies have reported that the decreasing and increasing trends of the jpl m tws are comparatively larger than those of other csr m and sh solutions scanlon et al 2018 jin et al 2020 the three processing centers jpl gfz and csr use different mathematical approaches and background models for the grace tws calculation for instance jpl m uses the glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction model which has not been considered for other grace solutions purcell et al 2016 additionally jpl and csr centers use dissimilar data processing techniques for global mascon solutions jpl m calculations employ spherical cap mascons 3 equal area whereas csr m uses hexagonal tiles 1 equatorial longitudinal distance watkins et al 2015 scanlon et al 2016b purcell et al 2016 the correlation and scatter matrix maps in fig 10 indicate that the temporal distribution of the five grace solutions is highly consistent however csr m and jpl m are more consistent with each other than with the sh solution in contrast jpl m and csr m correlated significantly r 0 98 reaching minimum and maximum values almost simultaneously 4 3 total basin discharge fig 11 illustrates the temporal trends of the total basin discharge in the lancang river basin from 2002 to 2015 the time series of the total basin discharge were calculated as a residual of the water balance eq 2 using precipitation trmm and cma evapotranspiration averaged from gldas noah vic and clm models and tws time series estimates the total basin discharge calculated from jpl m and csr m using both cma and trmm precipitation revealed a continuous decreasing trend in the basin basin discharge from cma precipitation revealed decreasing trends of 56 and 70 mm year for the jpl m and csr m tws respectively likewise the discharge calculated using trmm was 70 mm year for jpl m and 63 mm year for csr m similarly the total basin discharge calculated using gleam evapotranspiration for jpl m and csr m using cma and trmm precipitation showed an incessant decreasing trend basin discharge from cma precipitation revealed decreasing trends of 56 and 74 mm year for the jpl m and csr m tws respectively likewise the discharge calculated using trmm was 57 mm year for csr m and 71 mm year for jpl m the basin discharge trend was similar to that of precipitation fig 4 and tws fig 8 increased evapotranspiration fig 5 with decreasing precipitation resulted in decreased basin discharge during the study period 4 4 warming trends in lancang river basin the mean temperature distribution in the lancang river basin m k trend analysis and temporal distribution and seasonality are shown in fig 12 a d spatially the mean temperature was low 8 3 c in the high altitude mountainous region upstream of the basin and decreased towards the south downstream 23 c fig 12 a however the temperature exhibited a significant increasing trend over the study period in both the upstream and downstream parts of the basin fig 12 b it can also be seen in fig 12 c that temporally the temperature rose at a rate of 0 05 c from 2002 to 2015 in the study region hence the spatiotemporal trends of mean temperature depict massive warming in the lancang river basin this increase in warming rate is alarming given that the lancang river basin comprises the upper part of the mekong river basin feeding more than 60 million people worldwide including china and the countries located downstream cambodia thailand vietnam laos and myanmar jing et al 2020 increased warming is responsible for increased evapotranspiration in the study region which negatively impacts the available water resources in this region 5 discussion the lancang river is situated in a complex environmental setting with roughly two diverse topographies that gradually transform from grassland dominated plateaus to tropical rainforest zones in the south topographic gradients and diverse climates control the distribution of water resources across basins the downward trend in precipitation and a higher evapotranspiration rate have significantly contributed to the reduction of tws and total basin discharge in the lancang river basin previous studies detected severe drought in southwest china in 2009 and 2010 yang 2012 which agrees well with our results fig 12 c demonstrates that the highest annual mean temperature was recorded in 2009 while the mean annual precipitation was below average during the same year fig 4 b the lancang river basin is located in a karst region where shallow soils have high permeability leading to water stress during the dry season yang et al 2019 the lancang river basin is located in a typical south asian monsoon dominated region the most prominent monsoon system globally song 2012 fig 13 c reveals that precipitation has a clear seasonal cycle due to the south asian monsoon effect during july and august wet monsoon season the basin receives 70 80 of its annual total precipitation climate change in this region not only drives the precipitation cycle but also influences tws under increased warming and decreased precipitation csr jpl gfz csr m and jplm from grace and gldas tws showed decreasing trends in tws during the study period the impact of climate change on tws is evident from the 2009 2010 drought as shown in the tws anomalies of the five grace solutions fig 8 b indicating that climatic factors are the main driving forces behind tws variations in this region furthermore fig 8 b indicates that the csr m and jpl m solutions are more sensitive to climate variations than the three spherical harmonic solutions as the 2009 2010 drought is more evident in both mascon solutions drought does not appear in gldas tws because the gldas land water content does not include groundwater and surface water i e lakes and rivers as separate water components in its calculation in agreement with our results downward trends in precipitation and increased temperature has been reported as the main contributors to tws variations in the river source region tibetan plateau yao 2012 jing et al 2020 yang et al 2019 qiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2018 moreover yi et al 2016 reported that groundwater depletion in the upstream region of the lancang river basin in the tibetan plateau added more stress to tws and it is evident in fig 9 b that all the grace solutions and gldas tws showed a significant decreasing trend upstream of the basin during the study period the basin discharge for the lancang river was calculated as a residual from tws precipitation and evapotranspiration using the basin average approach discharge showed a significant decreasing trend in the basin using both cma and trmm precipitation as opposed to the two grace mascon solutions fig 11 a b given that the lancang is a transboundary river the observation data is under government control and access to observations requires multi party government permission and cooperation to support our findings we compared our results with the river flow recorded at the yungjinghong hydrometric station located on the lancang river which showed a significant decreasing trend in river flow from 1961 to 2015 liu et al 2020 fig 13 a b shows a time lag of 2 months between tws anomalies derived from the jpl m and csr m and precipitation the highest precipitation was recorded in july while the highest tws was recorded in september in a hydrosphere when precipitation is converted to tws during the water distribution process there is the possibility of a theoretical delayed response between tws and precipitation xu et al 2018 assessing the precise time lag between precipitation and tws as lag variations is decisive in understanding the interactions between climate variables and the hydrosphere a study conducted by syed et al 2008 demonstrated that gldas tws strongly correlates with precipitation in low latitude regions in the tibetan plateau a 2 month lag has been identified between grace tws and precipitation in the three river source regions xu et al 2018 thus precipitation is a key driver of the water budget and has immense control over the hydrological cycle and water balance in this region furthermore numerous studies have been conducted to reveal and understand the phenomenon behind the time lag between tws and precipitation there is a delay in the tws response when water enters the system as precipitation and distributes into the surface and subsurface water empirically lag can be defined as the total precipitation in hydrological balance thompson et al 2011 in the present study grace tws anomalies from csr and jpl mascon solutions were highly correlated with precipitation over a 2 month time lag these findings suggested that precipitation is a regulatory factor for tws variations that are controlled by the amount of precipitation occurring 2 months prior in the lancang river basin fig 12a b along with climatic factors aquifer properties such as permeability of sediments are the main driving force behind the delayed response of tws and precipitation for example in ethiopia a 0 month delay was recorded in karst dominated aquifers whereas a delay of up to 6 months was observed for aquifers dominated by unconsolidated sediments awange et al 2014 similarly the lancang river is also dominated by karst topography with highly permeable soils therefore a 2 month time lag in the karst dominated region might be a response to climate variations 6 conclusions understanding the trends in climatic variables is a practical approach for monitoring climatic changes and their impact on the hydrological cycle a rate of decrease in precipitation of 5 03 mm year was observed from 1998 to 2016 gldas and gleam evapotranspiration displayed an increasing trend of 4 0 4 1 mm year from 2002 to 2020 the grace tws from jpl gfz csr m and jpl m exhibited a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2016 jpl indicated a decreasing trend of 3 3 mm yr csr 4 0 mm year gfz 3 2 mm year csr m 5 0 mm year and jpl m 5 9 mm year however the csr m and jpl m solutions revealed a more severe and much wider tws reduction in the study region than the three sh solutions correspondingly gldas tws presented a decreasing trend of 4 0 mm year consistent with csr gfz and jpl solutions unlike the two mascon products the total basin discharge calculated by the water balance method showed a significant decreasing trend from 2002 to 2015 spatial and temporal temperature trends indicated intense warming in the basin with mean temperature increasing by 0 05 c from 2002 to 2015 additionally a 2 month lag between the grace derived tws and precipitation was recorded in addition to the aquifer properties climatic factors could be the key drivers behind this phenomenon however further investigations are needed to evaluate the direct relationship involved in the delayed response between precipitation and tws climatology the present study identified multiple spatial and temporal trends for climate variables and multi source tws variations in the lancang river basin these results could help understand climate change response in the transboundary river system and provide

satellite launched in 2002 provides ease in obtaining unique data tws that reflects mass transport and redistribution above and beneath the surface of earth landerer and swenson 2012b seyoum and milewski 2017 wahr et al 2004 grace provides comprehensive information on vertically integrated water storage changes by recording gravity field changes on earth jing et al 2019 landerer and swenson 2012b landerer and swenson 2012b and offers more direct ways of tws estimations than lsms jing et al 2019 grace provides tws data in two versions mascon m and spherical harmonic sh solutions calculated by mass concentration blocks mascons and standard spherical harmonic approaches scanlon et al 2016b landerer and swenson 2012b these grace products have been widely used to investigate tws variations in numerous studies including transboundary river basins e g lancang mekong river basin across the globe long et al 2013 jing et al 2020 bibi et al 2019 in this study we used grace products including sh solutions from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl geoforschungszentrum gfz and the center for space research at the university of texas austin csr and m solutions from the jpl jpl m and csr csr m to calculate river discharge in the lancang river basin using the water balance method we calculated river discharge using the gldas l and surface models gleam and tws and precipitation data from space observations this study provides a comprehensive insight into the spatiotemporal distribution of water balance components and tws in the lancang river basin and how they affect river discharge we discuss the relative importance of climatic factors and their influence on tws variations the primary objectives of this study were 1 to describe spatiotemporal variations in precipitation evapotranspiration temperature and tws trends derived from different solutions using the basin average approach 2 to estimate the total basin discharge in the study region based on the water balance method and 3 to estimate the time lag between precipitation and tws and explore the factors that may impact the time lag these findings could be helpful for water resource management and utilisation in transboundary river basins 2 study area and data resources 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river which originates from the southern tibetan plateau is the 7th largest river in asia the lancang river basin fig 1 21 n 34 n 94 e 102 e is 2354 km long with a drainage area of approximately 165 000 km2 and an elevation range from approximately 486 to 6500 m above sea level tang 2010 the lancang river basin covers different climatic zones with diverse geographic conditions resulting in a striking difference in water resources and heat distribution in this region the annual mean precipitation increases from north to south and ranges from 752 to 1025 mm similarly temperature increases from north to south and ranges between 12 3 and 14 3 c the lancang river basin is located in the tropical monsoon region of southeast asia the seasonal cycle is divided into wet may to october with a peak in august and a dry season november to april most of the area is occupied by forests in the southern part of the basin while grassland is the main land use type in the northern high altitude region fig 2 2 2 grace derived tws 2 2 1 spherical harmonics solutions rl06 the grace satellites provide monthly global total water storage anomalies by measuring gravity field changes on earth the sh solution has been the standard for the first decade of grace observations landerer and swenson 2012b vishwakarma et al 2018 the official grace science data system has continuously released monthly grace solutions from three processing centers 1 center for space research university of texas csr 2 jet propulsion laboratory jpl and 3 geoforschungszentrum gfz available at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the time series of the tws anomalies from the three processing centers were averaged to reduce the uncertainties in the tws estimate different grace solutions use different strategies and parameter choices sakumura et al 2014 2 2 2 the global mascon grace mascon solutions are produced using mass concentration blocks mascons scanlon et al 2016b it is much easier to implement geophysical constraints for mascon solutions and this approach is much more rigorous than the spherical harmonics of empirical post processing filtering landerer and watkins 2016 csr m and jpl m solutions are available at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the latest release v3 is rl06 gravity field solutions with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 but the native resolution is 1 1 save et al 2016 2 3 evapotranspiration data the global

amsterdam gleam 3 3a the gleam model estimates daily terrestrial evapotranspiration from satellite data at a 0 25 spatial resolution and is available at https www gleamproject org data 2 4 precipitation and temperature data in the present study we obtained temperature and precipitation data sets 2001 2015 from the national meteorological information centre of the meteorological administration of china cma these datasets have a horizontal resolution of 0 5 0 5 and are available at the cma data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn home do the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is a multi satellite precipitation product from nasa available at http trmm gsfc nasa gov data dir data html trmm merges data from various satellite sensors and rainfall gauge observations from the global precipitation climatology centre therefore the rainfall data from trmm were considered to be of good quality for the subsequent analysis 3 methods 3 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration anomalies terrestrial water storage changes from grace solutions are available as anomalies and computed by averaging from january 2004 to december 2009 ramillien et al 2006 therefore we used the same approach to calculate the precipitation and evapotranspiration anomalies for the lancang river basin anomalies were calculated relative to the mean values of precipitation and evapotranspiration averaging from january 2004 to december 2009 3 2 basin discharge calculation the traditional water balance approach eq 1 is the most widely used method and is an integral part of any conceptual model based on the principle of mass conservation the mass balance equation using grace data can be arranged as follows 1 d t w s d t p e t r in previous studies the water balance method has been used to calculate monthly basin discharge gao et al 2010 lv et al 2017 we applied the same approach to calculate the basin discharge for the lancang river basin in our study by rearranging eq 1 recharge can then be calculated as shown in eq 2 2 r p e t d t w s d t where r is the monthly total basin discharge et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation and d t w s d t is the tws anomaly from the five grace solutions the submarine discharge potential interbasin leakage and water diversion were not considered in eq 2 as suggested by ferreira et al 2013 the average et was calculated from gldas averaged from noah vic and clm and precipitation was obtained from trmm in the monthly time series of grace tws data a few months were missing during the study period due to satellite battery management issues these missing months were filled using the spline interpolation method 3 3 trend analysis 3 3 1 linear regression to scrutinise the linear trend of the variables a simple linear regression equation can be written as 3 y x a b x where yx symbolises the parameters at time x the intercept a and slope b are regression coefﬁcients obtained by the least square method student s t test was performed to test the statistical signiﬁcance of the trend 3 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall test has wide ranging applications as a statistical test in climatological and hydrological trend analysis mavromatis 2011 mann kendall trend analysis has two main advantages 1 it is a non parametric test that does not require data to be normally distributed and 2 it is less sensitive to unexpected interruptions in nonhomogeneous time series tabari 2011 for uncertainty against time mann 1945 developed a non parametric test for precise application of kendall s test for correlation which is commonly known as the mann kendall test or kendall t test kendall 1975 he proposed the null hypothesis as h0 for a population x1 x2 xn and h1 as an alternative hypothesis the mann kendall test statistic under h0 is given as follows 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where 5 s g n θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 for independent and randomly distributed random variables when n 8 the s statistic is approximately normally distributed with zero mean and variance as follows 6 σ 2 n n 1 2 n 5 18 consequently the standardised z statistics follow a normal standardised distribution 7 z s 1 θ i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 θ i f s 0 the no trend hypothesis is rejected when z zα eq 7 at a level of significance α in the present work we used mann kendall analysis for spatial interpolation of the tws time series as a few months were missing from the grace record during the study period 4 results 4 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration trends in lancang river basin the lancang river basin comprises diverse topography fig 3 shows considerable variation in the spatial distribution of precipitation amount which was low at high elevation and increased with decreasing elevation ranging between 33 173 mm annual precipitation displayed a decreasing trend and the rate of decrease was 5 03 mm year fig 4 evapotranspiration is a very important climate variable hence careful data selection was crucial for further analysis accordingly we used average evapotranspiration data from the gldas noah vic and clm models and gleam to remove the uncertainty in the results andam akorful et al 2015 both gldas and gleam evapotranspiration had an increasing trend of 4 and 4 1 mm year respectively from 2002 to 2020 fig 5 b fig 6 a illustrates the spatial patterns of evapotranspiration distribution from the gldas noah vic and clm and gleam models the amount of evapotranspiration upstream of the lancang river basin was observed to be much lower than that of the downstream region and ranged between 21 and 105 mm month the spatial m k trend analysis of evapotranspiration from the noah and vic models presented an increasing trend fig 6 b in downstream and most of the upstream regions of the basin whereas the clm model presented a varying trend of an increase decrease in red and no trend in green in the basin gleam also exhibited increasing trends in evapotranspiration both upstream and downstream of the basin fig 7 shows the scatter matrix map between noah vic and clm evapotranspiration of the lancang river basin noah and vic were found to have a stronger correlation than noah and vic with clm therefore using average evapotranspiration from the three gldas models and gleam in further analysis minimises the uncertainty in evapotranspiration estimates in the basin 4 2 grace tws trends 4 2 1 temporal tws trends from different grace solutions and gldas fig 8 a b illustrates the monthly mean linear distribution of tws from the five grace solutions 2002 2016 grace fo 2018 2020 and gldas tws fig 8 b shows the linear trends of grace solutions and gldas tws where the dotted lines represent the linear trends of the five grace tws and gldas tws as shown in fig 8 b all five grace tws and gldas tws show decreasing trends in the lancang river basin csr m and jpl m trends were more significant than sh solutions from csr gfz and jpl because sh products might experience signal leakage in the region which deserves further investigation as this was not addressed in the present study tws from the five grace products exhibited an increasing trend from 2006 to 2008 and then decreased afterwards agreeing with a previous study jin et al 2020 generally all five solutions showed a decreasing trend during the entire study period in the region the gldas tws trends were in good agreement with grace tws with a decreasing trend of 4 0 mm year in the lancang river basin table 1 summarises tws trends derived from the different grace solutions trend analysis revealed that both sh csr gfz and jpl and csr m had a significant decreasing trend in tws during the study period jpl showed a decreasing trend of 3 3 mm year csr 3 5 mm year gfz 3 2 mm year jpl m 6 0 mm year and csr m 5 0 mm year however the jpl m solution revealed a more severe and much wider tws reduction in the study region the gldas tws showed a decreasing trend of 4 0 mm year which was in good agreement with csr gfz and jpl the five grace products and the gldas tws revealed similar seasonal variability regardless of the different volumes between them 4 2 2 spatial tws trends from grace solutions and gldas fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the grace tws derived from the five solutions it can be seen that tws distribution in the lancang river basin opposed the elevation gradient low at high elevation upstream and high at low elevation downstream fig 9 a a substantial loss in tws in the high elevation upstream river source region during the entire period was observed and the declining trend was consistent for all grace solutions fig 9 b previous studies have reported that a massive decline in tws in the indian monsoon dominated tibetan plateau region is caused by rising temperatures and decreased precipitation in the himalayas yao 2012 jing et al 2020 additionally a previous study reported groundwater depletion upstream which added stress to tws in the headwater region of the lancang river yi et al 2016 in downstream water storage was substantially increased but this increase could be due to the construction of large reservoirs in lowland areas which appeared to increase water storage downstream eyler 2020 a previous study reported a significant decrease in river flow recorded at the yungjinghong hydrometric station located downstream of the basin from 1961 to 2015 liu et al 2020 it is clear from fig 9 b that the spatial distribution of tws solutions showed some discrepancies jpl m exhibited a slightly deviating trend from the other four grace solutions previous studies have reported that the decreasing and increasing trends of the jpl m tws are comparatively larger than those of other csr m and sh solutions scanlon et al 2018 jin et al 2020 the three processing centers jpl gfz and csr use different mathematical approaches and background models for the grace tws calculation for instance jpl m uses the glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction model which has not been considered for other grace solutions purcell et al 2016 additionally jpl and csr centers use dissimilar data processing techniques for global mascon solutions jpl m calculations employ spherical cap mascons 3 equal area whereas csr m uses hexagonal tiles 1 equatorial longitudinal distance watkins et al 2015 scanlon et al 2016b purcell et al 2016 the correlation and scatter matrix maps in fig 10 indicate that the temporal distribution of the five grace solutions is highly consistent however csr m and jpl m are more consistent with each other than with the sh solution in contrast jpl m and csr m correlated significantly r 0 98 reaching minimum and maximum values almost simultaneously 4 3 total basin discharge fig 11 illustrates the temporal trends of the total basin discharge in the lancang river basin from 2002 to 2015 the time series of the total basin discharge were calculated as a residual of the water balance eq 2 using precipitation trmm and cma evapotranspiration averaged from gldas noah vic and clm models and tws time series estimates the total basin discharge calculated from jpl m and csr m using both cma and trmm precipitation revealed a continuous decreasing trend in the basin basin discharge from cma precipitation revealed decreasing trends of 56 and 70 mm year for the jpl m and csr m tws respectively likewise the discharge calculated using trmm was 70 mm year for jpl m and 63 mm year for csr m similarly the total basin discharge calculated using gleam evapotranspiration for jpl m and csr m using cma and trmm precipitation showed an incessant decreasing trend basin discharge from cma precipitation revealed decreasing trends of 56 and 74 mm year for the jpl m and csr m tws respectively likewise the discharge calculated using trmm was 57 mm year for csr m and 71 mm year for jpl m the basin discharge trend was similar to that of precipitation fig 4 and tws fig 8 increased evapotranspiration fig 5 with decreasing precipitation resulted in decreased basin discharge during the study period 4 4 warming trends in lancang river basin the mean temperature distribution in the lancang river basin m k trend analysis and temporal distribution and seasonality are shown in fig 12 a d spatially the mean temperature was low 8 3 c in the high altitude mountainous region upstream of the basin and decreased towards the south downstream 23 c fig 12 a however the temperature exhibited a significant increasing trend over the study period in both the upstream and downstream parts of the basin fig 12 b it can also be seen in fig 12 c that temporally the temperature rose at a rate of 0 05 c from 2002 to 2015 in the study region hence the spatiotemporal trends of mean temperature depict massive warming in the lancang river basin this increase in warming rate is alarming given that the lancang river basin comprises the upper part of the mekong river basin feeding more than 60 million people worldwide including china and the countries located downstream cambodia thailand vietnam laos and myanmar jing et al 2020 increased warming is responsible for increased evapotranspiration in the study region which negatively impacts the available water resources in this region 5 discussion the lancang river is situated in a complex environmental setting with roughly two diverse topographies that gradually transform from grassland dominated plateaus to tropical rainforest zones in the south topographic gradients and diverse climates control the distribution of water resources across basins the downward trend in precipitation and a higher evapotranspiration rate have significantly contributed to the reduction of tws and total basin discharge in the lancang river basin previous studies detected severe drought in southwest china in 2009 and 2010 yang 2012 which agrees well with our results fig 12 c demonstrates that the highest annual mean temperature was recorded in 2009 while the mean annual precipitation was below average during the same year fig 4 b the lancang river basin is located in a karst region where shallow soils have high permeability leading to water stress during the dry season yang et al 2019 the lancang river basin is located in a typical south asian monsoon dominated region the most prominent monsoon system globally song 2012 fig 13 c reveals that precipitation has a clear seasonal cycle due to the south asian monsoon effect during july and august wet monsoon season the basin receives 70 80 of its annual total precipitation climate change in this region not only drives the precipitation cycle but also influences tws under increased warming and decreased precipitation csr jpl gfz csr m and jplm from grace and gldas tws showed decreasing trends in tws during the study period the impact of climate change on tws is evident from the 2009 2010 drought as shown in the tws anomalies of the five grace solutions fig 8 b indicating that climatic factors are the main driving forces behind tws variations in this region furthermore fig 8 b indicates that the csr m and jpl m solutions are more sensitive to climate variations than the three spherical harmonic solutions as the 2009 2010 drought is more evident in both mascon solutions drought does not appear in gldas tws because the gldas land water content does not include groundwater and surface water i e lakes and rivers as separate water components in its calculation in agreement with our results downward trends in precipitation and increased temperature has been reported as the main contributors to tws variations in the river source region tibetan plateau yao 2012 jing et al 2020 yang et al 2019 qiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2018 moreover yi et al 2016 reported that groundwater depletion in the upstream region of the lancang river basin in the tibetan plateau added more stress to tws and it is evident in fig 9 b that all the grace solutions and gldas tws showed a significant decreasing trend upstream of the basin during the study period the basin discharge for the lancang river was calculated as a residual from tws precipitation and evapotranspiration using the basin average approach discharge showed a significant decreasing trend in the basin using both cma and trmm precipitation as opposed to the two grace mascon solutions fig 11 a b given that the lancang is a transboundary river the observation data is under government control and access to observations requires multi party government permission and cooperation to support our findings we compared our results with the river flow recorded at the yungjinghong hydrometric station located on the lancang river which showed a significant decreasing trend in river flow from 1961 to 2015 liu et al 2020 fig 13 a b shows a time lag of 2 months between tws anomalies derived from the jpl m and csr m and precipitation the highest precipitation was recorded in july while the highest tws was recorded in september in a hydrosphere when precipitation is converted to tws during the water distribution process there is the possibility of a theoretical delayed response between tws and precipitation xu et al 2018 assessing the precise time lag between precipitation and tws as lag variations is decisive in understanding the interactions between climate variables and the hydrosphere a study conducted by syed et al 2008 demonstrated that gldas tws strongly correlates with precipitation in low latitude regions in the tibetan plateau a 2 month lag has been identified between grace tws and precipitation in the three river source regions xu et al 2018 thus precipitation is a key driver of the water budget and has immense control over the hydrological cycle and water balance in this region furthermore numerous studies have been conducted to reveal and understand the phenomenon behind the time lag between tws and precipitation there is a delay in the tws response when water enters the system as precipitation and distributes into the surface and subsurface water empirically lag can be defined as the total precipitation in hydrological balance thompson et al 2011 in the present study grace tws anomalies from csr and jpl mascon solutions were highly correlated with precipitation over a 2 month time lag these findings suggested that precipitation is a regulatory factor for tws variations that are controlled by the amount of precipitation occurring 2 months prior in the lancang river basin fig 12a b along with climatic factors aquifer properties such as permeability of sediments are the main driving force behind the delayed response of tws and precipitation for example in ethiopia a 0 month delay was recorded in karst dominated aquifers whereas a delay of up to 6 months was observed for aquifers dominated by unconsolidated sediments awange et al 2014 similarly the lancang river is also dominated by karst topography with highly permeable soils therefore a 2 month time lag in the karst dominated region might be a response to climate variations 6 conclusions understanding the trends in climatic variables is a practical approach for monitoring climatic changes and their impact on the hydrological cycle a rate of decrease in precipitation of 5 03 mm year was observed from 1998 to 2016 gldas and gleam evapotranspiration displayed an increasing trend of 4 0 4 1 mm year from 2002 to 2020 the grace tws from jpl gfz csr m and jpl m exhibited a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2016 jpl indicated a decreasing trend of 3 3 mm yr csr 4 0 mm year gfz 3 2 mm year csr m 5 0 mm year and jpl m 5 9 mm year however the csr m and jpl m solutions revealed a more severe and much wider tws reduction in the study region than the three sh solutions correspondingly gldas tws presented a decreasing trend of 4 0 mm year consistent with csr gfz and jpl solutions unlike the two mascon products the total basin discharge calculated by the water balance method showed a significant decreasing trend from 2002 to 2015 spatial and temporal temperature trends indicated intense warming in the basin with mean temperature increasing by 0 05 c from 2002 to 2015 additionally a 2 month lag between the grace derived tws and precipitation was recorded in addition to the aquifer properties climatic factors could be the key drivers behind this phenomenon however further investigations are needed to evaluate the direct relationship involved in the delayed response between precipitation and tws climatology the present study identified multiple spatial and temporal trends for climate variables and multi source tws variations in the lancang river basin these results could help understand climate change response in the transboundary river system and provide
