5040,microwave remote sensing is able to retrieve soil moisture sm at an adequate level of accuracy however these microwave remotely sensed sm products usually have a spatial resolution of tens of kilometers which cannot satisfy the requirements of fine to medium scale applications such as agricultural irrigation and local water resource management several sm downscaling methods have been proposed to solve this mismatch by downscaling the coarse scale sm to fine scale several kilometers or hundreds of meters although studies have been conducted over different climatic zones and from different data sets with good results there is still a lack of a comprehensive comparison and evaluation between them to guide the production of high resolution and high accuracy sm data therefore in this study we compared several sm downscaling methods from 0 25 to 0 01 based on polynormal fitting physical model machine learning and geostatistics over the qinghai tibet plateau where there is a wide range of climate conditions from four aspects that is comparison with the original microwave product comparison with in situ measurements inter comparison based on three cornered hat tch method and a spatial feasibility analysis the comparison results show that the method based on a physical model in this case the disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch method has the highest ability on preserving the coarse scale feature of original microwave sm product while to some extent this ability could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results in addition soil evaporation efficiency see alone is not sufficient to represent sm spatial patterns over complex land surface geostatistics based area to area regression kriging atark introduces the highest uncertainty caused by the overcorrection during the residual interpolation process while this process can also improve correlation r and correct the bias as well as provide more feasible spatial patterns and details two machine learning methods the random forest rf and gaussian process regression gpr show high stability on all comparison results but provide smoother spatial patterns the multivariate statistical regression msr method performs worst due to the fact that its simple linear regression model could not meet the requirement of sm fitting on complicated land surface moreover all five downscaling methods show a declining accuracy after downscaling this phenomenon may be caused by the spatial mismatch on fine scale in addition this could also be caused by the tendency that downscaled results will usually provide more spatial details from downscaling predictors while they cannot capture the temporal changes of the microwave sm product well in general this phenomenon tends to be more significant over heterogeneous land surface all in all five widely used soil moisture downscaling methods were compared based on a comprehensive comparison scheme to add to the body of knowledge in applicability of downcaling methods under different weather conditions keywords soil moisture downscaling methods comparison qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key state variable for its important role in water energy and carbon cycles although it accounts for a little part of the liquid water on earth only mohanty et al 2017 montzka et al 2017 wu and dickinson 2004 it controls the process of evaporation infiltration and runoff governs vegetation water uptake meanwhile it can be used to predict agricultural outputs forecast flood drought or wildfire events and analyze climate changes alizadeh and nikoo 2018 burapapol and nagasawa 2016 madadgar et al 2017 schaefer and magi 2019 wanders et al 2014 several microwave satellites have been launched to provide temporally continuous and spatially complete sm information with missions such as the metop a b advanced scatterometer ascat bartalis et al 2007 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e brocca et al 2011 jackson et al 2005 the advance microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 parinussa et al 2015 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 and the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 the spatial resolution of these sm products is mostly at the scale of tens of kilometers which cannot meet the research and application requirements at small and medium scale land surface process models crop growth models and water management applications for example need sm information at higher resolution i e several kilometers or even hundreds of meters crow et al 2000 fang et al 2018 to fill this gap many sm downscaling methods have been proposed to obtain fine scale sm information from coarse scale microwave products merlin et al 2016 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 most of these methods are based on sm predictors from the temperature vegetation feature space merlin et al 2016 peng et al 2015 wang et al 2016 polynomial fitting methods chauhan et al 2003 chen et al 2019 piles et al 2016 s√°nchez ruiz et al 2014 model based downscaling methods ines et al 2013 montzka et al 2018 nasta et al 2018 machine learning methods guevara and vargas 2019 im et al 2016 long et al 2019 park et al 2015 srivastava et al 2013 geostatistical method jin et al 2018a kim et al 2017 song et al 2019 data fusion methods das et al 2014 lorenz et al 2018 montzka et al 2016 narayan et al 2006 zhan et al 2006 and data assimilation methods naz et al 2020 pellenq et al 2003 sahoo et al 2013 although different downscaling methods have been proposed with the downscaled sm in high accuracy each type of the downscaling method has its own advantages drawbacks applicable conditions and assumptions in this context peng et al 2017 and sabaghy et al 2018 proposed systematic reviews of sm downscaling methods yu et al 2008 used six downscaling methods based on linear interpolation and geographic weighted regression to successfully downscale sm from 25 km to 1 km in north america the comparison results show that the methods based on geographic weighted regression have better performance and are less affected by the mosaic effect than linear extrapolation methods using the data from the soil moisture experiments 4 smex04 in southern arizona kim and hogue 2012 compared the soil wetness based method with the disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch method proposed by merlin et al 2009 and the temperature vegetation feature space based polynomial fitting method results show the fine scale sm from the first two downscaling methods have higher accuracy wu et al 2017 applied three smap based active passive downscaling methods official baseline algorithm optional algorithm and a change detection algorithm from the soil moisture active passive experiment smapex in australia with average root mean square errors rmse of 0 019 m3 m3 0 021 m3 m3 0 026 m3 m3 respectively liu et al 2018a compared four machine learning methods including classification and regression trees cart k nearest neighbors knn bayesian and random forests rf over northeast china results show that rf performs the best has high correlation with the original microwave product and the in situ data followed by cart knn and bayesian jin et al 2018b compared geographically weighted area to area regression kriging gwatark with a quadratic regression model qrm and area to area regression kriging atark at the upper reaches of the heihe river basin results show that gwatark performs better than qrm and atark with a 20 decrease of the root mean square error rmse than these two benchmark methods zhao et al 2018 compared the rf method with a polynomial fitting model for the iberian peninsula based on the moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis and smap ascending descending sm products results show that rf outperforms another method with an unbiased rmse ubrmse of 0 022 m3 m3 kim et al 2018 applied a support vector regression svr method to downscale sm in southwestern south korea and compared it with a polynomial fitting method with rmse of 0 07 m3 m3 and 0 09 m3 m3 correlation coefficient r of 0 68 and 0 62 respectively however these studies are usually limited to the comparison of same or similar types of downscaling methods or from different weather and climate conditions there is still a lack of applicability analysis as well as comprehensive and systematic evaluations of the sm downscaling methods over a specific area to guide the generation of high resolution and high precision downscaled sm products to solve this problem sabaghy et al 2020 performed a relatively comprehensive comparison in australia between radar based radiometer based optical based and oversampling based downscaling methods while these methods are usually limited by the lack of radar observations which can match up the existing radiometer observations spatially and temporally radar based or by the ability of medium scale 9 10 km radiometer based and oversampling based methods downscaling results in satisfying the needs of fine scale sm applications qinghai tibet plateau qtp is the source of seven major rivers in asia therefore is also called the water tower of asia in addition its high altitude makes it a hotspot to study global climate changes as an important variable indicating the interaction between land surface and atmosphere sm with high resolution and high precision over the qtp is badly needed therefore in this study a more detailed downscaling methods comparison was conducted over this region with a wide range of climate land cover and altitude conditions we evaluated more widely used sm downscaling benchmark methods including physical model based method polynomial fitting based method machine learning based method and geostatistical based method to test the applicability of each benchmark method over different land cover and under different weather conditions the methods were evaluated from four aspects that is 1 comparison of the downscaled with original sm 2 comparison of the downscaled sm with in situ observations 3 inter comparison based on the three cornered hat tavella and premoli 1994 method and 4 comparison of the spatial feasibility based on spatial patterns and details 2 study area and data 2 1 study area with an average elevation of above 4000 m and a size of about 2 5 million km2 the qinghai tibet plateau qtp 26 5 40 n and 73 105 e is the highest and largest mountain plateau in the world it is characterized by high altitude permafrost and glaciers cheng and wu 2007 so that it acts as an important water reservoir in east asia and is called the third pole and water tower of asia yang et al 2011 most areas of the qtp are arid and semi arid in winter controlled by mongolian and siberian highs the climate of qtp is cold arid and windy while the climate is warm and wet in summer due to the indian low ding et al 2007 precipitation mainly occurs from june to september with relatively drier condition on winter and spring chen et al 2013 as a major component of the global climate water and energy cycles over the qtp play an important part in the asian monsoon zhang et al 2003 the combination of high elevation with its special atmospheric water and energy circulation therefore makes the qtp develop a series of high cold vegetation types ni and herzschuh 2011 as shown in fig 1 the land cover distribution over the qtp follows a transitional gradient from the northwest to the southeast the dry and cold climate resulted from high latitude and altitude on the northwestern qtp promotes barren land and sparsely vegetated land cover with increasing annual precipitation the climate in the hinterland of the qtp changes to cold and wet resulting in the development of high cold meadow forests are found on the southeastern qtp where the climate is warm and wet due to the lower altitude and latitude as well as the increase of precipitation 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 reconstructed data several applications of soil moisture sm records require longer time series for researches on the status and trends of sm over high mountainous areas the smap data record 2015 to present might not be sufficient while the amsr e amsr2 mission however has a longer time series from 2002 to present but with lower accuracy than smap cui et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ray et al 2017 zeng et al 2016 qu et al 2019 used the random forest method to train the smap sm product with amsr e amsr2 brightness temperature from five channels h and v polarization of 10 7 ghz and 18 7 ghz v polarization of 36 5 ghz as well as auxiliary data dem land cover latitude longitude and day of the year over the qtp and rebuilt a random forest soil moisture rfsm product from 2002 to 2015 based on amsr e amsr2 preserving the traits of smap well r 0 95 rmse 0 03 m3 m3 with high accuracy r 0 75 rmse 0 06 m3 m3 bias 0 03 m3 m3 as compared to in situ measurements here this reconstructed sm product rfsm from machine learning method was used for downscaling the spatial resolution of rfsm is 0 25 according to the brightness temperature products from amsr e amsr2 as an example the rfsm data of 2014 was used in this study to conduct the downscaling methods comparison to identify adequate methods for further generation of long term high resolution sm over the qtp to overcome the problem of the spatial temporal discontinuity of the thermal infrared based land surface temperature lst products over the qtp a merged lst product zhang et al 2019 from thermal infrared and microwave observations were used in this study space borne thermal infrared tir lst retrievals provide high spatial resolutions but suffer from cloud contaminations by contrast passive microwave mw lst products have all weather capabilities but with a lower spatial resolution to fill this gap zhang et al 2019 integrated tir and mw lst based on a temporal component decomposition method the method decomposes lst into the components of annual temperature cycle atc diurnal temperature cycle dtc prescribed by solar geometry and weather temperature wtc driven by weather changes the atc is retrieved from clear sky tir lst and cloud covered mw lst respectively and then combined by a temporal weighting method the dtc is calculated from model based lst product cldas and gldas by non linear fitting and the wtc is determined from subtracting atc and dtc from the downscaled mw lst and then optimized by using a sliding window convolution strategy the accuracy of this integrated tir mw lst product is 1 29 1 71 k the spatial resolution is 1 km in this study the 1 km all weather lst for the year 2014 was used and resampled to a resolution of 0 01 using a nearest neighbor resampling method 2 2 2 auxiliary satellite data in order to feed the downscaling procedures a range of auxiliary satellite data sets are required the global land surface satellite glass is a high precision spatially continuous and long term global product based on multi source satellite sensors and ground based measured data variables include leaf area index lai surface broadband albedo albedo fractional vegetation cover fvc gross primary production gpp evapotranspiration et and broadband emissivity bbe etc the glass products selected in this study are fvc jia et al 2015 lai xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 and albedo liu et al 2013a 2013b qu et al 2014 the spatial resolution of the fvc product is 0 5 km the spatial resolution of the lai and albedo product is 1 km all these three products come with a sinusoidal projection and an 8 days temporal resolution the data of 2014 was used in this study and all data can be downloaded from glass website http www glass umd edu download html land cover data from moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis was used in this study the mcd12q1 product includes six different classification schemes we chose the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification scheme with a spatial resolution of 0 5 km and a sinusoidal projection the data of 2014 was used and this product can be downloaded from the earthdata website https search earthdata nasa gov global 30 arc second elevation gtopo30 is a global digital elevation model dem product developed by united states geological survey usgs with a resolution of 30 arc second approximately 1 km and an absolute accuracy of 30 m this dem product can be downloaded from usgs website http eros usgs gov find data products and data available gtopo30 info the precipitation data used in this study originates from cn05 1 wu and gao 2013 which is an interpolated 0 25 product based on more than 2000 station observations over china all auxiliary products such as glass fvc lai and albedo mcd12q1 and gtopo30 were resampled to a longitude latitude projection with a resolution of 0 01 using a nearest neighbor resampling method to match the projection of microwave based sm product whose resolution is 0 25 2 2 3 in situ soil moisture measurements the in situ measurements used in this study were selected from four networks namely the upper reach of heihe river basin uhrb li et al 2013 liu et al 2018b naqu yang 2013 maqu and ngari su et al 2011 table 1 lists basic information about these four networks more details can be found in fig 1 and the literature listed above in this study we assumed homogeneity of these 74 sites and that a single site value is representative for the mean value of a 0 01 pixel standard deviations were calculated based on dem to represent the heterogeneity of these four networks results show uhrb and ngari 347 6 m and 380 9 m have higher heterogeneity than maqu and naqu 151 6 m and 169 9 m 3 methodology 3 1 spatial soil moisture downscaling predictor sm downscaling predictors used in this study include lst fvc lai albedo soil evaporation efficiency see latitude longitude and day or the year doy from five aspects denoting energy vegetation dry wet condition geographic location and time information respectively the see is defined as the actual to potential soil evaporation can be retrieved from lst and fvc based on the method from merlin et al 2012 the calculation formula of see is as follow 1 see t s m a x t s t s m a x t s m i n where t s m a x and t s m i n are the maximum and minimum value of the soil surface temperature over the study area and t s is the soil surface temperature at a given pixel described as follow 2 t s t f v t v 1 f v where t is the lst f v is fvc and t v is the vegetation temperature which can be calculated using the approach proposed by moran et al 1994 it should be noted that a correction for the elevation effects on t has been conducted based on the method proposed by merlin et al 2013 3 t t ori Œ≥ h h lr where t ori is the original lst at a given pixel Œ≥ is the mean lapse rate which is set to 0 006 m h and h lr are the altitude of a pixel 0 01 and the mean altitude within the low resolution 0 25 pixel respectively 3 2 soil moisture downscaling methods five benchmark downscaling methods were compared in this study including a statistical regression based method a physical model based method two machine learning based methods as well as a geostatistical based method 3 2 1 multivariate statistical regression multivariate statistical regression msr refers to the establishment of a statistical relationship between sm and downscaling predictors under low resolution condition microwave pixel scale and then apply this statistical relationship to high resolution condition target scale by using high resolution downscaling predictors to obtain the downscaled sm at high resolution piles et al 2016 the regression method used in this study is stepwise regression the regression function can be described as follow 4 sm a 0 m 1 n a m a m i j 1 n a ij a i a j i j where a 0 is a constant a m and a ij are regression coefficients n is the number of the downscaling predictors used a m a i and a j are downscaling predictors 3 2 2 dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch is an updated version of the algorithms in merlin et al 2009 merlin et al 2010 merlin et al 2008 it aims at downscaling microwave sm from coarse to fine scale based on see given a semi empirical model and a first order taylor series expansion the downscaling algorithm is shown as follow 5 sm hr sm lr s m see lr see hr see lr where sm hr is the downscaled sm at high resolution sm lr is the microwave sm at low resolution s m see lr is the partial derivative of sm relative to see estimated at low resolution see hr and see lr are see at high and low resolution respectively the s m see lr can be calculated from daily sm and see observations the function is described as follows malb√©teau et al 2016 6 s m see lr sm see note that both eqs 5 and 6 are linearfunctions which ensures that the mean value of the downscaled sm at a microwave pixel is equal to the original microwave sm value 3 2 3 random forest the random forest rf approach as proposed by breiman 2001 essentially belongs to a large branch of machine learning methods that uses ensembles the basic idea is to integrate the results of different decision trees through ensemble learning the random denotes the randomization of data rows and variables columns first row sampling is performed with a replacement sampling method this makes sure the input samples of each tree are not the whole samples which makes it relatively less prone to over fitting then column sampling is performed by randomly selecting a number of features m from the population m m m and then select the best feature of m to completely split the samples the forest denotes to the multiple independent decision trees for an input sample n trees will provide n decision results and the rf will specify the most frequent result or choose the average of these n decision results as the final output this method has many advantages without significantly increasing the processing time i e it is insensitive to multivariate colinearity and default values and has a certain anti noise ability and can handle high dimensional data ahmad et al 2017 3 2 4 gaussian process regression gaussian process regression gpr is a non parametric machine learning method that uses gaussian process gp priordistributions to perform the regression analysis it is widely used in the fields of time series analysis image processing and automation control hu and wang 2015 li et al 2015 mihoub et al 2016 it requires fewer parameters to be set than artificial neural networks usually used for low dimensional and small sample regression problems where high accuracies are required the core theory of this algorithm uses the gp which is a collection of multiple gaussian distribution functions used to describe the distribution of data its nature is mainly described by the mean and covariance functions main assumption is that the prior distribution of variable y satisfies the following conditions 7 y n Œº k x x where Œº and k x x are the mean and covariance of y respectively the prior of joint probability distribution between observation variable y and predicted variable y can be described as 8 y y n Œº Œº k x x k x x k x x k x x where Œº and Œº are mean value of y and y x is new input variable samples k x x k x x is covariance between x and x k x x is covariance of x samples gpr is able to use different kernel functions to represent the covariance during the training process in this study the square exponential covariance kernel function was used after getting the prior distribution of y and the joint probability distribution from eq 8 the posterior probability can be calculated based on baye≈õformula therefore the final estimation of f x is performed by 9 p f x f x p f x f x p f x where p f x is the prior distribution of y p f x f x is the joint probability distribution and p f x f x is the posterior probability 3 2 5 area to area regression kriging the area to area regression kriging atark jin et al 2018b downscaling process can be divided into two main parts i building the trend surface by msr eq 4 and getting the residuals by removing trend surface from original microwave sm and ii performing area to area kriging interpolation to the residuals and then add these fine resolution residuals to trend surface to finish the downscaling process by this method the residuals after regression can meet the second order stationary condition and therefore modify the built trend surface after building the trend surface from msr the low resolution regression residuals are constructed by subtracting the trend surface from the microwave sm values then the high resolution residuals can be obtained from the nearby low resolution residuals by 10 r v j h 1 k Œª hj r v h where r v j is the residual to be estimated at a given fine scale pixel v j r v h is the neighboring residuals at coarse scale pixels k is the number of the chosen neighboring coarse scale pixels and Œª hj is the weightcoefficient that can be calculated as follows 11 i 1 k Œª ij c v h v i Œº o j c v h v j h 1 2 k i 1 k Œª ij 1 where c v h v i and c v h v j are area to area covariance Œº o j is the lagrange multiplier finally the resulting high resolution residuals are added to the trend surface to obtain the downscaled sm 3 3 downscaling and methods comparison procedure fig 2 shows the downscaling procedure and comparison of the downscaling methods before the downscaling process all the eight downscaling predictors were resampled to the resolution of 0 01 using a nearest neighbor resampling method see the downscaling predictor of dispatch is calculated from lst and fvc the downscaling predictors of msr and atark are lst fvc lai albedo see longitude and latitude as the models established by rf and gpr are with stronger simulation ability apart from the downscaling predictors used in msr and atark the observation day of year doy is added to ensure the stability of the downscaling relationship it should be noted that the downscaling predictors used in msr atark rf and gpr need to be normalized and a denormalization process is performed after the high resolution sm simulation to get the real downscaled sm after the downscaling procedure the comparison was conducted based on four aspects that is 1 comparison with original microwave sm product in this case is rfsm 2 comparison of the downscaled sm with in situ observations based on single site and spatial correlation 3 inter comparison based on the three cornered hat tch method and statistical metrics and 4 comparison of the spatial feasibility on the whole qtp and a specific area based on spatial patterns and details 3 4 statistical metrics the standard statistical metrics used in this study include correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse unbiased rmse ubrmse and bias given by 12 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 13 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 14 ubrmse i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n 15 bias 1 n i 1 n x i y i where x and y are mean value x i is the estimated value y i is the observed value and n is the size of sample however it is difficult to make a comprehensive quantitative comparison about the advantages and disadvantages of the downscaling method based on the verification results from a single evaluation metric therefore this study used the g down indicator merlin et al 2015 to comprehensively evaluate the downscaling results from three aspects that is efficiency gain g effi precision gain g prec and accuracy gain g accu given by 16 g down g effi g prec g accu 3 17 g effi 1 slope lr 1 slope hr 1 slope lr 1 slope hr 18 g prec 1 r lr 1 r hr 1 r lr 1 r hr 19 g accu bias lr bias hr bias lr bias hr where the subscript lr and hr indicate the statistical metrics on the microwave pixel scale and high resolution scale respectively and slope is the slope of microwave downscaled sm against in situ data 3 5 three cornered hat method as the quantity of in situ data is limited a thorough performance analysis of downscaling methods within the whole qtp is a challenge while the three cornered hat tch method tavella and premoli 1994 can estimate relative uncertainties among several products without prior information independence between the tested products is not necessary if properly constrained a time series can be split into true value and error by 20 x i x true e i i 1 2 n where x i is the ith product time series x true is the true value e i is the error term and n is the total number of the products the differences between the n 1 tested products x i and a randomly selected reference product x r are described as 21 y i r x i x r e i e r i 1 2 n 1 where y is a matrix with n 1 time series if the covariance matrix of y is s c o v y the n n unknown covariance matrix of the individual noises r can be described as 22 s j r j t where j i u i is a n 1 n 1 identity matrix u is a n 1 unit column vector to solve eq 22 galindo and palacio 1999 introduced a constrained minimization function based on kuhn tucker theory the objective function f can be obtained by 23 f r 1 n r nn 1 k 2 i 1 n j 1 n r ij 2 i j where k s n 1 r ij is the elements of r the constraint function g and the initial iteration conditions set as 24 g r 1 n r nn r s k 0 25 r in 0 0 i n r nn 0 1 2 s s u t s 1 u after obtaining the matrix r by minimizing eq 23 the square root of the diagonal values of r denotes the uncertainty of each product the ratio of the uncertainty to the mean value of each product can be considered as relative uncertainty 4 results in this section a comprehensive downscaling methods comparison scheme was used to find out the advantages and disadvantages of each downscaling methods the methods comparison will based on four aspects that is comparison with the original microwave sm product to test the ability on preserving the traits of microwave sm product comparison with in situ measurements to test the relatively true accuracy of each method and its variation in accuracy caused by the downscaling process inter comparison based on tch method to test the spatial reference accuracy of each method and spatial feasibility analysis to test the reliability of spatial trend and spatial detail capturing capability 4 1 comparison of the downscaled with original soil moisture to test the performance of the downscaling methods on preserving the coarse scale traits of the original microwave sm product the downscaling results at a resolution of 0 01 were averaged to 0 25 then the statistical metrics r ubrmse and bias were calculated spatially the results are shown in figs 3 and 4 fig 3 shows that when only considering the ability on preserving the coarse scale traits of the original microwave sm product msr rf and gpr have worse performance on the northwest of the qtp where the land cover is mainly barren or sparsely vegetated according to the r value atark has better performance over these areas originating from the residual correction process but has worse performance at the border as well as south central of the qtp caused by the complex varied topography dispatch performs best among the five downscaling methods and the downscaling result is highly correlated with the original sm product over the whole qtp as shown in the second column of fig 3 according to the ubrmse value rf and gpr show similar spatial distribution both of them have lower ubrmse over the whole qtp both two statistical regression methods msr and atark also have similar spatial distribution with higher ubrmse than rf and gpr but atark has smoother spatial pattern than msr again dispatch has the lowest ubrmse value over the whole qtp also performs the best among the five methods the third column of fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the bias results indicate that the bias of dispatch is almost zero over the whole qtp meaning the dispatch is the only unbiased downscaling method in this study gpr has better performance than rf especially on the south and southwest of qtp the bias distribution of msr and atark is opposite and around water bodies msr tends to underestimate and atark tends to overestimate fig 4 shows the value domain of these statistical metrics over the whole qtp according to the r value dispatch performs the best followed by atark gpr rf and msr from the ubrmse dispatch also performs the best followed by gpr rf msr and atark from the bias dispatch almost has zero bias value followed by gpr rf msr and atark which is consistent with the results of ubrmse 4 2 comparison of downscaled and in situ soil moisture to evaluate the performance of the downscaling methods the downscaling results were compared with the in situ sm data at the 0 01 scale at four networks totally 74 sites during the unfrozen season from april 1st to september 30th in addition the validation of the rfsm against in situ sm observations is performed at the 0 25 scale at all 74 sites the spatial plots of the downscaling results around four networks are shown in appendix fig a 1 the verification results are shown in appendix 1 and appendix 2 where r rmse ubrmse bias and g down are calculated separately fig 5 and table 2 show the violin plots as well as the mean value of the of the validation results over the all 74 sites the distribution of the correlation coefficient of atark is most similar to rfsm with very close mean value first and third quartile and median 0 555 to 0 546 which means the atark method can capture the temporal variation of the rfsm well followed by dispatch rf gpr and msr 0 479 0 472 0 469 and 0 445 respectively for the rmse value the distribution patterns of dispatch rf and gpr are more similar to rfsm with majority of the rmse located near 0 1 m3 m3 while as shown in table 2 dispatch and rf has lower mean value than gpr 0 118 m3 m3 0 117 m3 m3 and 0 121 m3 m3 respectively followed by atark and msr 0 129 m3 m3 and 0 137 m3 m3 meanwhile the msr has a wider value range which means it has lower stability over different sites according to rmse note that all these five downscaling results lead to a small increase of the rmse compared to rfsm whose mean value is 0 112 m3 m3 based on ubrmse msr performs best 0 051 m3 m3 followed by rf gpr dispatch and atark 0 058 m3 m3 0 063 m3 m3 0 068 m3 m3 0 086 m3 m3 respectively based on the bias evaluation the ranking is atark dispatch rf gpr and msr 0 014 m3 m3 0 069 m3 m3 0 081 m3 m3 0 083 m3 m3 and 0 119 m3 m3 respectively the highest bias value and lowest ubrmse value of msr show that this method usually has stable downscaling results and the main error bias is from its limited fitting capacity atark is just the opposite usually with unstable downscaling results caused by the residual interpolation process but this process can also reduce the bias when compared with in situ data as an unbiased downscaling method dispatch has the closest bias value with its origin rfsm msr usually has a narrow violin indicating that this method is unstable when applied to different areas note that these conclusions do not directly support the comparison results between the rfsm and downscaled sm as shown in figs 3 and 4 meaning that to some extent the ability of transferring the accuracy of the original microwave sm product could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results for example although the msr has worse performance regarding ubrmse when compared with rfsm it has the best performance when compared with in situ observed sm 0 051 m3 m3 in addition dispatch performs better than atark on r when compared with rfsm while atark has the highest r value 0 555 when compared with in situ observed sm even better than rfsm when comparing at different networks msr has worse r performance at uhrb maqu and ngari while at naqu where the land cover is homogeneous grassland as shown in fig 1 msr shows highest r it also shows low ubrmse and high bias at all four networks atark has highest r at all four networks indicating the residual processing strategy is useful for capturing a higher portion of sm temporal changes information but usually introduce larger bias and fluctuation rf and gpr have lower rmse and ubrmse at naqu but rf performs better than gpr at all four networks based on rmse and ubrmse as well as lowest rmse at naqu and ngari according to g down shown in table 2 from the view of all four networks there are only 28 4 32 4 41 9 43 2 and 44 6 of the sites with positive g down values for msr dispatch rf gpr and atark respectively this implies a negative effect of the downscaling process to the sm accuracy this phenomenon is more obvious over heterogeneous land surface like uhrb and maqu at naqu however rf and gpr show more than 50 percent of positive g down msr dispatch and atark also show higher proportion of positive values indicating that downscaling over homogeneous land surface could be more likely to keep the accuracy of rfsm or even improve the accuracy to further test the temporal stability of the downscaling methods the temporal course of the spatial correlation rspatial is plotted in fig 6 the results show that rspatial of rfsm changes dramatically during the seasons with precipitation in april when the soil on qtp are not fully thawed and ponding water might cover the soil the spatial surface sm cannot be captured adequately then rspatial increases until summer and the spatial patterns are adequately represented later in summer and autumn sm variability decreases with the increase of sm thus resulting in the decline of rspatial the large noise of rspatial could be resulted from the possibility that topography variations land cover changes and precipitation cannot be detected in a 0 25 microwave pixel but could be detected by some in situ sites while this seasonal trend is more obvious in the sm downscaling results when the whole qtp is dry or wet the low sm variability leads to lower spatial correlations between downscaled sm and in situ networks the spatial correlation is highest during moderate sm conditions with highest sm variability zhao et al 2013 an extensive precipitation event in summer and autumn reduces the spatial correlation rspatial 4 3 inter comparison of downscaling results considering that the direct comparison is limited by the quality and quantity of the in situ sm measurement it is difficult to indicate the overall performance of the downscaling methods over the entire qtp therefore the three cornered hat tch method was used in this study to compare the spatial distribution of the uncertainty between the five downscaling methods in addition an inter comparison between the downscaling results is also performed by calculating r and rmse between each two methods the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 it can be seen from fig 7 that the high uncertainty of dispatch is mainly concentrated on the boundary of microwave pixels with strong sm variability and around high sm areas in addition high uncertainty also appears close to water bodies where higher sm values appear as well as forest land cover in the southern part of the qtp both rf and gpr have high uncertainty in the eastern part and around the qinghai lake in the northeast of the qtp gpr has higher uncertainty than rf in the forested southern part of the qtp msr and atark both based on statistical regression have similar uncertainty spatial distribution both results show higher uncertainty over high sm area around water bodies and wetlands in the eastern part and hinterland of the qtp generally atark exhibits higher uncertainty than msr especially on the northeastern qtp and the grassland in the central part as well as forest in the south of the qtp fig 7 also shows the spatial distribution of the downscaling results with minimum uncertainty where gpr performs best in 33 2 of the qtp area followed by rf 29 5 dispatch 28 4 msr 8 1 and atark 0 8 fig 8 presents the inter comparison between each two methods results show that dispatch rf and gpr have high correlation with higher r values from 0 81 to 0 85 and lower rmse values lower than 0 04 m3 m3 msr performs worse with r lower than 0 8 0 66 0 73 and 0 51 and rmse higher than 0 04 m3 m3 0 049 m3 m3 0 042 m3 m3 0 081 m3 m3 against dispatch gpr and atark while although has similar r values as msr atark performs worst with the highest rmse higher than 0 05 m3 m3 as compared to other methods note that the correlation between msr and atark is the lowest even though they all based on polynomial fitting and used the same downscaling predictors the reason could be attributed to the residual interpolation process of atark compared to rf and gpr although dispatch is downscaled from see while rf and gpr are downscaled from lst fvc lai albedo see longitude latitude and doy they still have high correlation this might be caused by the fact that dispatch have high ability on preserving the accuracy and spatial pattern of rfsm and machine learning methods have strong simulation ability another reason could be attributed to the high representativeness of lst to sm long et al 2019 but this should be considered carefully as the ability of msr to capture the high dynamics of sm over the qtp is limited by its linear model this fitting performance difference would induce the weaker correlation between msr and rf gpr atark exhibits a higher bias than other methods when compared with rfsm fig 3 therefore in this inter comparison it performs worst this phenomenon is similar to the direct comparison results against in situ data in table 2 where dispatch rf and gpr have similar performance and msr performs worst while atark performs best regarding r and bias this is also consistent with the results shown in fig 7 based on tch method that is dispatch rf and gpr have similar uncertainty msr has high uncertainty in some specific areas and atark has the highest uncertainty over most area of the qtp note that direct comparison against in situ data and inter comparison tch focus on two different aspects respectively the first one validates the relatively true accuracy of a remote sensing product against ground based relatively true value the second one validates the relative reference accuracy between several products when there is no in situ data available that is to say this inter comparison only tests the consistency of a product against other products in time series so the inter comparison results can just be used as a reference not the true accuracy when both the direct comparison and inter comparison are available in one pixel in this case is a 0 01 pixel we should be more inclined to the first comparison results 4 4 spatial feasibility of the downscaled soil moisture in order to analyze the feasibility of the spatial distribution of the downscaling results figs 9 and 10 compare the downscaling results with rfsm over the whole qtp and a specific area on the unfrozen season as shown in fig 9 all five methods can capture the temporal changes of rfsm and dispatch gpr as well as rf are consistently better capturing the spatial patterns of rfsm over the whole qtp considering that dispatch is an unbiased downscaling method its ability to restore the spatial pattern of the original microwave product is the strongest but because of the pixel by pixel downscaling process despite a sliding window method is used the mosaic effect is still relatively serious as shown in fig 9 while rf to a certain extent has a stronger smoothing effect than dispatch on the spatial trend due to the latitude longitude information used in downscaling predictors are at a low resolution and the fact that rf cannot predict values out of range of training sets the new inputted fine scale latitude longitude information therefore would probably lead the predicted fine scale sm to nearest coarse scale pixels sm values hence the mosaic effect of downscaling results appears but this phenomenon mainly occurs in areas with strong sm gradients so that there is basically no mosaic phenomenon in areas with stable sm compared with rf the spatial distribution of gpr is less affected by mosaic effect in some sm variable areas and is not as smooth as rf in sm stable areas but on the whole there is a high degree of consistency with rf msr has a good response in the forest area only in the southeastern qtp but in other regions of qtp its downscaling results lose the spatial details of sm that is the spatial distribution is too smooth especially in areas with large gradients of sm in contrast atark underestimates sm in dry areas and overestimates sm in wet areas which strengthens the spatial comparison of sm and highlights the sm spatial characteristics of qtp this is because during the residual interpolation process the residual of the high resolution target pixels is affected by the surrounding high absolute value residuals thus overestimating the residuals and after these overestimated residuals are added to the regression trend surface the overcorrecting phenomenon appears fig 10 shows spatial details of the downscaling results over a specific area all results except msr can keep the spatial pattern of rfsm well while in the southwestern river valley dispatch shows lower sm which indicates the possibly wrong see spatial pattern in this area and that one downscaling predictor alone is not sufficient to represent spatial pattern and details on complex land surface atark performs better by both providing spatial pattern from rfsm and spatial details from downscaling predictors than dispatch msr although can provide spatial details around the river valley it weakens the spatial pattern of rfsm comparing with rf whose spatial pattern is smooth gpr can provide more spatial details both in southwestern low sm areas and northeastern high sm areas 5 discussion 5 1 downscaling algorithms and scale effects based on the performance of the five downscaling results on preserving the coarse scale traits of the original microwave product in section 4 1 the reasonable order of performance is dispatch gpr rf atark and msr this result is related to the scale effect introduced from their downscaling algorithm scaling of environmental states and processes is a key issue in remote sensing research and scale effects need to be considered in remote sensing analyses the scale effects in this downscaling process mainly originate from two topics 1 when the downscaling predictors were aggregated to low resolution the scale effect caused by the nonlinearity on the retrieval process of the downscaling predictors this kind of scale effect exists in all five downscaling methods it has no influences on the methods comparison results so we will focus on the second one 2 the scale effect of the model that is whether the downscaling model established on one scale is applicable to another scale this kind of scale effect is related to the linear or nonlinear degree of the downscaling model i e if the model is linear there is no scale effect and if the model is nonlinear and the same model is applied at different scale the results will be different and the extent of differences is related to the heterogeneity of the underlying surface and the degree of nonlinearity of the model among the five downscaling algorithms only the dispatch is a linear model there is no scale effect of the model so there will be no differences when changing the order of processing steps i e no difference between averaged first and then inverted i e averaging the high resolution downscaling predictors to low resolution and then the low resolution sm is inverted which corresponds to the downscaling process of establishing the relationship between sm and downscaling predictors at low resolution and inverted first and then averaged i e inverting the high resolution sm from the high resolution downscaling predictors and then the high resolution sm is averaged to low resolution which corresponds to the validating process of averaging the downscaling results to low resolution the pixel by pixel downscaling combined with its linear model results in an unbiased downscaling method dispatch therefore it performs best among the five downscaling methods by preserving the traits of the original microwave sm product as well as the smallest scale effect the other four downscaling algorithms are nonlinear so there is a significant scale effect during the model application the models established by rf and gpr are discrete combined with latitude and longitude information they can respond well to high and low sm conditions however the models established by msr and atark are continuous which leads to the failure of the continuous model on obtaining reliable fitting results in areas with large sm variability resulting in large deviation in the downscaling results especially around water bodies while during the residual interpolation process in atark as mentioned in section 4 4 the smoothing or the weaker fitting ability of the linear regression model leads to higher coarse scale residuals especially over water bodies therefore the fine scale residuals are still higher after interpolation these higher residuals as well as the spatially smoothing effect of the interpolation process lead to the overcorrection of the msr bias as shown in the bias spatial distribution results in fig 3 5 2 deterioration effects during downscaling the results in section 4 2 show all the five downscaling results have a decline of the accuracy than rfsm with a negative g down over more than 50 sites msr 71 6 dispatch 67 6 rf 58 1 gpr 56 8 and atark 55 4 which is contrary to the results of merlin et al 2015 and malb√©teau et al 2016 in order to investigate this phenomenon in more detail the bar plots in fig 11 show the performance of g down and also its three components namely g effi g prec and g accu from slope r and bias differences before and after the downscaling first for g down msr performs worst resulting from the bad performance of g effi and g accu with 75 68 and 77 03 negative values while it has a better g prec indicating that msr results have worse slope and bias than rfsm over most sites but with a relative better r performance than other methods for dispatch the 67 57 negative g down may result from the bad performance of g prec implying a decline of r when against rfsm the two machine learning methods rf and gpr have similar performance in g prec and g accu as well as g down while gpr performs better in g effi with less negative values 41 89 atark however has the best g down performance caused by its good performance of the all three component indices this accuracy decline phenomenon during downscaling is similar to the direct comparison results against in situ data shown in section 4 2 where atark performs best followed by dispatch rf gpr and msr considering r and bias but there are still differences for example msr has the worst r value 0 445 in table 2 while it performs better in g prec therefore fig 12 was plotted to test the changes of g effi g prec and g accu with the different combinations of high resolution and low resolution statistical matrix values the results indicated that these indices are suitable for single site comparison but not suitable for a comprehensive comparison over several sites even the same g effi g prec and g accu values imply different magnitudes of increase or decline of the downscaling results performances as compared to different original microwave product performances thus the sign of these indices is more meaningful than the absolute value itself when considering the validation results from different sites therefore the mismatch of the worst r performance and the best g prec performance could be explained by this different potential meaning of the g prec value that is some positive g prec values may indicate a low increase of the r over a site while some negative values could indicate a huge decline of the r over other sites in total this g down index is useful when comparing the downscaling results with the original microwave sm product but should be used carefully when there is not a strong positive or negative trend over most sites but the question is still why there is a negative effect of the downscaling process in this study this could result from the spatial mismatch at the fine scale resolution which is expected to be larger sabaghy et al 2020 van der velde et al 2012 and also the fact that original microwave products often have higher correlation with the temporally dynamic changes of the observed sm while the downscaling results have a potential to provide more spatial details and perhaps reflect more patterns about the downscaling predictors gruber et al 2020 peng et al 2016 although the downscaling predictors could provide more information than the original microwave sm product itself they could also introduce errors to the downscaling process 5 3 the impact of land cover land cover as an important factor which can reflect and influence sm spatial distribution it was analyzed here to further elaborate on the tch results in section 4 3 the variation of tch uncertainties corresponding to land cover changes from latitude and longitude direction are shown in fig 13 msr and atark usually have higher uncertainties than dispatch rf and gpr both from latitude and longitude direction their uncertainties change with the percentage of vegetated land cover the blue part in fig 13 while although the uncertainties of dispatch rf and gpr increase too their changes are gradual which indicate that statistical regression based methods msr and atark perform worse when the sm variability increases as the percentage of vegetated land cover increases for example on the longitude direction and around 101 104 e where the percentage of vegetated land cover increases the uncertainties of msr and atark increase sharply while the uncertainties of dispatch rf and gpr remain steady or even decline slightly this phenomenon could be explained by figs 3 and 9 which show a high positive bias value of msr and a high negative bias value of atark on the east part of qtp when compared with rfsm dispatch downscales sm in a window around the target pixel so the performance is stable over the whole qtp except for highly vegetated areas around 26 5 n this results from the weaker correlation between see and sm there malb√©teau et al 2016 machine learning based methods rf and gpr due to their model nonlinearity and flexibility can capture the sm changes over high variability areas and therefore also preserve a relatively stable uncertainty the violin plots and circle charts in figs 14 and 15 show that for barren land and sparsely vegetated land cover dispatch usually has minimum uncertainty followed by gpr rf msr and atark the pie graph indicates that dispatch has the minimum uncertainty in 40 2 of this land cover followed by gpr rf msr and atark 38 3 16 9 4 2 0 4 respectively under grassland rf has the minimum uncertainties followed by dispatch gpr msr and atark rf and gpr have the minimum uncertainty in 35 2 and 33 5 areas of grassland followed by dispatch msr and atark 22 8 7 9 0 6 respectively under forest rf also has the minimum uncertainty followed by dispatch gpr msr and atark rf has the minimum uncertainty in 43 area of the forest land cover followed by dispatch gpr msr and atark 26 9 15 11 3 3 8 respectively 5 4 synopsis of validation to perform a comprehensive comparison and to summarize the characteristics of each downscaling method a ranked radar chart is plotted in fig 16 among the five downscaling methods dispatch as an unbiased method caused by its linear downscaling model and pixel by pixel downscaling strategy has the best performance on preserving the coarse scale spatial distribution pattern and accuracy of rfsm followed by gpr and rf while msr and atark perform the worst resulting from the limited fitting ability of linear statistical regression model and the overcorrection phenomenon of the residual interpolation process in atark when compared with in situ measurements atark however performs best with the highest correlation even better than rfsm 0 555 to 0 546 followed by rf dispatch gpr and msr which indicates the positive effects of the residual processing strategy in atark and the fact that high consistency with original microwave sm product to some extent could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results when considering the g down metric the downscaling process has a negative effect at most sites about 71 6 67 6 58 1 56 8 and 55 4 for msr dispatch rf gpr and atark respectively this negative effect of downscaling could be explained by the spatial mismatch and the trend that downscaling results usually represent the spatial distribution of the downscaling predictors not the temporal changes of sm from the original microwave product besides this negative effect tends to be higher over heterogeneous land surface based on inter comparison results rf and gpr performs better with lower uncertainty spatially and rf is better than gpr over grassland and forest land cover dispatch has medium uncertainty and performs best over barren land or sparsely vegetated land cover as the correlation of see and sm is stronger over arid areas msr and atark have high uncertainty spatially and atark performs worst with high uncertainty resulted from the large deviation against other methods considering the spatial feasibility although showing highest sm variation spatially caused by the overcorrection phenomenon of the residual interpolation process atark can keep the spatial pattern of rfsm well and can provide more spatial details dispatch performs best with most similar spatial pattern as original microwave sm product while suffers from mosaic effects and can provide wrong sm pattern over complex land surface due to that see alone is not sufficient to represent sm spatial patterns gpr performs better than rf both in spatial patterns and details msr shows smoothest spatial pattern thus misses spatial details to a large degree 6 summary and conclusions in this study sm downscaling was performed over qtp by five methods namely msr dispatch rf gpr and atark to increase the spatial resolution of the original rfsm product from 0 25 to 0 01 the downscaling results were analyzed regarding four aspects that is comparison with the original microwave sm product comparison with in situ measurements inter comparison between each other and spatial feasibility analysis due to the linear model and pixel by pixel downscaling strategy dispatch is an unbiased downscaling method with the highest ability of preserving the coarse scale traits of microwave sm product while to some extent this ability could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results as it cannot make full use of extra information from ancillary data and usually will induce a mosaiced spatial pattern meanwhile see alone is not sufficient to represent sm variations over complex land surface machine learning methods rf and gpr perform stable in all four comparison results due to their high ability to capture nonlinear processes but they also provide a smoother spatial pattern rf has lowest uncertainty over grassland and forest land cover while it performs worse than gpr over barren land and sparsely vegetated land cover dispatch however performs best over these land covers caused by the stronger correlation of see and sm over arid areas the linear regression model of msr is not suitable for downscaling on complex land surface resulting in the low accuracy of downscaling results and missing of spatial details while over homogeneous land surface its downscaling results could capture sm temporal variation well atark has the highest uncertainty and large sm variation over most area of qtp caused by the overcorrection phenomenon of its residual interpolation process however it can also slightly improve the correlation r of the downscaling results and correct the bias when compared against in situ measurements as well as provide more feasible spatial patterns and details the availability of g down in downscaling results comparison is also discussed in this study as this index is suitable for the comparison before and after the downscaling for a single site and a single method it is not very useful to the comprehensive comparison on several sites therefore we recommended to use this index carefully and as an independent indicator from the statistic results based on g down accuracy decreasing is detected in all five downscaling methods which may be caused by the spatial mismatch on fine scale and the fact that downscaling results tend to preserve spatial traits of downscaling predictors while to some extent miss the temporal changes of microwave sm product in general this phenomenon is more likely to happen over complex land surface structures in conclusion dispatch is suitable for downscaling over arid regions and is not suitable for downscaling over high vegetated regions meanwhile when the original microwave sm product is reliable its downscaled result will also have higher reliability msr and atark are good at showing spatial trend and when high accuracy downscaled sm is needed atark will be a good choice machine learning is a compromised downscaling method without distinctive advantages and disadvantages it performs stably in all aspects taken together among these five methods atark has larger upside potential as its residual interpolation process can improve the downscaled accuracy if we can properly improve the fitting ability of the statistical regression model atark will have better downscaled results and the overcorrection phenomenon will be relieved credit authorship contribution statement yuquan qu conceptualization

5040,microwave remote sensing is able to retrieve soil moisture sm at an adequate level of accuracy however these microwave remotely sensed sm products usually have a spatial resolution of tens of kilometers which cannot satisfy the requirements of fine to medium scale applications such as agricultural irrigation and local water resource management several sm downscaling methods have been proposed to solve this mismatch by downscaling the coarse scale sm to fine scale several kilometers or hundreds of meters although studies have been conducted over different climatic zones and from different data sets with good results there is still a lack of a comprehensive comparison and evaluation between them to guide the production of high resolution and high accuracy sm data therefore in this study we compared several sm downscaling methods from 0 25 to 0 01 based on polynormal fitting physical model machine learning and geostatistics over the qinghai tibet plateau where there is a wide range of climate conditions from four aspects that is comparison with the original microwave product comparison with in situ measurements inter comparison based on three cornered hat tch method and a spatial feasibility analysis the comparison results show that the method based on a physical model in this case the disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch method has the highest ability on preserving the coarse scale feature of original microwave sm product while to some extent this ability could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results in addition soil evaporation efficiency see alone is not sufficient to represent sm spatial patterns over complex land surface geostatistics based area to area regression kriging atark introduces the highest uncertainty caused by the overcorrection during the residual interpolation process while this process can also improve correlation r and correct the bias as well as provide more feasible spatial patterns and details two machine learning methods the random forest rf and gaussian process regression gpr show high stability on all comparison results but provide smoother spatial patterns the multivariate statistical regression msr method performs worst due to the fact that its simple linear regression model could not meet the requirement of sm fitting on complicated land surface moreover all five downscaling methods show a declining accuracy after downscaling this phenomenon may be caused by the spatial mismatch on fine scale in addition this could also be caused by the tendency that downscaled results will usually provide more spatial details from downscaling predictors while they cannot capture the temporal changes of the microwave sm product well in general this phenomenon tends to be more significant over heterogeneous land surface all in all five widely used soil moisture downscaling methods were compared based on a comprehensive comparison scheme to add to the body of knowledge in applicability of downcaling methods under different weather conditions keywords soil moisture downscaling methods comparison qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction soil

research and application requirements at small and medium scale land surface process models crop growth models and water management applications for example need sm information at higher resolution i e several kilometers or even hundreds of meters crow et al 2000 fang et al 2018 to fill this gap many sm downscaling methods have been proposed to obtain fine scale sm information from coarse scale microwave products merlin et al 2016 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 most of these methods are based on sm predictors from the temperature vegetation feature space merlin et al 2016 peng et al 2015

different downscaling methods have been proposed with the downscaled sm in high accuracy each type of the downscaling method has its own advantages drawbacks applicable conditions and assumptions in this context peng et al 2017 and sabaghy et al 2018 proposed systematic reviews of sm downscaling methods yu et al 2008 used six downscaling methods based on linear interpolation and geographic weighted regression to successfully downscale sm from 25 km to 1 km in north america the comparison results show that the methods based on geographic weighted regression have better performance and are less affected by the mosaic effect than linear extrapolation methods using the data from the soil moisture experiments 4 smex04 in southern arizona kim and hogue 2012 compared the soil wetness based method with the disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch method proposed by merlin et al 2009 and the temperature vegetation feature space based polynomial fitting method results show the fine scale sm from the first two downscaling methods have higher accuracy wu et al 2017 applied three smap based active passive downscaling methods official baseline algorithm

results show that rf performs the best has high correlation with the original microwave product and the in situ data followed by cart knn and bayesian jin et al 2018b compared geographically weighted area to area regression kriging gwatark with a quadratic regression model qrm and area to area regression kriging atark at the upper reaches of the heihe river basin results show that gwatark performs better than qrm and atark with a 20 decrease of the root mean square error rmse than these two benchmark methods zhao et al 2018 compared the rf method with a polynomial fitting model for the iberian peninsula based on the moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis and smap ascending descending sm products results show that rf outperforms another method with an unbiased rmse ubrmse of 0 022 m3 m3 kim et al 2018 applied a support vector regression svr method to downscale sm in southwestern south korea and compared it with a polynomial fitting method with rmse of 0 07 m3 m3 and 0 09 m3 m3 correlation coefficient r of 0 68 and 0 62 respectively however these studies are usually limited to the comparison of same or similar types of downscaling methods or from different weather and climate conditions there is still a lack of applicability analysis as well as comprehensive and systematic evaluations of the sm downscaling methods over a specific area to guide the generation of high resolution and high precision downscaled sm products to solve this problem sabaghy et al 2020 performed a relatively comprehensive comparison in australia between radar based radiometer based optical based and oversampling based downscaling methods while these methods are usually limited by the lack of radar observations which can match up the existing radiometer observations spatially and temporally radar based or by the ability of medium scale 9 10 km radiometer based and oversampling based methods downscaling results in satisfying the needs of fine scale sm applications qinghai tibet plateau qtp is the source of seven major rivers in asia therefore is also called the water tower of asia in addition its high altitude makes it a hotspot to study global climate changes as an important variable indicating the interaction between land surface and atmosphere sm with high resolution and high precision over the qtp is badly needed therefore in this study a more detailed downscaling methods comparison was conducted over this region with a wide range of climate land cover and altitude conditions we evaluated more widely used sm downscaling benchmark methods including physical model based method polynomial fitting based method machine learning based method and geostatistical based method to test the applicability of each benchmark method over different land cover and under different weather conditions the methods were evaluated from four aspects that is 1 comparison of the downscaled with original sm 2 comparison of the downscaled sm with in situ observations 3 inter comparison based on the three cornered hat tavella and premoli 1994 method and 4 comparison of the spatial feasibility based on spatial patterns and details 2 study area and data 2 1 study

characterized by high altitude permafrost and glaciers cheng and wu 2007 so that it acts as an important water reservoir in east asia and is called the third pole and water tower of asia yang et al 2011 most areas of the qtp are arid and semi arid in winter controlled by mongolian and siberian highs the climate of qtp is cold arid and windy while the climate is warm and wet in summer due to the indian low ding et al 2007 precipitation mainly occurs from june to september with relatively drier condition on winter and spring chen et al 2013 as a major component of the global climate water and energy cycles over the qtp play an important part in the asian monsoon zhang et al 2003 the combination of high elevation with its special atmospheric water and energy circulation therefore makes the qtp develop a series of high cold vegetation types ni and herzschuh 2011 as shown in fig 1 the land cover distribution over the qtp follows a transitional gradient from the northwest to the southeast the dry and cold climate resulted from high latitude and altitude on the northwestern qtp promotes barren land and sparsely vegetated land cover with increasing annual precipitation the climate in the hinterland of the qtp changes to cold and wet resulting in the development of high cold meadow forests are found on the southeastern qtp where the climate is warm and wet due to the lower altitude and latitude as well as the increase of precipitation 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 reconstructed data several applications of soil moisture sm records require longer time series for researches on the status and trends of sm over high mountainous areas the smap data record 2015 to present might not be sufficient while the amsr e amsr2 mission however has a longer time series from 2002 to present but with lower accuracy than smap cui et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ray et al 2017 zeng et al 2016 qu et al 2019 used the random forest method to train the smap sm product with amsr e amsr2 brightness temperature

random forest soil moisture rfsm product from 2002 to 2015 based on amsr e amsr2 preserving the traits of smap well r 0 95 rmse 0 03 m3 m3 with high accuracy r 0 75 rmse 0 06 m3 m3 bias 0 03 m3 m3 as compared to in situ measurements here this reconstructed sm product rfsm from machine learning method was used for downscaling the spatial resolution of rfsm is 0 25 according to the brightness temperature products from amsr e amsr2 as an example the rfsm data of 2014 was used in this study to conduct the downscaling methods comparison to identify adequate methods for further generation of long term high resolution sm over the qtp to overcome the problem of the spatial temporal discontinuity of the thermal infrared based land surface temperature lst products over the qtp a merged lst product zhang et al 2019 from thermal infrared and microwave observations were used in this study space borne thermal infrared tir lst retrievals provide high spatial resolutions but suffer from cloud contaminations by contrast passive microwave mw lst products have all weather capabilities but with a lower spatial resolution to fill this gap zhang et al 2019 integrated tir and mw lst based on a temporal component decomposition method the method decomposes lst into the components of annual temperature cycle atc diurnal temperature cycle dtc prescribed by solar geometry and weather temperature wtc driven by weather changes the atc is retrieved from clear sky tir lst and cloud covered mw lst respectively and then combined by a temporal weighting method the dtc is calculated from model based lst product cldas and gldas by non linear fitting and the wtc is determined from subtracting atc and dtc from the downscaled mw lst and then optimized by using a sliding window convolution strategy the accuracy of this integrated tir mw lst product is 1 29 1 71 k the spatial resolution is 1 km in this study the 1 km all weather lst for the year 2014 was used and resampled to a resolution of 0 01 using a nearest neighbor resampling method 2 2 2 auxiliary satellite data in order to feed the downscaling procedures a range of auxiliary satellite data sets are required the global land surface

all auxiliary products such as glass fvc lai and albedo mcd12q1 and gtopo30 were resampled to a longitude latitude projection with a resolution of 0 01 using a nearest neighbor resampling method to match the projection of microwave based sm product whose resolution is 0 25 2 2 3 in situ soil moisture measurements the in situ measurements used in this study were selected from four networks namely the upper reach of heihe river basin uhrb li et al 2013 liu et al 2018b naqu yang 2013 maqu and ngari su et al 2011 table 1 lists basic information about these four networks more details can be found in fig 1 and the literature listed above in this study we assumed homogeneity of these 74 sites and that a single site value is representative for the mean value of a 0 01 pixel standard deviations were calculated based on dem to represent the heterogeneity of these four networks results show uhrb and ngari 347 6 m and 380 9 m have higher heterogeneity than maqu and naqu 151 6 m and 169 9 m 3 methodology 3 1 spatial soil moisture downscaling predictor sm downscaling predictors used in this study include lst fvc lai albedo soil evaporation efficiency see latitude longitude and day or the year doy from five aspects denoting energy vegetation dry wet condition geographic location and time information respectively the see is defined as the actual to potential soil evaporation can be retrieved from lst and fvc based on the method from merlin et al 2012 the calculation formula of see is as follow 1 see t s m a x t s t s m a x t s m i n where t s m a x and t s m i n are the maximum and minimum value of the soil surface temperature over the study area and t s is the soil surface temperature at a given pixel described as follow 2 t s t f v t v 1 f v where t is the lst f v is fvc and t v is the vegetation temperature which can be calculated using the approach proposed by moran et al 1994 it should be noted that a correction for the elevation effects on t has been conducted based on the method proposed by merlin et al 2013 3 t t ori Œ≥ h h lr where t ori is the original lst at a given pixel Œ≥ is the mean lapse rate which is set to 0 006 m h and h lr are the altitude of a pixel 0 01 and the mean altitude within the low resolution 0 25 pixel respectively 3 2 soil moisture downscaling methods five benchmark downscaling methods were compared in this study including a statistical regression based method a physical model based method two machine learning based methods as well as a geostatistical based method 3 2 1 multivariate statistical regression multivariate statistical regression msr refers to the establishment of a statistical relationship between sm and downscaling predictors under low resolution condition microwave pixel scale and then apply this statistical relationship to high resolution condition target scale by using high resolution downscaling predictors to obtain the downscaled sm at high resolution piles et al 2016 the regression method used in this study is stepwise regression the regression function can be described as follow 4 sm a 0 m 1 n a m a m i j 1 n a ij a i a j i j where a 0 is a constant a m and a ij are regression coefficients n is the number of the downscaling predictors used a m a i and a j are downscaling predictors 3 2 2 dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch is an updated version of the algorithms in merlin et al 2009 merlin et al 2010 merlin et al 2008 it aims at downscaling microwave sm from coarse to fine scale based on see given a semi empirical model and a first order taylor series expansion the downscaling algorithm is shown as follow 5 sm hr sm lr s m see lr see hr see lr where sm hr is the downscaled sm at high resolution sm lr is the microwave sm at low resolution s m see lr is the partial derivative of sm relative to see estimated at low resolution see hr and see lr are see at high and low resolution respectively the s m see lr can be calculated from daily sm and see observations the function is described as follows malb√©teau et al 2016 6 s m see lr sm see note that both eqs 5 and 6 are linearfunctions which ensures that the mean value of the downscaled sm at a microwave pixel is equal to the original microwave sm value 3 2 3 random forest the random forest rf approach as proposed by breiman 2001 essentially belongs to a large branch of machine learning methods that uses ensembles the basic idea is to integrate the results of different decision trees through ensemble learning the random denotes the randomization of data rows and variables columns first row sampling is performed with a replacement sampling method this makes sure the input samples of each tree are not the whole samples which makes it relatively less prone to over fitting then column sampling is performed by randomly selecting a number of features m from the population m m m and then select the best feature of m to completely split the samples the forest denotes to the multiple independent decision trees for an input sample n trees will provide n decision results and the rf will specify the most frequent result or choose the average of these n decision results as the final output this method has many advantages without significantly increasing the processing time i e it is insensitive to multivariate colinearity and default values and has a certain anti noise ability and can handle high dimensional data ahmad et al 2017 3 2 4 gaussian process regression gaussian process regression gpr is a non parametric machine learning method that uses gaussian process gp priordistributions to perform the regression analysis it is widely used in the fields of time series analysis image processing and automation control hu and wang 2015 li et al 2015 mihoub et al 2016 it requires fewer parameters to be set than artificial neural networks usually used for low dimensional and small sample regression problems where high accuracies are required the core theory of this algorithm uses the gp which is a collection of multiple gaussian distribution functions used to describe the distribution of data its nature is mainly described by the mean and covariance functions main assumption is that the prior distribution of variable y satisfies the following conditions 7 y n Œº k x x where Œº and k x x are the mean and covariance of y respectively the prior of joint probability distribution between observation variable y and predicted variable y can be described as 8 y y n Œº Œº k x x k x x k x x k x x where Œº and Œº are mean value of y and y x is new input variable samples k x x k x x is covariance between x and x k x x is covariance of x samples gpr is able to use different kernel functions to represent the covariance during the training process in this study the square exponential covariance kernel function was used after getting the prior distribution of y and the joint probability distribution from eq 8 the posterior probability can be calculated based on baye≈õformula therefore the final estimation of f x is performed by 9 p f x f x p f x f x p f x where p f x is the prior distribution of y p f x f x is the joint probability distribution and p f x f x is the posterior probability 3 2 5 area to area regression kriging the area to area regression kriging atark jin et al 2018b downscaling process can be divided into two main parts i building the trend surface by msr eq 4 and getting the residuals by removing trend surface from original microwave sm and ii performing area to area kriging interpolation to the residuals and then add these fine resolution residuals to trend surface to finish the downscaling process by this method the residuals after regression can meet the second order stationary condition and therefore modify the built trend surface after building the trend surface from msr the low resolution regression residuals are constructed by subtracting the trend surface from the microwave sm values then the high resolution residuals can be obtained from the nearby low resolution residuals by 10 r v j h 1 k Œª hj r v h where r v j is the residual to be estimated at a given fine scale pixel v j r v h is the neighboring residuals at coarse scale pixels k is the number of the chosen neighboring coarse scale pixels and Œª hj is the weightcoefficient that can be calculated as follows 11 i 1 k Œª ij c v h v i Œº o j c v h v j h 1 2 k i 1 k Œª ij 1 where c v h v i and c v h v j are area to area covariance Œº o j is the lagrange multiplier finally the resulting high resolution residuals are added to the trend surface to obtain the downscaled sm 3 3 downscaling and methods comparison procedure fig 2 shows the downscaling procedure and comparison of the downscaling methods before the downscaling process all the eight downscaling predictors were resampled to the resolution of 0 01 using a nearest neighbor resampling method see the downscaling predictor of dispatch is calculated from lst and fvc the downscaling predictors of msr and atark are lst fvc lai albedo see longitude and latitude as the models established by rf and gpr are with stronger simulation ability apart from the downscaling predictors used in msr and atark the observation day of year doy is added to ensure the stability of the downscaling relationship it should be noted that the downscaling predictors used in msr atark rf and gpr need to be normalized and a denormalization process is performed after the high resolution sm simulation to get the real downscaled sm after the downscaling procedure the comparison was conducted based on four aspects that is 1 comparison with original microwave sm product in this case is rfsm 2 comparison of the downscaled sm with in situ observations based on single site and spatial correlation 3 inter comparison based on the three cornered hat tch method and statistical metrics and 4 comparison of the spatial feasibility on the whole qtp and a specific area based on spatial patterns and details 3 4 statistical metrics the standard statistical metrics used in this study include correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse unbiased rmse ubrmse and bias given by 12 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 13 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 14 ubrmse i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n 15 bias 1 n i 1 n x i y i where x and y are mean value x i is the estimated value y i is the observed value and n is the size of sample however it is difficult to make a comprehensive quantitative comparison about the advantages and disadvantages of the downscaling method based on the verification results from a single evaluation metric therefore this study used the g down indicator merlin et al 2015 to comprehensively evaluate the downscaling results from three aspects that is efficiency gain g effi precision gain g prec and accuracy gain g accu given by 16 g down g effi g prec g accu 3 17 g effi 1 slope lr 1 slope hr 1 slope lr 1 slope hr 18 g prec 1 r lr 1 r hr 1 r lr 1 r hr 19 g accu bias lr bias hr bias lr bias hr where the subscript lr and hr indicate the statistical metrics on the microwave pixel scale and high resolution scale respectively and slope is the slope of microwave downscaled sm against in situ data 3 5 three cornered hat method as the quantity of in situ data is limited a thorough performance analysis of downscaling methods within the whole qtp is a challenge while the three cornered hat tch method tavella and premoli 1994 can estimate relative uncertainties among several products without prior information independence between the tested products is not necessary if properly constrained a time series can be split into true value and error by 20 x i x true e i i 1 2 n where x i is the ith product time series x true is the true value e i is the error term and n is the total number of the products the differences between the n 1 tested products x i and a randomly selected reference product x r are described as 21 y i r x i x r e i e r i 1 2 n 1 where y is a matrix with n 1 time series if the covariance matrix of y is s c o v y the n n unknown covariance matrix of the individual noises r can be described as 22 s j r j t where j i u i is a n 1 n 1 identity matrix u is a n 1 unit column vector to solve eq 22 galindo and palacio 1999 introduced a constrained minimization function based on kuhn tucker theory the objective function f can be obtained by 23 f r 1 n r nn 1 k 2 i 1 n j 1 n r ij 2 i j where k s n 1 r ij is the elements of r the constraint function g and the initial iteration conditions set as 24 g r 1 n r nn r s k 0 25 r in 0 0 i n r nn 0 1 2 s s u t s 1 u after obtaining the matrix r by minimizing eq 23 the square root of the diagonal values of r denotes the uncertainty of each product the ratio of the uncertainty to the mean value of each product can be considered as relative uncertainty 4 results in this section a comprehensive downscaling methods comparison scheme was used to find out the advantages and disadvantages of each downscaling methods the methods comparison will based on four aspects that is comparison with the original microwave sm product to test the ability on preserving the traits of microwave sm product comparison with in situ measurements to test the relatively true accuracy of each method and its variation in accuracy caused by the downscaling process inter comparison based on tch method to test the spatial reference accuracy of each method and spatial feasibility analysis to test the reliability of spatial trend and spatial detail capturing capability 4 1 comparison of the downscaled with original soil moisture to test the performance of the downscaling methods on preserving the coarse scale traits of the original microwave sm product the downscaling results at a resolution of 0 01 were averaged to 0 25 then the statistical metrics r ubrmse and bias were calculated spatially the results are shown in figs 3 and 4 fig 3 shows that when only considering the ability on preserving the coarse scale traits of the original microwave sm product msr rf and gpr have worse performance on the northwest of the qtp where the land cover is mainly barren or sparsely vegetated according to the r value atark has better performance over these areas originating from the residual correction process but has worse performance at the border as well as south central of the qtp caused by the complex varied topography dispatch performs best among the five downscaling methods and the downscaling result is highly correlated with the original sm product over the whole qtp as shown in the second column of fig 3 according to the ubrmse value rf and gpr show similar spatial distribution both of them have lower ubrmse over the whole qtp both two statistical regression methods msr and atark also have similar spatial distribution with higher ubrmse than rf and gpr but atark has smoother spatial pattern than msr again dispatch has the lowest ubrmse value over the whole qtp also performs the best among the five methods the third column of fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the bias results indicate that the bias of dispatch is almost zero over the whole qtp meaning the dispatch is the only unbiased downscaling method in this study gpr has better performance than rf especially on the south and southwest of qtp the bias distribution of msr and atark is opposite and around water bodies msr tends to underestimate and atark tends to overestimate fig 4 shows the value domain of these statistical metrics over the whole qtp according to the r value dispatch performs the best followed by atark gpr rf and msr from the ubrmse dispatch also performs the best followed by gpr rf msr and atark from the bias dispatch almost has zero bias value followed by gpr rf msr and atark which is consistent with the results of ubrmse 4 2 comparison of downscaled and in situ soil moisture to evaluate the performance of the downscaling methods the downscaling results were compared with the in situ sm data at the 0 01 scale at four networks totally 74 sites during the unfrozen season from april 1st to september 30th in addition the validation of the rfsm against in situ sm observations is performed at the 0 25 scale at all 74 sites the spatial plots of the downscaling results around four networks are shown in appendix fig a 1 the verification results are shown in appendix 1 and appendix 2 where r rmse ubrmse bias and g down are calculated separately fig 5 and table 2 show the violin plots as well as the mean value of the of the validation results over the all 74 sites the distribution of the correlation coefficient of atark is most similar to rfsm with very close mean value first and third quartile and median 0 555 to 0 546 which means the atark method can capture the temporal variation of the rfsm well followed by dispatch rf gpr and msr 0 479 0 472 0 469 and 0 445 respectively for the rmse value the distribution patterns of dispatch rf and gpr are more similar to rfsm with majority of the rmse located near 0 1 m3 m3 while as shown in table 2 dispatch and rf has lower mean value than gpr 0 118 m3 m3 0 117 m3 m3 and 0 121 m3 m3 respectively followed by atark and msr 0 129 m3 m3 and 0 137 m3 m3 meanwhile the msr has a wider value range which means it has lower stability over different sites according to rmse note that all these five downscaling results lead to a small increase of the rmse compared to rfsm whose mean value is 0 112 m3 m3 based on ubrmse msr performs best 0 051 m3 m3 followed by rf gpr dispatch and atark 0 058 m3 m3 0 063 m3 m3 0 068 m3 m3 0 086 m3 m3 respectively based on the bias evaluation the ranking is atark dispatch rf gpr and msr 0 014 m3 m3 0 069 m3 m3 0 081 m3 m3 0 083 m3 m3 and 0 119 m3 m3 respectively the highest bias value and lowest ubrmse value of msr show that this method usually has stable downscaling results and the main error bias is from its limited fitting capacity atark is just the opposite usually with unstable downscaling results caused by the residual interpolation process but this process can also reduce the bias when compared with in situ data as an unbiased downscaling method dispatch has the closest bias value with its origin rfsm msr usually has a narrow violin indicating that this method is unstable when applied to different areas note that these conclusions do not directly support the comparison results between the rfsm and downscaled sm as shown in figs 3 and 4 meaning that to some extent the ability of transferring the accuracy of the original microwave sm product could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results for example although the msr has worse performance regarding ubrmse when compared with rfsm it has the best performance when compared with in situ observed sm 0 051 m3 m3 in addition dispatch performs better than atark on r when compared with rfsm while atark has the highest r value 0 555 when compared with in situ observed sm even better than rfsm when comparing at different networks msr has worse r performance at uhrb maqu and ngari while at naqu where the land cover is homogeneous grassland as shown in fig 1 msr shows highest r it also shows low ubrmse and high bias at all four networks atark has highest r at all four networks indicating the residual processing strategy is useful for capturing a higher portion of sm temporal changes information but usually introduce larger bias and fluctuation rf and gpr have lower rmse and ubrmse at naqu but rf performs better than gpr at all four networks based on rmse and ubrmse as well as lowest rmse at naqu and ngari according to g down shown in table 2 from the view of all four networks there are only 28 4 32 4 41 9 43 2 and 44 6 of the sites with positive g down values for msr dispatch rf gpr and atark respectively this implies a negative effect of the downscaling process to the sm accuracy this phenomenon is more obvious over heterogeneous land surface like uhrb and maqu at naqu however rf and gpr show more than 50 percent of positive g down msr dispatch and atark also show higher proportion of positive values indicating that downscaling over homogeneous land surface could be more likely to keep the accuracy of rfsm or even improve the accuracy to further test the temporal stability of the downscaling methods the temporal course of the spatial correlation rspatial is plotted in fig 6 the results show that rspatial of rfsm changes dramatically during the seasons with precipitation in april when the soil on qtp are not fully thawed and ponding water might cover the soil the spatial surface sm cannot be captured adequately then rspatial increases until summer and the spatial patterns are adequately represented later in summer and autumn sm variability decreases with the increase of sm thus resulting in the decline of rspatial the large noise of rspatial could be resulted from the possibility that topography variations land cover changes and precipitation cannot be detected in a 0 25 microwave pixel but could be detected by some in situ sites while this seasonal trend is more obvious in the sm downscaling results when the whole qtp is dry or wet the low sm variability leads to lower spatial correlations between downscaled sm and in situ networks the spatial correlation is highest during moderate sm conditions with highest sm variability zhao et al 2013 an extensive precipitation event in summer and autumn reduces the spatial correlation rspatial 4 3 inter comparison of downscaling results considering that the direct comparison is limited by the quality and quantity of the in situ sm measurement it is difficult to indicate the overall performance of the downscaling methods over the entire qtp therefore the three cornered hat tch method was used in this study to compare the spatial distribution of the uncertainty between the five downscaling methods in addition an inter comparison between the downscaling results is also performed by calculating r and rmse between each two methods the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 it can be seen from fig 7 that the high uncertainty of dispatch is mainly concentrated on the boundary of microwave pixels with strong sm variability and around high sm areas in addition high uncertainty also appears close to water bodies where higher sm values appear as well as forest land cover in the southern part of the qtp both rf and gpr have high uncertainty in the eastern part and around the qinghai lake in the northeast of the qtp gpr has higher uncertainty than rf in the forested southern part of the qtp msr and atark both based on statistical regression have similar uncertainty spatial distribution both results show higher uncertainty over high sm area around water bodies and wetlands in the eastern part and hinterland of the qtp generally atark exhibits higher uncertainty than msr especially on the northeastern qtp and the grassland in the central part as well as forest in the south of the qtp fig 7 also shows the spatial distribution of the downscaling results with minimum uncertainty where gpr performs best in 33 2 of the qtp area followed by rf 29 5 dispatch 28 4 msr 8 1 and atark 0 8 fig 8 presents the inter comparison between each two methods results show that dispatch rf and gpr have high correlation with higher r values from 0 81 to 0 85 and lower rmse values lower than 0 04 m3 m3 msr performs worse with r lower than 0 8 0 66 0 73 and 0 51 and rmse higher than 0 04 m3 m3 0 049 m3 m3 0 042 m3 m3 0 081 m3 m3 against dispatch gpr and atark while although has similar r values as msr atark performs worst with the highest rmse higher than 0 05 m3 m3 as compared to other methods note that the correlation between msr and atark is the lowest even though they all based on polynomial fitting and used the same downscaling predictors the reason could be attributed to the residual interpolation process of atark compared to rf and gpr although dispatch is downscaled from see while rf and gpr are downscaled from lst fvc lai albedo see longitude latitude and doy they still have high correlation this might be caused by the fact that dispatch have high ability on preserving the accuracy and spatial pattern of rfsm and machine learning methods have strong simulation ability another reason could be attributed to the high representativeness of lst to sm long et al 2019 but this should be considered carefully as the ability of msr to capture the high dynamics of sm over the qtp is limited by its linear model this fitting performance difference would induce the weaker correlation between msr and rf gpr atark exhibits a higher bias than other methods when compared with rfsm fig 3 therefore in this inter comparison it performs worst this phenomenon is similar to the direct comparison results against in situ data in table 2 where dispatch rf and gpr have similar performance and msr performs worst while atark performs best regarding r and bias this is also consistent with the results shown in fig 7 based on tch method that is dispatch rf and gpr have similar uncertainty msr has high uncertainty in some specific areas and atark has the highest uncertainty over most area of the qtp note that direct comparison against in situ data and inter comparison tch focus on two different aspects respectively the first one validates the relatively true accuracy of a remote sensing product against ground based relatively true value the second one validates the relative reference accuracy between several products when there is no in situ data available that is to say this inter comparison only tests the consistency of a product against other products in time series so the inter comparison results can just be used as a reference not the true accuracy when both the direct comparison and inter comparison are available in one pixel in this case is a 0 01 pixel we should be more inclined to the first comparison results 4 4 spatial feasibility of the downscaled soil moisture in order to analyze the feasibility of the spatial distribution of the downscaling results figs 9 and 10 compare the downscaling results with rfsm over the whole qtp and a specific area on the unfrozen season as shown in fig 9 all five methods can capture the temporal changes of rfsm and dispatch gpr as well as rf are consistently better capturing the spatial patterns of rfsm over the whole qtp considering that dispatch is an unbiased downscaling method its ability to restore the spatial pattern of the original microwave product is the strongest but because of the pixel by pixel downscaling process despite a sliding window method is used the mosaic effect is still relatively serious as shown in fig 9 while rf to a certain extent has a stronger smoothing effect than dispatch on the spatial trend due to the latitude longitude information used in downscaling predictors are at a low resolution and the fact that rf cannot predict values out of range of training sets the new inputted fine scale latitude longitude information therefore would probably lead the predicted fine scale sm to nearest coarse scale pixels sm values hence the mosaic effect of downscaling results appears but this phenomenon mainly occurs in areas with strong sm gradients so that there is basically no mosaic phenomenon in areas with stable sm compared with rf the spatial distribution of gpr is less affected by mosaic effect in some sm variable areas and is not as smooth as rf in sm stable areas but on the whole there is a high degree of consistency with rf msr has a good response in the forest area only in the southeastern qtp but in other regions of qtp its downscaling results lose the spatial details of sm that is the spatial distribution is too smooth especially in areas with large gradients of sm in contrast atark underestimates sm in dry areas and overestimates sm in wet areas which strengthens the spatial comparison of sm and highlights the sm spatial characteristics of qtp this is because during the residual interpolation process the residual of the high resolution target pixels is affected by the surrounding high absolute value residuals thus overestimating the residuals and after these overestimated residuals are added to the regression trend surface the overcorrecting phenomenon appears fig 10 shows spatial details of the downscaling results over a specific area all results except msr can keep the spatial pattern of rfsm well while in the southwestern river valley dispatch shows lower sm which indicates the possibly wrong see spatial pattern in this area and that one downscaling predictor alone is not sufficient to represent spatial pattern and details on complex land surface atark performs better by both providing spatial pattern from rfsm and spatial details from downscaling predictors than dispatch msr although can provide spatial details around the river valley it weakens the spatial pattern of rfsm comparing with rf whose spatial pattern is smooth gpr can provide more spatial details both in southwestern low sm areas and northeastern high sm areas 5 discussion 5 1 downscaling algorithms and scale effects based on the performance of the five downscaling results on preserving the coarse scale traits of the original microwave product in section 4 1 the reasonable order of performance is dispatch gpr rf atark and msr this result is related to the scale effect introduced from their downscaling algorithm scaling of environmental states and processes is a key issue in remote sensing research and scale effects need to be considered in remote sensing analyses the scale effects in this downscaling process mainly originate from two topics 1 when the downscaling predictors were aggregated to low resolution the scale effect caused by the nonlinearity on the retrieval process of the downscaling predictors this kind of scale effect exists in all five downscaling methods it has no influences on the methods comparison results so we will focus on the second one 2 the scale effect of the model that is whether the downscaling model established on one scale is applicable to another scale this kind of scale effect is related to the linear or nonlinear degree of the downscaling model i e if the model is linear there is no scale effect and if the model is nonlinear and the same model is applied at different scale the results will be different and the extent of differences is related to the heterogeneity of the underlying surface and the degree of nonlinearity of the model among the five downscaling algorithms only the dispatch is a linear model there is no scale effect of the model so there will be no differences when changing the order of processing steps i e no difference between averaged first and then inverted i e averaging the high resolution downscaling predictors to low resolution and then the low resolution sm is inverted which corresponds to the downscaling process of establishing the relationship between sm and downscaling predictors at low resolution and inverted first and then averaged i e inverting the high resolution sm from the high resolution downscaling predictors and then the high resolution sm is averaged to low resolution which corresponds to the validating process of averaging the downscaling results to low resolution the pixel by pixel downscaling combined with its linear model results in an unbiased downscaling method dispatch therefore it performs best among the five downscaling methods by preserving the traits of the original microwave sm product as well as the smallest scale effect the other four downscaling algorithms are nonlinear so there is a significant scale effect during the model application the models established by rf and gpr are discrete combined with latitude and longitude information they can respond well to high and low sm conditions however the models established by msr and atark are continuous which leads to the failure of the continuous model on obtaining reliable fitting results in areas with large sm variability resulting in large deviation in the downscaling results especially around water bodies while during the residual interpolation process in atark as mentioned in section 4 4 the smoothing or the weaker fitting ability of the linear regression model leads to higher coarse scale residuals especially over water bodies therefore the fine scale residuals are still higher after interpolation these higher residuals as well as the spatially smoothing effect of the interpolation process lead to the overcorrection of the msr bias as shown in the bias spatial distribution results in fig 3 5 2 deterioration effects during downscaling the results in section 4 2 show all the five downscaling results have a decline of the accuracy than rfsm with a negative g down over more than 50 sites msr 71 6 dispatch 67 6 rf 58 1 gpr 56 8 and atark 55 4 which is contrary to the results of merlin et al 2015 and malb√©teau et al 2016 in order to investigate this phenomenon in more detail the bar plots in fig 11 show the performance of g down and also its three components namely g effi g prec and g accu from slope r and bias differences before and after the downscaling first for g down msr performs worst resulting from the bad performance of g effi and g accu with 75 68 and 77 03 negative values while it has a better g prec indicating that msr results have worse slope and bias than rfsm over most sites but with a relative better r performance than other methods for dispatch the 67 57 negative g down may result from the bad performance of g prec implying a decline of r when against rfsm the two machine learning methods rf and gpr have similar performance in g prec and g accu as well as g down while gpr performs better in g effi with less negative values 41 89 atark however has the best g down performance caused by its good performance of the all three component indices this accuracy decline phenomenon during downscaling is similar to the direct comparison results against in situ data shown in section 4 2 where atark performs best followed by dispatch rf gpr and msr considering r and bias but there are still differences for example msr has the worst r value 0 445 in table 2 while it performs better in g prec therefore fig 12 was plotted to test the changes of g effi g prec and g accu with the different combinations of high resolution and low resolution statistical matrix values the results indicated that these indices are suitable for single site comparison but not suitable for a comprehensive comparison over several sites even the same g effi g prec and g accu values imply different magnitudes of increase or decline of the downscaling results performances as compared to different original microwave product performances thus the sign of these indices is more meaningful than the absolute value itself when considering the validation results from different sites therefore the mismatch of the worst r performance and the best g prec performance could be explained by this different potential meaning of the g prec value that is some positive g prec values may indicate a low increase of the r over a site while some negative values could indicate a huge decline of the r over other sites in total this g down index is useful when comparing the downscaling results with the original microwave sm product but should be used carefully when there is not a strong positive or negative trend over most sites but the question is still why there is a negative effect of the downscaling process in this study this could result from the spatial mismatch at the fine scale resolution which is expected to be larger sabaghy et al 2020 van der velde et al 2012 and also the fact that original microwave products often have higher correlation with the temporally dynamic changes of the observed sm while the downscaling results have a potential to provide more spatial details and perhaps reflect more patterns about the downscaling predictors gruber et al 2020 peng et al 2016 although the downscaling predictors could provide more information than the original microwave sm product itself they could also introduce errors to the downscaling process 5 3 the impact of land cover land cover as an important factor which can reflect and influence sm spatial distribution it was analyzed here to further elaborate on the tch results in section 4 3 the variation of tch uncertainties corresponding to land cover changes from latitude and longitude direction are shown in fig 13 msr and atark usually have higher uncertainties than dispatch rf and gpr both from latitude and longitude direction their uncertainties change with the percentage of vegetated land cover the blue part in fig 13 while although the uncertainties of dispatch rf and gpr increase too their changes are gradual which indicate that statistical regression based methods msr and atark perform worse when the sm variability increases as the percentage of vegetated land cover increases for example on the longitude direction and around 101 104 e where the percentage of vegetated land cover increases the uncertainties of msr and atark increase sharply while the uncertainties of dispatch rf and gpr remain steady or even decline slightly this phenomenon could be explained by figs 3 and 9 which show a high positive bias value of msr and a high negative bias value of atark on the east part of qtp when compared with rfsm dispatch downscales sm in a window around the target pixel so the performance is stable over the whole qtp except for highly vegetated areas around 26 5 n this results from the weaker correlation between see and sm there malb√©teau et al 2016 machine learning based methods rf and gpr due to their model nonlinearity and flexibility can capture the sm changes over high variability areas and therefore also preserve a relatively stable uncertainty the violin plots and circle charts in figs 14 and 15 show that for barren land and sparsely vegetated land cover dispatch usually has minimum uncertainty followed by gpr rf msr and atark the pie graph indicates that dispatch has the minimum uncertainty in 40 2 of this land cover followed by gpr rf msr and atark 38 3 16 9 4 2 0 4 respectively under grassland rf has the minimum uncertainties followed by dispatch gpr msr and atark rf and gpr have the minimum uncertainty in 35 2 and 33 5 areas of grassland followed by dispatch msr and atark 22 8 7 9 0 6 respectively under forest rf also has the minimum uncertainty followed by dispatch gpr msr and atark rf has the minimum uncertainty in 43 area of the forest land cover followed by dispatch gpr msr and atark 26 9 15 11 3 3 8 respectively 5 4 synopsis of validation to perform a comprehensive comparison and to summarize the characteristics of each downscaling method a ranked radar chart is plotted in fig 16 among the five downscaling methods dispatch as an unbiased method caused by its linear downscaling model and pixel by pixel downscaling strategy has the best performance on preserving the coarse scale spatial distribution pattern and accuracy of rfsm followed by gpr and rf while msr and atark perform the worst resulting from the limited fitting ability of linear statistical regression model and the overcorrection phenomenon of the residual interpolation process in atark when compared with in situ measurements atark however performs best with the highest correlation even better than rfsm 0 555 to 0 546 followed by rf dispatch gpr and msr which indicates the positive effects of the residual processing strategy in atark and the fact that high consistency with original microwave sm product to some extent could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results when considering the g down metric the downscaling process has a negative effect at most sites about 71 6 67 6 58 1 56 8 and 55 4 for msr dispatch rf gpr and atark respectively this negative effect of downscaling could be explained by the spatial mismatch and the trend that downscaling results usually represent the spatial distribution of the downscaling predictors not the temporal changes of sm from the original microwave product besides this negative effect tends to be higher over heterogeneous land surface based on inter comparison results rf and gpr performs better with lower uncertainty spatially and rf is better than gpr over grassland and forest land cover dispatch has medium uncertainty and performs best over barren land or sparsely vegetated land cover as the correlation of see and sm is stronger over arid areas msr and atark have high uncertainty spatially and atark performs worst with high uncertainty resulted from the large deviation against other methods considering the spatial feasibility although showing highest sm variation spatially caused by the overcorrection phenomenon of the residual interpolation process atark can keep the spatial pattern of rfsm well and can provide more spatial details dispatch performs best with most similar spatial pattern as original microwave sm product while suffers from mosaic effects and can provide wrong sm pattern over complex land surface due to that see alone is not sufficient to represent sm spatial patterns gpr performs better than rf both in spatial patterns and details msr shows smoothest spatial pattern thus misses spatial details to a large degree 6 summary and conclusions in this study sm downscaling was performed over qtp by five methods namely msr dispatch rf gpr and atark to increase the spatial resolution of the original rfsm product from 0 25 to 0 01 the downscaling results were analyzed regarding four aspects that is comparison with the original microwave sm product comparison with in situ measurements inter comparison between each other and spatial feasibility analysis due to the linear model and pixel by pixel downscaling strategy dispatch is an unbiased downscaling method with the highest ability of preserving the coarse scale traits of microwave sm product while to some extent this ability could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results as it cannot make full use of extra information from ancillary data and usually will induce a mosaiced spatial pattern meanwhile see alone is not sufficient to represent sm variations over complex land surface machine learning methods rf and gpr perform stable in all four comparison results due to their high ability to capture nonlinear processes but they also provide a smoother spatial pattern rf has lowest uncertainty over grassland and forest land cover while it performs worse than gpr over barren land and sparsely vegetated land cover dispatch however performs best over these land covers caused by the stronger correlation of see and sm over arid areas the linear regression model of msr is not suitable for downscaling on complex land surface resulting in the low accuracy of downscaling results and missing of spatial details while over homogeneous land surface its downscaling results could capture sm temporal variation well atark has the highest uncertainty and large sm variation over most area of qtp caused by the overcorrection phenomenon of its residual interpolation process however it can also slightly improve the correlation r of the downscaling results and correct the bias when compared against in situ measurements as well as provide more feasible spatial patterns and details the availability of g down in downscaling results comparison is also discussed in this study as this index is suitable for the comparison before and after the downscaling for a single site and a single method it is not very useful to the comprehensive comparison on several sites therefore we recommended to use this index carefully and as an independent indicator from the statistic results based on g down accuracy decreasing is detected in all five downscaling methods which may be caused by the spatial mismatch on fine scale and the fact that downscaling results tend to preserve spatial traits of downscaling predictors while to some extent miss the temporal changes of microwave sm product in general this phenomenon is more likely to happen over complex land surface structures in conclusion dispatch is suitable for downscaling over arid regions and is not suitable for downscaling over high vegetated regions meanwhile when the original microwave sm product is reliable its downscaled result will also have higher reliability msr and atark are good at showing spatial trend and when high accuracy downscaled sm is needed atark will be a good choice machine learning is a compromised downscaling method without distinctive advantages and disadvantages it performs stably in all aspects taken together among these five methods atark has larger upside potential as its residual interpolation process can improve the downscaled accuracy if we can properly improve the fitting ability of the statistical regression model atark will have better downscaled results and the overcorrection phenomenon will be relieved credit authorship contribution statement yuquan qu conceptualization

5041,drylands are the homes to over one third of the world s population and are vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change based on climate projections recent studies reported a substantial expansion of global drylands in the coming decades and attributed that expansion to future warming however the expansion of drylands contradicts a widespread vegetation greening and a slight runoff increase in dryland ecosystems in the same climate models here we re examine changes in global drylands for the coming century and at two future warming targets 1 5 c and 2 c warming relative to the preindustrial level based on outputs of climate models who participated in the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 in addition to aridity index ai that has been widely used to measure the atmospheric aridity we also assess changes in drylands from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives using runoff q and leaf area index lai as indicators respectively our results show that when the impact of elevated atmospheric co2 concentration co2 on vegetation water consumption is considered in the estimation of potential evapotranspiration e p and ai the expansion of atmospheric drylands is at a much slower rate 0 16 per decade under rcp4 5 and 0 30 per decade under rcp8 5 than previously reported moreover the additional 0 5 c warming does not lead to an evident further expansion of atmospheric drylands in terms of hydrologic and agro ecological drylands both of them show significant shrinks over the coming decades suggesting reduced hydrologic and agro ecological aridity in the region finally contrasting with previous perceptions our results demonstrate that warming only plays a minor role in altering global drylands from all three perspectives increases in net radiation are primarily responsible for the expansion of atmospheric drylands and increases in p and co2 induced increases in vegetation water use efficiency are the key drivers of changes in hydrologic and agro ecological drylands keywords dryland global warming atmospheric aridity hydrologic aridity agro ecological aridity 1 introduction drylands occupy about 45 of the earth s terrestrial surfaces prƒÉvƒÉlie 2016 and are homes to more than one third of the global population feng and fu 2013 due to the great water scarcity and low vegetation coverage dryland ecosystems are especially vulnerable and sensitive to external disturbances such as climate change and human interventions reynolds et al 2007 reed et al 2012 middleton and sternberg 2013 wu et al 2016 berdugo et al 2020 quantification of changes in global drylands under climate change is thus essential for understanding the impacts of external disturbances on global dryland ecosystems and for developing relevant adaptation strategies nicholson 2011 reynolds et al 2007 traditionally drylands are defined based on climate aridity index ai which is calculated as the ratio of long term precipitation p over potential evapotranspiration e p the basic idea underlying ai is that p measures the atmospheric water supply and e p measures the atmospheric water demand with the ratio of p e p measuring how well the supply can meet the demand roderick et al 2015 lin et al 2018 over a climatological period e g typically 30 years when the ratio of p e p is smaller than 0 65 which indicates an evident atmospheric water scarcity the corresponding areas are defined as drylands gao and giorgi 2008 mortimore 2009 he et al 2019 by adopting this approach many studies have assessed changes in global dryland extent under various future climate scenarios and concluded a substantial expansion of global drylands in a warmer future feng and fu 2013 cook et al 2014 huang et al 2016 sun et al 2017 wei et al 2019 for example using ai forced with climate projections from the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 feng and fu 2013 estimated a dryland expansion of 10 and 4 by the end of the 21st century relative to the 1961 1990 baseline under representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 high emission scenario and 4 5 medium emission scenario respectively the reason underlying this reported drylands expansion is that the warming induced enhancement of e p greatly outweighs the increase of p leading to a decreased ai with more areas having an ai value lower than 0 65 in future climate scenarios additionally park et al 2018 further reported that significant aridification would emerge at about 10 rcp8 5 and 8 rcp4 5 of the global land area at the 1 5 c warming target and the corresponding numbers would increase to 32 rcp4 5 and 24 rcp8 5 at the 2 c warming target stressing the predominant role of warming on the expansion of global drylands however the ai based assessments of dryland changes have been considerably criticized for two reasons first ai was originally developed to assess spatial differences in aridity at a given instant of time barrow 1992 hulme 1996 using ai to assess aridity changes over time involves an important assumption that space and time are substitutable however the traditional approach of calculating ai in particular e p does not account for the variation of atmospheric co2 concentration co2 that ultimately drives climate change and introduces an additional source of variation not represent in spatial ai comparisons roderick et al 2015 consequently ignoring changes in co2 in the calculation of ai invalidates the space for time substitution assumption greve et al 2019 second and more fundamentally the conclusion of expanding drylands under warming using ai based approaches contradicts with persistent vegetation greening and a slight increase of surface runoff in ai defined global dryland regions projected by the same climate models alkama et al 2013 zeng et al 2016 yang et al 2018 aridity is a multidimensional issue greve and seneviratne 2015 roderick et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 despite ai that measures aridity from an atmospheric perspective surface vegetation and runoff quantify aridity respectively from the agro ecological and hydrologic perspectives that are more directly relevant to human needs cook et al 2014 milly and dunne 2016 roderick et al 2015 the projected vegetation greening and increased runoff indeed indicate reduced agro ecological aridity and hydrological aridity under warming which challenges the ai based assessments of future dryland changes with the issues mentioned above the current study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of global dryland changes from multiple perspectives under different future climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and at different levels of future warming 1 5 c and 2 c in particular to assess dryland changes from an atmospheric perspective we calculate e p using an updated penman monteith equation that explicitly acknowledges the impact of rising co2 on vegetation water use embedded in climate models and to assess dryland changes from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives we rely on direct outputs of surface runoff q and leaf area index lai from climate models this approach ensures that the estimated dryland changes essentially follow the cmip5 model projections yang et al 2020 2 methods and data 2 1 method 2 1 1 definitions of global drylands drylands are traditionally defined as regions where ai is smaller than 0 65 hulme 1996 gao and giorgi 2008 which can be further divided into four subtypes including i sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 ii semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 iii arid 0 05 ai 0 2 and iv hyper arid ai 0 05 here we follow this definition to determine drylands from the atmospheric perspective to determine drylands from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives the thresholds of q and lai for determining the four dryland subtypes were quantified using a frequency percentage approach because both q and lai are positively correlated with ai across space i e q and lai are generally small in regions with low ai and vice versa supplementary fig s1 we applied the same historical 1986 2005 ai threshold correspondent communitive frequency to historical q and lai communitive frequency distributions and to find the corresponding q and lai thresholds fig 1 this approach ensures the same areas of dryland and its subtypes from the three perspectives during the historical period additionally we focused our analysis in regions below 60 on to avoid dealing with frozen water and low temperature effect on vegetation growth feng and fu 2013 park et al 2018 2 1 2 determination of the timing of 1 5 c and 2 c warming targets to demonstrate the impacts of warming on dryland changes we assessed changes in global drylands from all three perspectives at two future warming targets 1 5 c and 2 c these two warming targets are also the two key warming targets set in the paris agreement on climate change and has been extensively investigated in the literature huang et al 2017 osima et al 2018 park et al 2018 shi et al 2018 wei et al 2019 miao et al 2020 yang et al 2020 here we determined the timing when the warming targets t 1 5 and t 2 are reached in each of the cmip5 models using the direct model output of near surface air temperature t a and the method widely used in previous studies huang et al 2016 park et al 2018 in more detail we firstly selected 1986 2005 as the reference periods representing the current climate park et al 2018 since the global mean t a for 1986 2005 is about 0 6 c higher than the pre industrial level schleussner et al 2016 hawkins et al 2017 t 1 5 and t 2 were identified as the time when global annual mean t a reaches 0 9 c and 1 4 c above that of 1986 2005 respectively a 20 year equal weight running mean filter was applied to the global mean annual t a series to remove the interannual variability in annual t a and each 20 year moving average is indexed to its final year the timing that each cmip5 model reaching the 1 5 c and 2 c warming targets are summarized in supplementary table s1 2 1 3 calculation of potential evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration e p was calculated using a modified penman monteith equation that explicitly

models participated in cmip5 under both historical 1861 2005 and future 2006 2100 scenarios were acquired from https esgfnode llnl gov search cmip5 supplementary table s2 two future climate change scenarios were considered including the medium emission scenario rcp4 5 and high emission scenario rcp8 5 taylor et al 2012 we use the first realization r1i1p1 of the historical and rcp scenario simulations in all cmip5 models the selected 16 cmip5 models provide all the required meteorological variables and runoff data however only 13 out of the 16 models reported lai estimates so the lai related analyses were performed using lai outputs from these 13 cmip5 models supplementary table s2 all data were resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 1 by using the first order conservative remapping scheme jones 1999 3 results 3 1 historical global dryland distributions from multiple perspectives global drylands are determined using ai q and lai which characterize drylands from the atmospheric hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives respectively by comparing the spatial coverages of the three variables during the historical period 1986 2005 the thresholds for the hydrologic and agro ecological drylands are 154 2 mm yr 1 and 2 0 respectively these are very close to the thresholds determined from the direct correlations between ai and q or lai supplementary fig s1 nevertheless as described in section 2 1 1 the frequency percentage approach adopted herein has an advantage that the determined drylands from different perspectives cover the same areas during the historical period i e 6 7 107 km2 which provides the same reference value for assessing dryland area changes from different perspectives and hence are used in the following analyses the thresholds of ai q and lai for global drylands and their subtypes are summarized in table 1 based on thresholds in table 1 the spatial distributions of global drylands and their subtypes for the historical period from different perspectives are shown in fig 2 in general the spatial patterns of global drylands and their subtypes determined from the three metrics are in a very good agreement drylands determined from the modified ai based approach cover central and southwestern north america southern south america northern and southern africa middle east central asia and australia which are consistent with previous findings e g feng and fu 2013 and are also satisfactorily captured by the q and lai based approaches fig 2b and c this result demonstrates the predominant role of climate in controlling the spatial patterns of hydrology and vegetation across the global terrestrial environments that have been well documented in the literature e g budyko 1974 yang et al 2015 3 2 global drylands change in future climate scenarios time series of relative changes in global dryland areas during 2006 2100 from the three perspectives relative to the 1986 2005 baseline are illustrated in fig 3 results show that global drylands from the three aspects exhibit contrasting changes for the coming century with drylands from the atmospheric perspective showing an expanding trend and those from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives showing decreasing trends in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios specifically the ensemble of the 16 cmip5 models projects an increasing atmospheric dryland extent at a rate of 0 16 per decade ranges between 0 25 and 0 52 per decades in individual models and 0 30 per decade ranges between 0 21 and 1 06 per decade under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 3a and supplementary table s3 by contrast the hydrological dryland experiences a slightly decreasing trend in the coming century at a rate of 0 07 per decade ranges between 0 26 and 0 19 per decade and 0 21 per decades ranges between 0 47 and 0 22 per decade under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 3b and supplementary table s3 nevertheless relatively large uncertainty and interannual variabilities are found in the dryland changes among cmip5 models from the atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives supplementary fig s2 for the 16 models used herein 13 and 10 of them show an increasing atmospheric dryland area and the increasing trend is statistically significant at the 99 confidence level in only 7 and 10 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively supplementary table s3 regarding hydrologic dryland the decreasing trend based on the multi model ensemble is respectively detected in 10 and 9 models significant in 3 and 8 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 table s2 in comparison the reduction of the agro ecological dryland area 0 98 and 1 36 per decade under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 is more consistent among models and shows a much smaller interannual variability fig 3c and supplementary table s3 for the 13 out of 16 models that report lai only one model miroc5 projects a very minor expansion of agro ecological drylands at 0 02 and 0 07 per decade under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively while the other 12 models consistently project a significant at the 99 confidence level decreasing trend of the agro ecological dryland area towards the end of the 21st century in terms of dryland subtypes the overall expansion of atmospheric drylands is largely driven by the expansion of arid and semi arid regions under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 4 d and g relative to the 1986 2005 baseline arid and semi arid areas from the atmospheric perspective increase by 1 98 and 3 28 under rcp4 5 and 5 26 and 3 27 under rcp8 5 respectively in the last decade of the 21st century the hyper arid areas also show increasing yet non significant at the 99 significant level changes of 0 84 and 2 96 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 4j however changes in sub humid regions are not consistent between the two future climate scenarios for the same period and under rcp4 5 sub humid areas expand by 0 32 whereas under rcp8 5 sub humid areas decrease by 1 79 fig 4a in comparison changes in dryland subtypes from the hydrologic and agro ecological aspects are more consistent between the two future climate scenarios in terms of hydrologic drylands only the arid region shows expansion while the other three dryland subtypes all exhibit shrinks under future climate scenarios fig 4b e h k for agro ecological drylands reductions in dryland areas are detected in all four subtypes with arid and semi arid regions generally showing a more rapid dryland decrease than hyper arid and sub humid regions fig 4c f i l 3 3 global drylands changes under the two warming targets the above results demonstrate significant changes in the global dryland area from all three perspectives in future climate scenarios however the change is only substantial from the agro ecological perspective but relatively small from the atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives fig 3 to further investigate how dryland changes under future warming we subsequently examine dryland changes at two future warming targets i e 1 5 c and 2 c over the preindustrial level moreover only results under rcp8 5 are presented in the following text as those under rcp4 5 supplementary fig s3 and fig s4 are essentially the same with rcp8 5 and the key difference between the two scenarios is that the two future warming targets occur in different future periods sooner in rcp8 5 and later in rcp4 5 table s1 changes in global drylands and their subtypes from all three perspectives under the two future warming targets i e t 1 5 and t 2 are illustrated in figs 5 and 6 compared with the 1986 2005 baseline the atmospheric dryland shows a small expansion of 1 20 ranges between 1 03 and 3 57 in individual models at t 1 5 which is driven by small expansions of all dryland subtypes fig 5a that mainly occur in central canada the brazilian highlands and central euro asia fig 6a the hydrologic dryland remains more or less unchanged at t 1 5 0 28 ranging between 2 99 and 2 87 supplementary table s4 which is primarily caused by an evident expansion of the sub humid region central euro asia and the mediterranean regions fig 6a that is largely offset by a decrease of semi arid area the siberia and sahel regions and around the pampas steppe fig 6b fig 5a compared with the small changes in atmospheric and hydrologic drylands the agro ecological dryland exhibits a higher magnitude of change at t 1 5 relative to the 1986 2005 baseline 2 55 ranging between 5 91 and 0 41 this reduction in agro ecological dryland is also found for arid semi arid and sub humid regions however an evident increase of the hyper arid area regarding agro ecology is projected to occur at t 1 5 in the brazilian highlands and southern africa figs 5a and 6c in comparison to t 1 5 a further 0 5 c warming only leads to a very small further expansion of the atmospheric dryland by 0 12 fig 5c correspondingly the atmospheric dryland expands by 1 32 at t 2 relative to the 1986 2005 baseline fig 5b despite the relatively small overall atmospheric dryland expansion with the 0 5 c additional warming an evident expansion of semi arid areas is found at t 2 compared to t 1 5 figs 5c and 6g nevertheless this expansion of semi arid areas is almost entirely offset by the concurrent decrease of sub humid regions leading to an overall small change in the atmospheric dryland between t 2 and t 1 5 an interesting result is found in the change of the hydrologic dryland with an additional 0 5 c warming figs 5c and 6h it is found that a further 0 5 c temperature increase reverses the hydrologic dryland changes from an expansion of 0 28 at t 1 5 to a reduction of 0 49 at t 2 indicating a 0 77 decrease of hydrologic dryland areas with an additional 0 5 c warming this hydrologic dryland decrease is primarily induced by shrinks of hydrologic drylands in hyper arid and arid regions figs 5b c and 6h compared with atmospheric and hydrologic drylands an additional 0 5 c warming has witnessed a larger change of the agro ecological dryland figs 5b c and 6i it is found that the agro ecological dryland shrinks by 4 31 at t 2 compared to the 1986 2005 baseline suggesting a further 1 76 reduction of global agro ecological dryland areas with the additional 0 5 c warming or 1 7 times of reduction compared with that at t 1 5 this further reduction in agro ecological drylands is found in all subtypes of global drylands with the additional 0 5 c warming figs 5c and 6i 4 discussion using climate aridity index many previous studies have assessed changes in global dryland areas and concluded a substantial expansion of global drylands under future warming feng and fu 2013 cook et al 2014 fu and feng 2014 huang et al 2016 2017 for example feng and fu 2013 estimated a dryland expansion of 10 and 4 by the end of the 21st century compared to 1961 1990 under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 respectively however these previous ai based assessments ignored an important response of vegetation to elevated co2 that has been demonstrated to substantially reduce the vegetation water consumption in climate models roderick et al 2015 milly and dunne 2016 with the available energy net radiation only showing little increase in future climate scenarios roderick et al 2014 yang et al 2019 future warming leads to a remarkable increase of the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit d which serves as the primary driver of the enhancement of e p in the traditional penman or penman monteith equations scheff and frierson 2014 nevertheless a recent study demonstrated that the increase of e p induced by the increase of d is nearly entirely offset by the decrease of e p caused by the decrease of surface conductance as a consequence of vegetation responding to elevated co2 in climate model projections yang et al 2019 this suggests that ignoring the impact of elevated co2 on vegetation would overestimate the increase of e p and therefore overestimating the expansion of global drylands based on ai greve et al 2019 here using a modified penman monteith equation that explicitly accounts for the co2 impact on vegetation our estimates of future atmospheric dryland expansion are much smaller than previously reported 1 58 under rcp4 5 and 2 95 under rcp8 5 for modified ai versus 5 27 under rcp4 5 and 14 63 under rcp8 5 using tranditonal ai fig 3a and supplementary table s3 fig s5 it should be noted that the effect of elevated co2 on e p and hence on atmospheric dryland is only strictly valid when vegetation coverage is high yang et al 2019 for sparsely vegetated areas e g drylands the e p model adopted here eq 1 may underestimate the increase of e p and therefore underestimate the expansion of atmospheric drylands this follows that a more reasonable estimate of atmospheric dryland expansion should fall between those with and without considering the co2 effect on the other hand multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that global drylands show the greatest greening trend under elevated co2 donohue et al 2013 2017 norby and zak 2011 fig 3 which suggests that the underestimation of e p increase by eq 1 would eventually become smaller even larger contrasts are found in the dryland changes from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives fig 3 since aridity is a multidimensional problem in addition to ai based atmospheric drylands we also assess changes in drylands from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives based on direct outputs of q and lai from cmip5 models contrasting with the expansion of atmospheric drylands reductions in hydrologic and agro ecological drylands are detected in both future climate scenarios suggesting overall reduced hydrologic and agro ecological aridity in global relatively dry regions the contrasting trends in future dryland changes indicate a decoupling between changes in atmospheric aridity and those in hydrologic and agro ecological aridity mankin et al 2019 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 this is not surprising because atmospheric aridity only measures the balance between water supply and demand in the atmosphere while p is also the external water supply for the terrestrial hydrological and agro ecological systems e p does not measure the actual water consumption on earth but is rather a hypothetical term that quantifies the atmospheric water demand or the actual evapotranspiration e when the surface is not water limited this suggests that e p and e may be more closely coupled when the surface is wet or in more humid regions but can be highly disconnected when the surface is dry or in more arid areas in this regard using ai or any measures that are directly based on e p to assess terrestrial aridity changes is not appropriate previous studies attributed the expansion of global atmospheric drylands to warming cook et al 2014 sherwood and fu 2014 feng and fu 2013 fu and feng 2014 huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 park et al 2018 however our result that the atmospheric dryland only expands by 1 58 2 95 over the next century and an additional 0 5 c warming only lead to very little further expansion of the atmospheric dryland suggest that the impact of warming on atmospheric dryland changes is small figs 3a and 5c as mentioned previously the increase of e p resulted from the warming induced increase of d is largely canceled by the decrease of e p as a result of vegetation responding to elevated co2 which indicates that the overall e p increase is actually not driven by warming and the aerodynamic component of e p combining the fact that p is projected to slightly increase overall global drylands it follows that the expansion of the atmospheric dryland cannot be driven by warming either but only likely by the radiative effect of greenhouse gases that slightly increases net radiation and thus e p this is consistent with recent attribution analyses of e p changes in climate models milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2019 who reported that the e p change over the 21st century is almost entirely driven by changes in net radiation rather than warming in addition warming is unlikely to drive the changes in hydrologic and agro ecological drylands either in global drylands p is often much smaller than e p which means that any increase in p will largely be evaporated to meet the high water demand defined by e p regardless of how e p changes in another word p defines e while the sensitivity of e to changes in e p is very small in dry regions this phenomenon has long been well known in the hydrological community e g roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2018 and again demonstrated by the findings that the hydrologic dryland only exhibits very minor changes yet statistically significant at the 99 confidence level under future climate change herein fig 5 as for vegetation since cold high latitude regions are excluded from our analysis increases in air temperature are not likely to promote vegetation growth in drylands instead the enhanced vegetation growth and consequently reduced agro ecological drylands are more likely to be driven by the increased precipitation or co2 induced increase of vegetation water use efficiency farquhar 1997 donohue et al 2013 2017 swann et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 or some combination thereof 5 conclusion in this study changes in global drylands over the coming century and at two future warming targets from the atmospheric hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives are assessed based on cmip5 model projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios key findings include 1 the atmospheric dryland is projected to expand at a rate of 0 16 per decade rcp4 5 and 0 30 per decade rcp8 5 towards the end of the 21st century nevertheless these estimated expanding trends are much slower than previously reported primarily due to the inclusion of vegetation response to elevated co2 2 both hydrologic and agro ecological drylands show significant decreasing trends over the coming century and decreased extents with an additional 0 5 c warming 1 5 c versus 2 c warming suggesting reduced hydrologic and agro ecological aridity under future warming in global dry regions 3 warming only plays a minor role in regulating future dryland changes the slight increase of the atmospheric dryland is largely caused by the enhanced radiative forcing induced by rising greenhouse gases the reduced hydrologic dryland is mainly a result of increased p and the shrink of agro ecological dryland is primarily credited to the increased p and or enhanced vegetation water use efficiency induced by elevated co2 it is therefore a reasonable conclusion that changes in p and co2 are the two main driving factors of global dryland change whereas the effect of warming is small credit authorship contribution statement cicheng zhang formal analysis writing

5041,drylands are the homes to over one third of the world s population and are vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change based on climate projections recent studies reported a substantial expansion of global drylands in the coming decades and attributed that expansion to future warming however the expansion of drylands contradicts a widespread vegetation greening and a slight runoff increase in dryland ecosystems in the same climate models here we re examine changes in global drylands for the coming century and at two future warming targets 1 5 c and 2 c warming relative to the preindustrial level based on outputs of climate models who participated in the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 in addition to aridity index ai that has been widely used to measure the atmospheric aridity we also assess changes in drylands from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives using runoff q and leaf area index lai as indicators respectively our results show that when the impact of elevated atmospheric co2 concentration co2 on vegetation water consumption is considered in the estimation of potential evapotranspiration e p and ai the expansion of atmospheric drylands is at a much slower rate 0 16 per decade under rcp4 5 and 0 30 per decade under rcp8 5 than previously reported moreover the additional 0 5 c warming does not lead to an evident further expansion of atmospheric drylands in terms of hydrologic and agro ecological drylands both of them show significant shrinks over the coming decades suggesting reduced hydrologic and agro ecological aridity in the region finally contrasting with previous perceptions our results demonstrate that warming only plays a minor role in altering global drylands from all three perspectives increases in net radiation are primarily responsible for the expansion of atmospheric drylands and increases in p and co2 induced increases in vegetation water use efficiency are the key drivers of changes in hydrologic and agro ecological drylands keywords dryland global warming atmospheric aridity hydrologic aridity agro ecological aridity 1 introduction drylands occupy about 45 of the earth s terrestrial surfaces prƒÉvƒÉlie 2016 and are homes to more than one third of the global population feng and fu 2013 due to the great water scarcity and low vegetation coverage dryland ecosystems are especially vulnerable and sensitive to external disturbances such as climate change and human interventions reynolds et al 2007 reed et al 2012 middleton and sternberg 2013 wu et al 2016 berdugo et al 2020 quantification of changes in global drylands under climate change is thus essential for understanding the impacts of external disturbances on global dryland ecosystems and for developing relevant adaptation strategies nicholson 2011 reynolds et al 2007 traditionally drylands are defined based on climate aridity index ai which is calculated as the ratio of long term precipitation p over potential evapotranspiration e p the basic idea underlying ai is that p measures the atmospheric water supply and e p measures the atmospheric water demand with the ratio of p e p measuring how well the supply can meet the demand roderick et al 2015 lin et al 2018 over a climatological period e g typically 30 years when the ratio of p e p is smaller than 0 65 which indicates an evident atmospheric water scarcity the corresponding areas are defined as drylands gao and giorgi 2008 mortimore 2009 he et al 2019 by adopting this approach many studies have assessed changes in global dryland extent under various future climate scenarios and concluded a substantial expansion of global drylands in a warmer future feng and fu 2013 cook et al 2014 huang et al 2016 sun et al 2017 wei et al 2019 for example using ai forced with climate projections from the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 feng and fu 2013 estimated a dryland expansion of 10 and 4 by the end of the 21st century relative to the 1961 1990 baseline under representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 high emission scenario and 4 5 medium emission scenario respectively the reason underlying this reported drylands expansion is that the warming induced enhancement of e p greatly outweighs the increase of p leading to a decreased ai with more areas having an ai value lower than 0 65 in future climate scenarios additionally park et al 2018 further reported that significant aridification would emerge at about 10 rcp8 5 and 8 rcp4 5 of the global land area at the 1 5 c warming target and the corresponding numbers would increase to 32 rcp4 5 and 24 rcp8 5 at the 2 c warming target stressing the predominant role of warming on the expansion of global drylands however the ai based assessments of dryland changes have been considerably criticized for two reasons first ai was originally developed to assess spatial differences in aridity at a given instant of time barrow 1992 hulme 1996 using ai to assess aridity changes over time involves an important assumption that space and time are substitutable however the traditional approach of calculating ai in particular e p does not account for the variation of atmospheric co2 concentration co2 that ultimately drives climate change and introduces an additional source of variation not represent in spatial ai comparisons roderick et al 2015 consequently ignoring changes in co2 in the calculation of ai invalidates the space for time substitution assumption greve et al 2019 second and more fundamentally the conclusion of expanding drylands under warming using ai based approaches contradicts with persistent vegetation greening and a slight increase of surface runoff in ai defined global dryland regions projected by the same climate models alkama et al 2013 zeng et al 2016 yang et al 2018 aridity is a multidimensional issue greve and seneviratne 2015 roderick et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 despite ai that measures aridity from an atmospheric perspective surface vegetation and runoff quantify aridity respectively from the agro ecological and hydrologic perspectives that are more directly relevant to human needs cook et al 2014 milly and dunne 2016 roderick et al 2015 the projected vegetation greening and increased runoff indeed indicate reduced agro ecological aridity and hydrological aridity under warming which challenges the ai based assessments of future dryland changes with the issues mentioned above the current study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of global dryland changes from multiple perspectives under different future climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and at different levels of future warming 1 5 c and 2 c in particular to assess dryland changes from an atmospheric perspective we calculate e p using an updated penman monteith equation that explicitly acknowledges the impact of rising co2 on vegetation water use embedded in climate models and to assess dryland changes from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives we rely on direct outputs of surface runoff q and leaf area index lai from climate models this approach ensures that the estimated dryland changes essentially follow the cmip5 model projections yang et al 2020 2 methods and data 2 1 method 2 1 1 definitions of global drylands drylands are traditionally defined as regions where ai is smaller than 0 65 hulme 1996 gao and giorgi 2008 which can be further divided into four subtypes including i sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 ii semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 iii arid 0 05 ai 0 2 and iv hyper arid ai 0 05 here we follow this definition to determine drylands from the atmospheric perspective to determine drylands from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives the thresholds of q and lai for determining the four dryland subtypes were quantified using a frequency percentage approach because both q and lai are positively correlated with ai across space i e q and lai are generally small in regions with low ai and vice versa supplementary fig s1 we applied the same historical 1986 2005 ai threshold correspondent communitive frequency to historical q and lai communitive frequency distributions and to find the corresponding q and lai thresholds fig 1 this approach ensures the same areas of dryland and its subtypes from the three perspectives during the historical period additionally we focused our analysis in regions below 60 on to avoid dealing with frozen water and low temperature effect on vegetation growth feng and fu 2013 park et al 2018 2 1 2 determination of the timing of 1 5 c and 2 c warming targets to demonstrate the impacts of warming on dryland changes we assessed changes in global drylands from all three perspectives at two future warming targets 1 5 c and 2 c these two warming targets are also the two key warming targets set in the paris agreement on climate change and has been extensively investigated in the literature huang et al 2017 osima et al 2018 park et al 2018 shi et al 2018 wei et al 2019 miao et al 2020 yang et al 2020 here we determined the timing when the warming targets t 1 5 and t 2 are reached in each of the cmip5 models using the direct model output of near surface air temperature t a and the method widely used in previous studies huang et al 2016 park et al 2018 in more detail we firstly selected 1986 2005 as the reference periods representing the current climate park et al 2018 since the global mean t a for 1986 2005 is about 0 6 c higher than the pre industrial level schleussner et al 2016 hawkins et al 2017 t 1 5 and t 2 were identified as the time when global annual mean t a reaches 0 9 c and 1 4 c above that of 1986 2005 respectively a 20 year equal weight running mean filter was applied to the global mean annual t a series to remove the interannual variability in annual t a and each 20 year moving average is indexed to its final year the timing that each cmip5 model reaching the 1 5 c and 2 c warming targets are summarized in supplementary table s1 2 1 3 calculation of potential evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration e p was calculated using a modified penman monteith equation that explicitly

models participated in cmip5 under both historical 1861 2005 and future 2006 2100 scenarios were acquired from https esgfnode llnl gov search cmip5 supplementary table s2 two future climate change scenarios were considered including the medium emission scenario rcp4 5 and high emission scenario rcp8 5 taylor et al 2012 we use the first realization r1i1p1 of the historical and rcp scenario simulations in all cmip5 models the selected 16 cmip5 models provide all the required meteorological variables and runoff data however only 13 out of the 16 models reported lai estimates so the lai related analyses were performed using lai outputs from these 13 cmip5 models supplementary table s2 all data were resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 1 by using the first order conservative remapping scheme jones 1999 3 results 3 1 historical global dryland distributions from multiple perspectives global drylands are determined using ai q and lai which characterize drylands from the atmospheric hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives respectively by comparing the spatial coverages of the three variables during the historical period 1986 2005 the thresholds for the hydrologic and agro ecological drylands are 154 2 mm yr 1 and 2 0 respectively these are very close to the thresholds determined from the direct correlations between ai and q or lai supplementary fig s1 nevertheless as described in section 2 1 1 the frequency percentage approach adopted herein has an advantage that the determined drylands from different perspectives cover the same areas during the historical period i e 6 7 107 km2 which provides the same reference value for assessing dryland area changes from different perspectives and hence are used in the following analyses the thresholds of ai q and lai for global drylands and their subtypes are summarized in table 1 based on thresholds in table 1 the spatial distributions of global drylands and their subtypes for the historical period from different perspectives are shown in fig 2 in general the spatial patterns of global drylands and their subtypes determined from the three metrics are in a very good agreement drylands determined from the modified ai based approach cover central and southwestern north america southern south america northern and southern africa middle east central asia and australia which are consistent with previous findings e g feng and fu 2013 and are also satisfactorily captured by the q and lai based approaches fig 2b and c this result demonstrates the predominant role of climate in controlling the spatial patterns of hydrology and vegetation across the global terrestrial environments that have been well documented in the literature e g budyko 1974 yang et al 2015 3 2 global drylands change in future climate scenarios time series of relative changes in global dryland areas during 2006 2100 from the three perspectives relative to the 1986 2005 baseline are illustrated in fig 3 results show that global drylands from the three aspects exhibit contrasting changes for the coming century with drylands from the atmospheric perspective showing an expanding trend and those from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives showing decreasing trends in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios specifically the ensemble of the 16 cmip5 models projects an increasing atmospheric dryland extent at a rate of 0 16 per decade ranges between 0 25 and 0 52 per decades in individual models and 0 30 per decade ranges between 0 21 and 1 06 per decade under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 3a and supplementary table s3 by contrast the hydrological dryland experiences a slightly decreasing trend in the coming century at a rate of 0 07 per decade ranges between 0 26 and 0 19 per decade and 0 21 per decades ranges between 0 47 and 0 22 per decade under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 3b and supplementary table s3 nevertheless relatively large uncertainty and interannual variabilities are found in the dryland changes among cmip5 models from the atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives supplementary fig s2 for the 16 models used herein 13 and 10 of them show an increasing atmospheric dryland area and the increasing trend is statistically significant at the 99 confidence level in only 7 and 10 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively supplementary table s3 regarding hydrologic dryland the decreasing trend based on the multi model ensemble is respectively detected in 10 and 9 models significant in 3 and 8 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 table s2 in comparison the reduction of the agro ecological dryland area 0 98 and 1 36 per decade under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 is more consistent among models and shows a much smaller interannual variability fig 3c and supplementary table s3 for the 13 out of 16 models that report lai only one model miroc5 projects a very minor expansion of agro ecological drylands at 0 02 and 0 07 per decade under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively while the other 12 models consistently project a significant at the 99 confidence level decreasing trend of the agro ecological dryland area towards the end of the 21st century in terms of dryland subtypes the overall expansion of atmospheric drylands is largely driven by the expansion of arid and semi arid regions under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 4 d and g relative to the 1986 2005 baseline arid and semi arid areas from the atmospheric perspective increase by 1 98 and 3 28 under rcp4 5 and 5 26 and 3 27 under rcp8 5 respectively in the last decade of the 21st century the hyper arid areas also show increasing yet non significant at the 99 significant level changes of 0 84 and 2 96 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 4j however changes in sub humid regions are not consistent between the two future climate scenarios for the same period and under rcp4 5 sub humid areas expand by 0 32 whereas under rcp8 5 sub humid areas decrease by 1 79 fig 4a in comparison changes in dryland subtypes from the hydrologic and agro ecological aspects are more consistent between the two future climate scenarios in terms of hydrologic drylands only the arid region shows expansion while the other three dryland subtypes all exhibit shrinks under future climate scenarios fig 4b e h k for agro ecological drylands reductions in dryland areas are detected in all four subtypes with arid and semi arid regions generally showing a more rapid dryland decrease than hyper arid and sub humid regions fig 4c f i l 3 3 global drylands changes under the two warming targets the above results demonstrate significant changes in the global dryland area from all three perspectives in future climate scenarios however the change is only substantial from the agro ecological perspective but relatively small from the atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives fig 3 to further investigate how dryland changes under future warming we subsequently examine dryland changes at two future warming targets i e 1 5 c and 2 c over the preindustrial level moreover only results under rcp8 5 are presented in the following text as those under rcp4 5 supplementary fig s3 and fig s4 are essentially the same with rcp8 5 and the key difference between the two scenarios is that the two future warming targets occur in different future periods sooner in rcp8 5 and later in rcp4 5 table s1 changes in global drylands and their subtypes from all three perspectives under the two future warming targets i e t 1 5 and t 2 are illustrated in figs 5 and 6 compared with the 1986 2005 baseline the atmospheric dryland shows a small expansion of 1 20 ranges between 1 03 and 3 57 in individual models at t 1 5 which is driven by small expansions of all dryland subtypes fig 5a that mainly occur in central canada the brazilian highlands and central euro asia fig 6a the hydrologic dryland remains more or less unchanged at t 1 5 0 28 ranging between 2 99 and 2 87 supplementary table s4 which is primarily caused by an evident expansion of the sub humid region central euro asia and the mediterranean regions fig 6a that is largely offset by a decrease of semi arid area the siberia and sahel regions and around the pampas steppe fig 6b fig 5a compared with the small changes in atmospheric and hydrologic drylands the agro ecological dryland exhibits a higher magnitude of change at t 1 5 relative to the 1986 2005 baseline 2 55 ranging between 5 91 and 0 41 this reduction in agro ecological dryland is also found for arid semi arid and sub humid regions however an evident increase of the hyper arid area regarding agro ecology is projected to occur at t 1 5 in the brazilian highlands and southern africa figs 5a and 6c in comparison to t 1 5 a further 0 5 c warming only leads to a very small further expansion of the atmospheric dryland by 0 12 fig 5c correspondingly the atmospheric dryland expands by 1 32 at t 2 relative to the 1986 2005 baseline fig 5b despite the relatively small overall atmospheric dryland expansion with the 0 5 c additional warming an evident expansion of semi arid areas is found at t 2 compared to t 1 5 figs 5c and 6g nevertheless this expansion of semi arid areas is almost entirely offset by the concurrent decrease of sub humid regions leading to an overall small change in the atmospheric dryland between t 2 and t 1 5 an interesting result is found in the change of the hydrologic dryland with an additional 0 5 c warming figs 5c and 6h it is found that a further 0 5 c temperature increase reverses the hydrologic dryland changes from an expansion of 0 28 at t 1 5 to a reduction of 0 49 at t 2 indicating a 0 77 decrease of hydrologic dryland areas with an additional 0 5 c warming this hydrologic dryland decrease is primarily induced by shrinks of hydrologic drylands in hyper arid and arid regions figs 5b c and 6h compared with atmospheric and hydrologic drylands an additional 0 5 c warming has witnessed a larger change of the agro ecological dryland figs 5b c and 6i it is found that the agro ecological dryland shrinks by 4 31 at t 2 compared to the 1986 2005 baseline suggesting a further 1 76 reduction of global agro ecological dryland areas with the additional 0 5 c warming or 1 7 times of reduction compared with that at t 1 5 this further reduction in agro ecological drylands is found in all subtypes of global drylands with the additional 0 5 c warming figs 5c and 6i 4 discussion using climate aridity index many previous studies have assessed changes in global dryland areas and concluded a substantial expansion of global drylands under future warming feng and fu 2013 cook et al 2014 fu and feng 2014 huang et al 2016 2017 for example feng and fu 2013 estimated a dryland expansion of 10 and 4 by the end of the 21st century compared to 1961 1990 under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 respectively however these previous ai based assessments ignored an important response of vegetation to elevated co2 that has been demonstrated to substantially reduce the vegetation water consumption in climate models roderick et al 2015 milly and dunne 2016 with the available energy net radiation only showing little increase in future climate scenarios roderick et al 2014 yang et al 2019 future warming leads to a remarkable increase of the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit d which serves as the primary driver of the enhancement of e p in the traditional penman or penman monteith equations scheff and frierson 2014 nevertheless a recent study demonstrated that the increase of e p induced by the increase of d is nearly entirely offset by the decrease of e p caused by the decrease of surface conductance as a consequence of vegetation responding to elevated co2 in climate model projections yang et al 2019 this suggests that ignoring the impact of elevated co2 on vegetation would overestimate the increase of e p and therefore overestimating the expansion of global drylands based on ai greve et al 2019 here using a modified penman monteith equation that explicitly accounts for the co2 impact on vegetation our estimates of future atmospheric dryland expansion are much smaller than previously reported 1 58 under rcp4 5 and 2 95 under rcp8 5 for modified ai versus 5 27 under rcp4 5 and 14 63 under rcp8 5 using tranditonal ai fig 3a and supplementary table s3 fig s5 it should be noted that the effect of elevated co2 on e p and hence on atmospheric dryland is only strictly valid when vegetation coverage is high yang et al 2019 for sparsely vegetated areas e g drylands the e p model adopted here eq 1 may underestimate the increase of e p and therefore underestimate the expansion of atmospheric drylands this follows that a more reasonable estimate of atmospheric dryland expansion should fall between those with and without considering the co2 effect on the other hand multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that global drylands show the greatest greening trend under elevated co2 donohue et al 2013 2017 norby and zak 2011 fig 3 which suggests that the underestimation of e p increase by eq 1 would eventually become smaller even larger contrasts are found in the dryland changes from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives fig 3 since aridity is a multidimensional problem in addition to ai based atmospheric drylands we also assess changes in drylands from the hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives based on direct outputs of q and lai from cmip5 models contrasting with the expansion of atmospheric drylands reductions in hydrologic and agro ecological drylands are detected in both future climate scenarios suggesting overall reduced hydrologic and agro ecological aridity in global relatively dry regions the contrasting trends in future dryland changes indicate a decoupling between changes in atmospheric aridity and those in hydrologic and agro ecological aridity mankin et al 2019 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 this is not surprising because atmospheric aridity only measures the balance between water supply and demand in the atmosphere while p is also the external water supply for the terrestrial hydrological and agro ecological systems e p does not measure the actual water consumption on earth but is rather a hypothetical term that quantifies the atmospheric water demand or the actual evapotranspiration e when the surface is not water limited this suggests that e p and e may be more closely coupled when the surface is wet or in more humid regions but can be highly disconnected when the surface is dry or in more arid areas in this regard using ai or any measures that are directly based on e p to assess terrestrial aridity changes is not appropriate previous studies attributed the expansion of global atmospheric drylands to warming cook et al 2014 sherwood and fu 2014 feng and fu 2013 fu and feng 2014 huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 park et al 2018 however our result that the atmospheric dryland only expands by 1 58 2 95 over the next century and an additional 0 5 c warming only lead to very little further expansion of the atmospheric dryland suggest that the impact of warming on atmospheric dryland changes is small figs 3a and 5c as mentioned previously the increase of e p resulted from the warming induced increase of d is largely canceled by the decrease of e p as a result of vegetation responding to elevated co2 which indicates that the overall e p increase is actually not driven by warming and the aerodynamic component of e p combining the fact that p is projected to slightly increase overall global drylands it follows that the expansion of the atmospheric dryland cannot be driven by warming either but only likely by the radiative effect of greenhouse gases that slightly increases net radiation and thus e p this is consistent with recent attribution analyses of e p changes in climate models milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2019 who reported that the e p change over the 21st century is almost entirely driven by changes in net radiation rather than warming in addition warming is unlikely to drive the changes in hydrologic and agro ecological drylands either in global drylands p is often much smaller than e p which means that any increase in p will largely be evaporated to meet the high water demand defined by e p regardless of how e p changes in another word p defines e while the sensitivity of e to changes in e p is very small in dry regions this phenomenon has long been well known in the hydrological community e g roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2018 and again demonstrated by the findings that the hydrologic dryland only exhibits very minor changes yet statistically significant at the 99 confidence level under future climate change herein fig 5 as for vegetation since cold high latitude regions are excluded from our analysis increases in air temperature are not likely to promote vegetation growth in drylands instead the enhanced vegetation growth and consequently reduced agro ecological drylands are more likely to be driven by the increased precipitation or co2 induced increase of vegetation water use efficiency farquhar 1997 donohue et al 2013 2017 swann et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 or some combination thereof 5 conclusion in this study changes in global drylands over the coming century and at two future warming targets from the atmospheric hydrologic and agro ecological perspectives are assessed based on cmip5 model projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios key findings include 1 the atmospheric dryland is projected to expand at a rate of 0 16 per decade rcp4 5 and 0 30 per decade rcp8 5 towards the end of the 21st century nevertheless these estimated expanding trends are much slower than previously reported primarily due to the inclusion of vegetation response to elevated co2 2 both hydrologic and agro ecological drylands show significant decreasing trends over the coming century and decreased extents with an additional 0 5 c warming 1 5 c versus 2 c warming suggesting reduced hydrologic and agro ecological aridity under future warming in global dry regions 3 warming only plays a minor role in regulating future dryland changes the slight increase of the atmospheric dryland is largely caused by the enhanced radiative forcing induced by rising greenhouse gases the reduced hydrologic dryland is mainly a result of increased p and the shrink of agro ecological dryland is primarily credited to the increased p and or enhanced vegetation water use efficiency induced by elevated co2 it is therefore a reasonable conclusion that changes in p and co2 are the two main driving factors of global dryland change whereas the effect of warming is small credit authorship contribution statement cicheng zhang formal analysis writing

5042,interactions between the yangtze river and poyang lake are undergoing rapid changes due to intensive human activities and ongoing climate change this study investigates the spatiotemporal variations of isotopic compositions Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in river and lake water to explore the river lake interactions in combination with water level and discharge in poyang lake watershed the results showed that river and lake water isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o exhibited highly temporal heterogeneity across seasons but their spatial differences were not remarkable which is closely related with water sources from local precipitation and groundwater and lake hydrology the homogeneous patterns of lake water Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o indicated that poyang lake is a well mixed lake in spatial scales by contrast the river 10 7 and lake 10 8 water d excess and lc excess 0 6 were close to precipitation d excess and lc excess suggesting that precipitation is the main source for the lake and river the slope and intercept of the river water line were slightly lower than those of the local meteoric water line and lake water line which could be attributed to a greater evaporative enrichment in river water impacted by water flow regulation in the watershed interactions between poyang lake and yangtze river vary seasonally as evidently shown by the variations of water discharge and isotope compositions in river and lake water the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of the yangtze river water become more positive in the downstream zone than those in the upstream zone indicating that the water from poyang lake has a great impact on downstream river water this result can also be demonstrated by the efflux rate from the poyang lake to the yangtze river ranging from 17 9 to 67 9 across seasons except for the outlier rate in october resulted from the backflow of water from yangtze river to the poyang lake the complex lake river interactions between poyang lake and yangtze river mainly resulted from the regulation of three gorges dam and water discharge from poyang lake watershed these findings of the complex lake river interactions will help to improve understanding of the hydrological processes and transport of pollutants and solutes around the confluence zone of the yangtze river and poyang lake keywords stable isotopes backflow river lake interactions yangtze river poyang lake 1 introduction stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h that occur in natural bodies of water have been used widely as ideal tracers to understand hydrological processes in the river lake watershed kendall and coplen 2001 wu et al 2018 sources of water in the main channel ogrinc et al 2018 saranya et al 2020 and to evaluate the origin and age of groundwater resources sacks et al 2014 strauch et al 2006 to obtain the continuous long term measurements of river water isotopes international atomic energy agency iaea has launched a network of monitoring stations worldwide known as global network of isotopes in river gnir halder et al 2015 vitvar et al 2007 compared with the intensive observation in north america or europe isotopic records of isotopic contents of river and lake water are relatively sparse in the yangtze river watersheds deng et al 2016 ding et al 2014 wu et al 2018 the existing researches have either emphasized the evaluation of damming effect on the water cycles of yangtze river or impact of climate in a given catchment however the complex hydrology of large river lake systems cannot be well understood by the fragmental datasets especially in the mid low reaches of yangtze river rivers covering hundreds of kilometers may characterize a distinct isotopic composition in upstream relative to downstream because they integrate water and hydrological processes from the sub catchments hence to understand the hydrological processes in large river lake systems and to explore the interactions between river and lake water it is an urgency to monitor the spatiotemporal isotopic variability of water sources in the river watershed a pioneer study by craig 1961 established the linear relationship between Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h for global precipitation as Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o 10 and subsequently defined as global meteoric water line gmwl a secondary isotope index deuterium excess d excess Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o provides substantial information regarding the weather conditions at the oceanic source and its modification by evaporation and moisture recycling dansgaard 1964 however it is necessary to utilize the local meteoric water line lmwl to reveal the changes in local precipitation hence evaporated water samples distribute below the lmwl suggesting kinetic fractionation gibson and edwards 2002 evaporation from surface water alters the isotopic contents by driving kinetic fractionation of the residual water and further changing the d excess value guan et al 2013 kendall and coplen 2001 as the d excess is originated from the gmwl it often does not cover the variations in local precipitation therefore the concept of line conditioned excess lc excess was applied to solve the offset between a lmwl and surface water samples landwehr and coplen 2006 many previous isotopic studies have focused on the spatial and temporal variations of isotopic compositions in precipitation river and lake water to elucidate the water cycles bowen et al 2011 hu et al 2013 li et al 2016 however the application of stable isotopes to elucidate the lake water cycle has been restricted because of the lack of long term field observations in many large lake watersheds the poyang lake watershed is a typical example of a lake subjected to the combined effects of catchment inflows and its interactions with the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 2015 where the first report of stable isotopes occurred in the gnir these sparse isotopic data in poyang lake mainly focus on three periods of three gorges dam tgd operation and explore the potential factors controlling the isotopic variations hu et al 2013 zhan et al 2016 although the observations of these studies suggest a preliminary investigation of the relationship between surface water and shallow groundwater depending on the short term samplings it is difficult to clearly illuminate the complex interactions between poyang lake and yangtze river under the tgd regulation and climate change it is necessary to examine the patterns of isotopic compositions in both river flows and precipitation across seasons in order to better understand the water sources and hydrodynamics of the poyang lake water nevertheless systematic investigation and the interpretation of isotopic signatures of lake and river water in this complex river lake systems with respect to climate change hydrological flux and water regimes remain scarce the impact of climate changes and human activities on poyang lake outflows especially for river lake interactions has been widely explored hu et al 2007 lai et al 2013 nakayama and shankman 2013 however no inconsistent conclusions have been obtained from previous studies which were conducted under different water regimes or used various data and methods lai et al 2013 presented a new model to reproduce the major physical processes characterized by wetting and drying processes in rivers lakes and floodplains controlled by the complex river lake interaction the complex river lake interaction resulted in the occurrence of backflow water from the yangtze river to the poyang lake and its variable frequency among annuals which is greatly influenced by the hydrological processes of the poyang lake basin zhang et al 2011 the effects of the tgd on downstream rivers and lakes will be intensified in the future when numerous ongoing and planned large scale dams are distributed in the upstream tributaries of the yangtze river lai et al 2014 in addition there are plans to build hydraulic engineering at the outlet of the poyang lake to prevent water from flowing into the yangtze river and the river lake interactions will be greatly altered which has stirred up intense controversy li 2009 given that the river lake interactions are becoming one of the most serious issues in the poyang lake it is necessary to explore the seasonal variations of interactions between the yangtze river and poyang lake combined with stable isotopes and hydrological gauge data this study presents the isotopic data Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of lake and river water collected in 2017 across the poyang lake watershed the objectives of this study are to 1 explore the potential mechanisms controlling the spatial and temporal variations of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in waters from the poyang lake and rivers and 2 identify the interactions between the poyang lake and yangtze river this study will be valuable for improving our understanding of the lake river interactions on water cycles of large lake watershed under climate change and human activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the poyang lake 28 4

the east china sea occupying the 1 8 106 km2 yangtze river catchment is subdivided into three sections including upper middle and lower yangtze catchment poyang lake serves industrial agricultural urban ecological and environmental functions for 10 million residents at the marginal areas of the lake poyang lake is mainly fed by catchment runoffs from five main tributary rivers ganjiang average 2585 m3 s xinjiang 744 m3 s fuhe 526 m3 s xiushui 463 m3 s and raohe 642 m3 s rivers fig 1 and is also influenced by the water regime of the yangtze river in the northern outlet of the lake at the hukou station discharge from these rivers and the supplement from the yangtze river e g backflow contribute approximately 89 and 3 of the total lake inflow respectively and the remaining part is mainly sourced from rainfall at the lake surface and groundwater inflow hu et al 2007 the largest annual volume of backflow was 13 of the annual lake discharge based on the hukou flow data during the period from 1960 to 2010 li et al 2017 the poyang lake has an average depth of 8 m with a high degree of seasonal variation which subsequently results in the variations of lake area from 1000 km2 and 3000 km2 annually the poyang lake watershed has an area of 16 2 104 km2 located in the middle reaches of yangtze river watershed characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is about 1654 mm year of which 55 is occupied in march to june the mean annual evapotranspiration is 1049 mm year with the highest rates occurring during may and september air temperature is seasonal with an annual average of 17 6 c characterized by the highest average value of 27 3 c during june to august and the lowest value of 7 1 c during december and february zhang et al 2014 however the contrasting mean annual temperature and precipitation amount observed in the upper yangtze river catchment are 12 7 c and 859 mm respectively chen et al 2014 land use type in the watershed mainly consists of forest 46 shrub land 25 crop land 25 and small areas of pasture urban centers and open water 2 2 water sampling and isotopic analysis a total of 79 water samples from the poyang lake and 77 water samples from the yangtze ganjiang xiushui and xinjiang rivers were collected monthly in 2017 and 2018 fig 1 all water samples were taken below a water depth of 30 cm and sealed in pre cleaned and plastic bottles immediately in addition 81 event based precipitation samples were collected from june 2017 to june 2018 at hukou county located in the northeast region of the poyang lake each sample was collected as soon as a precipitation event stopped to reduce evaporation stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of all water samples were measured by a laser absorption water vapor isotope spectrometer model 908 0004 los gatos research mountain view ca usa measured results are reported as Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the analytical precision values for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were between 0 5 and 0 1 respectively 2 3 data analysis and calculation of lc excess one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to test the difference of isotopic values in river water among seasons all values conformed to normality and sphericity assumptions and where followed by the post hoc tukey s least significance difference test at a p 0 05

from local precipitation landwehr and coplen 2006 1 lc excess Œ¥ 2 h a Œ¥ 18 o b here a and b represent the slope and intercept of the lmwl for evaporation fractionated water samples the lc excess would be negative and will distribute below the lmwl in addition daily water level and discharge data were obtained at cuntan jiujiang and hukou stations from the changjiang water resources commission in this study http www cjw gov cn these stations are distributed in the three gorges reservoir mainstream of the yangtze river and outlet of the poyang lake respectively fig 1 2 4 calculation of efflux rate stable isotopes in waters from poyang lake and yangtze river were used to estimate the efflux rate of the lake to the yangtze river by a two component mixing model genereux 1998 2 f ds f

represents the uncertainty in the variable specified in the subscript the uncertainty of upstream and downstream river water is caused by the spatial temporal variation of stable isotopic compositions in two components the uncertainty term w in eq 4 can be characterized in two ways 1 the standard deviation of multiple samples multiplying the student s t value at the confidence level of 95 and 2 the measurement error for Œ¥2h or for Œ¥18o based on replicate samples with a single sample 3 results 3 1 seasonal variation in water level and discharge the water level and discharge vary across seasons at the hukou jiujiang and cuntan station fig 2 the variation of the water level at the cuntan station differs from that at the hukou and jiujiang station the water level decreased from 175 to 145 m during the releasing stage january june and increased to 175 m during the impoundment stage september november at the cuntan station by contrast at the hukou and jiujiang stations the water level has a similar trend in variation and reaches a maximum of 20 7 and 21 2 m in july fig 2a the tgd regulation caused the fluctuations of water discharge and levels of the reservoir during the flooding periods of 2017 fig 2 moreover the water discharge shows two peaks in july and october at the jiujiang station while the peak of water discharge occurs in late june at the hukou station fig 2b in early october a negative peak in the water discharge is found at the hukou station 3 2 daily variation of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in precipitation events precipitation events occurred primarily during april and june when the majority of precipitation 20 mm was observed additionally air temperature fluctuated from 2 4 to 33 7 c during the entire study period the relatively lower air temperature was distributed during december and february fig 3 the highest precipitation was observed on july 1 2017 reaching 150 2 mm precipitation Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o varied highly throughout the observed periods the Œ¥2h ranged from 134 1 to 18 3 with an amount weighted average of 36 4 whereas Œ¥18o ranged from 18 1 to 0 7 with an amount weighted average of 5 9 the negative average Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values were observed in august there was a large fluctuation in precipitation d excess ranging from 12 1 to 24 1 with an average 11 2 fig 3b which is slightly higher than the global average of 10 the lower average d excess value was found during june september 3 3 isotopic variations in river and lake water seasonal variations of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h showed a similar pattern in lake and river water fig 4 the pattern of average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values in lake and river water was characterized by a higher variability and significance different p 0 05 between january and october in 2017 compared with other months however river water Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values exhibited a greater range in each month compared with lake water fig 4 river water Œ¥18o varied from 11 7 to 4 9 with an average of 6 7 and Œ¥2h from 84 2 to 27 1 with an average of 43 1 fig 4ab in contrast lake water Œ¥18o ranged from 10 2 to 4 7 with an average of 6 4 and Œ¥2h from 69 8 to 25 3 with an average of 40 4 fig 4 a larger variation in the range of lake water Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values was observed in october compared with other months fig 4 c d however in the spatial scale the average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in lake water showed no evident difference from nanji to hukou of the poyang lake table 1 additionally the average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h were remarkably lower in the yangtze river to those of other rivers e g ganjiang xiushui xinjiang fuhe and raohe and the poyang lake table 1 the isotopic compositions Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h were more enriched in the downstream of the yangtze river Œ¥18o 8 4 Œ¥2h 56 2 than those in the upstream of the yangtze river Œ¥18o 9 0 Œ¥2h 60 1 table 1 compared to the variations of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in lake water lake water lc excess and d excess exhibited less variability with an average of 0 65 and 10 8 during the entire observation period respectively fig 5 however there was a greater fluctuation of river water lc excess and d excess with an average of 0 69 and 10 7 respectively fig 5 the average lc excess and d excess values in river and lake water were close to the global average of 0 and 10 respectively 3 4 correlations between Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in precipitation river and lake water the correlation between event based Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in precipitation was established here as the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥2h 8 17 Œ¥18o 12 5 r 0 98 for the poyang lake region fig 6 this relationship was close to the global meteoric water line craig 1961 similarly the correlation between Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake and river water was reported as the lake water line lwl Œ¥2h 8 16 Œ¥18o 11 8 r 0 98 and river water line rwl Œ¥2h 7 82 Œ¥18o 9 55 r 0 99 fig 6 the slope and intercept of rwl evidently differed from those of the lmwl and lwl all river and lake water samples were clustered along the lmwl 3 5 efflux rate of lake water to yangtze river the efflux rate of the poyang lake to the yangtze river varied from 17 9 1 14 to 67 9 1 39 across seasons fig 7 the lower efflux rate was mainly observed during the wet season july august when the water level of the yangtze river was higher fig 7 interestingly the highest efflux rate was 108 9 2 01 in october which was associated with the backflow of the yangtze river to the poyang lake by contrast the higher efflux rate was found during the dry seasons december february corresponding to the lower water level of the yangtze river jiujiang station and the poyang lake hukou station fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling the spatiotemporal variations of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake and river water stable water isotopes are a powerful integrative recorders of key catchment processes e g evaporation and transpiration recycling mixing and catchment water balance as well as tracers of river recharge sources direct precipitation runoff lake and groundwater halder et al 2015 kendall and coplen 2001 lambs et al 2005 hydrological processes occurring between precipitation input and river discharge alter the stable isotopic composition of rivers including damming and lake mixing processes deng et al 2016 pham et al 2009 in this study river water isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o exhibited high temporal and spatial heterogeneity across seasons while the spatial differences of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were not remarkable in the poyang lake fig 4 and table 1 this observation agrees with other studies that have shown that spatial and temporal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation were directly mirrored in most of the river water dutton et al 2005 halder et al 2015 ogrinc et al 2018 the pattern of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake water could be closely associated with precipitation patterns rivers flowing into lake and lake hydrodynamic mixing in poyang lake li et al 2016 the seasonal variations of isotopic compositions in the river and lake water could be closely related with those of the precipitation relatively lower average values of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were observed in precipitation during the monsoon periods from july to october compared with other months fig 3 which are mainly controlled by the effects of the moisture source and precipitation in the subtropical regions hu et al 2013 wu et al 2015 in the chinese region of eastern asia monsoon rains june to september are characterized by greater depletion in isotopic compositions than winter rains november to may which is impacted by the pacific monsoon originating in western equatorial pacific aragu√°s aragu√°s et al 1998 the seasonal variations of average Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values in lake water had similar trends with those in river water during the observation period fig 4 because poyang lake is predominantly recharged by five river tributaries from the watershed however the average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values were slightly lower in lake water mean Œ¥18o 6 4 Œ¥2h 40 4 than those in river water average Œ¥18o 5 8 Œ¥2h 36 1 table 1 which could be attributed to greater evaporative enrichment in river water impacted by water flow regulation xie 1999 this finding is also evident as the lower slope and intercept of rwl compared with those of lmwl fig 6 lower slopes of 6 7 could be suggestive of post precipitation evaporation of surface waters while slopes higher than 8 indicate a dominant recharge source with the absence of isotopic fractionation timsic and patterson 2014 the higher slope 8 16 in lake water is close to that in lwml 8 17 which could be associated with precipitation input and high proportions of recharge from watershed groundwater in general groundwater experienced less evaporative fractionation jasechko 2019 previous studies reported a high proportion of groundwater 77 with isotopically depleted Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o recharge from the neighboring regions to the lake water which may be resulted in the lower isotopic values in lake water relative to river water hu et al 2013 zhan et al 2016 the spatial patterns of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake water from the south nanji to the north hukou of poyang lake are homogenous table 1 this pattern indicated that poyang lake is a well mixed lake which was distinct from other lakes such as the mary river channel lake and taihu lake townsend 2006 xiao et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 found that the direction of water flow controlled the distinct spatial patterns of the isotopic compositions in lake water with long residence time similarly li et al 2016 also found that lake water was well mixed in spatial scale because depth profiles exhibited similar isotopic compositions water temperature and water velocity poyang lake water discharges into the yangtze river throughout the year with the main lake having a short water residence time li et al 2015 which largely determines the spatial patterns of isotopic compositions in the lake water li et al 2015 reported that the average residence time of poyang lake was less than ten days in the low water level periods and approximately 30 days during the high water level periods which also suggested that the well mixed conditions of the lake water contribute to reducing the heterogeneity of the lake water isotopic compositions in a spatial scale fig 4 a similar study by saravana kumar et al 2001 also found that the dynamics of lake like hypolimnion and epilimnion conditions can determine the spatial pattern of isotopic compositions across different periods in lake naini india 4 2 comparison of water isotopic compositions with other regions lake water isotopic patterns are closely associated with climate and lake hydrology of each individual lake catchment such as input sources and evaporation jasechko et al 2013 pham et al 2009 for example well mixed lakes e g the north american great lakes and lake baikal shows relatively homogenous stable isotope compositions whereas perennially stratified or shallow lakes show greater isotopic variability e g lake taihu and chad xiao et al 2016 in contrast headwater lakes at the high latitudes and altitudes present the relatively lower Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values e g lake kluane and gongmo tso because of the depleted isotopic compositions of input sources such as precipitation and river water brahney 2007 shi et al 2014 whereas the closed lakes e g lake qinghai exhibit the highest isotopic values influenced by great evaporative enrichment wu et al 2017 however in this study the average d excess in the river 10 7 and lake 10 8 water were similar to that in precipitation 11 2 table 1 indicating that precipitation is the main source of river and lake water craig 1961 the high d excess of poyang lake water differs from other regions such as alpine lake and semi arid lake table 2 gibson and reid 2014 jasechko et al 2014 seal and shanks 1998 wu et al 2017 in general the lake water average d excess values range from 4 to 6 because of the evaporative enrichment gibson et al 2008 a closed inland lake e g qinghai lake located in arid regions is characterized by negative d excess values as a result of greater evaporative enrichment and the longer residence time of the lake water pham et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 however the relatively higher d excess values of a through flow lake e g poyang and dongting lake is indicative of well mixing and short residence time hu et al 2013 zhan et al 2015 by contrast some lakes present a lower average d excess value d excess 4 table 2 suggesting that the lake water experiences a great evaporative enrichment in isotopic compositions Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in addition it may relate with the relatively low annual precipitation amount in these lake watersheds except for tai lake determining the lower the d excess value in lake water table 2 river water lc excess and d excess exhibit seasonal variability during the entire period fig 5 which suggests that river water interacts with various water sources from recent precipitation and catchment groundwater and evaporation across seasons recent precipitation reaches the river either by surface runoff channel precipitation or by rapid flow through shallow subsurface flow paths precipitation d excess values vary remarkably across seasons fig 3 which results in the variability of river water d excess values the isotopic compositions of rivers from large watershed areas are subject to changes in precipitation composition because of runoff mixing with older groundwater and newer rainwater and impacted by evaporation penna et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 the contrasting slopes between rwl and lmwl suggest that river water undergo greater evaporation this evaporative effect may be associated with the huge area of five sub catchments and river water flow regulation which contributes to the variability of isotopic compositions in river water by contrast monthly average d excess and lc excess in lake water showed less variability table 1 indicating that the water was well mixed in the poyang lake which is consistent with the results of lake water d excess and lc excess in dongting lake and north american great lakes chains jasechko et al 2014 zhan et al 2015 jasechko et al 2014 found that these lake chains such as superior lake are perfectly mixed and thus spatial homogeneity of isotopic compositions of lake water however in taihu lake lake water average d excess showed high variability across seasons xiao et al 2016 indicating that the lake water was poorly mixed across seasons the poor hydrodynamic condition of taihu lake is the main reason for the poor water quality 4 3 implications for river lake interactions river lake interactions are not only influenced by the regulation of the tgd but also by the result of a complex interaction among a series of alterations under the influence of climate changes and human activities in the poyang lake watershed and upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river catchment guo et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 due to the regulation of tgd the water level and discharge of the reservoir varies across seasons fig 2a which largely impacts the river lake interactions in the middle reaches of the yangtze river yang et al 2016 the variations in water level and discharge suggest that the lake water discharged into the yangtze river at the hukou station during the observation period fig 2b however negative values were obtained for the water discharge from october 6th to 18th in 2017 indicating that the flow direction in the poyang lake reverses and the yangtze river water flows toward the poyang lake statistical analysis showed that an average of 16 backflow events per year occurred during 1960 2010 and both the frequency and magnitude of backflow reduced significantly since tgd began to operate li et al 2017 the occurrence of backflow coincided with the release of tgd which was attributed to the higher water level and discharge of the mainstream of the yangtze river compared with those in the outlet of the poyang lake this phenomenon is incident to the mixing zone of huge rivers e g yangtze river mekong river and amazon river and their tributaries especially in the three gorges reservoir kabeya et al 2008 schwerdtfeger et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 kabeya et al 2008 also showed that backflow events occurred between the mekong river and tonle sap lake during the annual monsoon peak determined by their distinct water regimes and isotopic patterns interactions between poyang lake and the yangtze river vary seasonally as indicated by the seasonal variations of the efflux rate of lake water to the yangtze river and Œ¥18o values figs 7 and 8 the efflux rate is higher during the non flooding period than during the flooding period june august which is closely associated with the hydraulic gradient between the poyang lake and yangtze river across seasons however in october the outlier rate resulted from the backflow of the yangtze river to the poyang lake according to the spatial pattern of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in october the backflow of the yangtze river water transports approximately 45 km southward into poyang lake fig 8b using hydrodynamic modeling li et al 2017 reported that the backflow disturbs the normal northward water flow direction in the poyang lake and transports mass 20 km southward into the lake similarly the efflux rate of the poyang lake to the yangtze river ranges from 10 8 in july to 78 7 in april using the stable isotopes zhan et al 2016 which is related with the tgd regulation wu et al 2018 also found that the seasonal efflux rate of the lake to the yangtze river reached 75 during the impoundment period of tgd the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of the yangtze river water become more positive in the downstream zone than those in the upstream zone of the yangtze river table 1 indicating that the lake water has a great impact on downstream river water the tgd impoundment resulted in a decrease in water discharge and a quick lowering of water level in the mainstream of the yangtze river this caused an increase in the outflow discharge and accelerated the emptying effect of poyang lake especially in dry seasons lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 under the dual influence of hydrological drought events and the impoundment of the tgd lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the worsening of the river lake interaction of poyang lake and its potential impacts on the lake ecosystem raised great concerns for the local management authorities and scientists li 2009 the proposed poyang lake hydraulic engineering project is planned to regulate the lake hydrology and ecological level especially for dry seasons however the effects of this project on wetland ecology and the water environment still remain debated because of the complex river lake interaction the interaction processes remarkably change the nutrient illumination intensity and suspended particle loads in the mixing zone this condition at surface became favorable for algal growth and thus the findings of the interaction processes provide important suggestions for controlling eutrophication and algal blooms in the mixing zone ran et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 hence future research should focus on the complex interactions between the poyang lake and yangtze river to better understand the transport of pollutants and solutes around the confluence zone of the yangtze river and poyang lake 5 conclusions in this study we explored the controlling factors on isotopic compositions Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of precipitation river and lake water on a spatial scale across seasons river and lake water isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o exhibited high temporal heterogeneity across seasons but their spatial differences were not remarkable the isotopic patterns of lake water are largely influenced by the isotopic compositions of precipitation and rivers and lake hydrodynamic mixing processes in poyang lake as evidently shown by the variations of d excess in lake water relative to river and precipitation the homogenous patterns of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake water also suggested that the poyang lake is a well mixed lake in spatial scale compared with lake water the lower lc excess and d excess values were found in river water indicating the greater evaporative enrichment because of river water flow regulation in the poyang lake watershed water level and discharge from gauge stations hukou and jiujiang fluctuated which is indicative of remarkable interactions between poyang lake and yangtze river during the observed periods the efflux rate of lake water to the yangtze river based on stable isotopes ranging from 17 9 to 67 9 whereas the outlier rate resulted from the backflow of the yangtze river to the poyang lake in october this study clearly demonstrated that river and lake water isotopic composition is a sensitive recorder of seasonal and spatial variability in monsoon rainfall patterns improved understanding of the basin hydrology of the monsoon fed poyang lake watershed and further observation of the spatio temporal evolution of river lake water isotopes in monsoonal zone may help to develop integrated river lake management strategies for the future dealing with water scarcity flood and drought mitigation and sustainable river resources for food production credit authorship contribution statement huawu wu conceptualization methodology software writing

5042,interactions between the yangtze river and poyang lake are undergoing rapid changes due to intensive human activities and ongoing climate change this study investigates the spatiotemporal variations of isotopic compositions Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in river and lake water to explore the river lake interactions in combination with water level and discharge in poyang lake watershed the results showed that river and lake water isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o exhibited highly temporal heterogeneity across seasons but their spatial differences were not remarkable which is closely related with water sources from local precipitation and groundwater and lake hydrology the homogeneous patterns of lake water Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o indicated that poyang lake is a well mixed lake in spatial scales by contrast the river 10 7 and lake 10 8 water d excess and lc excess 0 6 were close to precipitation d excess and lc excess suggesting that precipitation is the main source for the lake and river the slope and intercept of the river water line were slightly lower than those of the local meteoric water line and lake water line which could be attributed to a greater evaporative enrichment in river water impacted by water flow regulation in the watershed interactions between poyang lake and yangtze river vary seasonally as evidently shown by the variations of water discharge and isotope compositions in river and lake water the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of the yangtze river water become more positive in the downstream zone than those in the upstream zone indicating that the water from poyang lake has a great impact on downstream river water this result can also be demonstrated by the efflux rate from the poyang lake to the yangtze river ranging from 17 9 to 67 9 across seasons except for the outlier rate in october resulted from the backflow of water from yangtze river to the poyang lake the complex lake river interactions between poyang lake and yangtze river mainly resulted from the regulation of three gorges dam and water discharge from poyang lake watershed these findings of the complex lake river interactions will help to improve understanding of the hydrological processes and transport of pollutants and solutes around the confluence zone of the yangtze river and poyang lake keywords stable isotopes backflow river lake interactions yangtze river poyang lake 1 introduction stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h that occur in natural bodies of water have been used widely as ideal tracers to understand hydrological processes in the river lake watershed kendall and coplen 2001 wu et al 2018 sources of water in the main channel ogrinc et al 2018 saranya et al 2020 and to evaluate the origin and age of groundwater resources sacks et al 2014 strauch et al 2006 to obtain the continuous long term measurements of river water isotopes international atomic energy agency iaea has launched a network of monitoring stations worldwide known as global network of isotopes in river gnir halder et al 2015 vitvar et al 2007 compared with the intensive observation in north america or europe isotopic records of isotopic contents of river and lake water are relatively sparse in the yangtze river watersheds deng et al 2016 ding et al 2014 wu et al 2018 the existing researches have either emphasized the evaluation of damming effect on the water cycles of yangtze river or impact of climate in a given catchment however the complex hydrology of large river lake systems cannot be well understood by the fragmental datasets especially in the mid low reaches of yangtze river rivers covering hundreds of kilometers may characterize a distinct isotopic composition in upstream relative to downstream because they integrate water and hydrological processes from the sub catchments hence to understand the hydrological processes in large river lake systems and to explore the interactions between river and lake water it is an urgency to monitor the spatiotemporal isotopic variability of water sources in the river watershed a pioneer study by craig 1961 established the linear relationship between Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h for global precipitation as Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o 10 and subsequently defined as global meteoric water line gmwl a secondary isotope index deuterium excess d excess Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o provides substantial information regarding the weather conditions at the oceanic source and its modification by evaporation and moisture recycling dansgaard 1964 however it is necessary to utilize the local meteoric water line lmwl to reveal the changes in local precipitation hence evaporated water samples distribute below the lmwl suggesting kinetic fractionation gibson and edwards 2002 evaporation from surface water alters the isotopic contents by driving kinetic fractionation of the residual water and further changing the d excess value guan et al 2013 kendall and coplen 2001 as the d excess is originated from the gmwl it often does not cover the variations in local precipitation therefore the concept of line conditioned excess lc excess was applied to solve the offset between a lmwl and surface water samples landwehr and coplen 2006 many previous isotopic studies have focused on the spatial and temporal variations of isotopic compositions in precipitation river and lake water to elucidate the water cycles bowen et al 2011 hu et al 2013 li et al 2016 however the application of stable isotopes to elucidate the lake water cycle has been restricted because of the lack of long term field observations in many large lake watersheds the poyang lake watershed is a typical example of a lake subjected to the combined effects of catchment inflows and its interactions with the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 2015 where the first report of stable isotopes occurred in the gnir these sparse isotopic data in poyang lake mainly focus on three periods of three gorges dam tgd operation and explore the potential factors controlling the isotopic variations hu et al 2013 zhan et al 2016 although the observations of these studies suggest a preliminary investigation of the relationship between surface water and shallow groundwater depending on the short term samplings it is difficult to clearly illuminate the complex interactions between poyang lake and yangtze river under the tgd regulation and climate change it is necessary to examine the patterns of isotopic compositions in both river flows and precipitation across seasons in order to better understand the water sources and hydrodynamics of the poyang lake water nevertheless systematic investigation and the interpretation of isotopic signatures of lake and river water in this complex river lake systems with respect to climate change hydrological flux and water regimes remain scarce the impact of climate changes and human activities on poyang lake outflows especially for river lake interactions has been widely explored hu et al 2007 lai et al 2013 nakayama and shankman 2013 however no inconsistent conclusions have been obtained from previous studies which were conducted under different water regimes or used various data and methods lai et al 2013 presented a new model to reproduce the major physical processes characterized by wetting and drying processes in rivers lakes and floodplains controlled by the complex river lake interaction the complex river lake interaction resulted in the occurrence of backflow water from the yangtze river to the poyang lake and its variable frequency among annuals which is greatly influenced by the hydrological processes of the poyang lake basin zhang et al 2011 the effects of the tgd on downstream rivers and lakes will be intensified in the future when numerous ongoing and planned large scale dams are distributed in the upstream tributaries of the yangtze river lai et al 2014 in addition there are plans to build hydraulic engineering at the outlet of the poyang lake to prevent water from flowing into the yangtze river and the river lake interactions will be greatly altered which has stirred up intense controversy li 2009 given that the river lake interactions are becoming one of the most serious issues in the poyang lake it is necessary to explore the seasonal variations of interactions between the yangtze river and poyang lake combined with stable isotopes and hydrological gauge data this study presents the isotopic data Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of lake and river water collected in 2017 across the poyang lake watershed the objectives of this study are to 1 explore the potential mechanisms controlling the spatial and temporal variations of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in waters from the poyang lake and rivers and 2 identify the interactions between the poyang lake and yangtze river this study will be valuable for improving our understanding of the lake river interactions on water cycles of large lake watershed under climate change and human activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the poyang lake 28 4

the east china sea occupying the 1 8 106 km2 yangtze river catchment is subdivided into three sections including upper middle and lower yangtze catchment poyang lake serves industrial agricultural urban ecological and environmental functions for 10 million residents at the marginal areas of the lake poyang lake is mainly fed by catchment runoffs from five main tributary rivers ganjiang average 2585 m3 s xinjiang 744 m3 s fuhe 526 m3 s xiushui 463 m3 s and raohe 642 m3 s rivers fig 1 and is also influenced by the water regime of the yangtze river in the northern outlet of the lake at the hukou station discharge from these rivers and the supplement from the yangtze river e g backflow contribute approximately 89 and 3 of the total lake inflow respectively and the remaining part is mainly sourced from rainfall at the lake surface and groundwater inflow hu et al 2007 the largest annual volume of backflow was 13 of the annual lake discharge based on the hukou flow data during the period from 1960 to 2010 li et al 2017 the poyang lake has an average depth of 8 m with a high degree of seasonal variation which subsequently results in the variations of lake area from 1000 km2 and 3000 km2 annually the poyang lake watershed has an area of 16 2 104 km2 located in the middle reaches of yangtze river watershed characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is about 1654 mm year of which 55 is occupied in march to june the mean annual evapotranspiration is 1049 mm year with the highest rates occurring during may and september air temperature is seasonal with an annual average of 17 6 c characterized by the highest average value of 27 3 c during june to august and the lowest value of 7 1 c during december and february zhang et al 2014 however the contrasting mean annual temperature and precipitation amount observed in the upper yangtze river catchment are 12 7 c and 859 mm respectively chen et al 2014 land use type in the watershed mainly consists of forest 46 shrub land 25 crop land 25 and small areas of pasture urban centers and open water 2 2 water sampling and isotopic analysis a total of 79 water samples from the poyang lake and 77 water samples from the yangtze ganjiang xiushui and xinjiang rivers were collected monthly in 2017 and 2018 fig 1 all water samples were taken below a water depth of 30 cm and sealed in pre cleaned and plastic bottles immediately in addition 81 event based precipitation samples were collected from june 2017 to june 2018 at hukou county located in the northeast region of the poyang lake each sample was collected as soon as a precipitation event stopped to reduce evaporation stable isotopes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of all water samples were measured by a laser absorption water vapor isotope spectrometer model 908 0004 los gatos research mountain view ca usa measured results are reported as Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the analytical precision values for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were between 0 5 and 0 1 respectively 2 3 data analysis and calculation of lc excess one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to test the difference of isotopic values in river water among seasons all values conformed to normality and sphericity assumptions and where followed by the post hoc tukey s least significance difference test at a p 0 05

in this study http www cjw gov cn these stations are distributed in the three gorges reservoir mainstream of the yangtze river and outlet of the poyang lake respectively fig 1 2 4 calculation of

represents the uncertainty in the variable specified in the subscript the uncertainty of upstream and downstream river water is caused by the spatial temporal variation of stable isotopic compositions in two components the uncertainty term w in eq 4 can be characterized in two ways 1 the standard deviation of multiple samples multiplying the student s t value at the confidence level of 95 and 2 the measurement error for Œ¥2h or for Œ¥18o based on replicate samples with a single sample 3 results 3 1 seasonal variation in water level and discharge the water level and discharge vary across seasons at the hukou jiujiang and cuntan station fig 2 the variation of the water level at the cuntan station differs from that at the hukou and jiujiang station the water level decreased from 175 to 145 m during the releasing stage january june and increased to 175 m during the impoundment stage september november at the cuntan station by contrast at the hukou and jiujiang stations the water level has a similar trend in variation and reaches a maximum of 20 7 and 21 2 m in july fig 2a the tgd regulation caused the fluctuations of water discharge and levels of the reservoir during the flooding periods of 2017 fig 2 moreover the water discharge shows two peaks in july and october at the jiujiang station while the peak of water discharge occurs in late june at the hukou station fig 2b in early october a negative peak in the water discharge is found at the hukou station 3 2 daily variation of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in precipitation events precipitation events occurred primarily during april and june when the majority of precipitation 20 mm was observed additionally air temperature fluctuated from 2 4 to 33 7 c during the entire study period the relatively lower air temperature was distributed during december and february fig 3 the highest precipitation was observed on july 1 2017 reaching 150 2 mm precipitation Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o varied highly throughout the observed periods the Œ¥2h ranged from 134 1 to 18 3 with an amount weighted average of 36 4 whereas Œ¥18o ranged from 18 1 to 0 7 with an amount weighted average of 5 9 the negative average Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values were observed in august there was a large fluctuation in precipitation d excess ranging from 12 1 to 24 1 with an average 11 2 fig 3b which is slightly higher than the global average of 10 the lower average d excess value was found during june september 3 3 isotopic variations in river and lake water seasonal variations of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h showed a similar pattern in lake and river water fig 4 the pattern of average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values in lake and river water was characterized by a higher variability and significance different p 0 05 between january and october in 2017 compared with other months however river water Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values exhibited a greater range in each month compared with lake water fig 4 river water Œ¥18o varied from 11 7 to 4 9 with an average of 6 7 and Œ¥2h from 84 2 to 27 1 with an average of 43 1 fig 4ab in contrast lake water Œ¥18o ranged from 10 2 to 4 7 with an average of 6 4 and Œ¥2h from 69 8 to 25 3 with an average of 40 4 fig 4 a larger variation in the range of lake water Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values was observed in october compared with other months fig 4 c d however in the spatial scale the average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in lake water showed no evident difference from nanji to hukou of the poyang lake table 1 additionally the average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h were remarkably lower in the yangtze river to those of other rivers e g ganjiang xiushui xinjiang fuhe and raohe and the poyang lake table 1 the isotopic compositions Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h were more enriched in the downstream of the yangtze river Œ¥18o 8 4 Œ¥2h 56 2 than those in the upstream of the yangtze river Œ¥18o 9 0 Œ¥2h 60 1 table 1 compared to the variations of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in lake water lake water lc excess and d excess exhibited less variability with an average of 0 65 and 10 8 during the entire observation period respectively fig 5 however there was a greater fluctuation of river water lc excess and d excess with an average of 0 69 and 10 7 respectively fig 5 the average lc excess and d excess values in river and lake water were close to the global average of 0 and 10 respectively 3 4 correlations between Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in precipitation river and lake water the correlation between event based Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in precipitation was established here as the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥2h 8 17 Œ¥18o 12 5 r 0 98 for the poyang lake region fig 6 this relationship was close to the global meteoric water line craig 1961 similarly the correlation between Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake and river water was reported as the lake water line lwl Œ¥2h 8 16 Œ¥18o 11 8 r 0 98 and river water line rwl Œ¥2h 7 82 Œ¥18o 9 55 r 0 99 fig 6 the slope and intercept of rwl evidently differed from those of the lmwl and lwl all river and lake water samples were clustered along the lmwl 3 5 efflux rate of lake water to yangtze river the efflux rate of the poyang lake to the yangtze river varied from 17 9 1 14 to 67 9 1 39 across seasons fig 7 the lower efflux rate was mainly observed during the wet season july august when the water level of the yangtze river was higher fig 7 interestingly the highest efflux rate was 108 9 2 01 in october which was associated with the backflow of the yangtze river to the poyang lake by contrast the higher efflux rate was found during the dry seasons december february corresponding to the lower water level of the yangtze river jiujiang station and the poyang lake hukou station fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling the spatiotemporal variations of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake and river water stable water isotopes are a powerful integrative recorders of key catchment processes e g evaporation and transpiration recycling mixing and catchment water balance as well as tracers of river recharge sources direct precipitation runoff lake and groundwater halder et al 2015 kendall and coplen 2001 lambs et al 2005 hydrological processes occurring between precipitation input and river discharge alter the stable isotopic composition of rivers including damming and lake mixing processes deng et al 2016 pham et al 2009 in this study river water isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o exhibited high temporal and spatial heterogeneity across seasons while the spatial differences of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were not remarkable in the poyang lake fig 4 and table 1 this observation agrees with other studies that have shown that spatial and temporal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation were directly mirrored in most of the river water dutton et al 2005 halder et al 2015 ogrinc et al 2018 the pattern of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake water could be closely associated with precipitation patterns rivers flowing into lake and lake hydrodynamic mixing in poyang lake li et al 2016 the seasonal variations of isotopic compositions in the river and lake water could be closely related with those of the precipitation relatively lower average values of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were observed in precipitation during the monsoon periods from july to october compared with other months fig 3 which are mainly controlled by the effects of the moisture source and precipitation in the subtropical regions hu et al 2013 wu et al 2015 in the chinese region of eastern asia monsoon rains june to september are characterized by greater depletion in isotopic compositions than winter rains november to may which is impacted by the pacific monsoon originating in western equatorial pacific aragu√°s aragu√°s et al 1998 the seasonal variations of average Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values in lake water had similar trends with those in river water during the observation period fig 4 because poyang lake is predominantly recharged by five river tributaries from the watershed however the average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values were slightly lower in lake water mean Œ¥18o 6 4 Œ¥2h 40 4 than those in river water average Œ¥18o 5 8 Œ¥2h 36 1 table 1 which could be attributed to greater evaporative enrichment in river water impacted by water flow regulation xie 1999 this finding is also evident as the lower slope and intercept of rwl compared with those of lmwl fig 6 lower slopes of 6 7 could be suggestive of post precipitation evaporation of surface waters while slopes higher than 8 indicate a dominant recharge source with the absence of isotopic fractionation timsic and patterson 2014 the higher slope 8 16 in lake water is close to that in lwml 8 17 which could be associated with precipitation input and high proportions of recharge from watershed groundwater in general groundwater experienced less evaporative fractionation jasechko 2019 previous studies reported a high proportion of groundwater 77 with isotopically depleted Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o recharge from the neighboring regions to the lake water which may be resulted in the lower isotopic values in lake water relative to river water hu et al 2013 zhan et al 2016 the spatial patterns of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake water from the south nanji to the north hukou of poyang lake are homogenous table 1 this pattern indicated that poyang lake is a well mixed lake which was distinct from other lakes such as the mary river channel lake and taihu lake townsend 2006 xiao et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 found that the direction of water flow controlled the distinct spatial patterns of the isotopic compositions in lake water with long residence time similarly li et al 2016 also found that lake water was well mixed in spatial scale because depth profiles exhibited similar isotopic compositions water temperature and water velocity poyang lake water discharges into the yangtze river throughout the year with the main lake having a short water residence time li et al 2015 which largely determines the spatial patterns of isotopic compositions in the lake water li et al 2015 reported that the average residence time of poyang lake was less than ten days in the low water level periods and approximately 30 days during the high water level periods which also suggested that the well mixed conditions of the lake water contribute to reducing the heterogeneity of the lake water isotopic compositions in a spatial scale fig 4 a similar study by saravana kumar et al 2001 also found that the dynamics of lake like hypolimnion and epilimnion conditions can determine the spatial pattern of isotopic compositions across different periods in lake naini india 4 2 comparison of water isotopic compositions with other regions lake water isotopic patterns are closely associated with climate and lake hydrology of each individual lake catchment such as input sources and evaporation jasechko et al 2013 pham et al 2009 for example well mixed lakes e g the north american great lakes and lake baikal shows relatively homogenous stable isotope compositions whereas perennially stratified or shallow lakes show greater isotopic variability e g lake taihu and chad xiao et al 2016 in contrast headwater lakes at the high latitudes and altitudes present the relatively lower Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values e g lake kluane and gongmo tso because of the depleted isotopic compositions of input sources such as precipitation and river water brahney 2007 shi et al 2014 whereas the closed lakes e g lake qinghai exhibit the highest isotopic values influenced by great evaporative enrichment wu et al 2017 however in this study the average d excess in the river 10 7 and lake 10 8 water were similar to that in precipitation 11 2 table 1 indicating that precipitation is the main source of river and lake water craig 1961 the high d excess of poyang lake water differs from other regions such as alpine lake and semi arid lake table 2 gibson and reid 2014 jasechko et al 2014 seal and shanks 1998 wu et al 2017 in general the lake water average d excess values range from 4 to 6 because of the evaporative enrichment gibson et al 2008 a closed inland lake e g qinghai lake located in arid regions is characterized by negative d excess values as a result of greater evaporative enrichment and the longer residence time of the lake water pham et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 however the relatively higher d excess values of a through flow lake e g poyang and dongting lake is indicative of well mixing and short residence time hu et al 2013 zhan et al 2015 by contrast some lakes present a lower average d excess value d excess 4 table 2 suggesting that the lake water experiences a great evaporative enrichment in isotopic compositions Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in addition it may relate with the relatively low annual precipitation amount in these lake watersheds except for tai lake determining the lower the d excess value in lake water table 2 river water lc excess and d excess exhibit seasonal variability during the entire period fig 5 which suggests that river water interacts with various water sources from recent precipitation and catchment groundwater and evaporation across seasons recent precipitation reaches the river either by surface runoff channel precipitation or by rapid flow through shallow subsurface flow paths precipitation d excess values vary remarkably across seasons fig 3 which results in the variability of river water d excess values the isotopic compositions of rivers from large watershed areas are subject to changes in precipitation composition because of runoff mixing with older groundwater and newer rainwater and impacted by evaporation penna et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 the contrasting slopes between rwl and lmwl suggest that river water undergo greater evaporation this evaporative effect may be associated with the huge area of five sub catchments and river water flow regulation which contributes to the variability of isotopic compositions in river water by contrast monthly average d excess and lc excess in lake water showed less variability table 1 indicating that the water was well mixed in the poyang lake which is consistent with the results of lake water d excess and lc excess in dongting lake and north american great lakes chains jasechko et al 2014 zhan et al 2015 jasechko et al 2014 found that these lake chains such as superior lake are perfectly mixed and thus spatial homogeneity of isotopic compositions of lake water however in taihu lake lake water average d excess showed high variability across seasons xiao et al 2016 indicating that the lake water was poorly mixed across seasons the poor hydrodynamic condition of taihu lake is the main reason for the poor water quality 4 3 implications for river lake interactions river lake interactions are not only influenced by the regulation of the tgd but also by the result of a complex interaction among a series of alterations under the influence of climate changes and human activities in the poyang lake watershed and upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river catchment guo et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 due to the regulation of tgd the water level and discharge of the reservoir varies across seasons fig 2a which largely impacts the river lake interactions in the middle reaches of the yangtze river yang et al 2016 the variations in water level and discharge suggest that the lake water discharged into the yangtze river at the hukou station during the observation period fig 2b however negative values were obtained for the water discharge from october 6th to 18th in 2017 indicating that the flow direction in the poyang lake reverses and the yangtze river water flows toward the poyang lake statistical analysis showed that an average of 16 backflow events per year occurred during 1960 2010 and both the frequency and magnitude of backflow reduced significantly since tgd began to operate li et al 2017 the occurrence of backflow coincided with the release of tgd which was attributed to the higher water level and discharge of the mainstream of the yangtze river compared with those in the outlet of the poyang lake this phenomenon is incident to the mixing zone of huge rivers e g yangtze river mekong river and amazon river and their tributaries especially in the three gorges reservoir kabeya et al 2008 schwerdtfeger et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 kabeya et al 2008 also showed that backflow events occurred between the mekong river and tonle sap lake during the annual monsoon peak determined by their distinct water regimes and isotopic patterns interactions between poyang lake and the yangtze river vary seasonally as indicated by the seasonal variations of the efflux rate of lake water to the yangtze river and Œ¥18o values figs 7 and 8 the efflux rate is higher during the non flooding period than during the flooding period june august which is closely associated with the hydraulic gradient between the poyang lake and yangtze river across seasons however in october the outlier rate resulted from the backflow of the yangtze river to the poyang lake according to the spatial pattern of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in october the backflow of the yangtze river water transports approximately 45 km southward into poyang lake fig 8b using hydrodynamic modeling li et al 2017 reported that the backflow disturbs the normal northward water flow direction in the poyang lake and transports mass 20 km southward into the lake similarly the efflux rate of the poyang lake to the yangtze river ranges from 10 8 in july to 78 7 in april using the stable isotopes zhan et al 2016 which is related with the tgd regulation wu et al 2018 also found that the seasonal efflux rate of the lake to the yangtze river reached 75 during the impoundment period of tgd the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of the yangtze river water become more positive in the downstream zone than those in the upstream zone of the yangtze river table 1 indicating that the lake water has a great impact on downstream river water the tgd impoundment resulted in a decrease in water discharge and a quick lowering of water level in the mainstream of the yangtze river this caused an increase in the outflow discharge and accelerated the emptying effect of poyang lake especially in dry seasons lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 under the dual influence of hydrological drought events and the impoundment of the tgd lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the worsening of the river lake interaction of poyang lake and its potential impacts on the lake ecosystem raised great concerns for the local management authorities and scientists li 2009 the proposed poyang lake hydraulic engineering project is planned to regulate the lake hydrology and ecological level especially for dry seasons however the effects of this project on wetland ecology and the water environment still remain debated because of the complex river lake interaction the interaction processes remarkably change the nutrient illumination intensity and suspended particle loads in the mixing zone this condition at surface became favorable for algal growth and thus the findings of the interaction processes provide important suggestions for controlling eutrophication and algal blooms in the mixing zone ran et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 hence future research should focus on the complex interactions between the poyang lake and yangtze river to better understand the transport of pollutants and solutes around the confluence zone of the yangtze river and poyang lake 5 conclusions in this study we explored the controlling factors on isotopic compositions Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of precipitation river and lake water on a spatial scale across seasons river and lake water isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o exhibited high temporal heterogeneity across seasons but their spatial differences were not remarkable the isotopic patterns of lake water are largely influenced by the isotopic compositions of precipitation and rivers and lake hydrodynamic mixing processes in poyang lake as evidently shown by the variations of d excess in lake water relative to river and precipitation the homogenous patterns of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in lake water also suggested that the poyang lake is a well mixed lake in spatial scale compared with lake water the lower lc excess and d excess values were found in river water indicating the greater evaporative enrichment because of river water flow regulation in the poyang lake watershed water level and discharge from gauge stations hukou and jiujiang fluctuated which is indicative of remarkable interactions between poyang lake and yangtze river during the observed periods the efflux rate of lake water to the yangtze river based on stable isotopes ranging from 17 9 to 67 9 whereas the outlier rate resulted from the backflow of the yangtze river to the poyang lake in october this study clearly demonstrated that river and lake water isotopic composition is a sensitive recorder of seasonal and spatial variability in monsoon rainfall patterns improved understanding of the basin hydrology of the monsoon fed poyang lake watershed and further observation of the spatio temporal evolution of river lake water isotopes in monsoonal zone may help to develop integrated river lake management strategies for the future dealing with water scarcity flood and drought mitigation and sustainable river resources for food production credit authorship contribution statement huawu wu conceptualization methodology software writing

5043,global mangrove forests have exhibited distinct changes in past decades owing to diverse environmental gradients and regional anthropogenic activities previous studies have mainly reported alarming mangrove loss however few studies have focused on the process of mangrove expansion and its driving factors remain unclear by integrating medium resolution landsat surface reflectance products and meteorological hydrological and bathymetric data the current study investigates the spatiotemporal changes of mangrove forests in shenzhen inner bay szib of china over the past thirty years and the relationship between mangrove changes and natural and anthropogenic factors was also identified the results reveal that the area of mangrove forests in the szib increased at a rapid rate of 8 9 ha yr despite sea level rise reaching 527 1 ha in 2017 no statistically significant correlation between mangrove area and winter temperature and precipitation was found whereas a significant positive correlation occurred between mangrove area and sea level rise in contrast to the common consensus human activities affected the szib mangroves in two distinct ways on the one hand the area of mangrove deforestation occurred on 23 5 ha and 6 8 ha in the futian and mai po reserves respectively with reforestation campaigns only compensating for 5 6 ha of the mangrove area lost in the futian reserve on the other hand the reduced tidal prism due to the implementation of the shenzhen bay land reclamation project szblrp resulted in significant deposition in the szib which counterbalanced the negative effect of sea level rise contributing to 209 9 ha of mangrove expansion by providing suitable accommodation space and accounting for 78 4 of the total mangrove gain moreover the morphological adjustments in the szib caused by the shenzhen river regulation project szrrp also had a significant influence on the mangrove extent and distribution with the mangrove expansion area of 22 7 ha being contributed by the szrrp accounting for 8 5 of the total mangrove expansion the findings of the current study indicate that with the increased sediment supply and accretion rate induced by anthropogenic activities mangrove forests with limited land retreat space can still expand in the face of sea level rise keywords mangrove remote sensing sea level rise land reclamation river regulation works shenzhen bay 1 introduction mangrove forests are evergreen woody communities that exhibit salt tolerance and are periodically submerged in seawater in the intertidal zones of the tropics and subtropics giri et al 2015 they are unique and essential ecosystems that provide a wealth of valuable ecological and socioeconomic goods and services estoque et al 2018 for example mangrove forests play a prominent role by creating habitats for a variety of terrestrial fauna and providing various supplies for local communities shrestha et al 2019 they help in the accumulation of sediment nutrients and pollutants thus maintaining a healthy coastal environment alongi 2002 in addition mangroves can capture large amounts of carbon and are estimated to store up to four times as much carbon per unit area compared to terrestrial forest ecosystems donato et al 2011 furthermore mangroves act as coastal barriers to protect shorelines against erosion and flooding thus relieving the devastating impacts of natural hazards giri et al 2007 despite the multiple benefits provided mangroves worldwide are facing immense pressure from environmental changes like sea level rise drought and freezing events and hurricanes galeano et al 2017 han et al 2018 and from aggravated human activities such as excessive deforestation land use change and coastal reclamation meyfroidt and lambin 2008 krauss et al 2014 hence understanding the feedback mechanisms of mangrove forests in response to natural and anthropogenic impacts is crucial an in situ field survey is an ideal approach to monitor land cover changes however due to the relatively large distribution scale periodic submergence and complex morphology it is time consuming and costly to conduct field campaigns to monitor mangrove changes rather than field observations remote sensing can efficiently capture repetitive geoscience information for inaccessible regions over a long period kuenzer et al 2011 and has therefore been widely used to characterize mangrove forest changes at broad spatial and temporal scales giri et al 2011 previous studies have highlighted the alarming rates at which mangroves in many sites have been degraded for instance valiela et al 2001 estimated that more than one third of mangroves were lost across southeast asia between the 1980s and 1990s primarily due to aquaculture expansion blum and roberts 2009 reported a 4900 km2 loss of coastal wetlands in the mississippi river delta since 1932 due to the combined effect of sea level rise and land subsidence moreover servino et al 2018 attributed over 500 ha of mangrove loss in eastern brazil to a devastating hailstorm nevertheless an increasing trend in mangrove coverage was also found recently richards and friess 2016 jayanthi et al 2018 suggesting that mangrove forests exhibit distinct responses to different external impacts although the above results provide a valuable perspective on mangrove forest changes at the continental or regional scales few studies have involved a quantitative analysis of the impacts of natural changes or anthropogenic activities on mangroves and knowledge on the mechanisms behind mangrove expansion is still in its infancy moreover previous studies regarding mangrove detection were generally not at sufficient temporal resolutions which hinders the study of detailed gain and loss processes of mangroves the shenzhen inner bay szib mangrove community is the only mangrove ecosystem situated in the urban hinterland of china it has diverse mangrove species and functions as a landing area for a large number of rare and endangered bird species that migrate from siberia to australia which hence has received considerable attention given its prominent ecological value huang et al 2012 su et al 2014 as a pioneer in china s reform and opening policy the shenzhen special economic zone has witnessed rapid economic development and a sharply booming human population over the past forty years however the increasing demand for living space and commercial land drove significant land cover changes which inevitably had profound impacts on nearby environments the large scale shenzhen bay land reclamation project szblrp implemented along the northern and western coasts of the szib during 1988 2006 significantly decreased seawater coverage and caused pronounced sedimentation in the szib qin et al 2002 moreover the shenzhen river regulation project szrrp jointly implemented by the shenzhen and hong kong governments greatly altered the amount of water and sediment entering the szib thereby triggering remarkable morphological adjustments zhang et al 2005 meanwhile natural changes like sea level rise and extreme cold events have occurred in the szib zhang and mao 2015 liang et al 2018 despite such environmental changes and strong human interventions in its vicinity the mangrove forests in szib have rapidly increased in recent decades jia et al 2016 previous studies regarding the szib have mainly documented the impact of human activities on hydrodynamics sediment transport and morphological adjustments wang et al 2011 feng et al 2020 and few have focused on the extent and distribution of mangrove forests not to mention the mechanisms behind their rapid expansion consequently investigating the spatiotemporal changes in the mangrove forests of the szib is of particular concern for understanding the roles of natural changes and anthropogenic activities in mangrove expansion in this study we monitored the long term changes in mangrove forests in the szib of china from a time series of medium resolution satellite images and investigated their relationship to natural and anthropogenic factors using synchronized meteorological hydrological and bathymetric data the objectives of this research are to i characterize the extent and distribution changes of the mangrove forests in the szib over the past three decades and ii assess the extent to which mangrove changes were controlled by natural and anthropogenic factors 2 study area located in south china 22 28 22 32 n and 113 54 114 2 e shenzhen bay is a half enclosed and shallow bay connected to the pearl river delta with a total area of 90 km2 and an average depth of 2 9 m a subtropical monsoon climate prevails in shenzhen bay with an average annual air temperature of 22 4 c the average annual rainfall between 1965 and 2016 was 1664 mm of which greater than 84 occurred between april and september the tidal system in shenzhen bay is characterized as semidiurnal tides with an annual average tidal range of 1 4 m the szib mangrove community is located in the northeastern corner of shenzhen bay and is separated by the shenzhen river fig 1 the futian and mai po mangrove reserves which are situated on the southern coast along shenzhen and the northwestern coast of the new territories of hong kong special administrative region respectively constitute the szib mangrove ecosystem the futian mangrove community consists of avicennia marina kandelia candel sonneratia caseolaris sonneratia apetala and aegiceras corniculatum of which a marina and k candel are the dominant mangrove species xiao et al 2007 the futian mangrove provincial natural conservation area was established in october 1984 and was upgraded to one of china s national nature reserves in april 1988 the mangrove species in mai po are much more diverse than those in the futian but the dominant mangrove species are similar tam and wong 2000 due to its rich biodiversity the mai po mangrove forest was designated as a wetland of international importance under the ramsar convention in september 1995 3 data and methods the procedures used herein involved two main steps the first step focused on identifying the land cover changes in the szib over the past thirty years the second focused on quantifying the impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on mangrove changes to facilitate reading and understanding a flow chart outlining the method used is presented in fig 2 3 1 data acquisition landsat 5 thematic mapper tm and landsat 8 operational land imager oli atmospherically corrected images with a 30 m resolution were used for monitoring the spatial and temporal mangrove forest changes in the szib considering the relatively small szib coverage ten landsat surface reflectance products path row 122 44 free of cloud cover in the szib between 1988 and 2017 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earthexplorer website https earthexplorer usgs gov the surface reflectance data of landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli were generated by the usgs using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps and landsat surface reflectance code lasrc algorithms respectively these data were processed as level 1 terrain corrected lit scenes with the highest geometric accuracy through geometric correction by ground control points and a digital elevation model dem the images were projected into the universal transverse mercator utm coordinate system with the datum of wgs 84 all images were captured between october and december to prevent potential phenological bias with tidal levels ranging from 0 62 m to 0 74 m in addition to the satellite data monthly average precipitation and hourly tidal level data from the chiwan tidal gauge station situated at the offshore boundary of shenzhen bay were also collected from the shenzhen hydrological data yearbook the daily air temperature of the lau fau shan meteorological station was downloaded from the hong kong observatory http gb weather gov hk furthermore bathymetric data of the szib at a scale of 1 5000 as well as the annual sediment delivery from shenzhen river were collected from the municipal shenzhen river regulation office unpublished data the plane coordinate system of each bathymetric chart was the shenzhen independent coordinate system with the vertical datum of huanghai 1956 the specific locations and observational periods as well as the data sources are summarized in table 1 table 1 details of the employed satellite images and the meteorological hydrological and bathymetric data used in the current study note cw chiwan lfs lau fau shan szr shenzhen river szib shenzhen inner bay msrro municipal shenzhen river regulation office szhdy shenzhen hydrological data yearbook and hko hong kong observatory 3 2 data pre processing and ground data collection given that the coverage of the szib is relatively small in terms of the acquired satellite image the study area was extracted as a rectangular subset of the satellite images to reduce unnecessary classification fig 3 a six land cover classes including mangrove urban land water bodies forest shrub area intertidal area and aquaculture were identified as the main land cover types in the szib according to the previous study by jia et al 2016 who explored the landscape pattern dynamics of the szib by means of object oriented classification on historical landsat images obtaining reliable ground truth points is a crucial prerequisite for accurate land cover classification the extracted landsat images were composed as color images using the combination of bands 4 5 and 3 and bands 5 6 and 4 as red green blue rgb for landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli images respectively which was found to be an effective way to distinguish mangrove and non mangrove areas since the reflectance spectra of mangrove is visibly different from that of other land cover types in short wave infrared regions under this band combination fig 4 ground truth points of the six main land cover types in each image were first manually identified and inspected based on color shape and texture and their associated characteristics to justify the reliability of the selected ground truth points and modify the potentially misclassified points high resolution historical images of the szib that were free of cloud cover were acquired from google earth http www google com earth fig 3b the capture dates of google earth data were 1 november 2013 and 20 november 2017 with corresponding tidal levels at chiwan of 0 45 m and 0 25 m respectively additionally field surveys were conducted on 1 december 2010 and 17 may 2019 to identify ground truth points by collecting development histories from local management and interviewing technical experts and elderly people the total number of ground truth points for the different images ranged from 139 to 204 with less than half of the total being used in the training site polygons whereas the remaining data were treated as validation site polygons 3 3 image classification and validation the supervised support vector machine classification method was used to classify each image the categories of water bodies and intertidal area were treated as a single class in the classified result as were the categories of urban land and forest shrub area since the main objective was to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in mangrove forests post classification editing was performed by visually removing isolated noise and correcting the apparently misclassified areas for example some aquaculture categories misclassified as water bodies due to reflectance overlap in the green spectral region were corrected because aquaculture ponds have a visible polygonal shape with surrounding fences mangrove classes that were misclassified as forest shrub area in inland were corrected because mangrove survival requires suitable seawater inundation conditions four accuracy parameters including producer s accuracy user s accuracy overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient were calculated on each classified map based on validation datasets with the aim of evaluating the classification accuracy 3 4 mangrove change detection the area and percentage of land cover categories in each classified map were first calculated to explore their temporal changes and the spatial variations in the area weighted centroids of the mangrove forests were calculated to investigate the spatial patterns of the szib mangrove changes over the past three decades the conversion metrics between the mangrove and other land cover categories from 1988 to 2017 and within two consecutive periods were then calculated to explore the underlying reason behind mangrove changes in the szib 3 5 linking mangrove changes to natural and anthropogenic factors to investigate the relationships between mangrove changes and natural drivers correlation analysis was conducted between mangrove coverage and the annual mean sea level winter temperature and precipitation a natural factor was considered to be significant in relation to mangrove area if the p value of the linear relationship was smaller than 0 01 additionally the correlation between mangrove area changes due to water bodies conversion and tidal prism variations was examined during the implementation of the szblrp to explore the extent to which this project may account for mangrove changes the tidal prism in shenzhen bay was calculated based on the area extent of seawater identified by satellite images and the synchronous tidal ranges at chiwan furthermore the impact of the szrrp on mangrove forests was explored through the relationship between bathymetric changes and mangrove area variations due to water bodies conversion during the three time intervals of 2006 2009 2009 2013 and 2013 2017 the acquired bathymetric data were first georeferenced to satellite images using fifteen fixed benchmarks of which the transformation relationship between the shenzhen independent coordinate and the wgs 1984 coordinate system was known the average bathymetric changes at the locations of mangrove area variations were then extracted using spatial joint in arcgis and the bathymetric changes in 2009 2013 and 2013 2017 were cumulated with the bathymetric changes in the previous period to consider the potential temporal lag between the bathymetric changes and mangrove area variations 4 results 4 1 land cover analysis 4 1 1 performance of classification the overall accuracy of the ten classified images ranged from 90 3 to 97 4 with the kappa coefficient ranging from 0 87 to 0 96 indicating satisfactory accuracy in the classification results table 2 presents the four accuracy parameters of the classification results of each image the producer s accuracy and user s accuracy of all classified categories in the ten images were well within the acceptable range suggesting that the classification results were sufficiently accurate to monitor the spatiotemporal changes in the land cover of the szib 4 1 2 temporal variations in land cover dynamics the classification map of the szib between 1988 and 2017 demonstrated significant spatial and temporal changes in each land cover within this period fig 5 over 1688 ha of water bodies were lost due to the implementation of land reclamation between 1988 and 2006 table 3 the overall aquaculture area decreased by 52 8 leaving 610 4 ha in 2017 and nearly 94 of this loss occurred in shenzhen land reclamation and aquaculture squeeze has contributed to the rapid urbanization of shenzhen over 2151 ha of urban land was gained in shenzhen from 1988 to 2006 in contrast to shenzhen the change in urban land area in hong kong near the mangroves was insignificant and has been maintained at approximately 428 ha over the past thirty years the average aquaculture area of hong kong in the szib was 558 7 ha during 1988 2017 which was in line with the 540 ha of aquaculture coverage reported by afcd 2011 mangrove coverage increased from 259 6 ha in 1988 to 527 1 ha in 2017 with an increase rate of 8 9 ha yr which is in agreement with the result of jia et al 2016 significant spatial and temporal variations were found in the area extent of mangrove forest in the szib the mangrove area in the mai po reserve steadily increased from 196 ha in 1988 to 415 ha in 2017 whereas the area of mangrove forests in the futian reserve decreased from 63 5 ha in 1988 to 53 6 ha in 1998 which was equivalent to a loss of 15 6 relative to the area in 1988 after that the degraded futian mangroves gradually recovered to their original level and consistently increased by 48 6 ha reaching 112 1 ha in 2017 the spatial variations in the area weighted centroids of mangrove forests indicated that the szib mangrove exhibited an overall outward migration trend during 1988 2017 fig 6 with a determination coefficient r 2 of the fitting results for mangrove centroid changes in the futian and mai po reserves of 0 57 and 0 68 respectively the area weighted centroids of the futian mangrove extended 426 8 m to the southeastern direction over the past three decades with the most pronounced migration occurring during 1991 1995 235 m it should be noted that 120 5 m of northwestern movement was uncovered in the spatial change of futian mangrove centroids during 1998 2001 which was mainly attributed to the growth of mangrove forests along the fringe of the feng tang river within this period in the case of mai po the area weighted mangrove centroids gradually migrated seaward for 477 5 m in a clockwise direction during 1988 2017 with an average moving distance of 15 9 m yr 4 1 3 conversion of mangroves in shenzhen inner bay the relative contributions of other land cover categories to mangrove area changes in the szib between 1988 and 2017 fig 7 demonstrated that the conversion from water bodies played a vital role in mangrove expansion as it accounted for 133 9 and 93 8 of the mangrove expansion in the futian and mai po reserves respectively the contributions of aquaculture and urban land to mangrove forests in these two reserves were completely opposite the 6 2 ha and 10 4 ha of mangrove loss in the futian reserve were caused by conversion to aquaculture and urban land respectively whereas 13 5 ha of mangroves were gained in the mai po reserve from the conversion of aquaculture and the net conversion between mangrove and urban land in the mai po reserve was insignificant there were substantial temporal differences in the mangrove conversion dynamics between the futian and mai po reserves during 1988 2017 in the case of the futian reserve 65 1 ha of mangroves were consistently gained from water bodies with pronounced conversion occurring during 1998 2001 13 2 ha and 2013 2017 16 5 ha however 23 7 ha of mangroves were lost to urban land and aquaculture between 1988 and 1998 which is consistent with the result described by he 2004 that over 20 ha of mangroves were degraded owing to urban and industry expansion along the coastline of shenzhen although 5 1 ha of mangroves were subsequently gained from urban land and aquaculture during 1998 2004 a total of 16 6 ha of mangroves were lost in the futian reserve from 1988 to 2017 due to human interference compared to the futian reserve the mai po reserve witnessed rapid mangrove expansion due to water bodies conversion with the gain primarily occurring during 1991 1995 42 7 ha and 1998 2001 39 ha despite the insignificant net conversion between urban land and mangroves during the past three decades 3 6 ha of the mai po mangroves were lost to urban land in 1991 1995 but this loss was soon counterbalanced by later gains almost 13 ha of mangroves in the mai po reserve were gained from aquaculture over the past thirty years with the main conversion occurring in 1995 1998 5 5 ha which was closely related to fishpond reconfiguration near tsim bei tsui afcd 2011 4 2 relationship between mangrove area and natural factors accelerating sea level rise annual precipitation patterns and freeze events have been considered three dominant natural factors affecting the mangrove area and distribution in sites with low hurricane frequency simard et al 2019 the long term temporal variations in annual sea level precipitation and winter temperature in shenzhen bay were examined to detect whether there were significant change trends in the past decades fig 8 a significant increasing trend was detected for the annual sea level of shenzhen bay over the past forty years with a mean increase rate of 2 2 mm yr standardized precipitation index spi values covering 12 months were calculated to assess the temporal variation in the rainfall pattern the calculated spi values showed that precipitation fluctuated remarkably over the past fifty years but no drought event occurred within this period with all spi values above 1 the temporal change in the winter temperature of shenzhen bay during 1986 2017 was negligible with an average winter temperature of 16 1 c the extreme low temperature was 3 5 c in 2016 which is much higher than the threshold low temperature of 7 c that mangrove forests can tolerate osland et al 2013 to test whether the mangrove changes in the szib over the past thirty years were related to natural factors correlation analysis was conducted between mangrove coverage and annual sea level winter temperature and precipitation fig 9 both winter temperature and precipitation showed little correlation with the mangrove area changes with the p value being larger than 0 01 indicating that the impacts of these two natural factors on mangrove forests in the szib over the past three decades were negligible a significant positive correlation was found between sea level and mangrove area during 1988 2009 with a r 2 of 0 79 however sea level rise is expected to have a tremendous negative effect on mangrove forests as it prolongs the inundation duration and causes a hypersaline environment thereby leading to mangrove decay especially in places where the landward retreat space is occupied therefore this abnormal positive correlation indicated that there was another factor governing mangrove changes as it enabled the mangrove forests to adjust their bed level at a rate that matched or even exceeded the rate of sea level rise thereby counterbalancing its adverse impact on mangrove forests 4 3 impacts of human activities on mangrove forests 4 3 1 deforestation and reforestation despite an overall increasing trend mangrove deforestation also occurred in the szib over the past thirty years more than 23 ha of mangrove forests in the futian reserve were lost to urban land or aquaculture during 1988 1998 with the most striking decrease occurring in 1991 fig 7 accounting for 15 8 of the futian mangrove area that year the primary reason for the futian mangrove loss was that the increasing demand for living accommodations and commercial land in the urbanization process of shenzhen overwhelmed the idea of protecting the mangrove ecosystems thereby leading to rapid urban development at the cost of mangrove deterioration he 2004 reported that a great number of urban construction projects have been launched along the shenzhen coastline since 1991 including the shenzhen coastal avenue guangshen expressway and xin zhou river and feng tang river drainage engineering as well as real estate development leading to significant mangrove loss and degradation and reduction in the ecosystem services provided by the mangroves fortunately this shortsighted policy was soon abolished when society and the authorities realized the value of mangrove forests reforestation campaigns were therefore implemented to restore the futian mangroves resulting in a total of 5 6 ha of mangroves gained from urban land and aquaculture between 1998 and 2004 fig 7 compared to the futian reserve the direct impact of human pressure on mangrove forests in the mai po reserve was limited in 1988 2017 under the protection and conservation of the ramsar convention framework according to the development concept of the ramsar convention and the existing configurations of mai po the agriculture fisheries and conservation department afcd of hong kong delineated the mai po area into different management zones with the wetland conservation area and buffer area being proper determined fig 10 a any private development that could undermine the mangrove forests would be required to perform compensatory projects to mitigate its negative ecological impacts afcd 2011 the effectiveness of this management approach was mirrored by the conversion relationship between the mai po mangrove and the nearby urban area was overall insignificant during 1988 2017 with the mangrove loss due to urban land expansion soon being compensated fig 7 however it is important to note that 6 8 ha of mai po mangroves were lost in 2013 2017 to maintain the flood capacity of the shan pui river afcd 2011 such mangrove loss was ascribed to human intervention other maintenance mangrove removal was also undertaken by afcd 2011 to avoid the further adverse impacts of the exotic mangrove sonneratia on native species fig 10b 4 3 2 shenzhen bay land reclamation project to alleviate the increasing pressure of urban land demand for further urbanization of shenzhen the large scale shenzhen bay land reclamation project szblrp was implemented along the northern and western coasts of the szib from 1988 to 2006 rather than causing mangrove deforestation this project witnessed rapid mangrove expansion as a remarkable increase occurred within the construction period therefore the mangrove area changes due to water bodies conversion were examined in relation to the tidal prism variations during 1988 2006 to explore the potential impact of the szblrp on the mangrove forests the shenzhen urban land significantly increased from 1194 3 ha in 1988 to 3346 ha in 2006 and then plateaued afterward fig 11 a in parallel with the urban land increase the tidal prism of shenzhen bay dramatically decreased by 19 8 from 1 41 108 m3 in 1988 to 1 13 108 m3 in 2006 due to the szblrp mangrove expansion during 1988 2006 due to water bodies conversion produced a significant negative correlation with tidal prism changes with a r 2 of 0 85 fig 11b in other words a total of 187 9 ha of mangrove expansion area which accounted for 70 2 of the total mangrove gain was contributed by the tidal prism variations due to the szblr highlighting the significant influence of the szblr on mangrove expansion in the szib 4 3 3 shenzhen river regulation project as a natural border between shenzhen and hong kong the shenzhen river is the largest tributary entering shenzhen bay however the return period of flood in the shenzhen river was only 2 5 years due to its short travel time and narrow meandering river channel chan and lee 2010 to relieve flood hazards and improve the flood control capacity the shenzhen river regulation project szrrp was jointly implemented by the shenzhen and hong kong governments the flood control capacity of the shenzhen river was improved after its implementation however the water and sediment regimes altered by the szrrp have triggered remarkable morphological adjustments in the szib and may have a significant impact on the extent and distribution of mangroves therefore the mangrove changes during 2006 2017 due to water bodies conversion were examined in association with the cumulative bathymetric changes to explore the extent to which the szrrp may have been responsible for the mangrove changes the mangrove changes due to water bodies conversion exhibited an overall seaward expansion trend after the completion of the szrrp with pronounced spatial variations fig 12 mangrove expansion occurred primarily on the southwestern coast of the mai po reserve between 2006 and 2017 and the southern coast of the futian reserve between 2013 and 2017 whereas mangrove losses were mainly distributed along the edge of the futian reserve in 2006 2009 notably 6 7 ha of mangroves were lost to water bodies in 2013 2017 to improve the flood capacity of the shan pui river in hong kong correlation analysis between the cumulative bathymetric changes and mangrove area variations showed a statistically significant relationship during 2013 2017 r 2 0 84 p 0 01 n 44 indicating that the mangrove gain area of 21 8 ha within this period was contributed by bathymetric changes between 2009 and 2017 however no statistically significant relationship was detected between the mangrove area variations and cumulative bathymetric changes during 2006 2009 and 2009 2013 with both the r 2 being less than 0 1 interestingly over 12 ha and 9 ha of mangrove expansion within these two periods occurred at sites where bathymetric changes were less than 0 in other words the mangrove forests in these erosion sites still expanded seaward given that no other human interference occurred it is reasonable to speculate that the szblrp was responsible for these mangrove expansion as it left sufficient accommodation capital that enabled the mangroves to consistently expand at the sites despite the bed erosion a significant correlation between the mangrove area variations and cumulative bathymetric changes was found when excluding these points with the r 2 increasing to 0 82 and 0 86 suggesting that 0 9 ha and 2 ha of mangrove area gains and 0 7 ha and 1 3 ha of mangrove area losses in 2006 2009 and 2009 2013 respectively were contributed by the morphological adjustments caused by the szrrp additionally it is important to note that the positive intercept of the fitting line for the relationship between the cumulative bathymetric changes and the mangrove area changes during 2013 2017 indicated that the szib mangrove will continue to expand due to the accommodation capital left by the szrrp if sediment supply remains at present level overall human activities had two distinct effects on the szib mangrove forests over the past three decades on the one hand the szblr and the szrrp contributed 209 9 ha and 22 7 ha of mangrove expansion respectively accounting for 78 4 and 8 5 of the total mangrove gain on the other hand 23 5 ha and 6 8 ha of mangrove forests were lost in the futian and mai po reserves respectively due to urban land and aquaculture conversion and river channelization with reforestation campaigns only compensating 5 6 ha of the mangrove loss in the futian reserve 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in mangrove change detection in the current study long time series land classification maps of the szib were interpreted using ten landsat surface reflectance products spanning thirty years and the conversion relationships between the mangrove forests and other land cover types were studied to investigate the potential reason behind the mangrove changes the spatial coherence and tidal inundation consistency across the different images were thus essential especially for the relatively small study area the landsat level 1 data used in the current study were geo referenced using several ground control points and a digital elevation model dem so the spatial bias between the different images was negligible however it is difficult to find long term time series cloud free satellite images with identical tidal levels at the acquisition date additionally due to the lack of synchronization data the instantaneous tidal level at the acquisition dates of the images in 2013 and 2017 was calculated using nine main astronomic components derived from harmonic analysis with a standard deviation of 0 14 m which was the unfavorable factor for mangrove change detection these sources of error can be minimized by adopting satellite images with a relatively uniform tidal level at capture time most images used in the current study were acquired with an instantaneous tidal level less than 0 35 m indicating that nearly all of the mangroves were exposed above the sea surface in these images jia et al 2016 the relatively high tide level of 0 74 m in 2004 may have led to an underestimation of the area of mangrove forests gained from water bodies as a consequence of the szblrp another potential source of uncertainty stems from the selection process for the ground truth points accurate determination of ground truth points is a prerequisite for classification however the majority of the ground truth points used in the current study were obtained from visual interpretation in terms of color texture and shape of different land cover types which lacks objectivity synchronized high resolution google earth images and field surveys provided a solid reference for choosing the ground truth points but these data covered only a limited amount of time and mangrove misclassification may have unavoidably occurred in the mixed pixels adjacent to other land cover types in addition there was no agreement concerning what the classification method should be used under different spatial scales and land cover characteristics civco et al 2002 noted that each classification method has its own merit and no method has been regarded as the best way to perform land cover classification although these inherent weaknesses may have biased the classification results the adverse effects were minimized by adopting strict and consistent differentiated standards for different land cover categories in the classification process with the aid of local technical experts and the classification accuracy showed that the classified results using the support vector machine algorithm were reliable fig 10b shows the extent and distribution of the mai po mangroves in 2010 which were interpreted by the afcd using high resolution aerial photographs indicating good agreement in mangrove forests mapping between the current result and that of the previous study 5 2 positive effect of human activities on mangrove expansion previous studies have highlighted the negative effect of human interventions like urban and agricultural expansion kirwan and murray 2007 hu et al 2018 industrial harbors godoy et al 2018 and upstream damming lu and siew 2006 on mangrove forests while the positive effects of human activities have mainly been reported from reforestation campaigns sakho et al 2011 li et al 2013 in contrast to the common consensus the recent rapid mangrove expansion in the szib can primarily be attributed to the implementation of the szblrp and the szrrp therefore it is important to explore the positive feedback of mangrove forests in response to these two human activities to better understand the driving factors behind mangrove expansion the implementation of the szblrp significantly decreased the seawater coverage and resulted in reduced tidal prism which triggered severe sedimentation in the szib thereby providing suitable accommodation space for mangroves to expand seaward the tidal prism of shenzhen bay drastically decreased by 2 8 107 m3 during 1988 2006 as a consequence of the decreased seawater area caused by the szblrp the reduced tidal prism resulted in decreased seawater entering shenzhen bay and decreased shear stress at the bed bottom which favored deposition these phenomena have been demonstrated by ni et al 1998 and wang et al 2009 who documented that the sedimentation rate in 1996 was almost two fold larger than that in 1986 and a new intertidal area gradually formed near the river mouth this pronounced deposition not only facilitated the dispersal of mangrove seedlings but also provided additional migration space and thus contributed to mangrove seaward colonization in the face of sea level rise the implementation of the szrrp altered the flow and sediment conditions entering shenzhen bay leading to remarkable morphological changes in the szib which had a significant impact on the mangrove distribution the temporal variation in the sediment load from the shenzhen river showed landward sediment delivery between 2007 and 2008 fig 13 a in addition increased tidal water flowed into the wider and deeper shenzhen river channel immediately after the completion of the szrrp resulting in an increased tidal prism that favored erosion in the szib these were reflected by the intertidal area of the szib decreasing from 6 8 106 m2 in 2006 to 4 7 106 m2 in 2009 fig 13b the decreased intertidal area and sediment deficiency impeded the capacity of mangroves to keep pace with sea level rise and may have caused mangrove decay by shrinking the potential accommodation space and prolonging the inundation time however this adverse effect was already overwhelmed by the accommodation capital left by the szblrp and the mangroves showed overall seaward expansion during this period afterward continuous siltation occurred in the shenzhen river to achieve a new equilibrium state between the hydrodynamic and sediment dynamics and riverbed boundaries which was accompanied with a reduced tidal prism and increased sediment delivery thus resulting in a 1 7 106 m2 intertidal area increase during 2009 2017 this enlarged intertidal area provided a suitable inundation environment and eventually contributed to seaward mangrove expansion within this period duan et al 2017 reported that mangrove forests in the szib will continue to expand if the accretion rate of the szib remains at the present level which is consistent with the finding of the current study that the mangrove extent shows an increasing trend owing to the accommodation capital left by the szrrp however with the strong anthropogenic activities in the development process of the socialist demonstration area and the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area the future response of the szib mangrove forests to growing anthropogenic activities deserves future investigation 5 3 the future resilience of mangrove forests to sea level rise due to the increasing visible pressure of global climate changes on delta and coastal ecosystems the question of how future mangrove forests may evolve is of great interest for wetland scientists and government policymakers and an expansive body of research has thus been undertaken to investigate the response of mangrove forests to sea level rise which has been considered the major natural force driving mangrove dynamics duncan et al 2017 cohen et al 2018 the growth and expansion of mangrove forests require proper hydrodynamic and salinity conditions and rising sea level is expected to prolong the inundation duration and to increase the water salinity which may result in mangrove loss woodroffe et al 2016 there is evidence that mangrove forests exhibit self capacity to adjust the bed level at a rate that matches sea level rise by means of their intrinsic biological feedback mechanisms including sediment trapping of leaves and pneumatophores and organic decomposition of below ground biomass mckee et al 2007 if the rate of sea level rise surpasses the adjustment rate the mangrove forests may undergo landward retreat to maintain suitable submergence and salinity conditions schuerch et al 2018 meantime the amount of upstream sediment delivery has been regarded as an important factor affecting the resilience of mangrove forests to sea level rise lovelock et al 2015 mangrove forests will be able to keep pace with or even exceed sea level rise if a new suitable inundation area is provided by adequate sediment supply nevertheless with the accelerating sea level rise due to increasing anthropogenic co2 emissions growing sediment starvation due to upstream damming and squeezing landward retreat space due to coastal urban and industrial developments kondolf et al 2014 willemsen et al 2016 perera et al 2018 the future prospect of mangrove forests is far from optimistic duke et al 2007 even suggested that 2100 may see the end of mangrove forests however the current study found that despite sea level rise and occupied landward retreat space the area of mangrove forests in the szib has rapidly increased over the past three decades the underlying mechanism responsible for this is that the implementation of the szblrp triggered pronounced deposition in the szib which counteracted the negative effects of sea level rise on mangrove forests and offered additional seaward accommodation space hence contributing to the rapid mangrove expansion of the szib this counterintuitive mangrove expansion gives us certain confidence that the mangrove forests in which landward retreat space was limited and upstream sediment input was shortage can still show resilient behavior to sea level rise with the help of a human induced sedimentation environment therefore it is reasonable to speculate that at sites that resemble shenzhen bay where coastal reclamation becomes a typical feature seaward accommodation space caused by sedimentation provides an alternative outlet for mangrove forests in the face of sea level rise 6 conclusions the current study monitored the spatiotemporal changes in mangrove forests in the szib between 1988 and 2017 using landsat surface reflectance data and examined their changes with respect to natural changes and anthropogenic activities the results revealed that the mangrove forests in the szib consistently increased from 259 6 ha to 527 1 ha during 1988 2017 of which 81 8 occurred in the mai po reserve the mangrove area changes were weakly correlated with the annual winter temperature and annual precipitation but produced a significant positive correlation with sea level rise in contrast to the common consensus mangrove deforestation and reforestation were found across the futian and mai po reserves but only to a limited extent the correlation analyses indicated that 78 4 and 8 5 of the total mangrove area gains were contributed by the szblrp and szrrp respectively as they provided additional accommodation space for mangroves to migrate seaward despite sea level rise such an expansion trend will continue if sediment supply remains at present levels we concluded that rather than inevitable inundation by sea level rise mangrove forests may show an increasing trend if additional seaward accommodation space can be created by anthropogenic activities these findings are useful for understanding mangrove forest dynamics in response to natural and anthropogenic factors and the results provide scientists and policymakers with guidelines for mangrove protection and conservation in the face of sea level rise in integrated

5043,global mangrove forests have exhibited distinct changes in past decades owing to diverse environmental gradients and regional anthropogenic activities previous studies have mainly reported alarming mangrove loss however few studies have focused on the process of mangrove expansion and its driving factors remain unclear by integrating medium resolution landsat surface reflectance products and meteorological hydrological and bathymetric data the current study investigates the spatiotemporal changes of mangrove forests in shenzhen inner bay szib of china over the past thirty years and the relationship between mangrove changes and natural and anthropogenic factors was also identified the results reveal that the area of mangrove forests in the szib increased at a rapid rate of 8 9 ha yr despite sea level rise reaching 527 1 ha in 2017 no statistically significant correlation between mangrove area and winter temperature and precipitation was found whereas a significant positive correlation occurred between mangrove area and sea level rise in contrast to the common consensus human activities affected the szib mangroves in two distinct ways on the one hand the area of mangrove deforestation occurred on 23 5 ha and 6 8 ha in the futian and mai po reserves respectively with reforestation campaigns only compensating for 5 6 ha of the mangrove area lost in the futian reserve on the other hand the reduced tidal prism due to the implementation of the shenzhen bay land reclamation project szblrp resulted in significant deposition in the szib which counterbalanced the negative effect of sea level rise contributing to 209 9 ha of mangrove expansion by providing suitable accommodation space and accounting for 78 4 of the total mangrove gain moreover the morphological adjustments in the szib caused by the shenzhen river regulation project szrrp also had a significant influence on the mangrove extent and distribution with the mangrove expansion area of 22 7 ha being contributed by the szrrp accounting for 8 5 of the total mangrove expansion the findings of the current study indicate that with the increased sediment supply and accretion rate induced by anthropogenic activities mangrove forests with limited land retreat space can still expand in the face of sea level rise keywords mangrove remote sensing sea level rise land reclamation river regulation works shenzhen bay 1 introduction mangrove forests are evergreen woody communities that exhibit salt tolerance and are periodically submerged in seawater in the intertidal zones of the tropics and subtropics giri et al 2015 they are unique and essential ecosystems that provide a wealth of valuable ecological and socioeconomic goods and services estoque et al 2018 for example mangrove forests play a prominent role by creating habitats for a variety of terrestrial fauna and providing various supplies for local communities shrestha et al 2019 they help in the accumulation of sediment nutrients and pollutants thus maintaining a healthy coastal environment alongi 2002 in addition mangroves can capture large amounts of carbon and are estimated to store up to four times as much carbon per unit area compared to terrestrial forest ecosystems donato et al 2011 furthermore mangroves act as coastal barriers to protect shorelines against erosion and flooding thus relieving the devastating impacts of natural hazards giri et al 2007 despite the multiple benefits provided mangroves worldwide are facing immense pressure from environmental changes like sea level rise drought and freezing events and hurricanes galeano et al 2017 han et al 2018 and from aggravated human activities such as excessive deforestation land use change and coastal reclamation meyfroidt and lambin 2008 krauss et al 2014 hence understanding the feedback mechanisms of mangrove forests in response to natural and anthropogenic impacts is crucial an in situ field survey is an ideal approach to monitor land cover changes however due to the relatively large distribution scale periodic submergence and complex morphology it is time consuming and costly to conduct field campaigns to monitor mangrove changes rather than field observations remote sensing can efficiently capture repetitive geoscience information for inaccessible regions over a long period kuenzer et al 2011 and has therefore been widely used to characterize mangrove forest changes at broad spatial and temporal scales giri et al 2011 previous studies have highlighted the alarming rates at which mangroves in many sites have been degraded for instance valiela et al 2001 estimated that more than one third of mangroves were lost across southeast asia between the 1980s and 1990s primarily due to aquaculture expansion blum and roberts 2009 reported a 4900 km2 loss of coastal wetlands in the mississippi river delta since 1932 due to the combined effect of sea level rise and land subsidence moreover servino et al 2018 attributed over 500 ha of mangrove loss in eastern brazil to a devastating hailstorm nevertheless an increasing trend in mangrove coverage was also found recently richards and friess 2016 jayanthi et al 2018 suggesting that mangrove forests exhibit distinct responses to different external impacts although the above results provide a valuable perspective on mangrove forest changes at the continental or regional scales few studies have involved a quantitative analysis of the impacts of natural changes or anthropogenic activities on mangroves and knowledge on the mechanisms behind mangrove expansion is still in its infancy moreover previous studies regarding mangrove detection were generally not at sufficient temporal resolutions which hinders the study of detailed gain and loss processes of mangroves the shenzhen inner bay szib mangrove community is the only mangrove ecosystem situated in the urban hinterland of china it has diverse mangrove species and functions as a landing area for a large number of rare and endangered bird species that migrate from siberia to australia which hence has received considerable attention given its prominent ecological value huang et al 2012 su et al 2014 as a pioneer in china s reform and opening policy the shenzhen special economic zone has witnessed rapid economic development and a sharply booming human population over the past forty years however the increasing demand for living space and commercial land drove significant land cover changes which inevitably had profound impacts on nearby environments the large scale shenzhen bay land reclamation project szblrp implemented along the northern and western coasts of the szib during 1988 2006 significantly decreased seawater coverage and caused pronounced sedimentation in the szib qin et al 2002 moreover the shenzhen river regulation project szrrp jointly implemented by the shenzhen and hong kong governments greatly altered the amount of water and sediment entering the szib thereby triggering remarkable morphological adjustments zhang et al 2005 meanwhile natural changes like sea level rise and extreme cold events have occurred in the szib zhang and mao 2015 liang et al 2018 despite such environmental changes and strong human interventions in its vicinity the mangrove forests in szib have rapidly increased in recent decades jia et al 2016 previous studies regarding the szib have mainly documented the impact of human activities on hydrodynamics sediment transport and morphological adjustments wang et al 2011 feng et al 2020 and few have focused on the extent and distribution of mangrove forests not to mention the mechanisms behind their rapid expansion consequently investigating the spatiotemporal changes in the mangrove forests of the szib is of particular concern for understanding the roles of natural changes and anthropogenic activities in mangrove expansion in this study we monitored the long term changes in mangrove forests in the szib of china from a time series of medium resolution satellite images and investigated their relationship to natural and anthropogenic factors using synchronized meteorological hydrological and bathymetric data the objectives of this research are to i characterize the extent and distribution changes of the mangrove forests in the szib over the past three decades and ii assess the extent to which mangrove changes were controlled by natural and anthropogenic factors 2 study area located in south china 22 28 22 32 n and 113 54 114 2 e shenzhen bay is a half enclosed and shallow bay connected to the pearl river delta with a total area of 90 km2 and an average depth of 2 9 m a subtropical monsoon climate prevails in shenzhen bay with an average annual air temperature of 22 4 c the average annual rainfall between 1965 and 2016 was 1664 mm of which greater than 84 occurred between april and september the tidal system in shenzhen bay is characterized as semidiurnal tides with an annual average tidal range of 1 4 m the szib mangrove community is located in the northeastern corner of shenzhen bay and is separated by the shenzhen river fig 1 the futian and mai po mangrove reserves which are situated on the southern coast along shenzhen and the northwestern coast of the new territories of hong kong special administrative region respectively constitute the szib mangrove ecosystem the futian mangrove community consists of avicennia marina kandelia candel sonneratia caseolaris sonneratia apetala and aegiceras corniculatum of which a marina and k candel are the dominant mangrove species xiao et al 2007 the futian mangrove provincial natural conservation area was established in october 1984 and was upgraded to one of china s national nature reserves in april 1988 the mangrove species in mai po are much more diverse than those in the futian but the dominant mangrove species are similar tam and wong 2000 due to its rich biodiversity the mai po mangrove forest was designated as a wetland of international importance under the ramsar convention in september 1995 3 data and methods the procedures used herein involved two main steps the first step focused on identifying the land cover changes in the szib over the past thirty years the second focused on quantifying the impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on mangrove changes to facilitate reading and understanding a flow chart outlining the method used is presented in fig 2 3 1 data acquisition landsat 5 thematic mapper tm and landsat 8 operational land imager oli atmospherically corrected images with a 30 m resolution were used for monitoring the spatial and temporal mangrove forest changes in the szib considering the relatively small szib coverage ten landsat surface reflectance products path row 122 44 free of cloud cover in the szib between 1988 and 2017 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earthexplorer website https earthexplorer usgs gov the surface reflectance data of landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli were generated by the usgs using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps and landsat surface reflectance code lasrc algorithms respectively these data were processed as level 1 terrain corrected lit scenes with the highest geometric accuracy through geometric correction by ground control points and a digital elevation model dem the images were projected into the universal transverse mercator utm coordinate system with the datum of wgs 84 all images were captured between october and december to prevent potential phenological bias with tidal levels ranging from 0 62 m to 0 74 m in addition to the satellite data monthly average precipitation and hourly tidal level data from the chiwan tidal gauge station situated at the offshore boundary of shenzhen bay were also collected from the shenzhen hydrological data yearbook the daily air temperature of the lau fau shan meteorological station was downloaded from the hong kong observatory http gb weather gov hk furthermore bathymetric data of the szib at a scale of 1 5000 as well as the annual sediment delivery from shenzhen river were collected from the municipal shenzhen river regulation office unpublished data the plane coordinate system of each bathymetric chart was the shenzhen independent coordinate system with the vertical datum of huanghai 1956 the specific locations and observational periods as well as the data sources are summarized in table 1 table 1 details of the employed satellite images and the meteorological hydrological and bathymetric data used in the current study note cw chiwan lfs lau fau shan szr shenzhen river szib shenzhen inner bay msrro municipal shenzhen river regulation office szhdy shenzhen hydrological data yearbook and hko hong kong observatory 3 2 data pre processing and ground data collection given that the coverage of the szib is relatively small in terms of the acquired satellite image the study area was extracted as a rectangular subset of the satellite images to reduce unnecessary classification fig 3 a six land cover classes including mangrove urban land water bodies forest shrub area intertidal area and aquaculture were identified as the main land cover types in the szib according to the previous study by jia et al 2016 who explored the landscape pattern dynamics of the szib by means of object oriented classification on historical landsat images obtaining reliable ground truth points is a crucial prerequisite for accurate land cover classification the extracted landsat images were composed as color images using the combination of bands 4 5 and 3 and bands 5 6 and 4 as red green blue rgb for landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli images respectively which was found to be an effective way to distinguish mangrove and non mangrove areas since the reflectance spectra of mangrove is visibly different from that of other land cover types in short wave infrared regions under this band combination fig 4 ground truth points of the six main land cover types in each image were first manually identified and inspected based on color shape and texture and their associated characteristics to justify the reliability of the selected ground truth points and modify the potentially misclassified points high resolution historical images of the szib that were free of cloud cover were acquired from google earth http www google com earth fig 3b the capture dates of google earth data were 1 november 2013 and 20 november 2017 with corresponding tidal levels at chiwan of 0 45 m and 0 25 m respectively additionally field surveys were conducted on 1 december 2010 and 17 may 2019 to identify ground truth points by collecting development histories from local management and interviewing technical experts and elderly people the total number of ground truth points for the different images ranged from 139 to 204 with less than half of the total being used in the training site polygons whereas the remaining data were treated as validation site polygons 3 3 image classification and validation the supervised support vector machine classification method was used to classify each image the categories of water bodies and intertidal area were treated as a single class in the classified result as were the categories of urban land and forest shrub area since the main objective was to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in mangrove forests post classification editing was performed by visually removing isolated noise and correcting the apparently misclassified areas for example some aquaculture categories misclassified as water bodies due to reflectance overlap in the green spectral region were corrected because aquaculture ponds have a visible polygonal shape with surrounding fences mangrove classes that were misclassified as forest shrub area in inland were corrected because mangrove survival requires suitable seawater inundation conditions four accuracy parameters including producer s accuracy user s accuracy overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient were calculated on each classified map based on validation datasets with the aim of evaluating the classification accuracy 3 4 mangrove change detection the area and percentage of land cover categories in each classified map were first calculated to explore their temporal changes and the spatial variations in the area weighted centroids of the mangrove forests were calculated to investigate the spatial patterns of the szib mangrove changes over the past three decades the conversion metrics between the mangrove and other land cover categories from 1988 to 2017 and within two consecutive periods were then calculated to explore the underlying reason behind mangrove changes in the szib 3 5 linking mangrove changes to natural and anthropogenic factors to investigate the relationships between mangrove changes and natural drivers correlation analysis was conducted between mangrove coverage and the annual mean sea level winter temperature and precipitation a natural factor was considered to be significant in relation to mangrove area if the p value of the linear relationship was smaller than 0 01 additionally the correlation between mangrove area changes due to water bodies conversion and tidal prism variations was examined during the implementation of the szblrp to explore the extent to which this project may account for mangrove changes the tidal prism in shenzhen bay was calculated based on the area extent of seawater identified by satellite images and the synchronous tidal ranges at chiwan furthermore the impact of the szrrp on mangrove forests was explored through the relationship between bathymetric changes and mangrove area variations due to water bodies conversion during the three time intervals of 2006 2009 2009 2013 and 2013 2017 the acquired bathymetric data were first georeferenced to satellite images using fifteen fixed benchmarks of which the transformation relationship between the shenzhen independent coordinate and the wgs 1984 coordinate system was known the average bathymetric changes at the locations of mangrove area variations were then extracted using spatial joint in arcgis and the bathymetric changes in 2009 2013 and 2013 2017 were cumulated with the bathymetric changes in the previous period to consider the potential temporal lag between the bathymetric changes and mangrove area variations 4 results 4 1 land cover analysis 4 1 1 performance of classification the overall accuracy of the ten classified images ranged from 90 3 to 97 4 with the kappa coefficient ranging from 0 87 to 0 96 indicating satisfactory accuracy in the classification results table 2 presents the four accuracy parameters of the classification results of each image the producer s accuracy and user s accuracy of all classified categories in the ten images were well within the acceptable range suggesting that the classification results were sufficiently accurate to monitor the spatiotemporal changes in the land cover of the szib 4 1 2 temporal variations in land cover dynamics the classification map of the szib between 1988 and 2017 demonstrated significant spatial and temporal changes in each land cover within this period fig 5 over 1688 ha of water bodies were lost due to the implementation of land reclamation between 1988 and 2006 table 3 the overall aquaculture area decreased by 52 8 leaving 610 4 ha in 2017 and nearly 94 of this loss occurred in shenzhen land reclamation and aquaculture squeeze has contributed to the rapid urbanization of shenzhen over 2151 ha of urban land was gained in shenzhen from 1988 to 2006 in contrast to shenzhen the change in urban land area in hong kong near the mangroves was insignificant and has been maintained at approximately 428 ha over the past thirty years the average aquaculture area of hong kong in the szib was 558 7 ha during 1988 2017 which was in line with the 540 ha of aquaculture coverage reported by afcd 2011 mangrove coverage increased from 259 6 ha in 1988 to 527 1 ha in 2017 with an increase rate of 8 9 ha yr which is in agreement with the result of jia et al 2016 significant spatial and temporal variations were found in the area extent of mangrove forest in the szib the mangrove area in the mai po reserve steadily increased from 196 ha in 1988 to 415 ha in 2017 whereas the area of mangrove forests in the futian reserve decreased from 63 5 ha in 1988 to 53 6 ha in 1998 which was equivalent to a loss of 15 6 relative to the area in 1988 after that the degraded futian mangroves gradually recovered to their original level and consistently increased by 48 6 ha reaching 112 1 ha in 2017 the spatial variations in the area weighted centroids of mangrove forests indicated that the szib mangrove exhibited an overall outward migration trend during 1988 2017 fig 6 with a determination coefficient r 2 of the fitting results for mangrove centroid changes in the futian and mai po reserves of 0 57 and 0 68 respectively the area weighted centroids of the futian mangrove extended 426 8 m to the southeastern direction over the past three decades with the most pronounced migration occurring during 1991 1995 235 m it should be noted that 120 5 m of northwestern movement was uncovered in the spatial change of futian mangrove centroids during 1998 2001 which was mainly attributed to the growth of mangrove forests along the fringe of the feng tang river within this period in the case of mai po the area weighted mangrove centroids gradually migrated seaward for 477 5 m in a clockwise direction during 1988 2017 with an average moving distance of 15 9 m yr 4 1 3 conversion of mangroves in shenzhen inner bay the relative contributions of other land cover categories to mangrove area changes in the szib between 1988 and 2017 fig 7 demonstrated that the conversion from water bodies played a vital role in mangrove expansion as it accounted for 133 9 and 93 8 of the mangrove expansion in the futian and mai po reserves respectively the contributions of aquaculture and urban land to mangrove forests in these two reserves were completely opposite the 6 2 ha and 10 4 ha of mangrove loss in the futian reserve were caused by conversion to aquaculture and urban land respectively whereas 13 5 ha of mangroves were gained in the mai po reserve from the conversion of aquaculture and the net conversion between mangrove and urban land in the mai po reserve was insignificant there were substantial temporal differences in the mangrove conversion dynamics between the futian and mai po reserves during 1988 2017 in the case of the futian reserve 65 1 ha of mangroves were consistently gained from water bodies with pronounced conversion occurring during 1998 2001 13 2 ha and 2013 2017 16 5 ha however 23 7 ha of mangroves were lost to urban land and aquaculture between 1988 and 1998 which is consistent with the result described by he 2004 that over 20 ha of mangroves were degraded owing to urban and industry expansion along the coastline of shenzhen although 5 1 ha of mangroves were subsequently gained from urban land and aquaculture during 1998 2004 a total of 16 6 ha of mangroves were lost in the futian reserve from 1988 to 2017 due to human interference compared to the futian reserve the mai po reserve witnessed rapid mangrove expansion due to water bodies conversion with the gain primarily occurring during 1991 1995 42 7 ha and 1998 2001 39 ha despite the insignificant net conversion between urban land and mangroves during the past three decades 3 6 ha of the mai po mangroves were lost to urban land in 1991 1995 but this loss was soon counterbalanced by later gains almost 13 ha of mangroves in the mai po reserve were gained from aquaculture over the past thirty years with the main conversion occurring in 1995 1998 5 5 ha which was closely related to fishpond reconfiguration near tsim bei tsui afcd 2011 4 2 relationship between mangrove area and natural factors accelerating sea level rise annual precipitation patterns and freeze events have been considered three dominant natural factors affecting the mangrove area and distribution in sites with low hurricane frequency simard et al 2019 the long term temporal variations in annual sea level precipitation and winter temperature in shenzhen bay were examined to detect whether there were significant change trends in the past decades fig 8 a significant increasing trend was detected for the annual sea level of shenzhen bay over the past forty years with a mean increase rate of 2 2 mm yr standardized precipitation index spi values covering 12 months were calculated to assess the temporal variation in the rainfall pattern the calculated spi values showed that precipitation fluctuated remarkably over the past fifty years but no drought event occurred within this period with all spi values above 1 the temporal change in the winter temperature of shenzhen bay during 1986 2017 was negligible with an average winter temperature of 16 1 c the extreme low temperature was 3 5 c in 2016 which is much higher than the threshold low temperature of 7 c that mangrove forests can tolerate osland et al 2013 to test whether the mangrove changes in the szib over the past thirty years were related to natural factors correlation analysis was conducted between mangrove coverage and annual sea level winter temperature and precipitation fig 9 both winter temperature and precipitation showed little correlation with the mangrove area changes with the p value being larger than 0 01 indicating that the impacts of these two natural factors on mangrove forests in the szib over the past three decades were negligible a significant positive correlation was found between sea level and mangrove area during 1988 2009 with a r 2 of 0 79 however sea level rise is expected to have a tremendous negative effect on mangrove forests as it prolongs the inundation duration and causes a hypersaline environment thereby leading to mangrove decay especially in places where the landward retreat space is occupied therefore this abnormal positive correlation indicated that there was another factor governing mangrove changes as it enabled the mangrove forests to adjust their bed level at a rate that matched or even exceeded the rate of sea level rise thereby counterbalancing its adverse impact on mangrove forests 4 3 impacts of human activities on mangrove forests 4 3 1 deforestation and reforestation despite an overall increasing trend mangrove deforestation also occurred in the szib over the past thirty years more than 23 ha of mangrove forests in the futian reserve were lost to urban land or aquaculture during 1988 1998 with the most striking decrease occurring in 1991 fig 7 accounting for 15 8 of the futian mangrove area that year the primary reason for the futian mangrove loss was that the increasing demand for living accommodations and commercial land in the urbanization process of shenzhen overwhelmed the idea of protecting the mangrove ecosystems thereby leading to rapid urban development at the cost of mangrove deterioration he 2004 reported that a great number of urban construction projects have been launched along the shenzhen coastline since 1991 including the shenzhen coastal avenue guangshen expressway and xin zhou river and feng tang river drainage engineering as well as real estate development leading to significant mangrove loss and degradation and reduction in the ecosystem services provided by the mangroves fortunately this shortsighted policy was soon abolished when society and the authorities realized the value of mangrove forests reforestation campaigns were therefore implemented to restore the futian mangroves resulting in a total of 5 6 ha of mangroves gained from urban land and aquaculture between 1998 and 2004 fig 7 compared to the futian reserve the direct impact of human pressure on mangrove forests in the mai po reserve was limited in 1988 2017 under the protection and conservation of the ramsar convention framework according to the development concept of the ramsar convention and the existing configurations of mai po the agriculture fisheries and conservation department afcd of hong kong delineated the mai po area into different management zones with the wetland conservation area and buffer area being proper determined fig 10 a any private development that could undermine the mangrove forests would be required to perform compensatory projects to mitigate its negative ecological impacts afcd 2011 the effectiveness of this management approach was mirrored by the conversion relationship between the mai po mangrove and the nearby urban area was overall insignificant during 1988 2017 with the mangrove loss due to urban land expansion soon being compensated fig 7 however it is important to note that 6 8 ha of mai po mangroves were lost in 2013 2017 to maintain the flood capacity of the shan pui river afcd 2011 such mangrove loss was ascribed to human intervention other maintenance mangrove removal was also undertaken by afcd 2011 to avoid the further adverse impacts of the exotic mangrove sonneratia on native species fig 10b 4 3 2 shenzhen bay land reclamation project to alleviate the increasing pressure of urban land demand for further urbanization of shenzhen the large scale shenzhen bay land reclamation project szblrp was implemented along the northern and western coasts of the szib from 1988 to 2006 rather than causing mangrove deforestation this project witnessed rapid mangrove expansion as a remarkable increase occurred within the construction period therefore the mangrove area changes due to water bodies conversion were examined in relation to the tidal prism variations during 1988 2006 to explore the potential impact of the szblrp on the mangrove forests the shenzhen urban land significantly increased from 1194 3 ha in 1988 to 3346 ha in 2006 and then plateaued afterward fig 11 a in parallel with the urban land increase the tidal prism of shenzhen bay dramatically decreased by 19 8 from 1 41 108 m3 in 1988 to 1 13 108 m3 in 2006 due to the szblrp mangrove expansion during 1988 2006 due to water bodies conversion produced a significant negative correlation with tidal prism changes with a r 2 of 0 85 fig 11b in other words a total of 187 9 ha of mangrove expansion area which accounted for 70 2 of the total mangrove gain was contributed by the tidal prism variations due to the szblr highlighting the significant influence of the szblr on mangrove expansion in the szib 4 3 3 shenzhen river regulation project as a natural border between shenzhen and hong kong the shenzhen river is the largest tributary entering shenzhen bay however the return period of flood in the shenzhen river was only 2 5 years due to its short travel time and narrow meandering river channel chan and lee 2010 to relieve flood hazards and improve the flood control capacity the shenzhen river regulation project szrrp was jointly implemented by the shenzhen and hong kong governments the flood control capacity of the shenzhen river was improved after its implementation however the water and sediment regimes altered by the szrrp have triggered remarkable morphological adjustments in the szib and may have a significant impact on the extent and distribution of mangroves therefore the mangrove changes during 2006 2017 due to water bodies conversion were examined in association with the cumulative bathymetric changes to explore the extent to which the szrrp may have been responsible for the mangrove changes the mangrove changes due to water bodies conversion exhibited an overall seaward expansion trend after the completion of the szrrp with pronounced spatial variations fig 12 mangrove expansion occurred primarily on the southwestern coast of the mai po reserve between 2006 and 2017 and the southern coast of the futian reserve between 2013 and 2017 whereas mangrove losses were mainly distributed along the edge of the futian reserve in 2006 2009 notably 6 7 ha of mangroves were lost to water bodies in 2013 2017 to improve the flood capacity of the shan pui river in hong kong correlation analysis between the cumulative bathymetric changes and mangrove area variations showed a statistically significant relationship during 2013 2017 r 2 0 84 p 0 01 n 44 indicating that the mangrove gain area of 21 8 ha within this period was contributed by bathymetric changes between 2009 and 2017 however no statistically significant relationship was detected between the mangrove area variations and cumulative bathymetric changes during 2006 2009 and 2009 2013 with both the r 2 being less than 0 1 interestingly over 12 ha and 9 ha of mangrove expansion within these two periods occurred at sites where bathymetric changes were less than 0 in other words the mangrove forests in these erosion sites still expanded seaward given that no other human interference occurred it is reasonable to speculate that the szblrp was responsible for these mangrove expansion as it left sufficient accommodation capital that enabled the mangroves to consistently expand at the sites despite the bed erosion a significant correlation between the mangrove area variations and cumulative bathymetric changes was found when excluding these points with the r 2 increasing to 0 82 and 0 86 suggesting that 0 9 ha and 2 ha of mangrove area gains and 0 7 ha and 1 3 ha of mangrove area losses in 2006 2009 and 2009 2013 respectively were contributed by the morphological adjustments caused by the szrrp additionally it is important to note that the positive intercept of the fitting line for the relationship between the cumulative bathymetric changes and the mangrove area changes during 2013 2017 indicated that the szib mangrove will continue to expand due to the accommodation capital left by the szrrp if sediment supply remains at present level overall human activities had two distinct effects on the szib mangrove forests over the past three decades on the one hand the szblr and the szrrp contributed 209 9 ha and 22 7 ha of mangrove expansion respectively accounting for 78 4 and 8 5 of the total mangrove gain on the other hand 23 5 ha and 6 8 ha of mangrove forests were lost in the futian and mai po reserves respectively due to urban land and aquaculture conversion and river channelization with reforestation campaigns only compensating 5 6 ha of the mangrove loss in the futian reserve 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in mangrove change detection in the current study long time series land classification maps of the szib were interpreted using ten landsat surface reflectance products spanning thirty years and the conversion relationships between the mangrove forests and other land cover types were studied to investigate the potential reason behind the mangrove changes the spatial coherence and tidal inundation consistency across the different images were thus essential especially for the relatively small study area the landsat level 1 data used in the current study were geo referenced using several ground control points and a digital elevation model dem so the spatial bias between the different images was negligible however it is difficult to find long term time series cloud free satellite images with identical tidal levels at the acquisition date additionally due to the lack of synchronization data the instantaneous tidal level at the acquisition dates of the images in 2013 and 2017 was calculated using nine main astronomic components derived from harmonic analysis with a standard deviation of 0 14 m which was the unfavorable factor for mangrove change detection these sources of error can be minimized by adopting satellite images with a relatively uniform tidal level at capture time most images used in the current study were acquired with an instantaneous tidal level less than 0 35 m indicating that nearly all of the mangroves were exposed above the sea surface in these images jia et al 2016 the relatively high tide level of 0 74 m in 2004 may have led to an underestimation of the area of mangrove forests gained from water bodies as a consequence of the szblrp another potential source of uncertainty stems from the selection process for the ground truth points accurate determination of ground truth points is a prerequisite for classification however the majority of the ground truth points used in the current study were obtained from visual interpretation in terms of color texture and shape of different land cover types which lacks objectivity synchronized high resolution google earth images and field surveys provided a solid reference for choosing the ground truth points but these data covered only a limited amount of time and mangrove misclassification may have unavoidably occurred in the mixed pixels adjacent to other land cover types in addition there was no agreement concerning what the classification method should be used under different spatial scales and land cover characteristics civco et al 2002 noted that each classification method has its own merit and no method has been regarded as the best way to perform land cover classification although these inherent weaknesses may have biased the classification results the adverse effects were minimized by adopting strict and consistent differentiated standards for different land cover categories in the classification process with the aid of local technical experts and the classification accuracy showed that the classified results using the support vector machine algorithm were reliable fig 10b shows the extent and distribution of the mai po mangroves in 2010 which were interpreted by the afcd using high resolution aerial photographs indicating good agreement in mangrove forests mapping between the current result and that of the previous study 5 2 positive effect of human activities on mangrove expansion previous studies have highlighted the negative effect of human interventions like urban and agricultural expansion kirwan and murray 2007 hu et al 2018 industrial harbors godoy et al 2018 and upstream damming lu and siew 2006 on mangrove forests while the positive effects of human activities have mainly been reported from reforestation campaigns sakho et al 2011 li et al 2013 in contrast to the common consensus the recent rapid mangrove expansion in the szib can primarily be attributed to the implementation of the szblrp and the szrrp therefore it is important to explore the positive feedback of mangrove forests in response to these two human activities to better understand the driving factors behind mangrove expansion the implementation of the szblrp significantly decreased the seawater coverage and resulted in reduced tidal prism which triggered severe sedimentation in the szib thereby providing suitable accommodation space for mangroves to expand seaward the tidal prism of shenzhen bay drastically decreased by 2 8 107 m3 during 1988 2006 as a consequence of the decreased seawater area caused by the szblrp the reduced tidal prism resulted in decreased seawater entering shenzhen bay and decreased shear stress at the bed bottom which favored deposition these phenomena have been demonstrated by ni et al 1998 and wang et al 2009 who documented that the sedimentation rate in 1996 was almost two fold larger than that in 1986 and a new intertidal area gradually formed near the river mouth this pronounced deposition not only facilitated the dispersal of mangrove seedlings but also provided additional migration space and thus contributed to mangrove seaward colonization in the face of sea level rise the implementation of the szrrp altered the flow and sediment conditions entering shenzhen bay leading to remarkable morphological changes in the szib which had a significant impact on the mangrove distribution the temporal variation in the sediment load from the shenzhen river showed landward sediment delivery between 2007 and 2008 fig 13 a in addition increased tidal water flowed into the wider and deeper shenzhen river channel immediately after the completion of the szrrp resulting in an increased tidal prism that favored erosion in the szib these were reflected by the intertidal area of the szib decreasing from 6 8 106 m2 in 2006 to 4 7 106 m2 in 2009 fig 13b the decreased intertidal area and sediment deficiency impeded the capacity of mangroves to keep pace with sea level rise and may have caused mangrove decay by shrinking the potential accommodation space and prolonging the inundation time however this adverse effect was already overwhelmed by the accommodation capital left by the szblrp and the mangroves showed overall seaward expansion during this period afterward continuous siltation occurred in the shenzhen river to achieve a new equilibrium state between the hydrodynamic and sediment dynamics and riverbed boundaries which was accompanied with a reduced tidal prism and increased sediment delivery thus resulting in a 1 7 106 m2 intertidal area increase during 2009 2017 this enlarged intertidal area provided a suitable inundation environment and eventually contributed to seaward mangrove expansion within this period duan et al 2017 reported that mangrove forests in the szib will continue to expand if the accretion rate of the szib remains at the present level which is consistent with the finding of the current study that the mangrove extent shows an increasing trend owing to the accommodation capital left by the szrrp however with the strong anthropogenic activities in the development process of the socialist demonstration area and the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area the future response of the szib mangrove forests to growing anthropogenic activities deserves future investigation 5 3 the future resilience of mangrove forests to sea level rise due to the increasing visible pressure of global climate changes on delta and coastal ecosystems the question of how future mangrove forests may evolve is of great interest for wetland scientists and government policymakers and an expansive body of research has thus been undertaken to investigate the response of mangrove forests to sea level rise which has been considered the major natural force driving mangrove dynamics duncan et al 2017 cohen et al 2018 the growth and expansion of mangrove forests require proper hydrodynamic and salinity conditions and rising sea level is expected to prolong the inundation duration and to increase the water salinity which may result in mangrove loss woodroffe et al 2016 there is evidence that mangrove forests exhibit self capacity to adjust the bed level at a rate that matches sea level rise by means of their intrinsic biological feedback mechanisms including sediment trapping of leaves and pneumatophores and organic decomposition of below ground biomass mckee et al 2007 if the rate of sea level rise surpasses the adjustment rate the mangrove forests may undergo landward retreat to maintain suitable submergence and salinity conditions schuerch et al 2018 meantime the amount of upstream sediment delivery has been regarded as an important factor affecting the resilience of mangrove forests to sea level rise lovelock et al 2015 mangrove forests will be able to keep pace with or even exceed sea level rise if a new suitable inundation area is provided by adequate sediment supply nevertheless with the accelerating sea level rise due to increasing anthropogenic co2 emissions growing sediment starvation due to upstream damming and squeezing landward retreat space due to coastal urban and industrial developments kondolf et al 2014 willemsen et al 2016 perera et al 2018 the future prospect of mangrove forests is far from optimistic duke et al 2007 even suggested that 2100 may see the end of mangrove forests however the current study found that despite sea level rise and occupied landward retreat space the area of mangrove forests in the szib has rapidly increased over the past three decades the underlying mechanism responsible for this is that the implementation of the szblrp triggered pronounced deposition in the szib which counteracted the negative effects of sea level rise on mangrove forests and offered additional seaward accommodation space hence contributing to the rapid mangrove expansion of the szib this counterintuitive mangrove expansion gives us certain confidence that the mangrove forests in which landward retreat space was limited and upstream sediment input was shortage can still show resilient behavior to sea level rise with the help of a human induced sedimentation environment therefore it is reasonable to speculate that at sites that resemble shenzhen bay where coastal reclamation becomes a typical feature seaward accommodation space caused by sedimentation provides an alternative outlet for mangrove forests in the face of sea level rise 6 conclusions the current study monitored the spatiotemporal changes in mangrove forests in the szib between 1988 and 2017 using landsat surface reflectance data and examined their changes with respect to natural changes and anthropogenic activities the results revealed that the mangrove forests in the szib consistently increased from 259 6 ha to 527 1 ha during 1988 2017 of which 81 8 occurred in the mai po reserve the mangrove area changes were weakly correlated with the annual winter temperature and annual precipitation but produced a significant positive correlation with sea level rise in contrast to the common consensus mangrove deforestation and reforestation were found across the futian and mai po reserves but only to a limited extent the correlation analyses indicated that 78 4 and 8 5 of the total mangrove area gains were contributed by the szblrp and szrrp respectively as they provided additional accommodation space for mangroves to migrate seaward despite sea level rise such an expansion trend will continue if sediment supply remains at present levels we concluded that rather than inevitable inundation by sea level rise mangrove forests may show an increasing trend if additional seaward accommodation space can be created by anthropogenic activities these findings are useful for understanding mangrove forest dynamics in response to natural and anthropogenic factors and the results provide scientists and policymakers with guidelines for mangrove protection and conservation in the face of sea level rise in integrated

5044,this paper presents an assessment of the hydrological impacts of proposed coal mines and coal seam gas csg developments in the gloucester hunter namoi and galilee subregions of eastern australia surface water and groundwater modelling was carried out to assess the cumulative regional scale hydrological impacts of multiple coal and coal seam gas developments the hydrological metrics assessed were groundwater drawdown and changes in low flow characteristics as measured by the number of low flow or zero flow days per year uncertainty in the modelling was also considered and the results are presented as the median and plausible range 5th to 95th percentile from many simulations which attempt to capture a wide range of uncertainty the results indicate that under the best case 5th percentile scenario the impact of additional proposed coal resource developments on groundwater drawdown and surface water characteristics can be quite small however under the worse case 95th percentile groundwater drawdown is very likely for up to 5 km from the coal resource developments but unlikely beyond 20 km altered surface water characteristics can extend for many kilometres downstream particularly in unregulated systems the cumulative hydrological impact is enhanced where there are multiple developments in close proximity the results are being used to inform policy and the approval process for coal resource developments keywords hydrological impacts coal mining coal seam gas cumulative impact assessment 1 introduction worldwide there is growing concern about environmental issues particularly those posed by ever increasing greenhouse gas emissions see for example ripple et al 2017 these concerns have been accompanied by increasing public awareness and citizen activism with wide spread opposition to new coal mines and coal seam gas developments across much of the developed world roser renouf et al 2014 despite this the coal mining industry has a large political influence anderson 1995 and new coal mines and unconventional gas developments continue to be approved and constructed this has led to conflict between development proponents and the community particularly in developed countries this is particularly true in australia where both coal mining higginbotham et al 2010 and coal seam gas developments luke et al 2018 face wide spread public opposition despite this public opposition new coal mines and coal seam gas developments are still being approved by federal and state governments the carmichael coal mine in the galilee basin in queensland is a good example of the conflict between coal developers and sectors of society opposed to its development with final approvals recently being granted by the state government despite community opposition currell et al 2020 as well as the carmichael coal mine there are many other coal mines and csg development proposals in central and eastern australia currently being considered for approval by federal and state governments these coal developments will have some impact on water resources and the ecological economic and socio cultural assets that depend on water in regions where there are multiple coal and csg developments in potentially hydrologically connected systems there is a need for assessing the impact of proposed developments that is i cumulative and ii allows for a spatially explicit assessment of future impacts on water and water dependent assets the need for a cumulative approach is driven largely by the fact that the site scale environmental impact statements required of development proponents typically do not consider cumulative impacts due to other nearby developments as an example the importance of considering cumulative impacts of multiple coal mines in the catchments draining to the great barrier reef including those in the galilee basin examined here is highlighted by grech et al 2016 one of the aims of the current study is to instil public confidence in the impact assessment of proposed coal resource developments as a result an assessment of the uncertainty in these predictions is paramount impacts on water are particularly contentious with some studies questioning whether current hydrogeological investigations provide an adequate assessment of potential impacts on water resources and water dependent assets currell et al 2017 it is estimated that coal mining in nsw and queensland where all of the mines considered in the current paper are located consume around 225 000 ml of freshwater per year which is the equivalent of the water consumption of a city of 5 2 million people overton 2020 clearly the expansion of the coal mining industry could have large impacts on other water users despite the controversy surrounding the topic surprisingly few studies can be found in the literature that apply a cumulative impact assessment approach to assess the potential impacts of coal resource development on water resources and water dependent assets most studies tend to focus on either the hydrological impacts of coal mining e g bonta et al 1997 or unconventional gas development e g kondash and vengosh 2015 clancy et al 2018 even though at least in australia both types of development frequently occur together in the same catchments in canada alberta has a cumulative effects management framework guiding the development of their oil and gas industry johnson et al 2011 although it has been widely criticised as being ineffective duinker and greig 2006 in many ways australia has taken the lead in recognising the importance of considering cumulative impacts with publications such as franks et al 2010 and the regulatory arm of the office of groundwater impact and assessment ogia which considers cumulative impacts in queensland however there is only one cumulative management area overseen by ogia the surat basin and they only consider unconventional gas development and not the coal mines that occur in close proximity to the coal seam gas developments in australia a water trigger was added to the australian federal government epbc act in 2013 that gave the commonwealth regulator the department of the environment oversight of the direct indirect and cumulative impacts of coal resource development on water dependent assets as a result of this the department of the environment contracted the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro along with the bureau of meteorology and geoscience australia to undertake a series of cumulative impact assessments known as bioregional assessments to assess the potential impacts of coal and csg development across eastern australia on water resources and water dependent assets these water dependent assets include ecological assets such as wetlands or the habitat of endangered species economic assets such as water access rights and socio cultural assets such as indigenous sites this paper presents the key findings of that assessment as related to impacts on surface and groundwater in four key subregions see section 2 an important focus of the bioregional assessments program was an assessment of cumulative impacts of proposed developments at a regional scale and a requirement to map the likelihood of impact that is to show areas where impacts are possible and to rule out areas where the assessments indicate that impacts are highly unlikely additionally the ba programme grounds the analysis in causal relationships between developments and potential impacts in terms of water mediated causal pathways and these provide the scientific rigour to link developments with changes to water and potential impacts on water dependent assets throughout the modelling process not reported in the current paper but available at www bioregionalassessments gov au 2 study areas an assessment was made of all potential coal mines and csg developments across six bioregions in central and eastern australia fig 1 and those that were considered likely to proceed in the next decade were identified for further analysis those developments that were assessed as being likely to proceed anticipate the extraction of approximately 41 000 mt of coal across 58 new mines or expansions to existing mines as well as approximately 16 000 pj of natural gas from eight new csg developments these developments are valued at around 3 trillion dollars to the australian economy and burning them would release approximately 75 000 mt of co2 into the atmosphere note that this assessment was made in mid 2015 since that time some developments are no longer likely to proceed while some others have now been proposed full details are in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the bioregional assessments were a very large program of work employing over 100 fte researchers over 5 years the six bioregions examined encompassed 13 subregions which are also shown in fig 1 the outputs of the program in its entirety are contained in 104 reports all of which are available for download from www bioregionalassessments gov au the purpose of the current paper is to summarise key findings related to the impacts of underground and open cut coal mining as well as coal seam gas extraction on groundwater and surface water in four key subregions where development is most likely to occur these are the gloucester hunter namoi and galilee subregions fig 1 2 1 gloucester the gloucester subregion was the smallest subregion analysed being just 481 km2 and straddling two catchments the gloucester river flowing north and the karuah river flowing south fig 3 it is situated in eastern nsw and is part of the northern sydney basin bioregion the main land use is grazing cattle and there are just 5000 people living in the subregion mostly in the towns of gloucester and stroud there are two open cut coal mines duralie and stratford currently operating as of december 2012 both mines have expansion plans while there are also proposals for a new coal mine rocky hill and csg project the gloucester gas project current coal resource developments as of december 2012 as well as those considered likely to proceed in the next decade for all four subregions are listed in table 1 december 2012 was chosen as the cut off date for assessing the currency of mines as this was the start date of the assessment 2 2 hunter the hunter subregion is also located in nsw and is the second subregion considered to be part of the northern sydney basin bioregion it is much larger than the gloucester subregion being approximately 17 000 km2 it is home to the major city of newcastle fig 4 and is known for coal mining power generation equine and viticulture industries there are 42 currently operating coal mines comprising 22 open cut and 20 underground mines there are 22 coal developments considered likely to proceed comprising four new open cut mines two new underground coal mines and expansions to 16 currently operating mines there are no coal seam gas operations currently operating nor planned for the hunter subregion 2 3 namoi the namoi subregion is located adjacent to the hunter subregion in northern nsw it is approximately 30 000 km2 in area its major towns are gunnedah and narrabri fig 5 and is part of the murray darling basin an important cropping area of australia there are six currently operating coal mines in the namoi subregion comprising five open cut and one underground coal mine the nine additional coal mines considered to be likely to proceed comprise three new open cut mines two new underground mines one new underground open cut mine and expansions to three currently operating open cut mines there is also one csg operation proposed for the namoi subregion the narrabri gas project 2 4 galilee the galilee subregion in qld was the largest subregion examined at approximately 250 000 km2 it is semi arid is used for grazing on native pastures and is sparsely populated home to around 20 000 people fig 6 unlike the other subregions there are no currently operating coal mines or csg developments in the galilee subregion there are 14 coal mines comprising three open cut mines two underground coal mines and nine combined underground open cut coal mines which are considered likely to proceed there are also three csg projects that are considered likely to proceed 3 methods 3 1 causal pathways and conceptual models conceptually four primary causal pathways were identified via which hydrological changes from coal resource developments could propagate to water dependent assets these are driven by 1 coal seam depressurisation and dewatering 2 preferential flow paths into overlying underlying aquifers i e enhanced inter aquifer connectivity from fracturing faulting leaky aquitards or the integrity or positioning of wells 3 management storage and disposal of co produced water 4 disruption of natural surface drainage fig 2 illustrates these causal pathways using a conceptual block diagram of the gloucester subregion while there are regionally specific variations these causal pathways are applicable to all forms of underground and open cut coal mining as well as coal seam gas extraction across all the study areas conceptual models were also developed for the other three subregions not shown here 3 2 numerical modelling and scenario definition having developed a conceptual model of the four causal pathways via which coal and csg development may impact assets that are dependent on surface and or groundwater numerical models were then constructed to represent the potential hydrological impacts quantitatively the models used as well as references to reports describing the application of these models are given in table 2 the choice of groundwater models was driven largely by data availability to parameterise and run them in gloucester hunter and namoi there was sufficient data to parameterise a dynamic groundwater model in galilee a simple analytical element model was used as there was insufficient data to parameterise a dynamic model there is little water level data in the galilee subregion and there is no current development in galilee the choice of surface water models was driven by whether there were sufficient gauging stations to parameterise a river system model along with the need for such a complex model simple landscape models were adopted in the gloucester and galilee as there are no major dams and only limited diversions for irrigation in the hunter and namoi the main rivers are regulated by large dams to manage water supply for irrigation industry and town uses thus full river system models were used to capture this complexity two modelling scenarios were defined 1 a baseline scenario which included all commercially operating coal mines in the subregion as of december 2012 as described in the section above it also included all extensions to current mines that had already received government approvals 2 an expansion scenario that included all the baseline coal mines as well as the proposed underground and open cut coal mines and csg developments as described sections 4 1 and 4 2 the primary focus of the current paper is the difference in hydrologic response between these two scenarios which represents the difference attributable to the proposed additional coal resource developments the models were run for the 90 year period 2013 2102 and the maximum change in a range of hydrologic parameters over this period was extracted from the model outputs for groundwater the parameter chosen was groundwater drawdown in the regional water table aquifer for surface water nine hydrological characteristics covering a range of flow characteristics were chosen viney et al 2020a b contains details of these characteristics as well as a full description of the surface water modelling methodology in the current paper increase in the number of low flow or zero flow days only is reported as it is the surface water metric found to be most likely to be altered by coal resource development full changes in all streamflow metrics across all four subregions can be seen using the explorer tool found at https www bioregionalassessments gov au ba explorer the same climate sequence was used for both the baseline and expansion model runs this climate sequence was created by repeating the 30 year period from 1983 to 2013 three times with a climate change signal imposed on it details are in viney et al 2020b the awra l landscape model was run across all four subregions under both the baseline and expansion scenarios to estimate total runoff in general terms coal resource development can impact on surface water in numerous ways viney et al 2020b in terms of the modelling however impacts on surface water were represented through three mechanisms as represented in fig 2 the first is through open cut coal mines capturing overland flow and thus reducing surface runoff exiting the mine area the second is through underground mines reducing total runoff due to subsidence here total runoff was assumed to decrease by 10 and the third is via a reduction in baseflow which is estimated from the groundwater modelling see below in the hunter and namoi where a river system model was used the river heights from this model were used as boundary conditions in the groundwater model to allow the calculation of river losses becoming groundwater recharge in the gloucester and galilee the streams under examination are gaining streams as a result river losses to groundwater are minimal and so the river boundary in the groundwater model did not require a transient stream stage the groundwater model was run under both scenarios providing estimates of groundwater drawdowns as well as the difference in baseflows between both scenarios changing total runoff see above further details of the groundwater and surface water modelling approach are available in the project reports as listed in table 2 as well as crosbie et al 2016 peeters et al 2018b and viney 2016 2020a b estimating risks associated with coal development not only requires an estimate of the magnitude of impacts but also their likelihood or probability this necessitated a probabilistic framework for numerical model development rather than a deterministic one the probabilistic framework to propagate uncertainty through numerical surface and groundwater models peeters et al 2016 2018b stochastically evaluates a wide range of parameter combinations the parameter combinations consistent with observations are selected through a limits of acceptability approach to generate an ensemble of predictions viney et al 2020a as some of these numerical models have long runtimes and in general thousands of runs are required to adequately bound the limits of uncertainty computational efficiency is increased using emulators cui et al 2018 the prediction focused uncertainty quantification is complemented with global sensitivity analysis peeters et al 2014 and a qualitative uncertainty analysis peeters 2017 the latter systematically lists the assumptions and model choices underpinning the modelling and uncertainty analysis and discusses the potential effect on predictions results are presented for the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles from the groundwater and surface water models in order to capture the uncertainty inherent in this regional scale analysis results for the 95th percentile were then used to define a zone of potential hydrological change peeters et al 2018b viney et al 2020b outside of which it is very unlikely that impacts will occur to do this a decision was made that a less than 5 chance of less than 0 2 m of drawdown or a 3 day or 5 change in any of nine surface water hydrological metrics may be considered insignificant acknowledging that these thresholds may not represent ecologically safe limits see currell 2016 for example while this choice of thresholds is necessarily subjective the decision to choose these metrics and likelihood of change was made as a result of extensive consultation with state government decision makers to ensure that these metrics and thresholds were useful for them decision makers can therefore use these outputs to determine the area where hydrological changes are very likely to occur within the area bounded by the 5th percentile and where they are very unlikely to occur outside the area bounded by the 95th percentile note that as we selected the largest change in hydrological characteristics over the period 2013 2102 for each model output node the hydrological changes reported in this paper represent the maximum change in these hydrological characteristics over the 90 year modelled period as a result the hydrological changes presented here are very unlikely to be seen at any single point in time because the changes at each model node may occur at different times for different locations there was insufficient available information in order to model some coal mines particularly those that have not yet commenced operations where information on pumping rate exact mine location and size etc has yet to be made public by the proponent some mines in the baseline scenario were also not modelled due to the limited impacts of that mine on hydrology for example where the longwall panels occur beneath a lake the number of underground coal mines open cut coal mines expansions to current mines and csg projects that were modelled in each subregion under the baseline and expansion scenarios is shown in table 3 note that the decision on which coal resource developments to include in the study was made in mid 2015 since that time some of the developments that were included in the modelling and listed in table 2 now look unlikely to proceed due to the proponent pulling out or the state or federal government refusing development proposals details are in the subregion specific sections on groundwater and surface water in sections 4 1 and 4 2 4 results 4 1 groundwater 4 1 1 gloucester all baseline and expansion mines and the sole csg development in the gloucester subregion were able to be represented in the groundwater model note however that since the decision on which developments to include was made the proponent of the gloucester gas project agl have announced that they will no longer be proceeding with this development additionally the rocky hill coal mine was refused government approvals and is also unlikely to proceed despite this both developments were included in the modelling additional groundwater drawdown defined as that drawdown due to the expansion developments that is predicted to occur on top of that drawdown due to baseline coal mines for the gloucester subregion is shown in fig 3 the left hand side of this figure shows that additional drawdown in the regional water table aquifer in excess of 0 2 m is very likely for an area of nearly 20 km2 the right hand side of this figure shows that additional drawdown in excess of 0 2 m is very unlikely to exceed an area of around 100 km2 most of this drawdown is close to the proposed rocky hill coal mine and gloucester gas project in the north of the subregion the currently existing open cut mine at stratford only has a small impact on additional drawdown due to expansion plans the duralie mine has expansion plans to the north of the current mine pit thus the additional drawdown seen there in this and subsequent groundwater figures modelled drawdowns close to open cut mines are considered unreliable because of the very steep hydraulic gradients at the mine pit interface thus modelled changes are obscured there in this and subsequent groundwater drawdown figures underground mines and csg developments are not subject to this limitation understanding drawdown close to open cut coal mines is best handled by a finer resolution model not a regional scale analysis of the type carried out here which is better suited to examining cumulative impacts from multiple developments 4 1 2 hunter all baseline mines in the hunter subregion were included in the groundwater model of the 22 mines considered likely to proceed table 1 insufficient information about proposed operations meant that five could not be included in the groundwater modelling table 3 these were the new west muswellbrook open cut coal mine as well as proposed expansions to the austar and wambo underground mines and mount arthur and wilpinjong open cut mines there are no coal seam gas operations currently operating nor planned for the hunter subregion as of writing all of the mines in the expansion scenario are still considered likely to proceed additional drawdown due to these 17 mines in the expansion scenario is shown in fig 4 the top left figure shows that drawdown in the regional water table aquifer in excess of 0 2 m is very likely for an area of 528 km2 the top right figure shows that it is very unlikely that drawdown in excess of 0 2 m will exceed an area of 2441 km2 these areas of drawdown are distributed throughout the subregion reflecting the wide dispersion of proposed coal mine developments in the hunter the patchy nature of the additional drawdown also reflects the fact that there are currently 42 mines in operation in the subregion some of the additional mines will therefore have little impact in terms of drawdown as the groundwater levels have already been drawn down significantly by the existing mines 4 1 3 namoi all baseline mines in the namoi subregion were included in the groundwater model of the nine mines considered likely to proceed table 1 two could not be included in the groundwater model due to insufficient information table 3 these were the expansion to the vickery south open cut coal mine and the new gunnedah precinct open cut and underground coal mine the narrabri gas project was able to be modelled after the expansion scenario was finalised the nsw government bought back bhp s caroona coal exploration licences on the liverpool plains and thus it is unlikely to proceed as of july 2017 the shenhua exploration licence for the watermark coal project was reduced by 51 4 to exclude the liverpool plains however this did not change the operational mining area and therefore the hydrological modelling of the watermark coal project carried out here remains relevant additional drawdown due to the eight coal resource developments in the expansion scenario is shown in fig 5 the top right figure shows that drawdown in the regional water table aquifer in excess of 0 2 m is very likely for an area of 156 km2 the bottom right figure shows that it is very unlikely that drawdown in excess of 0 2 m will exceed an area of 2299 km2 of this area of drawdown 287 km2 occurs in the agriculturally important namoi alluvium this represents 8 of the upper namoi alluvium and 0 01 of the lower namoi alluvium 4 1 4 galilee in the galilee subregion there are no commercially operating coal mines or csg developments in the baseline scenario of the 14 coal mines considered likely to proceed table 1 there was insufficient information to model seven the open cut blackall mine and the underground alpha west and hughenden coal mines as well as the combined open cut and underground operations at clyde park milray pentland and west pentland the three csg projects the glenaras gas project gunn project and blue energy s exploration tenement 813 also had insufficient information available to model them at this stage all seven mines in the expansion scenario table 3 are still considered likely to proceed additional drawdown due to the seven modelled coal mines is shown in fig 6 the top right figure shows that drawdown in excess of 0 2 m in the regional water table aquifer is very likely for an area of 2820 km2 the bottom right figure shows that it is very unlikely that drawdown in excess of 0 2 m will exceed an area of 13 364 km2 this drawdown occurs within two distinct areas centred on proposed coal mines there is considerable overlap in the drawdown cones of depression as a result of the proposed coal mines in each area major aquifers of the geological eromanga basin part of the great artesian basin are unlikely to see significant levels of drawdown nearby springs are very likely to experience some level of drawdown 4 2 surface water 4 2 1 gloucester as for the groundwater modelling all baseline and expansion mines and the sole csg development in the gloucester subregion were able to be represented in the surface water model the increase in the number of low flow days defined in this paper as the lowest 10th percentile of flows as assessed over the entire 100 year modelling period due to additional coal resource development in the gloucester subregion is shown in fig 7 in this and subsequent figures the circles show the increase in the number of low flow days per year at streamflow nodes that were directly modelled where possible these changes were interpolated to stream links between these nodes in some cases changes in hydrology due to coal mines or major streams joining the network between nodes meant that streamflow may change significantly between nodes and thus this interpolation was not possible in these cases a dashed pink line indicates those streams where a change in hydrology cannot be ruled out but also could not be quantified at the 5th percentile it is unlikely that there are increases of more than 3 low flow days per year anywhere in the subregion although there are a couple of streams that pass close to the rocky hill stratford and duralie mines where potential impacts larger than this cannot be ruled out at the 50th percentile the avon river is predicted to experience an extra 3 20 low flow days per year where it passes the rocky hill coal mine and gloucester gas project at the 95th percentile the avon river may experience increases of 20 80 low flow days per year and there are larger increases in smaller streams near the gloucester gas project rocky hill and stratford mines as well as increases of 3 20 days in the karuah river near the duralie mine 4 2 2 hunter of the baseline mines in the hunter subregion two open cut coal mines and 10 underground coal mines were not included in the surface water modelling table 3 both open cut mines are quite small and would be expected to have little impact on surface water the 10 underground coal mines are also expected to have little impact on surface water as they are either under lakes or are quite small extensions to currently existing mines of the 22 mines considered likely to proceed in the hunter subregion table 1 insufficient information about proposed operations meant that four could not be included in the surface water modelling table 3 these were the new west muswellbrook open cut coal mine as well as proposed expansions to the austar mandalong and wambo underground mines expansions to the chain valley underground mine was also not included in the surface water modelling as it occurs under a coastal lake there are no coal seam gas operations currently operating nor planned for the hunter subregion the increase in the number of low flow days due to additional coal resource development in the hunter subregion is shown in fig 8 at the 95th percentile top right 408 km of the stream network are predicted to experience increases of at least 3 low flow days per year a further 801 km of streams that were not explicitly represented in the river network could experience similar increases in low flow days due to additional coal resource development because they flow through catchments disturbed by mining where changes have been quantified about 22 km of streams are very likely 5th percentile to experience increases of at least 3 days per year they include parts of the wyong river saddlers creek loders creek dry creek and swamp creek at the 95th percentile increases in low flow days in these streams may exceed 200 days per year due to additional coal resource development the potentially large changes in some of the small tributary streams of the hunter river are relatively localised the much larger hunter river is not particularly sensitive to the modelled changes in inflows from these tributaries because of its much greater volume of flow and because its flow tends to be augmented with releases from storage from dams upstream 4 2 3 namoi the coal resource developments included in the surface water model for the namoi were identical to those included in the groundwater model discussed in section 4 1 the increase in the number of zero flow days due to additional coal resource development in the namoi subregion is shown in fig 9 unlike the wetter gloucester and hunter subregions many streams in the namoi and galilee subregions are ephemeral and thus the increase in the number of zero flow days defined as days with flow 1 ml day is a more appropriate metric for assessing changes in low flow dynamics than low flow days at the 95th percentile there are 1678 km of streams that could experience three or more additional zero flow days per year in the namoi subregion at the 5th percentile this could be as small as 91 km of streams note that there are another unquantified but potentially impacted 3629 km of streams where zero flow days may also increase but were not modelled or not able to be extrapolated to for the reasons discussed above these potentially large changes in some of the small tributary streams of the namoi river are relatively localised like the hunter river the much larger namoi river is not particularly sensitive to the modelled changes in inflows from these tributaries because of its much greater volume of flow and because its flow tends to be augmented with releases from storage from dams upstream 4 2 4 galilee the coal resource developments included in the surface water model for the galilee were identical to those included in the groundwater model discussed in section 4 1 the increase in the number of zero flow days due to additional coal resource development in the galilee subregion is shown in fig 10 at the 5th percentile 347 km of streams are predicted to experience increases in zero flow days of at least 3 days per year with 183 km of these experiencing increases of at least 20 days per year at the 50th percentile 1034 km of streams are modelled to experience increases of at least 3 days per year at the 95th percentile this increases to 1108 km of streams with another 1781 km where increases of at least 3 days per year cannot be ruled out there are 956 km of modelled streams which are predicted to have at least an increase of 20 days per year of zero flow at the 95th percentile and 798 km of these streams have an increase of at least 80 days per year increases in zero flow days above the 200 day maximum range are only evident at the 95th percentile with 591 km of streams predicted to experience at least this amount of impact 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater results from across the four subregions as shown in figs 3 6 indicate that drawdown of greater than 0 2 m is very likely 95th percentile at distances of up to 5 km from each coal mine conversely drawdown of greater than 0 2 m is very unlikely 5th percentile at distances greater than 20 km from a coal mine these results suggest that the combined impact from open cut pits or underground mining from developments within 10 km needs to be considered cumulatively whilst developments that are further than 40 km apart can probably be considered as separate developments in terms of impacts on groundwater results from the two subregions where csg development was modelled gloucester and namoi indicate that drawdown in the regional aquifer as a result of the extraction of coal seam gas from deeper layers occurs over much larger areas than that from open cut or underground coal mining but in general is of a smaller magnitude this effect can be seen by the lower magnitude of drawdowns around the gloucester gas project in fig 3 and narrabri gas project in fig 5 compared to levels of drawdown seen around nearby open cut and underground coal mines in these two subregions this is because the wells that are used to extract csg cover a larger area but are relatively sparse and because the depressurisation of groundwater is occurring much deeper underground these changes are less likely to propagate upwards into the regional water table aquifer due to lower permeability layers in between the results above related to cumulative impacts from nearby coal mines may not therefore apply to csg projects but it is possible that extraction of csg will have a smaller impact on groundwater levels in the regional water table aquifer than open cut or underground coal mining the results indicate that there are numerous potential developments in close proximity across all four subregions that can have significant combined impact on groundwater drawdowns under these circumstances environmental impact assessments of individual developments should also consider interactions with adjacent developments so that the regulator can make informed decisions on cumulative groundwater related impacts in a region 5 2 surface water to understand the significance of the modelled increases in low flow or zero flow days it is useful to look at them in the context of the inter annual variability in the number of low flow or zero flow days per year due to climate variability under the baseline in other words are the modelled increases due to additional coal resource development within the natural range of variability of the longer term flow regime which would suggest the system might be adapted to the range of possible increases or are they potentially moving the system outside the range of hydrological variability it currently experiences note however that small changes in the hydrologic regime may have significant ecological consequences comparing the magnitude of the changes to the long term climate variability does not mean that changes that are less than climate variability are not significant however if the modelled changes are much greater than the long term climate variability then it is more likely that the hydrological changes are ecologically significant we are not therefore ruling out impacts where the change in low flow characteristics is less than inter annual variability but rather highlighting those areas where it is greater than inter annual variability we also discuss total reductions in water availability on end of system streamflows in each region 5 2 1 gloucester increases in the number of low flow days due to additional coal resource development in the gloucester subregion are shown in fig 7 most of the increases in the number of low flow days are less than those streams experience naturally due to inter annual variability only at the 95th percentile in the avon river near the rocky hill coal mine are the increases in the number of low flow days similar to the range of low flow days seen due to inter annual variability that is the stream is expected to see an extra 20 80 low flow days due to additional coal resource development and this increase is similar to the range seen over the entire period of record where the difference in the number of low flow days between a dry year and a wet year is also between 20 and 80 this does not mean that the stream will not experience ecological impacts due to these changes but these impacts are arguably larger in some of the other subregions where the increase in number of low flow days far exceeds the range of conditions that the streams currently see due to inter annual variability there is some evidence of cumulative impacts on surface water in the gloucester subregion whereby hydrological changes in the avon river due to the expansion of the stratford coal mine may be enhanced by the hydrological impacts of the rocky hill coal mine and gloucester gas project moving downstream total reductions in streamflow at the junction of the avon river with the gloucester river are around 4 gl year out of an average annual flow of 309 gl year a little over 1 despite these cumulative impacts any changes in these streams become insignificant when the avon river joins the much larger gloucester river this is seen by the lack of change downstream of this point towards the top of fig 7 the average annual flow at this point is 853 gl year meaning that the reduction of 4 gl year represents a reduction of well below 1 5 2 2 hunter at the 5th percentile the increase in the number of low flow days in the hunter subregion is either not significant or less than inter annual variability at all locations except for one small unnamed stream orange circle in the mid north of the subregion where the increase of 80 200 low flow days per year is similar to the range seen due to inter annual variability at the 50th and 95th percentiles increase in the number of low flow days at this point is now larger than the range of low flow days seen due to inter annual variability many of the other locations showing increases of more than 80 low flow days per year are also exceeding the range of conditions seen due to inter annual variability as are some of the locations showing increases of 20 80 low flow days per year many of these changes are occurring in small unregulated streams in close proximity to mines as discussed above in the larger hunter river increases in the number of low flow days are generally smaller and within the range of natural variability seen under the baseline however on the hunter river downstream of its junction with saltwater creek to just upstream of singleton there is a 5 chance of increases of more than 80 days per year in low flow days this is comparable to the inter annual variability seen at this point these changes likely reflect the more extreme groundwater drawdown results and associated reductions in baseflow rather than sensitivity of the river to changes in tributary inflows that is flow regulation in the hunter river minimises the potential for hydrological impacts to accumulate moving downstream at the end of the hunter river hunter greta represented by the blue dot on fig 8 to the nw of maitland total reductions in streamflow are around 30 gl year out of an annual average flow of 1269 gl year a little over 2 further upstream on the hunter river just downstream of the junction with saltwater creek see fig 8 this total reduction in streamflow of 30 gl year is more than 3 of the average annual flow of 897 gl year 5 2 3 namoi at the 5th percentile the increase in number of zero flow days in the namoi subregion is either not significant or less than inter annual variability at all locations except for bollol creek orange circle in the mid east of the subregion where the increase of 80 200 low flow days per year is similar to the range seen under the baseline at the 50th and 95th percentiles increase in the number of zero flow days at this point is now larger than the range of zero flow days seen due to inter annual variability at the 50th percentile the other two locations with increases of 80 200 zero flow days per year orange dots on fig 9 also exceed the range seen due to inter annual variability at the 95th percentile many of the other locations showing increases of more than 80 low flow days per year are exceeding the range of conditions seen due to inter variability under the baseline as are some of the locations showing increases of 20 80 low flow days per year as for the hunter subregion most of these changes are occurring in small streams that are not subject to flow regulation in the larger namoi river increases in the number of low flow days are generally smaller and less than the range of conditions seen due to inter annual variability as a result similar to the hunter river flow regulation minimises the potential for hydrological impacts to accumulate moving downstream on the namoi river the namoi river joins the barwon river near the town of walgett in the namoi river at walgett far left dot on fig 9 the reduction in streamflow of around 6 gl year out of an annual average flow of 3301 gl year represents much less than 1 however as the namoi river displays large inter annual variability this percentage reduction would be much larger in dry years 5 2 4 galilee because the streams in the galilee subregion are mostly ephemeral and show a great degree of inter annual variability even though there are substantial increases in the number of zero flow days shown in fig 10 many of these changes are less than the range seen due to inter annual variability under the baseline for instance at the 5th percentile none of the modelled changes are comparable to the range seen under the baseline at the 50th percentile only the six most downstream nodes on the suttor river which show an additional 20 80 days of zero flow are similar to the range of conditions seen due to inter annual variability at the 95th percentile however all of the locations showing more than 200 additional zero flow days per year exceed the range of conditions seen under the baseline while those locations in the south of the region showing an additional 80 200 zero flow days per year are similar to the range seen due to inter annual variability under the baseline modelled increases in the number of zero flow days are largest along the main reaches of the belyando river and that part of the suttor river downstream of its junction with the belyando river fig 10 this indicates that changes in the low flow regime are likely to be more substantial for reaches where impacts from multiple mining operations can cumulatively impact downstream sections of the main river system as opposed to smaller tributaries that may occur closer to individual mines but are not influenced by multiple mining operations it is unlikely that any of these hydrological changes would propagate past lake dalrymple in the north of the subregion due to the much larger inflows from the burdekin river at this point in analysing these zero flow modelling results it is important to be aware that many reaches of the belyando and suttor rivers that show a 5 chance of more than an additional 200 zero flow days may not actually flow for 200 days in most years however in wet years these rivers can receive considerable inflows and it is possible for over 200 days of streamflow to occur these years are when the impacts are at a maximum and thus are the ones reported here the belyando river joins the suttor river upstream of lake dalrymple as shown on fig 10 at the last node before this junction the reduction in streamflow of around 75 gl year out of an annual average flow of 2057 gl year represents a little under 4 however similar to the namoi river the belyando river displays large inter annual variability and this percentage reduction would be much larger in dry years 6 conclusions this paper assessed the potential hydrological impacts due to additional coal resource developments across four subregions in eastern australia namely the gloucester hunter namoi and galilee uncertainty was also considered in the modelling to provide the plausible range of impact and the results were presented as the median impact and the 5th to 95th percentile range of impact at the 5th percentile best case scenario the impacts of additional coal resource developments on groundwater drawdown and number of low flow zero flow days is relatively small however at the 95th percentile worst case scenario groundwater drawdown can extend for up to 10 km from additional coal mines and csg developments and the altered surface water hydrological regime can extend for many kilometres downstream this is particularly the case where there are multiple developments in close proximity that can lead to cumulative hydrological impacts in regulated river systems such as the hunter and namoi rivers the impacts on low flows are mitigated to some extent by regulated releases however the impacts of these additional releases on dam levels and other water users were not assessed here as a general rule of thumb coal resource developments that occur within 10 km of each other must consider the potential for cumulative impacts on groundwater coal resource developments that are more than 40 km apart probably do not need to consider cumulative impacts on groundwater but depending on their orientation within a catchment there may be significant cumulative impacts on surface water to consider this paper was limited to showing hydrological impacts as defined through two metrics groundwater drawdown and changes in the low flow regime as described by an increase in the number of low flow days or zero flow days in ephemeral systems while these metrics are those most sensitive to coal resource development there may be additional metrics particularly related to surface water viney et al 2020b which could also be examined these changes can be visualised using the explorer tool at https www bioregionalassessments gov au ba explorer the conclusions drawn in this paper particularly those related to bounding the range of possible impacts were possible to a large extent due to the explicit focus on predictive uncertainty however the range of uncertainty of hydrological impacts presented in this paper seen in the difference between the results at the 5th percentile and those at the 95th percentile is quite large reducing this potential range would be possible by collecting field data to more accurately constrain the range of parameter values used in the hydrological modelling this should be a focus for future studies the cumulative impact assessment approach presented in this paper represents a powerful tool for assessing the impacts of cumulative developments and has provided useful rules of thumb for when it might need to be applied the approach taken did not however allow for an explicit assessment of the cumulative impacts of baseline and expansion mines future cumulative impact assessments may wish to consider incorporating this aspect the focus of this paper was also on hydrological changes only the hydrological changes modelled here may also have impacts on ecosystems and the water dependent assets that exist within these ecosystems this analysis will be the subject of a future paper credit

5044,this paper presents an assessment of the hydrological impacts of proposed coal mines and coal seam gas csg developments in the gloucester hunter namoi and galilee subregions of eastern australia surface water and groundwater modelling was carried out to assess the cumulative regional scale hydrological impacts of multiple coal and coal seam gas developments the hydrological metrics assessed were groundwater drawdown and changes in low flow characteristics as measured by the number of low flow or zero flow days per year uncertainty in the modelling was also considered and the results are presented as the median and plausible range 5th to 95th percentile from many simulations which attempt to capture a wide range of uncertainty the results indicate that under the best case 5th percentile scenario the impact of additional proposed coal resource developments on groundwater drawdown and surface water characteristics can be quite small however under the worse case 95th percentile groundwater drawdown is very likely for up to 5 km from the coal resource developments but unlikely beyond 20 km altered surface water characteristics can extend for many kilometres downstream particularly in unregulated systems the cumulative hydrological impact is enhanced where there are multiple developments in close proximity the results are being used to inform policy and the approval process for coal resource developments keywords hydrological impacts coal mining coal seam gas cumulative impact assessment 1 introduction worldwide there is growing concern about environmental issues particularly those posed by ever increasing greenhouse gas emissions see for example ripple et al 2017 these concerns have been accompanied by increasing public awareness and citizen activism with wide spread opposition to new coal mines and coal seam gas developments across much of the developed world roser renouf et al 2014 despite this the coal mining industry has a large political influence anderson 1995 and new coal mines and unconventional gas developments continue to be approved and constructed this has led to conflict between development proponents and the community particularly in developed countries this is particularly true in australia where both coal mining higginbotham et al 2010 and coal seam gas developments luke et al 2018 face wide spread public opposition despite this public opposition new coal mines and coal seam gas developments are still being approved by federal and state governments the carmichael coal mine in the galilee basin in queensland is a good example of the conflict between coal developers and sectors of society opposed to its development with final approvals recently being granted by the state government despite community opposition currell et al 2020 as well as the carmichael coal mine there are many other coal mines and csg development proposals in central and eastern australia currently being considered for approval by federal and state governments these coal developments will have some impact on water resources and the ecological economic and socio cultural assets that depend on water in regions where there are multiple coal and csg developments in potentially hydrologically connected systems there is a need for assessing the impact of proposed developments that is i cumulative and ii allows for a spatially explicit assessment of future impacts on water and water dependent assets the need for a cumulative approach is driven largely by the fact that the site scale environmental impact statements required of development proponents typically do not consider cumulative impacts due to other nearby developments as an example the importance of considering cumulative impacts of multiple coal mines in the catchments draining to the great barrier reef including those in the galilee basin examined here is highlighted by grech et al 2016 one of the aims of the current study is to instil public confidence in the impact assessment of proposed coal resource developments as a result an assessment of the uncertainty in these predictions is paramount impacts on water are particularly contentious with some studies questioning whether current hydrogeological investigations provide an adequate assessment of potential impacts on water resources and water dependent assets currell et al 2017 it is estimated that coal mining in nsw and queensland where all of the mines considered in the current paper are located consume around 225 000 ml of freshwater per year which is the equivalent of the water consumption of a city of 5 2 million people overton 2020 clearly the expansion of the coal mining industry could have large impacts on other water users despite the controversy surrounding the topic surprisingly few studies can be found in the literature that apply a cumulative impact assessment approach to assess the potential impacts of coal resource development on water resources and water dependent assets most studies tend to focus on either the hydrological impacts of coal mining e g bonta et al 1997 or unconventional gas development e g kondash and vengosh 2015 clancy et al 2018 even though at least in australia both types of development frequently occur together in the same catchments in canada alberta has a cumulative effects management framework guiding the development of their oil and gas industry johnson et al 2011 although it has been widely criticised as being ineffective duinker and greig 2006 in many ways australia has taken the lead in recognising the importance of considering cumulative impacts with publications such as franks et al 2010 and the regulatory arm of the office of groundwater impact and assessment ogia which considers cumulative impacts in queensland however there is only one cumulative management area overseen by ogia the surat basin and they only consider unconventional gas development and not the coal mines that occur in close proximity to the coal seam gas developments in australia a water trigger was added to the australian federal government epbc act in 2013 that gave the commonwealth regulator the department of the environment oversight of the direct indirect and cumulative impacts of coal resource development on water dependent assets as a result of this the department of the environment contracted the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro along with the bureau of meteorology and geoscience australia to undertake a series of cumulative impact assessments known as bioregional assessments to assess the potential impacts of coal and csg development across eastern australia on water resources and water dependent assets these water dependent assets include ecological assets such as wetlands or the habitat of endangered species economic assets such as water access rights and socio cultural assets such as indigenous sites this paper presents the key findings of that assessment as related to impacts on surface and groundwater in four key subregions see section 2 an important focus of the bioregional assessments program was an assessment of cumulative impacts of proposed developments at a regional scale and a requirement to map the likelihood of impact that is to show areas where impacts are possible and to rule out areas where the assessments indicate that impacts are highly unlikely additionally the ba programme grounds the analysis in causal relationships between developments and potential impacts in terms of water mediated causal pathways and these provide the scientific rigour to link developments with changes to water and potential impacts on water dependent assets throughout the modelling process not reported in the current paper but available at www bioregionalassessments gov au 2 study areas an assessment was made of all potential coal mines and csg developments across six bioregions in central and eastern australia fig 1 and those that were considered likely to proceed in the next decade were identified for further analysis those developments that were assessed as being likely to proceed anticipate the extraction of approximately 41 000 mt of coal across 58 new mines or expansions to existing mines as well as approximately 16 000 pj of natural gas from eight new csg developments these developments are valued at around 3 trillion dollars to the australian economy and burning them would release approximately 75 000 mt of co2 into the atmosphere note that this assessment was made in mid 2015 since that time some developments are no longer likely to proceed while some others have now been proposed full details are in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the bioregional assessments were a very large program of work employing over 100 fte researchers over 5 years the six bioregions examined encompassed 13 subregions which are also shown in fig 1 the outputs of the program in its entirety are contained in 104 reports all of which are available for download from www bioregionalassessments gov au the purpose of the current paper is to summarise key findings related to the impacts of underground and open cut coal mining as well as coal seam gas extraction on groundwater and surface water in four key subregions where development is most likely to occur these are the gloucester hunter namoi and galilee subregions fig 1 2 1 gloucester the gloucester subregion was the smallest subregion analysed being just 481 km2 and straddling two catchments the gloucester river flowing north and the karuah river flowing south fig 3 it is situated in eastern nsw and is part of the northern sydney basin bioregion the main land use is grazing cattle and there are just 5000 people living in the subregion mostly in the towns of gloucester and stroud there are two open cut coal mines duralie and stratford currently operating as of december 2012 both mines have expansion plans while there are also proposals for a new coal mine rocky hill and csg project the gloucester gas project current coal resource developments as of december 2012 as well as those considered likely to proceed in the next decade for all four subregions are listed in table 1 december 2012 was chosen as the cut off date for assessing the currency of mines as this was the start date of the assessment 2 2 hunter the hunter subregion is also located in nsw and is the second subregion considered to be part of the northern sydney basin bioregion it is much larger than the gloucester subregion being approximately 17 000 km2 it is home to the major city of newcastle fig 4 and is known for coal mining power generation equine and viticulture industries there are 42 currently operating coal mines comprising 22 open cut and 20 underground mines there are 22 coal developments considered likely to proceed comprising four new open cut mines two new underground coal mines and expansions to 16 currently operating mines there are no coal seam gas operations currently operating nor planned for the hunter subregion 2 3 namoi the namoi subregion is located adjacent to the hunter subregion in northern nsw it is approximately 30 000 km2 in area its major towns are gunnedah and narrabri fig 5 and is part of the murray darling basin an important cropping area of australia there are six currently operating coal mines in the namoi subregion comprising five open cut and one underground coal mine the nine additional coal mines considered to be likely to proceed comprise three new open cut mines two new underground mines one new underground open cut mine and expansions to three currently operating open cut mines there is also one csg operation proposed for the namoi subregion the narrabri gas project 2 4 galilee the galilee subregion in qld was the largest subregion examined at approximately 250 000 km2 it is semi arid is used for grazing on native pastures and is sparsely populated home to around 20 000 people fig 6 unlike the other subregions there are no currently operating coal mines or csg developments in the galilee subregion there are 14 coal mines comprising three open cut mines two underground coal mines and nine combined underground open cut coal mines which are considered likely to proceed there are also three csg projects that are considered likely to proceed 3 methods 3 1 causal pathways and conceptual models conceptually four primary causal pathways were identified via which hydrological changes from coal resource developments could propagate to water dependent assets these are driven by 1 coal seam depressurisation and dewatering 2 preferential flow paths into overlying underlying aquifers i e enhanced inter aquifer connectivity from fracturing faulting leaky aquitards or the integrity or positioning of wells 3 management storage and disposal of co produced water 4 disruption of natural surface drainage fig 2 illustrates these causal pathways using a conceptual block diagram of the gloucester subregion while there are regionally specific variations these causal pathways are applicable to all forms of underground and open cut coal mining as well as coal seam gas extraction across all the study areas conceptual models were also developed for the other three subregions not shown here 3 2 numerical modelling and scenario definition having developed a conceptual model of the four causal pathways via which coal and csg development may impact assets that are dependent on surface and or groundwater numerical models were then constructed to represent the potential hydrological impacts quantitatively the models used as well as references to reports describing the application of these models are given in table 2 the choice of groundwater models was driven largely by data availability to parameterise and run them in gloucester hunter and namoi there was sufficient data to parameterise a dynamic groundwater model in galilee a simple analytical element model was used as there was insufficient data to parameterise a dynamic model there is little water level data in the galilee subregion and there is no current development in galilee the choice of surface water models was driven by whether there were sufficient gauging stations to parameterise a river system model along with the need for such a complex model simple landscape models were adopted in the gloucester and galilee as there are no major dams and only limited diversions for irrigation in the hunter and namoi the main rivers are regulated by large dams to manage water supply for irrigation industry and town uses thus full river system models were used to capture this complexity two modelling scenarios were defined 1 a baseline scenario which included all commercially operating coal mines in the subregion as of december 2012 as described in the section above it also included all extensions to current mines that had already received government approvals 2 an expansion scenario that included all the baseline coal mines as well as the proposed underground and open cut coal mines and csg developments as described sections 4 1 and 4 2 the primary focus of the current paper is the difference in hydrologic response between these two scenarios which represents the difference attributable to the proposed additional coal resource developments the models were run for the 90 year period 2013 2102 and the maximum change in a range of hydrologic parameters over this period was extracted from the model outputs for groundwater the parameter chosen was groundwater drawdown in the regional water table aquifer for surface water nine hydrological characteristics covering a range of flow characteristics were chosen viney et al 2020a b contains details of these characteristics as well as a full description of the surface water modelling methodology in the current paper increase in the number of low flow or zero flow days only is reported as it is the surface water metric found to be most likely to be altered by coal resource development full changes in all streamflow metrics across all four subregions can be seen using the explorer tool found at https www bioregionalassessments gov au ba explorer the same climate sequence was used for both the baseline and expansion model runs this climate sequence was created by repeating the 30 year period from 1983 to 2013 three times with a climate change signal imposed on it details are in viney et al 2020b the awra l landscape model was run across all four subregions under both the baseline and expansion scenarios to estimate total runoff in general terms coal resource development can impact on surface water in numerous ways viney et al 2020b in terms of the modelling however impacts on surface water were represented through three mechanisms as represented in fig 2 the first is through open cut coal mines capturing overland flow and thus reducing surface runoff exiting the mine area the second is through underground mines reducing total runoff due to subsidence here total runoff was assumed to decrease by 10 and the third is via a reduction in baseflow which is estimated from the groundwater modelling see below in the hunter and namoi where a river system model was used the river heights from this model were used as boundary conditions in the groundwater model to allow the calculation of river losses becoming groundwater recharge in the gloucester and galilee the streams under examination are gaining streams as a result river losses to groundwater are minimal and so the river boundary in the groundwater model did not require a transient stream stage the groundwater model was run under both scenarios providing estimates of groundwater drawdowns as well as the difference in baseflows between both scenarios changing total runoff see above further details of the groundwater and surface water modelling approach are available in the project reports as listed in table 2 as well as crosbie et al 2016 peeters et al 2018b and viney 2016 2020a b estimating risks associated with coal development not only requires an estimate of the magnitude of impacts but also their likelihood or probability this necessitated a probabilistic framework for numerical model development rather than a deterministic one the probabilistic framework to propagate uncertainty through numerical surface and groundwater models peeters et al 2016 2018b stochastically evaluates a wide range of parameter combinations the parameter combinations consistent with observations are selected through a limits of acceptability approach to generate an ensemble of predictions viney et al 2020a as some of these numerical models have long runtimes and in general thousands of runs are required to adequately bound the limits of uncertainty computational efficiency is increased using emulators cui et al 2018 the prediction focused uncertainty quantification is complemented with global sensitivity analysis peeters et al 2014 and a qualitative uncertainty analysis peeters 2017 the latter systematically lists the assumptions and model choices underpinning the modelling and uncertainty analysis and discusses the potential effect on predictions results are presented for the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles from the groundwater and surface water models in order to capture the uncertainty inherent in this regional scale analysis results for the 95th percentile were then used to define a zone of potential hydrological change peeters et al 2018b viney et al 2020b outside of which it is very unlikely that impacts will occur to do this a decision was made that a less than 5 chance of less than 0 2 m of drawdown or a 3 day or 5 change in any of nine surface water hydrological metrics may be considered insignificant acknowledging that these thresholds may not represent ecologically safe limits see currell 2016 for example while this choice of thresholds is necessarily subjective the decision to choose these metrics and likelihood of change was made as a result of extensive consultation with state government decision makers to ensure that these metrics and thresholds were useful for them decision makers can therefore use these outputs to determine the area where hydrological changes are very likely to occur within the area bounded by the 5th percentile and where they are very unlikely to occur outside the area bounded by the 95th percentile note that as we selected the largest change in hydrological characteristics over the period 2013 2102 for each model output node the hydrological changes reported in this paper represent the maximum change in these hydrological characteristics over the 90 year modelled period as a result the hydrological changes presented here are very unlikely to be seen at any single point in time because the changes at each model node may occur at different times for different locations there was insufficient available information in order to model some coal mines particularly those that have not yet commenced operations where information on pumping rate exact mine location and size etc has yet to be made public by the proponent some mines in the baseline scenario were also not modelled due to the limited impacts of that mine on hydrology for example where the longwall panels occur beneath a lake the number of underground coal mines open cut coal mines expansions to current mines and csg projects that were modelled in each subregion under the baseline and expansion scenarios is shown in table 3 note that the decision on which coal resource developments to include in the study was made in mid 2015 since that time some of the developments that were included in the modelling and listed in table 2 now look unlikely to proceed due to the proponent pulling out or the state or federal government refusing development proposals details are in the subregion specific sections on groundwater and surface water in sections 4 1 and 4 2 4 results 4 1 groundwater 4 1 1 gloucester all baseline and expansion mines and the sole csg development in the gloucester subregion were able to be represented in the groundwater model note however that since the decision on which developments to include was made the proponent of the gloucester gas project agl have announced that they will no longer be proceeding with this development additionally the rocky hill coal mine was refused government approvals and is also unlikely to proceed despite this both developments were included in the modelling additional groundwater drawdown defined as that drawdown due to the expansion developments that is predicted to occur on top of that drawdown due to baseline coal mines for the gloucester subregion is shown in fig 3 the left hand side of this figure shows that additional drawdown in the regional water table aquifer in excess of 0 2 m is very likely for an area of nearly 20 km2 the right hand side of this figure shows that additional drawdown in excess of 0 2 m is very unlikely to exceed an area of around 100 km2 most of this drawdown is close to the proposed rocky hill coal mine and gloucester gas project in the north of the subregion the currently existing open cut mine at stratford only has a small impact on additional drawdown due to expansion plans the duralie mine has expansion plans to the north of the current mine pit thus the additional drawdown seen there in this and subsequent groundwater figures modelled drawdowns close to open cut mines are considered unreliable because of the very steep hydraulic gradients at the mine pit interface thus modelled changes are obscured there in this and subsequent groundwater drawdown figures underground mines and csg developments are not subject to this limitation understanding drawdown close to open cut coal mines is best handled by a finer resolution model not a regional scale analysis of the type carried out here which is better suited to examining cumulative impacts from multiple developments 4 1 2 hunter all baseline mines in the hunter subregion were included in the groundwater model of the 22 mines considered likely to proceed table 1 insufficient information about proposed operations meant that five could not be included in the groundwater modelling table 3 these were the new west muswellbrook open cut coal mine as well as proposed expansions to the austar and wambo underground mines and mount arthur and wilpinjong open cut mines there are no coal seam gas operations currently operating nor planned for the hunter subregion as of writing all of the mines in the expansion scenario are still considered likely to proceed additional drawdown due to these 17 mines in the expansion scenario is shown in fig 4 the top left figure shows that drawdown in the regional water table aquifer in excess of 0 2 m is very likely for an area of 528 km2 the top right figure shows that it is very unlikely that drawdown in excess of 0 2 m will exceed an area of 2441 km2 these areas of drawdown are distributed throughout the subregion reflecting the wide dispersion of proposed coal mine developments in the hunter the patchy nature of the additional drawdown also reflects the fact that there are currently 42 mines in operation in the subregion some of the additional mines will therefore have little impact in terms of drawdown as the groundwater levels have already been drawn down significantly by the existing mines 4 1 3 namoi all baseline mines in the namoi subregion were included in the groundwater model of the nine mines considered likely to proceed table 1 two could not be included in the groundwater model due to insufficient information table 3 these were the expansion to the vickery south open cut coal mine and the new gunnedah precinct open cut and underground coal mine the narrabri gas project was able to be modelled after the expansion scenario was finalised the nsw government bought back bhp s caroona coal exploration licences on the liverpool plains and thus it is unlikely to proceed as of july 2017 the shenhua exploration licence for the watermark coal project was reduced by 51 4 to exclude the liverpool plains however this did not change the operational mining area and therefore the hydrological modelling of the watermark coal project carried out here remains relevant additional drawdown due to the eight coal resource developments in the expansion scenario is shown in fig 5 the top right figure shows that drawdown in the regional water table aquifer in excess of 0 2 m is very likely for an area of 156 km2 the bottom right figure shows that it is very unlikely that drawdown in excess of 0 2 m will exceed an area of 2299 km2 of this area of drawdown 287 km2 occurs in the agriculturally important namoi alluvium this represents 8 of the upper namoi alluvium and 0 01 of the lower namoi alluvium 4 1 4 galilee in the galilee subregion there are no commercially operating coal mines or csg developments in the baseline scenario of the 14 coal mines considered likely to proceed table 1 there was insufficient information to model seven the open cut blackall mine and the underground alpha west and hughenden coal mines as well as the combined open cut and underground operations at clyde park milray pentland and west pentland the three csg projects the glenaras gas project gunn project and blue energy s exploration tenement 813 also had insufficient information available to model them at this stage all seven mines in the expansion scenario table 3 are still considered likely to proceed additional drawdown due to the seven modelled coal mines is shown in fig 6 the top right figure shows that drawdown in excess of 0 2 m in the regional water table aquifer is very likely for an area of 2820 km2 the bottom right figure shows that it is very unlikely that drawdown in excess of 0 2 m will exceed an area of 13 364 km2 this drawdown occurs within two distinct areas centred on proposed coal mines there is considerable overlap in the drawdown cones of depression as a result of the proposed coal mines in each area major aquifers of the geological eromanga basin part of the great artesian basin are unlikely to see significant levels of drawdown nearby springs are very likely to experience some level of drawdown 4 2 surface water 4 2 1 gloucester as for the groundwater modelling all baseline and expansion mines and the sole csg development in the gloucester subregion were able to be represented in the surface water model the increase in the number of low flow days defined in this paper as the lowest 10th percentile of flows as assessed over the entire 100 year modelling period due to additional coal resource development in the gloucester subregion is shown in fig 7 in this and subsequent figures the circles show the increase in the number of low flow days per year at streamflow nodes that were directly modelled where possible these changes were interpolated to stream links between these nodes in some cases changes in hydrology due to coal mines or major streams joining the network between nodes meant that streamflow may change significantly between nodes and thus this interpolation was not possible in these cases a dashed pink line indicates those streams where a change in hydrology cannot be ruled out but also could not be quantified at the 5th percentile it is unlikely that there are increases of more than 3 low flow days per year anywhere in the subregion although there are a couple of streams that pass close to the rocky hill stratford and duralie mines where potential impacts larger than this cannot be ruled out at the 50th percentile the avon river is predicted to experience an extra 3 20 low flow days per year where it passes the rocky hill coal mine and gloucester gas project at the 95th percentile the avon river may experience increases of 20 80 low flow days per year and there are larger increases in smaller streams near the gloucester gas project rocky hill and stratford mines as well as increases of 3 20 days in the karuah river near the duralie mine 4 2 2 hunter of the baseline mines in the hunter subregion two open cut coal mines and 10 underground coal mines were not included in the surface water modelling table 3 both open cut mines are quite small and would be expected to have little impact on surface water the 10 underground coal mines are also expected to have little impact on surface water as they are either under lakes or are quite small extensions to currently existing mines of the 22 mines considered likely to proceed in the hunter subregion table 1 insufficient information about proposed operations meant that four could not be included in the surface water modelling table 3 these were the new west muswellbrook open cut coal mine as well as proposed expansions to the austar mandalong and wambo underground mines expansions to the chain valley underground mine was also not included in the surface water modelling as it occurs under a coastal lake there are no coal seam gas operations currently operating nor planned for the hunter subregion the increase in the number of low flow days due to additional coal resource development in the hunter subregion is shown in fig 8 at the 95th percentile top right 408 km of the stream network are predicted to experience increases of at least 3 low flow days per year a further 801 km of streams that were not explicitly represented in the river network could experience similar increases in low flow days due to additional coal resource development because they flow through catchments disturbed by mining where changes have been quantified about 22 km of streams are very likely 5th percentile to experience increases of at least 3 days per year they include parts of the wyong river saddlers creek loders creek dry creek and swamp creek at the 95th percentile increases in low flow days in these streams may exceed 200 days per year due to additional coal resource development the potentially large changes in some of the small tributary streams of the hunter river are relatively localised the much larger hunter river is not particularly sensitive to the modelled changes in inflows from these tributaries because of its much greater volume of flow and because its flow tends to be augmented with releases from storage from dams upstream 4 2 3 namoi the coal resource developments included in the surface water model for the namoi were identical to those included in the groundwater model discussed in section 4 1 the increase in the number of zero flow days due to additional coal resource development in the namoi subregion is shown in fig 9 unlike the wetter gloucester and hunter subregions many streams in the namoi and galilee subregions are ephemeral and thus the increase in the number of zero flow days defined as days with flow 1 ml day is a more appropriate metric for assessing changes in low flow dynamics than low flow days at the 95th percentile there are 1678 km of streams that could experience three or more additional zero flow days per year in the namoi subregion at the 5th percentile this could be as small as 91 km of streams note that there are another unquantified but potentially impacted 3629 km of streams where zero flow days may also increase but were not modelled or not able to be extrapolated to for the reasons discussed above these potentially large changes in some of the small tributary streams of the namoi river are relatively localised like the hunter river the much larger namoi river is not particularly sensitive to the modelled changes in inflows from these tributaries because of its much greater volume of flow and because its flow tends to be augmented with releases from storage from dams upstream 4 2 4 galilee the coal resource developments included in the surface water model for the galilee were identical to those included in the groundwater model discussed in section 4 1 the increase in the number of zero flow days due to additional coal resource development in the galilee subregion is shown in fig 10 at the 5th percentile 347 km of streams are predicted to experience increases in zero flow days of at least 3 days per year with 183 km of these experiencing increases of at least 20 days per year at the 50th percentile 1034 km of streams are modelled to experience increases of at least 3 days per year at the 95th percentile this increases to 1108 km of streams with another 1781 km where increases of at least 3 days per year cannot be ruled out there are 956 km of modelled streams which are predicted to have at least an increase of 20 days per year of zero flow at the 95th percentile and 798 km of these streams have an increase of at least 80 days per year increases in zero flow days above the 200 day maximum range are only evident at the 95th percentile with 591 km of streams predicted to experience at least this amount of impact 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater results from across the four subregions as shown in figs 3 6 indicate that drawdown of greater than 0 2 m is very likely 95th percentile at distances of up to 5 km from each coal mine conversely drawdown of greater than 0 2 m is very unlikely 5th percentile at distances greater than 20 km from a coal mine these results suggest that the combined impact from open cut pits or underground mining from developments within 10 km needs to be considered cumulatively whilst developments that are further than 40 km apart can probably be considered as separate developments in terms of impacts on groundwater results from the two subregions where csg development was modelled gloucester and namoi indicate that drawdown in the regional aquifer as a result of the extraction of coal seam gas from deeper layers occurs over much larger areas than that from open cut or underground coal mining but in general is of a smaller magnitude this effect can be seen by the lower magnitude of drawdowns around the gloucester gas project in fig 3 and narrabri gas project in fig 5 compared to levels of drawdown seen around nearby open cut and underground coal mines in these two subregions this is because the wells that are used to extract csg cover a larger area but are relatively sparse and because the depressurisation of groundwater is occurring much deeper underground these changes are less likely to propagate upwards into the regional water table aquifer due to lower permeability layers in between the results above related to cumulative impacts from nearby coal mines may not therefore apply to csg projects but it is possible that extraction of csg will have a smaller impact on groundwater levels in the regional water table aquifer than open cut or underground coal mining the results indicate that there are numerous potential developments in close proximity across all four subregions that can have significant combined impact on groundwater drawdowns under these circumstances environmental impact assessments of individual developments should also consider interactions with adjacent developments so that the regulator can make informed decisions on cumulative groundwater related impacts in a region 5 2 surface water to understand the significance of the modelled increases in low flow or zero flow days it is useful to look at them in the context of the inter annual variability in the number of low flow or zero flow days per year due to climate variability under the baseline in other words are the modelled increases due to additional coal resource development within the natural range of variability of the longer term flow regime which would suggest the system might be adapted to the range of possible increases or are they potentially moving the system outside the range of hydrological variability it currently experiences note however that small changes in the hydrologic regime may have significant ecological consequences comparing the magnitude of the changes to the long term climate variability does not mean that changes that are less than climate variability are not significant however if the modelled changes are much greater than the long term climate variability then it is more likely that the hydrological changes are ecologically significant we are not therefore ruling out impacts where the change in low flow characteristics is less than inter annual variability but rather highlighting those areas where it is greater than inter annual variability we also discuss total reductions in water availability on end of system streamflows in each region 5 2 1 gloucester increases in the number of low flow days due to additional coal resource development in the gloucester subregion are shown in fig 7 most of the increases in the number of low flow days are less than those streams experience naturally due to inter annual variability only at the 95th percentile in the avon river near the rocky hill coal mine are the increases in the number of low flow days similar to the range of low flow days seen due to inter annual variability that is the stream is expected to see an extra 20 80 low flow days due to additional coal resource development and this increase is similar to the range seen over the entire period of record where the difference in the number of low flow days between a dry year and a wet year is also between 20 and 80 this does not mean that the stream will not experience ecological impacts due to these changes but these impacts are arguably larger in some of the other subregions where the increase in number of low flow days far exceeds the range of conditions that the streams currently see due to inter annual variability there is some evidence of cumulative impacts on surface water in the gloucester subregion whereby hydrological changes in the avon river due to the expansion of the stratford coal mine may be enhanced by the hydrological impacts of the rocky hill coal mine and gloucester gas project moving downstream total reductions in streamflow at the junction of the avon river with the gloucester river are around 4 gl year out of an average annual flow of 309 gl year a little over 1 despite these cumulative impacts any changes in these streams become insignificant when the avon river joins the much larger gloucester river this is seen by the lack of change downstream of this point towards the top of fig 7 the average annual flow at this point is 853 gl year meaning that the reduction of 4 gl year represents a reduction of well below 1 5 2 2 hunter at the 5th percentile the increase in the number of low flow days in the hunter subregion is either not significant or less than inter annual variability at all locations except for one small unnamed stream orange circle in the mid north of the subregion where the increase of 80 200 low flow days per year is similar to the range seen due to inter annual variability at the 50th and 95th percentiles increase in the number of low flow days at this point is now larger than the range of low flow days seen due to inter annual variability many of the other locations showing increases of more than 80 low flow days per year are also exceeding the range of conditions seen due to inter annual variability as are some of the locations showing increases of 20 80 low flow days per year many of these changes are occurring in small unregulated streams in close proximity to mines as discussed above in the larger hunter river increases in the number of low flow days are generally smaller and within the range of natural variability seen under the baseline however on the hunter river downstream of its junction with saltwater creek to just upstream of singleton there is a 5 chance of increases of more than 80 days per year in low flow days this is comparable to the inter annual variability seen at this point these changes likely reflect the more extreme groundwater drawdown results and associated reductions in baseflow rather than sensitivity of the river to changes in tributary inflows that is flow regulation in the hunter river minimises the potential for hydrological impacts to accumulate moving downstream at the end of the hunter river hunter greta represented by the blue dot on fig 8 to the nw of maitland total reductions in streamflow are around 30 gl year out of an annual average flow of 1269 gl year a little over 2 further upstream on the hunter river just downstream of the junction with saltwater creek see fig 8 this total reduction in streamflow of 30 gl year is more than 3 of the average annual flow of 897 gl year 5 2 3 namoi at the 5th percentile the increase in number of zero flow days in the namoi subregion is either not significant or less than inter annual variability at all locations except for bollol creek orange circle in the mid east of the subregion where the increase of 80 200 low flow days per year is similar to the range seen under the baseline at the 50th and 95th percentiles increase in the number of zero flow days at this point is now larger than the range of zero flow days seen due to inter annual variability at the 50th percentile the other two locations with increases of 80 200 zero flow days per year orange dots on fig 9 also exceed the range seen due to inter annual variability at the 95th percentile many of the other locations showing increases of more than 80 low flow days per year are exceeding the range of conditions seen due to inter variability under the baseline as are some of the locations showing increases of 20 80 low flow days per year as for the hunter subregion most of these changes are occurring in small streams that are not subject to flow regulation in the larger namoi river increases in the number of low flow days are generally smaller and less than the range of conditions seen due to inter annual variability as a result similar to the hunter river flow regulation minimises the potential for hydrological impacts to accumulate moving downstream on the namoi river the namoi river joins the barwon river near the town of walgett in the namoi river at walgett far left dot on fig 9 the reduction in streamflow of around 6 gl year out of an annual average flow of 3301 gl year represents much less than 1 however as the namoi river displays large inter annual variability this percentage reduction would be much larger in dry years 5 2 4 galilee because the streams in the galilee subregion are mostly ephemeral and show a great degree of inter annual variability even though there are substantial increases in the number of zero flow days shown in fig 10 many of these changes are less than the range seen due to inter annual variability under the baseline for instance at the 5th percentile none of the modelled changes are comparable to the range seen under the baseline at the 50th percentile only the six most downstream nodes on the suttor river which show an additional 20 80 days of zero flow are similar to the range of conditions seen due to inter annual variability at the 95th percentile however all of the locations showing more than 200 additional zero flow days per year exceed the range of conditions seen under the baseline while those locations in the south of the region showing an additional 80 200 zero flow days per year are similar to the range seen due to inter annual variability under the baseline modelled increases in the number of zero flow days are largest along the main reaches of the belyando river and that part of the suttor river downstream of its junction with the belyando river fig 10 this indicates that changes in the low flow regime are likely to be more substantial for reaches where impacts from multiple mining operations can cumulatively impact downstream sections of the main river system as opposed to smaller tributaries that may occur closer to individual mines but are not influenced by multiple mining operations it is unlikely that any of these hydrological changes would propagate past lake dalrymple in the north of the subregion due to the much larger inflows from the burdekin river at this point in analysing these zero flow modelling results it is important to be aware that many reaches of the belyando and suttor rivers that show a 5 chance of more than an additional 200 zero flow days may not actually flow for 200 days in most years however in wet years these rivers can receive considerable inflows and it is possible for over 200 days of streamflow to occur these years are when the impacts are at a maximum and thus are the ones reported here the belyando river joins the suttor river upstream of lake dalrymple as shown on fig 10 at the last node before this junction the reduction in streamflow of around 75 gl year out of an annual average flow of 2057 gl year represents a little under 4 however similar to the namoi river the belyando river displays large inter annual variability and this percentage reduction would be much larger in dry years 6 conclusions this paper assessed the potential hydrological impacts due to additional coal resource developments across four subregions in eastern australia namely the gloucester hunter namoi and galilee uncertainty was also considered in the modelling to provide the plausible range of impact and the results were presented as the median impact and the 5th to 95th percentile range of impact at the 5th percentile best case scenario the impacts of additional coal resource developments on groundwater drawdown and number of low flow zero flow days is relatively small however at the 95th percentile worst case scenario groundwater drawdown can extend for up to 10 km from additional coal mines and csg developments and the altered surface water hydrological regime can extend for many kilometres downstream this is particularly the case where there are multiple developments in close proximity that can lead to cumulative hydrological impacts in regulated river systems such as the hunter and namoi rivers the impacts on low flows are mitigated to some extent by regulated releases however the impacts of these additional releases on dam levels and other water users were not assessed here as a general rule of thumb coal resource developments that occur within 10 km of each other must consider the potential for cumulative impacts on groundwater coal resource developments that are more than 40 km apart probably do not need to consider cumulative impacts on groundwater but depending on their orientation within a catchment there may be significant cumulative impacts on surface water to consider this paper was limited to showing hydrological impacts as defined through two metrics groundwater drawdown and changes in the low flow regime as described by an increase in the number of low flow days or zero flow days in ephemeral systems while these metrics are those most sensitive to coal resource development there may be additional metrics particularly related to surface water viney et al 2020b which could also be examined these changes can be visualised using the explorer tool at https www bioregionalassessments gov au ba explorer the conclusions drawn in this paper particularly those related to bounding the range of possible impacts were possible to a large extent due to the explicit focus on predictive uncertainty however the range of uncertainty of hydrological impacts presented in this paper seen in the difference between the results at the 5th percentile and those at the 95th percentile is quite large reducing this potential range would be possible by collecting field data to more accurately constrain the range of parameter values used in the hydrological modelling this should be a focus for future studies the cumulative impact assessment approach presented in this paper represents a powerful tool for assessing the impacts of cumulative developments and has provided useful rules of thumb for when it might need to be applied the approach taken did not however allow for an explicit assessment of the cumulative impacts of baseline and expansion mines future cumulative impact assessments may wish to consider incorporating this aspect the focus of this paper was also on hydrological changes only the hydrological changes modelled here may also have impacts on ecosystems and the water dependent assets that exist within these ecosystems this analysis will be the subject of a future paper credit
