21880,this discussion is based on the paper by mamouri et al 2019 hereafter identified as the original authors or the original paper the original authors employed computational fluid dynamics to calculate the flow field around several wind turbine airfoils and combined this with an evaluation of the entropy generation to estimate the second law efficiency it came to our attention that the equations used to estimate the entropy generation and in particular the term that is used to estimate the entropy generated by turbulent fluctuations are incorrect in addition the original authors claim that one of the main contributions of their work is the identification of a relation between entropy generation and drag probably ignoring that the same relation has been known and used by several authors in the past and examples can be found from at least 60 years ago keywords entropy generation cfd rans drag 1 introduction the work by mamouri et al 2019a presents an analysis of the entropy generation around different airfoils using computational fluid dynamics cfd methods and in particular the solution of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with a k ω turbulence closure entropy generation is then calculated by post processing the flow field resulting from cfd simulations this document focuses on two important issues that are present in mamouri et al 2019a 1 the equations used to estimate entropy generation equation 1 and 2 corresponding to 12 and 13 in the original paper are incorrect the original authors assert that they have been taken from herwig and kock 2006a kock and herwig 2004 where however the equations are different in particular the error lies in the estimation of the entropy generation from turbulent fluctuations which accounts for a significant portion often the majority of the total entropy generation in a turbulent flow from mamouri et al 2019a 1 s g e n μ μ t t 0 2 u i x i 2 u i x j u i x i ρ ε t 0 2 s g e n μ e f f t 0 2 u x 2 v y 2 u y v x ρ ε t 0 the fact that results in the original paper have been presented in dimensional form contrary to best practice makes it difficult to understand whether the erroneous equations have been actually used in the simulations or this is only the case of an inadvertent misprint however the same incorrect equations have been used by the same authors in other occasions mamouri et al 2019b in addition given that different but equally inaccurate methodologies have recently been used in other works we feel that some clarifications are necessary as an example shehata et al 2016 and soltanmohamadi and lakzian 2016 completely neglected the entropy generation by turbulent fluctuations leading to unrealistic results such as entropy generation rates lower at large than at small incidence angles the estimation of entropy generation in rans equations will be presented in section 2 where the errors made in mamouri et al 2019a will be discussed and physically correct equations presented 2 mamouri et al 2019a claim one of the main novelties of their paper to be the introduction of a relation between entropy generation and drag this is certainly not a novelty as the existence of a relation between the two quantities has been known for decades as reported in the work of oswatitsch 1956 giles and cummings 1999 hunt et al 1999 paparone and tognaccini 2003 yamazaki et al 2008 fidkowski et al 2012 ghisu et al 2018 in particular the equivalence between entropy generation and drag is often used in drag decomposition methods to identify and isolate the main sources of losses paparone and tognaccini 2003 this deficiency of the paper will be explained in more detail in section 3 2 estimation of entropy generation through the solution of the rans equations as the direct numerical simulation dns of the navier stokes ns equations for most flows of industrial interest is still beyond the capability of current computers tyacke and tucker 2014 the most common and practical approach is the solution of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations which are derived by replacing the instantaneous flow variables in the ns with the sum of a mean value and a fluctuating component with zero mean value the complete derivation can be found in a number of textbooks such as versteeg and malalasekera 2007 hirsch 2007 for an incompressible flow assuming heat transfer to be obey fourier s law of conduction they read 3 u 0 4 ρ u t ρ u u u u p π ρ a 5 ρ h t ρ u h u h d p d t λ 2 t π u π u where π is the deviatoric stress tensor that for a newtonian flow is equal to 6 π μ u u t 2 μ s u in equations 3 5 the overbar denotes reynolds averaging and the prime symbol denotes fluctuating quantities the terms ρ u u ρ u h and π u represent the effects of turbulent fluctuations not resolved by the rans approach on the mean flow and need somehow to be modeled in addition two equations of state linking ρ p t and h are required to close the system of equations 3 5 an entropy equation which is not usually solved in cfd programs as it would make the system in equations 3 5 overdetermined can be derived by linking gibbs relation with the momentum and energy equations for a detailed derivation see ghisu et al 2018 jin et al 2017 7 s t s u λ ρ t t s u λ ρ t t σ v m f σ t m f σ v t σ t t where σ v m f and σ t m f are the entropy production rates per

π u λ ln t t are not directly solved in rans approaches and a model is required to reproduce their effect in the governing equations linear eddy viscosity models are the most common approach to turbulence closure and link the terms ρ u u and ρ u h to the gradients of the mean variables the so called boussinesq s hypothesis 12 ρ u u π r μ t u u t 2 μ t s u 13 ρ u h λ t t where π r ρ u u is the reynolds stress tensor μ t and λ t are the turbulent viscosity and thermal diffusivity the terms μ t and λ t are usually modeled based on additional transport the former or algebraic equations the latter the most well known models are k ε which solves two partial differential equations for turbulent kinetic energy and its rate of dissipation and k ω which uses turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate the interested reader is referred to versteeg and malalasekera 2007 hirsch 2007 ferziger and peric 2001 for more details the quantity π u which is equal to ρ t σ v t see equation 10 is also present in the equation of conservation of the turbulent kinetic energy k and its derivation can be found in tennekes and lumley 1972 14 ρ k t ρ u k p u π u 1 2 ρ u u u π u ρ u u s u the last two terms on the right hand side of equation 14 represent the rate of dissipation of k and its rate of production per unit mass the former is usually referred to with the symbol ε per unit volume and is directly available in k ε models or can easily be calculated in k ω models versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the latter can be calculated by substituting equation 12 15 π u ρ ε 16 ρ u u s u π r s u 2 μ t s u 2 note how the term π u appears in the energy turbulent kinetic energy and entropy equations meaning that the turbulent kinetic energy is transformed into heat by means of the viscous stresses thus generating entropy 2 2 physically correct equations for estimating entropy generation in turbulent flows in summary the local entropy production can be estimated from rans simulations as the sum of a contribution due to the mean flow and one due to turbulent fluctuations 17 t σ v t σ v m f t σ v t 1 ρ π u π u 1 ρ 2 μ s u 2 ρ ε this equation has been used in several works ertesvåg and kolbu 2005 jin and herwig 2015 kiš and herwig 2011 kock and herwig 2004 while in other papers moore and moore 1983 iandoli et al 2008 jin and herwig 2015 asinari et al 2016 ghisu et al 2018 the turbulent energy dissipation has been replaced by the turbulent energy production thus entailing a local equilibrium between the two contributions and leading to the following equation 18 t σ v t σ v m f t σ v t 1 ρ π u π u 1 ρ 2 μ s u 2 2 μ t s u 2 1 ρ 2 μ μ t s u 2 jin and herwig 2015 argue that the second approach i e equation 18 is more reliable because in rans methods the specific dissipation rate ε is only used as an intermediate quantity to calculate the turbulent viscosity μ t and the reynolds stresses which interact with the mean flow through momentum and energy equations herwig and kock 2006b also highlight that a small difference exists between the quantity ε and the turbulent dissipation per unit mass but suggest that this difference can be ignored in practice as also done by ertesvåg and kolbu 2005 jin and herwig 2015 kiš and herwig 2011 kock and herwig 2004 equations 17 and 18 are alternative methods for calculating the entropy production due to viscous dissipation in a turbulent flow on the contrary the equations reported in mamouri et al 2019a are incorrect as they include see equations 1 and 2 both the viscous dissipation and the turbulent energy production the latter should not be included in the equation unless it is used as an approximation of the dissipation but in this case the former should disappear a similar approach can be used for the estimating the total entropy generation due to heat tranfer this would require additional transport equations for the variance of the temperature fluctuations and its dissipation rate as done in nagano and kim 1988 but similar models are not available in commercial solvers which generally assume a local equilibrium between production and dissipation kock and herwig 2004 19 t σ t 1 ρ λ 1 t t t 1 ρ λ λ t ln t t the correctness of eqn 18 for the evaluation of entropy generation and therefore the inappropriateness of eqn 1 and 2 will be proved in the next section through a numerical example taken from ghisu et al 2018 the same example is also used to demonstrate the equivalence between entropy and drag for an airfoil 3 the equivalence between entropy and drag for isolated airfoils mamouri et al 2019a claim one of the main contributions of their work to be the introduction of a relation between entropy generation and drag for isolated airfoils the existence of a dependence between these two quantities is not surprising as they are both generated by viscous dissipations it is not a novelty either as entropy generation has been used for decades to isolate the main sources of drag or differentiate between different types of drag oswatitsch 1956 giles and cummings 1999 hunt et al 1999 paparone and tognaccini 2003 yamazaki et al 2008 fidkowski et al 2012 this approach is best known under the names of drag decomposition or mid field methods ghisu et al 2018 report a summary of these methods together with a detailed derivation of the dependence between entropy and drag for an isolated airfoil and a description of the assumptions from ghisu et al 2018 the equivalence between entropy generation rate and drag is expressed as follows 20 t s g 1 2 ρ u 3 a c d d 1 2 ρ u 2 a where t is the reference temperature assumed constant and uniform in the domain s g is the entropy production per unit time ρ is the flow density u is the upstream velocity a a reference area c d the aerodynamic drag coefficient and d the drag force s g can be calculated as the volume integral of the specific entropy generation rates in an appropriate domain ω large enough to allow the dissipation of the airfoil s wake 21 s g ω ρ σ v m f σ v t d ω a non dimensional entropy generation rate coefficient can be defined as follows 22 k s g t s g 1 2 ρ u 3 a for an isolated airfoil the non dimensional entropy generation rate coefficient defined in equation 22 is simply equal to the drag coefficient 23 k s g c d it should be noted that the same conclusion has been reached by herwig and schmandt 2013 2014 using dimensional analysis together with an equivalent relation for internal flows a numerical proof for this equivalence has recently been presented by ghisu et al 2018 for a naca0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and reynolds numbers fig 1 reports a comparison between the two non dimensional coefficients here the drag has been calculated integrating pressure and viscous forces on the airfoil while the entropy generation rate s g has been calculated by integrating the entropy generation rate per unit volume in the computational domain equation 18 only the viscous dissipation has been considered as the temperature remains constant in the simulation no heat transfer non dimensional coefficients have then been obtained using equations 20 and 22 for more details about numerical setup verification validation and results the interested reader is referred to ghisu et al 2018 in fig 2 the non dimensional entropy generation rate k s g has been subdivided into the two contributions due to mean flow and turbulent fluctuations k s g m f and k s g t the relative contribution of turbulent fluctuations increases both for larger reynolds numbers and larger incidence angles due to the larger turbulent dissipation that is present in these conditions even at the lowest value of reynolds number studied here 6 25e4 the contribution of turbulent fluctuations is about 1 3 of the total at zero angle of attack at 6 it equals the contribution of mean flow and grows dramatically for larger incidence angles due to the appearance of flow separation in the larger reynolds number case 1e6 the contribution due to turbulent fluctuations is about 3 4 of the total already at low incidence angles and this fraction grows significantly at larger angles of attack from these results it is clear how a correct mathematical formulation of entropy generation in the presence of rans simulations is fundamental for an accurate estimation both neglecting the turbulent fluctuations as done in shehata et al 2016 soltanmohamadi and lakzian 2016 or overestimating them including both turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and generation as done in mamouri et al 2019a can lead to incorrect and misleading results furthermore presenting data in non dimensional form as best practice suggests has the advantage of simplifying the relation among the parameters of interest and making the results more easily reproducible it should be noted how the benefit of mid field methods is not the estimation of the global entropy production which could easily be calculated using equation 20 but rather the fact that it allows the main sources of losses or irreversibilities to be identified and visualized specific regions of the flow field can then be tailored by design and optimization methods for a more effective result yamazaki et al 2008 bisson and nadarajah 2013 4 conclusions the work by mamouri et al 2019a presents an analysis of the entropy generation around

21882,in this paper a series of experimental data for wave current induced pore water pressure around a partially embedded monopile is presented unlike the previous studies the combined action of waves and currents is studied the partially embedded monopile is considered the variations of pore water pressures around the monopile in time and space are investigated by wave flume experiments the experimental results indicate that the hydrodynamic response and the seabed response caused by the combined action of waves and currents are significantly different from those caused by wave load when the following current is superimposed on the wave the wave profile on the lateral side rather than on the front of the monopile fluctuates first and the wave trough of the incident wave becomes small and gentle moreover it was found that the amplitudes of pore water pressures increase while the attenuation of pore water pressures slows down under the large wave energy with a large current it was further found that the existence of a current has a significant effect on the pore water pressure at z h 0 3 on the front side and on the pore water pressure at z h 0 15 on the back side of the monopile additionally the influence of the current on the vertical and horizontal distributions of pore water pressures is related to the wave height keywords wave current seabed monopile interaction hydrodynamic response seabed response partially embedded monopile laboratory experiments 1 introduction nowadays numerous offshore structures including breakwaters cross sea bridges and oil platforms have been constructed in coastal regions with the continuous development of ocean engineering among these monopiles are frequently selected as the foundation for offshore wind turbines due to their relatively low construction cost and security compared to other available alternatives wang and yang 2014 it is well known that waves and currents coexist in coastal regions they are one of the most important external threat factors in controlling hydrodynamic behavior and they are normally major environmental forces leading to seabed liquefaction olabarrieta et al 2010 previous studies have shown that seabed liquefaction around offshore structures can lead to a partial or even total loss of bearing capacity of the foundations muñoz perez et al 2015 with the extremely harsh and complex marine environments long wave periods high current velocity and high wave energy efforts to maintain the stability and safety of monopile are becoming great technical challenges therefore it is vital to consider the combined action of waves and currents for predictions of the hydrodynamic response and seabed response around a monopile in engineering practice it is unavoidable to consider the embedded depth of a structure in the primary design stage of offshore structures for a better structural design and maintenance to date the buried depth of pipelines including a fully buried pipeline dunn et al 2006 gao et al 2003 jeng 2001 luan et al 2008 and a partially buried pipeline duan et al 2017 liang and jeng 2019 sun et al 2019 zhao and jeng 2016 has been studied extensively their results demonstrated the significant effects of the embedded depth of a pipeline on the seabed response which was even found to threaten seabed stability around an offshore pipeline this strengthens the necessity of considering partially embedded marine structures as regards partially embedded monopile foundations the numerical result by zhang et al 2015 indicated that the embedded depth has a significant influence on a wave induced seabed response around a monopile unfortunately the combined action of waves and currents was not considered in zhang et al 2015 when studying the hydrodynamic response and seabed response around the monopile to fill in the gaps of ignoring the partially embedded pile foundation systematic experiments were performed for the wave and current induced seabed response around the partially embedded monopile in recent decades wave induced seabed responses were extensively studied by analytical approximations yamamoto et al 1978 hsu and jeng 1994 numerical simulations eicher et al 2003 jeng and ou 2010 jeng et al 2013 and laboratory experiments jeng et al 2005 yang et al 2009 sumer et al 2012 liu et al 2015 a comprehensive review of the study of wave induced seabed responses was performed by jeng 2003 in which both theoretical and experimental studies were summarized and discussed in detail recently attention has been paid to the combined effects of waves and currents on seabed response ye and jeng 2012 liao et al 2015 in ye and jeng 2012 the third order approximation of wave current interactions was employed as the external loading in the porous seabed model the numerical results indicated that the current could significantly affect the seabed response and should not be ignored in the seabed model however the existence of offshore structures was not considered in the literature mentioned above when considering interactions between offshore structures and waves especially pile foundations studies on a wave induced hydrodynamic response receive much attention due to primary concerns in offshore engineering wienke and oumeraci 2005 chen et al 2014 it has been reported that the existence of the structure has a significant effect on wave transformation and the distribution of wave induced pore pressure mo et al 2007 chang and jeng 2014 it is noted that hydrodynamic response around pile foundation has attracted considerable attention less attention has been paid to seabed response although its importance has been reported in the literature to systematically understand wave current seabed structure interactions many studies have been carried out with various research methods several numerical models have been proposed for the problem sui et al 2016 ye et al 2016 lin et al 2017 in ye et al 2016 a 3d integrated numerical model was proposed for fluid structures seabed interaction fssi it confirmed that the variations of wave induced dynamics and seabed response around offshore structures were sufficiently captured and the distribution of pore water pressure was significantly affected by the presence of offshore structures in lin et al 2017 a 3d integrated numerical model was established to investigate the wave induced seabed response which indicated that the embedded depth of the monopile had an evident blocking effect on vertical pore pressure development resulting in a somewhat reduced momentary liquefaction depth of the soil around the monopile foundation sumer 2014 laboratory experiments have been broadly employed as a reliable method to study the seabed response under external loads liu et al 2015 sassa and sekiguchi 2001 sumer et al 2013 note that the wave flume test has been commonly used by coastal engineers for the problem of wave current interactions in sumer et al 2013 an experimental investigation was carried out to analyze the back filling of scour holes around circular piles under the combined action of waves and currents the focus of their studies was the development of scour holes rather than the seabed response therefore pore water pressure was not obtained for further analysis of seabed stability recently in qi and gao 2014 and qi et al 2019 laboratory tests were successively conducted to study scour development around a monopile or twin piles in combined waves and currents seabed response around the pile foundation was not paid enough attention furthermore the pile foundation was fixed at the bottom of the seabed not partially embedded in the seabed while the fixed boundary condition at the bottom could not fully reflect the mechanism of pile foundation recently a set of experiment data for regular wave induced pore water pressure around a partially embedded monopile was reported in wang et al 2019 another series of tests for irregular wave induced pore water pressures around a monopile was conducted by zhang et al 2020 however in their experiments only the wave loading was considered while the coexistence of currents was neglected therefore to have a better understanding of the whole physical process and mechanism a series of comprehensive experiments is desired which motivated this study the main objectives of this paper were to examine the wave and current induced pore water pressure around a partially embedded monopile through physical modeling as well as the hydrodynamic response detailed descriptions of the experiments are outlined in section 2 regular wave current induced hydrodynamic responses including the variation of wave profiles current velocities and dynamic wave pressures impacting the monopile were then studied to reflect the characteristics of turbulent flow around the monopile in the mixed flow field in section 3 the distribution of pore water pressure around the partially embedded monopile was comparatively studied in section 4 in the time and space domains a particular focus of the parametric study is the effects of the wave parameters and currents on the vertical and horizontal distribution of pore water pressure 2 wave flume experiments to investigate the wave current induced hydrodynamic response and pore water pressure around the partially embedded monopile a series of comprehensive laboratory experiments were performed in the wave flume of the deepwater long span bridge laboratory of southwest jiaotong university some important statistics including wave profile flow field velocity dynamic wave pressure and pore water pressure were synchronously sampled to provide abundant and reliable data references for future studies in the related fields this is the third publication for a series of experimental study for the seabed response around a partially embedded monopile the first paper wang et al 2019 considered the regular wave loading the second paper zhang et al 2020 considered irregular wave loading in this paper the main focus is the combined wave and current loading this series of experiments will provide reliable data for numerical modelers for model validations in the future study 2 1 experiment setup experiments were conducted at southwest jiaotong university in a wave flume with dimensions of 60 length 2 0 width 1 8 m depth the wave flume equipment has the ability of bidirectional current generation and unidirectional wave generation as shown in fig 1 the wave flume was equipped with a hydraulic piston type wave maker at the upstream end and a sponge type wave absorber at the downstream end to dissipate incoming wave energy and thus minimize the effects of wave reflection regular irregular waves propagate forward from the wave generation at the right hand side to the wave absorber at the left hand side in a positive direction note that only regular waves were considered in this study the wave maker is suitable for generating waves with a wave height of 0 01 0 6 m for a 0 5 1 2 m water depth and wave periods of 0 6 to 2 0 s moreover the two way flow field could be generated by manually adjusting the frequency converter settings to simulate the flow field with fixed velocity in the flume experiment while producing either regular or irregular waves this flume is capable of generating reversible steady flow with a velocity of up to around 0 6 m s at a 0 6 m water depth a sediment basin was manufactured specifically for this series of experiments and it was located at a distance of 26 5 m away from the wave maker with a size of 7 0 m length 2 0 m width 1 0 m depth a monopile model with a diameter d 0 3 m was vertically embedded in the center of the sediment basin with a depth of 0 6 m the surrounding walls and the bottom of the test sand pit were made of rigid and impermeable concrete 2 2 measuring instruments for experiments in the experiments the wave profile flow velocity dynamic wave pressure and pore water pressure around the partially embedded monopile were simultaneously measured by using five wave height gauges an acoustic doppler velocimetry adv and 23 pore pressure transducers respectively five wave height gauges designed by chengdu yufan co ltd with a measurement range of 0 60 m and an accuracy of 0 5 were used to sample the statistics of wave heights and the underwater connector of each wave height gauges is 6 mm in diameter as shown in fig 1 b two far field wave height gauges denoted as 551 and 553 were arranged side by side with a 0 66 m gap at a distance of 5 5 m from the center of the monopile which was sufficient to eliminate the influence of the structure on the flow field and to then measure incident wave conditions note that the data acquisition system of gauge 551 was directly linked with the wave maker to monitor wave surface variation while gauge 553 was used to measure the incident wave height three more wave height gauges gauges 552 554 and 555 0 45 m from the center of the monopile were used to sample wave profile statistics around the monopile acoustic doppler velocimetry adv designed and manufactured by qingdao nortek as co ltd was mounted at 0 3 m above the bottom of the wave flume and the underwater connector of the adv is 8 mm in diameter at a distance of 2 85 m from the surface of the monopile to measure the undisturbed flow velocity the cy200 type pore pressure transducers 6 mm in outer diameter were designed and manufactured by chengdu test co ltd the measurement range of these pore pressure transducers was 30 kpa with an accuracy of 0 1 to pay attention to the spatial distribution of dynamic wave pressure or pore water pressure 23 pore pressure transducers were used as depicted in fig 2 in the tests 19 transducers points 1 19 were used to measure pore water pressures within the seabed and four transducers points 20 23 were used to measure dynamic wave pressure acting on the monopile details of the locations of pore pressure transducers are given in fig 3 ten transducers points 1 10 were installed on the supporting parts of the monopile as shown in fig 3b thirteen transducers points 11 23 were installed through the boreholes reserved on the wall of the monopile as shown in fig 3c afterwards the signals of the wave height gauges the adv and pore pressure transducers were sampled by a remote computer that was connected to the servo and acquisition systems with a sampling frequency of 100 hz the wave current monopile seabed interaction mechanism was further obtained by synthetically analyzing the obtained sample signals 2 3 characteristics of experiment materials sandy sediment quartz sand with a mean particle size of d 50 0 215 mm was used as the seabed material in the experiments the gradation distribution of the soil sample is plotted in fig 4 density of soil sample ρ s was calculated by the cutting ring method which measures the mass of a fixed volume of soil before and after drying permeability k s was determined by the constant head permeability test and shear modulus g was confirmed by the relationship between elastic modulus and poisson s ratio μ in which the elastic modulus was measured by a tri axial apparatus and poisson s ratio of soil sample μ was usually 0 3 moreover maximum void ratio e m a x astm d4254 2016b and minimum void ratio e m i n astm d4253 2016a were calculated by measuring the loose density and compaction density of soil sample the soil properties are listed in table 1 note that water was slowly introduced into the flume and was left there for at least 3 days before conducting the experiments this is to ensure the completion of the subsidence of the soil sediment and the seabed became almost fully saturated a polymethyl methacrylate pmma monopile with an outer diameter of d 0 3 m a wall thickness of 0 01 m and a length of 1 5 m was vertically embedded in the sandy sediment with a depth of 0 6 m the bottom of the monopile was sealed with a circular plate with a 0 02 m thickness which was located on the pre embedded fine steel bar shown in fig 3b the circular roof of the monopile with a 0 02 m thickness was bolted onto the fixing bracket of the flume therefore monopile movements including translational motion and rotation were thoroughly constrained through supporting parts to prevent settlement or inclination of the monopile compared with the monopile the disturbance effect of the small sized supporting parts on sand or flow field could be neglected 2 4 test conditions in this study the variations of flow field and pore water pressure around the monopile under the combined action of the regular wave and current were considered the experiment conditions included 68 cases of regular waves with different wave parameters wave height h and wave period t and current velocities as listed in table 2 for the cases of regular wave current interactions wave height h varied from 0 06 to 0 14 m with an interval of 0 02 m and wave period t was 1 0 1 2 1 6 and 2 0 s current velocity u was 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m s for wave current interactions only waves with a following current were considered in the experiments for the cases of regular waves alone the incident wave was only adopted as h 0 12 m or t 1 6 s the water depth was kept at 0 6 m above the sediment basin for all tests regarding the case of current only according to the potential flow theory dean and dalrymple 1991 currents mainly change the distribution of wave field in the designated areas therefore the wave and current induced pressures acting on the seabed surface will change and finally the pore water pressure in the seabed will change this is the way currents affect the wave induced seabed response therefore the current induced excess pore water pressure is small enough to be ignored under the case of currents alone this was verified by the present experiments because the wave maker was switched on until the current came to a steady state that is before the wave maker starts the pore water pressure can be considered to be under the action of the current alone the experimental result shows that the variation of current induced pore water pressure is almost linear therefore we do not present the results for current only cases here 2 5 test procedures in general testing procedures were adopted as follows 1 checking measuring instruments and placing the monopile model first we checked and installed the measuring instruments thirteen pore pressure transducers points 11 23 were sealed with glass glue in the boreholes reserved on the wall of the monopile as shown in fig 3c the pore pressure transducers were immersed in water for at least 24 h to ensure that air would be completely exhausted ten pore pressure transducers points 1 10 were installed on the supporting parts of the monopile which needed to be placed before filling in addition an adv and five wave height gauges were installed at the designated positions the monopile model was then placed and fixed by the supporting parts to restrict the movement of the monopile model 2 filling the sediment basin before the experiments the sand was fully mixed with gradually added water in the soil mixture tank the large amount of sand in the homogeneous liquid state was then pumped into the test section to produce a stable sand seabed with a 1 0 m thickness the sediment basin was consolidated for at least 3 days 3 filling the water tank the flume was then filled with clear water as slowly as possible until water depth reached 0 6 m attention was paid to the change of the sand sediment surface especially the sand sediment around the monopile to avoid obvious soil loss 4 calibrating target wave spectrum and target current the input parameters of the wave maker corresponding to the target regular wave and current should be determined before the formal test to unify the inputted test conditions far field wave height gauge 551 monitored the variation of the wave profile during the initial calibrating target wave spectrum of the experiment for regular waves wave numbers of continuous sampling should be more than 10 under the steady wave average parameters of the sampling wave could be taken as the representative parameters of the target wave wave height h and wave period t the target current was then calibrated by adjusting the input electrical current until the designed current was obtained in the flow field finally the input parameters of the target regular wave and current were saved for subsequent experiments 5 starting the experiments under the conditions of the wave alone we switched on the wave maker under the conditions of the wave with the following current it was necessary to turn on the current generator first and then switch on the wave maker when the current came to a steady state 6 sampling the statistics of experiment data the duration of data collection was at least 120 s for the regular wave current cases after oscillatory soil response in the sandy seabed reached an equilibrium state determined by monitoring the variation of the transducer point 11 data collection included wave height flow velocity and pore water pressure with a sampling frequency of 100 hz it should be noted that for cases under the action of waves considered in the experiments the variation of the soil configuration especially the seabed surface around the monopile was small enough to be ignored for the short duration of each cases moreover for cases under the action of waves and currents the influence of the variation of the soil configuration on the experimental results can also be ignored the main reason is that after each experiment the reading of the scale pasted on the monopile wall underwent a small change which corresponded to the small change of the soil configuration 7 ending experiments for cases under a regular wave alone the wave maker could be switched off to end the experiment for cases under a regular wave with a following current it was better to turn off the wave maker first and then switch off the current generator 8 this step consisted of emptying the wave flume leveling the sand sediment and reading against a scale pasted on the monopile wall shown in fig 3c which corresponds to the sand surface to monitor sand loss when the difference between the scale reading and the original reading exceeded 3 0 mm the sand filling operation was carried out with sand in a homogeneous liquid state 9 the test was repeated 10 steps 3 9 except step 4 were repeated for the next case 3 wave current induced hydrodynamic response around a monopile in this section the hydrodynamic response around the monopile is studied and variations of wave profiles measured velocities and dynamic wave pressure impacting the monopile are analyzed in the time and space domains 3 1 variations of wave profiles around a monopile four wave height gauges were used to monitor the variations of wave profiles during the experiments as shown in fig 1 the first gauge 553 was located 5 5 m from the center of the monopile the diameter of the pile was 0 3 m to measure incident wave height the other three were located 0 45 m from the center of the monopile gauges 552 554 and 555 with these measurements we aimed to understand the variations of wave profiles around a monopile as an example tests 34 and 64 are presented the wave height was 0 12 m the wave period was 1 6 s the water depth was 0 6 m and the current was 0 0 or 0 2 m s fig 5 plots the variations of wave profiles around the monopile in which the dashed line indicates the incident wave as shown in fig 5a under the action of a wave alone the incident wave first propagated to the front of the monopile and then passed through the lateral side to the back of the monopile when waves and currents coexisted in the flow field as shown in fig 5b the incident wave was affected by the current the wave trough of the incident wave became smaller and flatter while the wave crest slightly increased note that at the stable stage of the wave current interaction the wave profile on the lateral side fluctuated first then the incident wave propagated to the front side and finally to the back side which was inconsistent with the expectation that the wave profile on the front side fluctuated first this discrepancy was mainly due to the positive driving effect of the current on the wave profile of the lateral side in the early stages of the experiment the wave was superimposed after the current became stable in the flow field therefore the wave profile on the lateral side could change rapidly due to the influence of the following current while the fluctuation of the wave profile on the front side needed reaction time due to the blocking effect of the monopile on wave propagation moreover with the existence of currents the effects of phase differences between wave profiles at different points were enhanced this indicates that the effect of wave current interactions on wave profiles around a monopile was different from that of the wave alone case this is a significant nonlinear process accompanied by incident reflected and diffraction waves which undoubtedly affected the seabed response especially the seabed response around the monopile 3 2 measured velocity variation flow velocity is another index to monitor the variation of the flow field under the combined action of waves and currents fig 6 shows the variations of measured velocities under different wave and current parameters the results show that the time histories of the measured velocities were saw toothed curves rather than smooth curves due to the disturbed data signal transmission moreover as shown in the figure the interaction between wave and current is complicated and it does not follow the principle of linear superposition the amplitude of periodic measured velocity is closely related to the current and wave condition flow velocity periodically changes and the maximum value of the periodic velocity can reach u m 0 39 m s for superimposed waves with t 1 6 s h 0 12 m and u 0 2 m s current with the increase of wave height wave period or current velocity the amplitude of current velocity increases this is principally because the periodic variation of flow velocity can enhance wave particle velocity which accelerates fluid movement around the monopile and makes a difference on the seabed response under the action of waves and currents compared with that under the wave alone in general as waves are superimposed onto a following current there are mainly three effects 1 periodically enlarging flow velocity so as to increase pore water pressure acting on the seabed surface which produces a larger seabed response 2 exerting upward seepage force onto sand grains under a series of wave troughs which threatens seabed stability 3 inevitably intensifying turbulence around the monopile which makes the seabed response around the monopile different from that under the wave alone the experiment results are further analyzed in the following sections 3 3 dynamic wave pressure acting on a monopile in offshore engineering dynamic wave pressure is a reference index in the initial stage of engineering design from this point on consideration points 20 and 22 were selected to study dynamic wave pressure acting on the monopile as shown in fig 2 point 20 was located on the front side and point 22 was on the lateral of the monopile fig 7 presents the wave current induced dynamic wave pressure impact on the monopile for various current velocities the results reflect that the amplitude of dynamic wave pressure measured at point 20 was larger than that measured at point 22 which was mainly due to the wave surface climbing in the front side of the monopile the effect of the current on the amplitude of the dynamic wave pressure was different in the front and the lateral of the monopile the peak value of dynamic wave pressure measured at point 20 in front side increases while the trough value measured at point 22 decreases because the following current makes it easier for waves flowing through the lateral side of the monopile compared to the case under wave alone moreover when considering the effect of the current on the phases of dynamic wave pressure the phase difference of the dynamic wave pressure between that in the front side and that in the lateral side of the monopile increases especially evident at the trough position of the dynamic wave pressure for example under the action of waves and currents as shown in fig 7b phase difference between the peak values of points 20 and 22 was δ t p t 0 075 and the phase difference between trough values satisfied δ t t t 0 1625 while δ t p t 0 069 and δ t t t 0 119 under the wave alone respectively as shown in fig 7a thus the rising percentage at peak position was 8 7 and that at the trough position was 36 6 the larger rising percentage at the trough position implied a stronger effect of the following current on the variation of wave trough which was related to the fact that the current made the wave trough smaller and gentler furthermore it is noted that dynamic wave pressures in fig 7 and the wave profiles in fig 5 did not correspond as the monitoring positions of the two variables were different dynamic wave pressure was directly measured on the surface of the monopile while wave height gauges were 0 45 m away from the center of the monopile in general with the existence of currents the effects of phase lags were enhanced in addition the peak value of dynamic wave pressure at the front side increased while the trough value decreased 4 wave current induced pore water pressure around a monopile in this section the results of wave and current induced pore water pressure denoted as p within the seabed around the monopile are presented the experiment results focus on the effect of the following current on the spatial and temporal distributions of wave current induced pore water pressure in the front and the back of as well as around the perimeter of and at the bottom of the monopile note that p 0 γ w d was the static water pressure at the seabed surface where γ w was volumetric weight and d was water depth furthermore the maximum amplitude of wave current induced excess pore water pressure denoted as p corresponded to the maximum value obtained in the duration of measured time in the following analysis 4 1 monopile front under the combined action of waves and currents four measurements in front of the monopile namely points 11 z h 0 05 12 z h 0 15 13 z h 0 30 and 5 z h 0 70 referring to fig 2 were considered to examine the distributions of wave current induced pore water pressures in the temporal and spatial domains fig 8 presents the time histories of wave current induced pore water pressures in the front of the monopile the attenuation and phase lag of pore water pressure along the depth direction were clearly observed under the wave with the current the phase lag between points 11 and 5 was equivalent to 180 while it was about 130 under the wave alone results showed that in the mixed flow field formed by the wave and current the current could increase the phase lag of pore water pressure which was mainly caused by friction damping within the sand seabed it is also important to note that the following current made the amplitude of pore water pressure large especially in the upper region of the seabed for the same wave parameters t 1 6 s and h 0 12 m the maximum values of point 11 with the following current u 0 2 m s were p 11 m a x 0 406 kpa and p 5 m a x 0 039 kpa respectively while they were p 11 m a x 0 329 kpa and p 5 m a x 0 021 kpa under the wave alone the variation of the upper point 11 under the wave with a following current was larger than that under the wave alone which is discussed further below in the following examples we further focus on the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of wave current induced pore water pressure in various conditions which was non dimensionalized by static water pressure p 0 fig 9 illustrates the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various wave periods for wave height h 0 12 m the results showed that pore water pressure increased with the increase of the wave period and the current put a drag on the attenuation of pore water pressure along the depth direction compared with cases under the wave alone the maximum value of p p 0 increased significantly under the wave with the current taking the case of wave height h 0 12 m and wave period t 1 6 maximum dimensionless excess pore water pressure p p 0 measured at point 11 was 0 069 with current velocity u 0 2 m s while it was only 0 056 under the wave alone another variation was that the influence of the variation of the wave period on pore water pressure was mainly concentrated in the range of 0 3 times the seabed depth under the wave alone while in the mixed flow field variations of the period still had a great influence on the amplitude of pore water pressure at z h 0 70 that is the current could enlarge the influence range of the wave period on pore water pressure within the seabed fig 10 illustrates the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of the wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various wave heights for a wave period t 1 6 s the results show that compared with the influence of the wave period on the distribution variation law and influence range of pore water pressure the influence of the wave height on pore water pressures in the front of the monopile is similar note that for the case with current u 0 2 m s the rising percentage of pore water pressure measured at point 11 reaches 42 4 24 4 15 8 and 12 5 as wave height increases from 0 06 to 0 14 m with an interval of 0 02 m that is the effect of wave height on the growth of pore water pressure decreases with the increase of the wave height a similar variation trend also exists for the cases under the wave alone fig 11 plots the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of the wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various current velocities and wave heights as shown in the figure current velocity increases the amplitudes of pore water pressures along the depth direction at the monopile front within the upper seabed to a different extent and the attenuation trend of pore water pressure could be slowed down under the wave with a large current if a following current existed in the wave field there was a significant difference in pore water pressure especially for point 13 at z h 0 3 considering the case of h 0 12 m and t 1 6 s with current u 0 1 m s the increasing multiples of pore water pressures measured at points 11 12 13 and 5 were 0 09 0 93 2 53 and 0 65 times that of the same wave condition alone respectively pore water pressure of point 13 at z h 0 3 increased mostly due to the existence of the current with the same wave parameters the variation effect of the current velocities on pore water pressure gradually decreased along the depth direction except for point 5 under h 0 14 m t 1 6 s and u 0 3 m s this was mainly because pore water pressure was larger than the initial effective stress at point 5 and some of the soil became unstable and was even liquefied the redistribution of internal force within the seabed under the combined action of waves and currents then made the pore water pressure at point 5 less than that under wave load therefore it can be seen that pore water pressure at z h 0 3 was most significantly affected by the existence of the current compared with the cases under the wave alone and variations of current velocities had a significant effect on pore water pressure position near the seabed surface which is a noteworthy result 4 2 monopile back under the combined action of waves and currents four points behind the monopile namely points 17 z h 0 05 18 z h 0 15 19 z h 0 30 and 7 z h 0 70 referring to fig 2 were studied to examine the distributions of wave current induced pore water pressure in the temporal and spatial domain fig 12 shows the time histories of wave current induced pore water pressures behind the monopile to clarify the time histories of the pore water pressures the measured pore water pressures at points 18 19 and 7 were enlarged five times under the wave alone compared with cases under the wave alone the amplitudes of pore water pressures in the back of the monopile were larger and attenuation decreased more slowly along the depth under the wave with the following current this was mainly due to the increase in the wave pressure acting on the seabed surface when the current was superimposed on the wave furthermore the phase lag between points 17 and 7 was equivalent to 126 under the combined action of waves and currents while it was only 45 under wave load this shows that the phase lag of the pore water pressure in the back of the monopile was smaller than that in the front of the monopile because of the existence of the monopile therefore it is clear that the current had a significant effect on the time history and spatial distribution of pore water pressure behind the monopile next parametric analyses of wave parameters and current velocities on the vertical distributions of wave current induced pore water pressures were performed fig 13 illustrates the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various wave periods for wave height h 0 12 m as shown in the figure pore water pressures at four points behind the monopile increased and the attenuation of pore water pressure decreased with the increase of the wave period which was similar to the variations of pore water pressures in the front of the monopile with periods except for differences in variation degree and position furthermore it can be seen that the pore water pressure of point 17 at z h 0 05 was most affected by the variation of the wave period under the wave alone while point 18 at z h 0 15 achieved a large rising percentage as the wave period increased from 1 0 to 2 0 s under the coexistence of waves and currents from another point of view it was shown that the current promoted pore water pressure to penetrate deep into the seabed fig 14 plots the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of the wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various wave heights for wave period t 1 6 s it can be seen that a larger wave height and the existence of a current could increase pore water pressures at the back of the monopile compared with the variations of pore water pressures at the front of the monopile with different wave heights the amplitudes of pore water pressures behind the monopile were smaller and the influential level of wave height was distinct to position considering the cases under the wave alone with t 1 6 s the reduction percentage of pore water pressure measured at point 18 at z h 0 15 accounted for 94 8 94 5 94 3 89 4 and 85 7 of the total measured attenuation as wave height increased from 0 06 to 0 14 m at 0 02 m intervals while it was only 51 2 46 7 46 0 45 6 and 43 9 of total measured attenuation at z h 0 15 under the action of waves and currents that is pore water pressure was attenuated quickly in the upper seabed in the 0 15 m range under wave load while its attenuation was slowed down in the combined action of waves and currents moreover the reduction percentage of pore water pressure declined with the increase of wave height fig 15 shows the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various current velocities and wave heights as shown in the figure the influence of current velocity on the variations of amplitudes of pore water pressures along the depth behind the monopile was more significant than that at the front side the amplitudes of pore water pressures increased with increasing current velocities considering the specific experimental case of h 0 12 m and t 1 6 s with u 0 1 m s current the increasing percentages of pore water pressures measured at points 17 18 19 and 7 reached 16 8 268 8 88 2 and 11 1 compared with the same wave condition respectively the largest increment occurred at point 18 mainly due to the existence of the current the current could make the pore water pressure permeate downward moreover the variation of current velocity had a considerable effect on the pore water pressure at point 7 at z h 0 7 behind the monopile in comparison with the small influence of the current on the pore water pressure at point 5 at z h 0 7 in front of the monopile 4 3 around the monopile perimeter at z h 0 15 the effects of wave parameters and current velocity on the vertical distributions of pore water pressures have been discussed the variation of pore water pressure in the plane are analyzed in detail five pore pressure transducers were distributed around the monopile at z h 0 15 they were points 12 θ 0 14 θ 45 15 θ 90 16 θ 135 and 18 θ 180 referring to fig 2 in which θ represents the angle between pore pressure transducer and the flume central line in the counterclockwise direction θ 0 represents the front of the monopile and θ 180 is the back fig 16 plots the time histories of wave current induced pore water pressures around the monopile for various current velocities at z h 0 15 results showed that the amplitudes of pore water pressures decreased gradually with the increase of θ which was mainly due to the shielding effect of the monopile on the flow field the maximum was achieved at the front of the monopile considering the case under wave load as shown in fig 16a the nonlinear fluctuations of pore water pressures can be found at points 16 and 18 it is shown that the superimposition of incident reflection and diffraction waves made the variation of pore water pressure obviously three dimensionally nonlinear at the back part of the monopile when waves and currents coexist in the flow field as shown in fig 16b the amplitudes of pore water pressures increase significantly moreover the time histories of pore water pressures especially measured at points 16 and 18 did not show the nonlinear fluctuations that have been found in the case under wave load this phenomenon manifested that the current could restrain the nonlinear fluctuation around the monopile at z h 0 15 mainly due to the reduction of the ratio of monopile diameter to wavelength moreover the phase lag between points 12 and 18 was about 12 under the wave load while the phase of the back point 18 was about 47 ahead of the front point 12 in the mixed flow field this indicated that the current had a more significant effect on the phase of pore water pressure at plane z h 0 15 than on that measured in the vertical distribution next we study the effect of wave parameters and current velocity on pore water pressures around the monopile at z h 0 15 fig 17 illustrates the distributions of pore water pressures around the monopile for various wave periods for h 0 12 m at z h 0 15 a larger period means a greater wave energy which then generates larger pore water pressure around the monopile at z h 0 15 the maximum pore water pressure was always obtained at the front of the monopile while the location of the minimum pore water pressure remained to be discussed considering the cases under wave load as shown in fig 17a when the wave period was smaller such as t 1 0 or 1 2 s the lateral pore water pressure at point 15 was the smallest when the wave period is larger such as t 1 6 or 2 0 s the smallest was reached at point 16 not the back point 18 this was mainly due to the weaker shielding effect of the monopile on the wave with a longer wavelength considering the cases under the action of wave with current as shown in fig 17b the amplitudes of the dimensionless pore water pressure were obviously larger than those without the superimposed current the maximum and minimum pore water pressures were obtained at the front and the back of the monopile respectively the difference between the pore water pressure at the front side and that at the back side of the monopile decreased with an increasing wave period furthermore with the increase of the wave period the maximum increment of pore water pressure was transferred from the front to the lateral of the monopile and was finally obtained behind the monopile with more wave energy being transmitted to the back of the monopile under external loads fig 18 describes the distributions of pore water pressures around the monopile for various wave heights for t 1 6 s at z h 0 15 as for the cases under wave loads shown in fig 18a the increment of pore water pressure in the front of the monopile was larger than that at the back side which indicated that the increase of wave height could significantly affect the amplitude of pore water pressure at the front side this was mainly due to the higher wave height resulting in greater wave energy reaching at the front of the monopile when waves and currents coexisted in the flow field as shown in fig 18b the distributions of pore water pressures around the monopile at z h 0 15 had some different characteristics this indicated that the current could obviously promote the increase of pore water pressure behind the monopile relative to the cases under the action of wave the maximum pore water pressure was obtained in the front of the monopile due to the large wave energy furthermore the variations of pore water pressures around the monopile at z h 0 15 increased with a relatively stable increment as wave height increased from 0 06 to 0 14 m compared with the effect of the wave period on the increment of pore water pressure therefore the current could promote the influence of wave height on pore water pressures around the monopile especially on pore water pressure at the back side fig 19 depicts the distributions of the maximum pore water pressures around the monopile at z h 0 15 for various current velocities and wave heights results showed that the current could significantly increase pore water pressures around the monopile even though current velocity and wave height were relatively small as shown in fig 19a the difference between the wave and current induced pore water pressure and the wave induced pore water pressure around the monopile is obvious this is consistent with as mentioned above the influence of the current on the pore water pressure at the front of the monopile being weaker than that at the back side in terms of growth proportion moreover with the increase of the current velocity the influence of the current on the flow field behind the monopile became more significant this indicated that a larger current velocity caused a greater increase of pore water pressure behind the monopile 4 4 at the monopile bottom at z h 0 7 in previous studies pile foundations were mostly fixed at the bottom of seabed to further study the seabed response around the pile foundations thus it was impossible to analyze variations of pore water pressures at the bottom of the pile foundations in order to overcome this deficiency in our experiment four points were measured in the z h 0 7 plane namely point 5 θ 0 point 8 θ 90 point 7 θ 180 and point 9 θ 270 referring to fig 2 which were 0 1 m away from the bottom of the monopile fig 20 displays the time histories of wave current induced pore water pressures at the bottom of the monopile at z h 0 7 results showed that the time histories of pore water pressures at z h 0 7 were sawtooth curves rather than smooth curves which was mainly due to interference to signal transmission of the pore pressure transducers located deep in the seabed at the lateral sides there were differences both in the amplitude and the phase of the pore water pressure between points 8 and 9 and the difference would become larger when the current was superimposed on the wave the asymmetry of the flow field at the lateral sides of the monopile resulted in asymmetries of the amplitude and phase of pore water pressure moreover the amplitudes of pore water pressures at the front and the back of the monopile were larger than those in both lateral sides mainly due to the weaker disturbance of the flow field at the lateral sides furthermore it indicated that the current could restrain the phase advance the phase of the back point 7 was about 135 ahead of the front point 5 at z h 0 7 under the wave alone while it was 95 when the wave and current coexisted in the flow field this was mainly due to the edge effect at the bottom of the monopile which promoted the redistribution of internal forces in the seabed fig 21 plots the distributions of pore water pressures at the monopile bottom for various wave periods for h 0 12 m at z h 0 7 in the figure the effect of the wave period on pore water pressure at the front and the back of the monopile was more obvious than that on both the lateral sides resulting from the more turbulent flow field at the front and back sides considering the cases under wave load as shown in fig 21a the pore water pressure measured at point 5 located at the front side was larger than that measured at point 7 located at the back side if the current and wave coexisted in the flow field as shown in fig 21b the amplitudes of pore water pressures measured at z h 0 7 were larger than those under wave load and the asymmetry of pore water pressure measured at both lateral sides became more visible this indicates that the following current not only increased the amplitude of pore water pressure but also enhanced the asymmetry of the flow field at both the lateral sides of the monopile moreover it should be noted that except for the case of wave period t 1 0 s pore water pressure at the front side was larger than that at the back side of the monopile the main reason was that when the wave period was t 1 0 s the redistribution of internal force within the deep seabed made the pore water pressure at the back side of the monopile larger than that at the front side when the wave period was larger the greater wave energy made the pore water pressure at the front side larger in general the influence of the wave period on the amplitudes of pore water pressures at the z h 0 7 plane was weaker than that measured at z h 0 15 as a small part of the wave energy could be transmitted to the deep seabed due to friction damping within the seabed fig 22 presents distributions of pore water pressures at the bottom of monopile for various wave heights for t 1 6 s at z h 0 7 results indicated that under the action of the wave as shown in fig 22a the amplitude of the pore water pressure at the front of the monopile was larger than that at the back side and the amplitudes of pore water pressures at both lateral sides increased in a smaller range with increasing wave height if the wave was superimposed on the current in the flow field as shown in fig 22b the asymmetry of pore water pressures measured at both lateral sides appeared again moreover the position of the maximum of pore water pressures at the z h 0 7 plane was related to the wave height when the wave height was small such as wave heights less than 0 12 m for the considered experimental parameters the maximum pore water pressure was obtained at point 7 at the back side mainly because the redistribution of internal force within the deep seabed made the pore water pressure at the back side larger than that at the front side with the increase of wave height a greater wave energy played a major role in making the pore water pressure at the front side larger in addition variations in pore water pressures measured at z h 0 7 were two orders less than those measured at z h 0 15 this was mainly due to the friction damping within the seabed which made the variation of wave height unable to cause an obvious change in the pore water pressure in the deep seabed fig 23 depicts distributions of the maximum pore water pressures at the bottom of the monopile at z h 0 7 for various current velocities and wave heights results showed that the influence of the current velocity on variations in pore water pressures at z h 0 7 was closely related to wave height the amplitudes and asymmetry of pore water pressures measured at both lateral sides at z h 0 7 namely points 8 and 9 increased under the action of larger waves superimposed on the larger current pore water pressure measured at the back point 7 increased with the increase in current velocity and wave height however at the upstream side when the wave height was small such as h 0 06 m or h 0 10 m shown in fig 23a b pore water pressure measured at the front point 5 under the combined action of the wave and the current was smaller than that measured at point 7 of the downstream side and smaller than that under wave load this is mainly because the redistribution of internal force below the monopile within the seabed played an important role in the case with a small wave height for a larger wave height pore water pressure measured at the front point 5 was larger compared with that measured at the back point 7 mainly due to the larger wave pressure acting on the seabed surface in the front of the monopile moreover taking the case of h 0 14 m and current u 0 3 m s as shown in fig 23d muddy fluid was visible in the flume pore water pressure measured at point 5 showed significant decrease on the contrary pore water pressure measured at point 7 experienced an obvious increase mainly owing to the soil loss caused by the seabed liquefaction 5 conclusions in this paper a comprehensive experimental investigation on regular wave and current induced hydrodynamic and seabed responses around a partially embedded monopile was reported twenty incident wave conditions in which h ranged from 0 06 to 0 14 m and t varied from 1 0 to 2 0 s were experimentally tested three current velocities u varying from 0 1 to 0 3 m s were considered to comprehensively study wave current interaction hydrodynamic response and pore water pressure within the seabed around the monopile were monitored in the experimental process the variation of pore water pressure in time and space had attracted much more attention due to a closer correlation with seabed stability based on experiment data the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hydrodynamic response under the combined action of waves and currents was significantly different from that under wave loading for variations of wave profiles around the monopile when waves and currents coexisted in the flow field the wave trough of the incident wave became smaller and gentler the wave profile at the lateral side rather than the front of the monopile fluctuated first due to the driving effect of the current moreover the peak value of the dynamic wave pressure at the front side increased while the trough value decreased as the current was superimposed on the wave field 2 regarding the vertical distributions of pore water pressures higher wave energy with larger current velocity caused larger amplitudes and slower attenuation of pore water pressures along the depth under the action of the wave load the variations of pore water pressures mainly concentrated in the range of z h 0 30 at the front of the monopile and z h 0 15 at the back side for various wave parameters however under the combined action of waves and currents more wave energy could be transmitted to the deeper seabed which led to greater pore water pressures around the monopile the influence of the variations in current velocities on pore water pressures gradually decreased in depth and could be neglected at z h 0 30 at the front of the monopile while the influence was considerable even at z h 0 70 in the back side of the monopile moreover the current made the phase lag in the front side of the monopile larger than that in the back side 3 when considering the horizontal distributions of pore water pressures the amplitudes of pore water pressures in the plane increased with increasing wave energy and they could be even larger under the combined action of waves and currents in the z h 0 15 plane wave parameters had a more significant effect on the amplitudes of pore water pressures at the front side under the wave action while the current evidently strengthened the influence of wave parameters on the amplitudes of pore water pressures behind the monopile in the z h 0 70 plane the asymmetry of pore water pressures measured at both lateral sides became more significant under the action of a higher wave energy with larger current velocity in addition wave height affected the relative magnitude of the pore water pressures at the front side and the back side of the monopile in general the influence of the current on the amplitudes of pore water pressures at z h 0 70 was smaller but more complex compared with that at z h 0 15 credit authorship contribution statement linya chen investigation formal analysis validation writing original

21882,in this paper a series of experimental data for wave current induced pore water pressure around a partially embedded monopile is presented unlike the previous studies the combined action of waves and currents is studied the partially embedded monopile is considered the variations of pore water pressures around the monopile in time and space are investigated by wave flume experiments the experimental results indicate that the hydrodynamic response and the seabed response caused by the combined action of waves and currents are significantly different from those caused by wave load when the following current is superimposed on the wave the wave profile on the lateral side rather than on the front of the monopile fluctuates first and the wave trough of the incident wave becomes small and gentle moreover it was found that the amplitudes of pore water pressures increase while the attenuation of pore water pressures slows down under the large wave energy with a large current it was further found that the existence of a current has a significant effect on the pore water pressure at z h 0 3 on the front side and on the pore water pressure at z h 0 15 on the back side of the monopile additionally the influence of the current on the vertical and horizontal distributions of pore water pressures is related to the wave height keywords wave current seabed monopile interaction hydrodynamic response seabed response partially embedded monopile laboratory experiments 1 introduction nowadays numerous offshore structures including breakwaters cross sea bridges and oil platforms have been constructed in coastal regions with the continuous development of ocean engineering among these monopiles are frequently selected as the foundation for offshore wind turbines due to their relatively low construction cost and security compared to other available alternatives wang and yang 2014 it is well known that waves and currents coexist in coastal regions they are one of the most important external threat factors in controlling hydrodynamic behavior and they are normally major environmental forces leading to seabed liquefaction olabarrieta et al 2010 previous studies have shown that seabed liquefaction around offshore structures can lead to a partial or even total loss of bearing capacity of the foundations muñoz perez et al 2015 with the extremely harsh and complex marine environments long wave periods high current velocity and high wave energy efforts to maintain the stability and safety of monopile are becoming great technical challenges therefore it is vital to consider the combined action of waves and currents for predictions of the hydrodynamic response and seabed response around a monopile in engineering practice it is unavoidable to consider the embedded depth of a structure in the primary design stage of offshore structures for a better structural design and maintenance to date the buried depth of pipelines including a fully buried pipeline dunn et al 2006 gao et al 2003 jeng 2001 luan et al 2008 and a partially buried pipeline duan et al 2017 liang and jeng 2019 sun et al 2019 zhao and jeng 2016 has been studied extensively their results demonstrated the significant effects of the embedded depth of a pipeline on the seabed response which was even found to threaten seabed stability around an offshore pipeline this strengthens the necessity of considering partially embedded marine structures as regards partially embedded monopile foundations the numerical result by zhang et al 2015 indicated that the embedded depth has a significant influence on a wave induced seabed response around a monopile unfortunately the combined action of waves and currents was not considered in zhang et al 2015 when studying the hydrodynamic response and seabed response around the monopile to fill in the gaps of ignoring the partially embedded pile foundation systematic experiments were performed for the wave and current induced seabed response around the partially embedded monopile in recent decades wave induced seabed responses were extensively studied by analytical approximations yamamoto et al 1978 hsu and jeng 1994 numerical simulations eicher et al 2003 jeng and ou 2010 jeng et al 2013 and laboratory experiments jeng et al 2005 yang et al 2009 sumer et al 2012 liu et al 2015 a comprehensive review of the study of wave induced seabed responses was performed by jeng 2003 in which both theoretical and experimental studies were summarized and discussed in detail recently attention has been paid to the combined effects of waves and currents on seabed response ye and jeng 2012 liao et al 2015 in ye and jeng 2012 the third order approximation of wave current interactions was employed as the external loading in the porous seabed model the numerical results indicated that the current could significantly affect the seabed response and should not be ignored in the seabed model however the existence of offshore structures was not considered in the literature mentioned above when considering interactions between offshore structures and waves especially pile foundations studies on a wave induced hydrodynamic response receive much attention due to primary concerns in offshore engineering wienke and oumeraci 2005 chen et al 2014 it has been reported that the existence of the structure has a significant effect on wave transformation and the distribution of wave induced pore pressure mo et al 2007 chang and jeng 2014 it is noted that hydrodynamic response around pile foundation has attracted considerable attention less attention has been paid to seabed response although its importance has been reported in the literature to systematically understand wave current seabed structure interactions many studies have been carried out with various research methods several numerical models have been proposed for the problem sui et al 2016 ye et al 2016 lin et al 2017 in ye et al 2016 a 3d integrated numerical model was proposed for fluid structures seabed interaction fssi it confirmed that the variations of wave induced dynamics and seabed response around offshore structures were sufficiently captured and the distribution of pore water pressure was significantly affected by the presence of offshore structures in lin et al 2017 a 3d integrated numerical model was established to investigate the wave induced seabed response which indicated that the embedded depth of the monopile had an evident blocking effect on vertical pore pressure development resulting in a somewhat reduced momentary liquefaction depth of the soil around the monopile foundation sumer 2014 laboratory experiments have been broadly employed as a reliable method to study the seabed response under external loads liu et al 2015 sassa and sekiguchi 2001 sumer et al 2013 note that the wave flume test has been commonly used by coastal engineers for the problem of wave current interactions in sumer et al 2013 an experimental investigation was carried out to analyze the back filling of scour holes around circular piles under the combined action of waves and currents the focus of their studies was the development of scour holes rather than the seabed response therefore pore water pressure was not obtained for further analysis of seabed stability recently in qi and gao 2014 and qi et al 2019 laboratory tests were successively conducted to study scour development around a monopile or twin piles in combined waves and currents seabed response around the pile foundation was not paid enough attention furthermore the pile foundation was fixed at the bottom of the seabed not partially embedded in the seabed while the fixed boundary condition at the bottom could not fully reflect the mechanism of pile foundation recently a set of experiment data for regular wave induced pore water pressure around a partially embedded monopile was reported in wang et al 2019 another series of tests for irregular wave induced pore water pressures around a monopile was conducted by zhang et al 2020 however in their experiments only the wave loading was considered while the coexistence of currents was neglected therefore to have a better understanding of the whole physical process and mechanism a series of comprehensive experiments is desired which motivated this study the main objectives of this paper were to examine the wave and current induced pore water pressure around a partially embedded monopile through physical modeling as well as the hydrodynamic response detailed descriptions of the experiments are outlined in section 2 regular wave current induced hydrodynamic responses including the variation of wave profiles current velocities and dynamic wave pressures impacting the monopile were then studied to reflect the characteristics of turbulent flow around the monopile in the mixed flow field in section 3 the distribution of pore water pressure around the partially embedded monopile was comparatively studied in section 4 in the time and space domains a particular focus of the parametric study is the effects of the wave parameters and currents on the vertical and horizontal distribution of pore water pressure 2 wave flume experiments to investigate the wave current induced hydrodynamic response and pore water pressure around the partially embedded monopile a series of comprehensive laboratory experiments were performed in the wave flume of the deepwater long span bridge laboratory of southwest jiaotong university some important statistics including wave profile flow field velocity dynamic wave pressure and pore water pressure were synchronously sampled to provide abundant and reliable data references for future studies in the related fields this is the third publication for a series of experimental study for the seabed response around a partially embedded monopile the first paper wang et al 2019 considered the regular wave loading the second paper zhang et al 2020 considered irregular wave loading in this paper the main focus is the combined wave and current loading this series of experiments will provide reliable data for numerical modelers for model validations in the future study 2 1 experiment setup experiments were conducted at southwest jiaotong university in a wave flume with dimensions of 60 length 2 0 width 1 8 m depth the wave flume equipment has the ability of bidirectional current generation and unidirectional wave generation as shown in fig 1 the wave flume was equipped with a hydraulic piston type wave maker at the upstream end and a sponge type wave absorber at the downstream end to dissipate incoming wave energy and thus minimize the effects of wave reflection regular irregular waves propagate forward from the wave generation at the right hand side to the wave absorber at the left hand side in a positive direction note that only regular waves were considered in this study the wave maker is suitable for generating waves with a wave height of 0 01 0 6 m for a 0 5 1 2 m water depth and wave periods of 0 6 to 2 0 s moreover the two way flow field could be generated by manually adjusting the frequency converter settings to simulate the flow field with fixed velocity in the flume experiment while producing either regular or irregular waves this flume is capable of generating reversible steady flow with a velocity of up to around 0 6 m s at a 0 6 m water depth a sediment basin was manufactured specifically for this series of experiments and it was located at a distance of 26 5 m away from the wave maker with a size of 7 0 m length 2 0 m width 1 0 m depth a monopile model with a diameter d 0 3 m was vertically embedded in the center of the sediment basin with a depth of 0 6 m the surrounding walls and the bottom of the test sand pit were made of rigid and impermeable concrete 2 2 measuring instruments for experiments in the experiments the wave profile flow velocity dynamic wave pressure and pore water pressure around the partially embedded monopile were simultaneously measured by using five wave height gauges an acoustic doppler velocimetry adv and 23 pore pressure transducers respectively five wave height gauges designed by chengdu yufan co ltd with a measurement range of 0 60 m and an accuracy of 0 5 were used to sample the statistics of wave heights and the underwater connector of each wave height gauges is 6 mm in diameter as shown in fig 1 b two far field wave height gauges denoted as 551 and 553 were arranged side by side with a 0 66 m gap at a distance of 5 5 m from the center of the monopile which was sufficient to eliminate the influence of the structure on the flow field and to then measure incident wave conditions note that the data acquisition system of gauge 551 was directly linked with the wave maker to monitor wave surface variation while gauge 553 was used to measure the incident wave height three more wave height gauges gauges 552 554 and 555 0 45 m from the center of the monopile were used to sample wave profile statistics around the monopile acoustic doppler velocimetry adv designed and manufactured by qingdao nortek as co ltd was mounted at 0 3 m above the bottom of the wave flume and the underwater connector of the adv is 8 mm in diameter at a distance of 2 85 m from the surface of the monopile to measure the undisturbed flow velocity the cy200 type pore pressure transducers 6 mm in outer diameter were designed and manufactured by chengdu test co ltd the measurement range of these pore pressure transducers was 30 kpa with an accuracy of 0 1 to pay attention to the spatial distribution of dynamic wave pressure or pore water pressure 23 pore pressure transducers were used as depicted in fig 2 in the tests 19 transducers points 1 19 were used to measure pore water pressures within the seabed and four transducers points 20 23 were used to measure dynamic wave pressure acting on the monopile details of the locations of pore pressure transducers are given in fig 3 ten transducers points 1 10 were installed on the supporting parts of the monopile as shown in fig 3b thirteen transducers points 11 23 were installed through the boreholes reserved on the wall of the monopile as shown in fig 3c afterwards the signals of the wave height gauges the adv and pore pressure transducers were sampled by a remote computer that was connected to the servo and acquisition systems with a sampling frequency of 100 hz the wave current monopile seabed interaction mechanism was further obtained by synthetically analyzing the obtained sample signals 2 3 characteristics of experiment materials sandy sediment quartz sand with a mean particle size of d 50 0 215 mm was used as the seabed material in the experiments the gradation distribution of the soil sample is plotted in fig 4 density of soil sample ρ s was calculated by the cutting ring method which measures the mass of a fixed volume of soil before and after drying permeability k s was determined by the constant head permeability test and shear modulus g was confirmed by the relationship between elastic modulus and poisson s ratio μ in which the elastic modulus was measured by a tri axial apparatus and poisson s ratio of soil sample μ was usually 0 3 moreover maximum void ratio e m a x astm d4254 2016b and minimum void ratio e m i n astm d4253 2016a were calculated by measuring the loose density and compaction density of soil sample the soil properties are listed in table 1 note that water was slowly introduced into the flume and was left there for at least 3 days before conducting the experiments this is to ensure the completion of the subsidence of the soil sediment and the seabed became almost fully saturated a polymethyl methacrylate pmma monopile with an outer diameter of d 0 3 m a wall thickness of 0 01 m and a length of 1 5 m was vertically embedded in the sandy sediment with a depth of 0 6 m the bottom of the monopile was sealed with a circular plate with a 0 02 m thickness which was located on the pre embedded fine steel bar shown in fig 3b the circular roof of the monopile with a 0 02 m thickness was bolted onto the fixing bracket of the flume therefore monopile movements including translational motion and rotation were thoroughly constrained through supporting parts to prevent settlement or inclination of the monopile compared with the monopile the disturbance effect of the small sized supporting parts on sand or flow field could be neglected 2 4 test conditions in this study the variations of flow field and pore water pressure around the monopile under the combined action of the regular wave and current were considered the experiment conditions included 68 cases of regular waves with different wave parameters wave height h and wave period t and current velocities as listed in table 2 for the cases of regular wave current interactions wave height h varied from 0 06 to 0 14 m with an interval of 0 02 m and wave period t was 1 0 1 2 1 6 and 2 0 s current velocity u was 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m s for wave current interactions only waves with a following current were considered in the experiments for the cases of regular waves alone the incident wave was only adopted as h 0 12 m or t 1 6 s the water depth was kept at 0 6 m above the sediment basin for all tests regarding the case of current only according to the potential flow theory dean and dalrymple 1991 currents mainly change the distribution of wave field in the designated areas therefore the wave and current induced pressures acting on the seabed surface will change and finally the pore water pressure in the seabed will change this is the way currents affect the wave induced seabed response therefore the current induced excess pore water pressure is small enough to be ignored under the case of currents alone this was verified by the present experiments because the wave maker was switched on until the current came to a steady state that is before the wave maker starts the pore water pressure can be considered to be under the action of the current alone the experimental result shows that the variation of current induced pore water pressure is almost linear therefore we do not present the results for current only cases here 2 5 test procedures in general testing procedures were adopted as follows 1 checking measuring instruments and placing the monopile model first we checked and installed the measuring instruments thirteen pore pressure transducers points 11 23 were sealed with glass glue in the boreholes reserved on the wall of the monopile as shown in fig 3c the pore pressure transducers were immersed in water for at least 24 h to ensure that air would be completely exhausted ten pore pressure transducers points 1 10 were installed on the supporting parts of the monopile which needed to be placed before filling in addition an adv and five wave height gauges were installed at the designated positions the monopile model was then placed and fixed by the supporting parts to restrict the movement of the monopile model 2 filling the sediment basin before the experiments the sand was fully mixed with gradually added water in the soil mixture tank the large amount of sand in the homogeneous liquid state was then pumped into the test section to produce a stable sand seabed with a 1 0 m thickness the sediment basin was consolidated for at least 3 days 3 filling the water tank the flume was then filled with clear water as slowly as possible until water depth reached 0 6 m attention was paid to the change of the sand sediment surface especially the sand sediment around the monopile to avoid obvious soil loss 4 calibrating target wave spectrum and target current the input parameters of the wave maker corresponding to the target regular wave and current should be determined before the formal test to unify the inputted test conditions far field wave height gauge 551 monitored the variation of the wave profile during the initial calibrating target wave spectrum of the experiment for regular waves wave numbers of continuous sampling should be more than 10 under the steady wave average parameters of the sampling wave could be taken as the representative parameters of the target wave wave height h and wave period t the target current was then calibrated by adjusting the input electrical current until the designed current was obtained in the flow field finally the input parameters of the target regular wave and current were saved for subsequent experiments 5 starting the experiments under the conditions of the wave alone we switched on the wave maker under the conditions of the wave with the following current it was necessary to turn on the current generator first and then switch on the wave maker when the current came to a steady state 6 sampling the statistics of experiment data the duration of data collection was at least 120 s for the regular wave current cases after oscillatory soil response in the sandy seabed reached an equilibrium state determined by monitoring the variation of the transducer point 11 data collection included wave height flow velocity and pore water pressure with a sampling frequency of 100 hz it should be noted that for cases under the action of waves considered in the experiments the variation of the soil configuration especially the seabed surface around the monopile was small enough to be ignored for the short duration of each cases moreover for cases under the action of waves and currents the influence of the variation of the soil configuration on the experimental results can also be ignored the main reason is that after each experiment the reading of the scale pasted on the monopile wall underwent a small change which corresponded to the small change of the soil configuration 7 ending experiments for cases under a regular wave alone the wave maker could be switched off to end the experiment for cases under a regular wave with a following current it was better to turn off the wave maker first and then switch off the current generator 8 this step consisted of emptying the wave flume leveling the sand sediment and reading against a scale pasted on the monopile wall shown in fig 3c which corresponds to the sand surface to monitor sand loss when the difference between the scale reading and the original reading exceeded 3 0 mm the sand filling operation was carried out with sand in a homogeneous liquid state 9 the test was repeated 10 steps 3 9 except step 4 were repeated for the next case 3 wave current induced hydrodynamic response around a monopile in this section the hydrodynamic response around the monopile is studied and variations of wave profiles measured velocities and dynamic wave pressure impacting the monopile are analyzed in the time and space domains 3 1 variations of wave profiles around a monopile four wave height gauges were used to monitor the variations of wave profiles during the experiments as shown in fig 1 the first gauge 553 was located 5 5 m from the center of the monopile the diameter of the pile was 0 3 m to measure incident wave height the other three were located 0 45 m from the center of the monopile gauges 552 554 and 555 with these measurements we aimed to understand the variations of wave profiles around a monopile as an example tests 34 and 64 are presented the wave height was 0 12 m the wave period was 1 6 s the water depth was 0 6 m and the current was 0 0 or 0 2 m s fig 5 plots the variations of wave profiles around the monopile in which the dashed line indicates the incident wave as shown in fig 5a under the action of a wave alone the incident wave first propagated to the front of the monopile and then passed through the lateral side to the back of the monopile when waves and currents coexisted in the flow field as shown in fig 5b the incident wave was affected by the current the wave trough of the incident wave became smaller and flatter while the wave crest slightly increased note that at the stable stage of the wave current interaction the wave profile on the lateral side fluctuated first then the incident wave propagated to the front side and finally to the back side which was inconsistent with the expectation that the wave profile on the front side fluctuated first this discrepancy was mainly due to the positive driving effect of the current on the wave profile of the lateral side in the early stages of the experiment the wave was superimposed after the current became stable in the flow field therefore the wave profile on the lateral side could change rapidly due to the influence of the following current while the fluctuation of the wave profile on the front side needed reaction time due to the blocking effect of the monopile on wave propagation moreover with the existence of currents the effects of phase differences between wave profiles at different points were enhanced this indicates that the effect of wave current interactions on wave profiles around a monopile was different from that of the wave alone case this is a significant nonlinear process accompanied by incident reflected and diffraction waves which undoubtedly affected the seabed response especially the seabed response around the monopile 3 2 measured velocity variation flow velocity is another index to monitor the variation of the flow field under the combined action of waves and currents fig 6 shows the variations of measured velocities under different wave and current parameters the results show that the time histories of the measured velocities were saw toothed curves rather than smooth curves due to the disturbed data signal transmission moreover as shown in the figure the interaction between wave and current is complicated and it does not follow the principle of linear superposition the amplitude of periodic measured velocity is closely related to the current and wave condition flow velocity periodically changes and the maximum value of the periodic velocity can reach u m 0 39 m s for superimposed waves with t 1 6 s h 0 12 m and u 0 2 m s current with the increase of wave height wave period or current velocity the amplitude of current velocity increases this is principally because the periodic variation of flow velocity can enhance wave particle velocity which accelerates fluid movement around the monopile and makes a difference on the seabed response under the action of waves and currents compared with that under the wave alone in general as waves are superimposed onto a following current there are mainly three effects 1 periodically enlarging flow velocity so as to increase pore water pressure acting on the seabed surface which produces a larger seabed response 2 exerting upward seepage force onto sand grains under a series of wave troughs which threatens seabed stability 3 inevitably intensifying turbulence around the monopile which makes the seabed response around the monopile different from that under the wave alone the experiment results are further analyzed in the following sections 3 3 dynamic wave pressure acting on a monopile in offshore engineering dynamic wave pressure is a reference index in the initial stage of engineering design from this point on consideration points 20 and 22 were selected to study dynamic wave pressure acting on the monopile as shown in fig 2 point 20 was located on the front side and point 22 was on the lateral of the monopile fig 7 presents the wave current induced dynamic wave pressure impact on the monopile for various current velocities the results reflect that the amplitude of dynamic wave pressure measured at point 20 was larger than that measured at point 22 which was mainly due to the wave surface climbing in the front side of the monopile the effect of the current on the amplitude of the dynamic wave pressure was different in the front and the lateral of the monopile the peak value of dynamic wave pressure measured at point 20 in front side increases while the trough value measured at point 22 decreases because the following current makes it easier for waves flowing through the lateral side of the monopile compared to the case under wave alone moreover when considering the effect of the current on the phases of dynamic wave pressure the phase difference of the dynamic wave pressure between that in the front side and that in the lateral side of the monopile increases especially evident at the trough position of the dynamic wave pressure for example under the action of waves and currents as shown in fig 7b phase difference between the peak values of points 20 and 22 was δ t p t 0 075 and the phase difference between trough values satisfied δ t t t 0 1625 while δ t p t 0 069 and δ t t t 0 119 under the wave alone respectively as shown in fig 7a thus the rising percentage at peak position was 8 7 and that at the trough position was 36 6 the larger rising percentage at the trough position implied a stronger effect of the following current on the variation of wave trough which was related to the fact that the current made the wave trough smaller and gentler furthermore it is noted that dynamic wave pressures in fig 7 and the wave profiles in fig 5 did not correspond as the monitoring positions of the two variables were different dynamic wave pressure was directly measured on the surface of the monopile while wave height gauges were 0 45 m away from the center of the monopile in general with the existence of currents the effects of phase lags were enhanced in addition the peak value of dynamic wave pressure at the front side increased while the trough value decreased 4 wave current induced pore water pressure around a monopile in this section the results of wave and current induced pore water pressure denoted as p within the seabed around the monopile are presented the experiment results focus on the effect of the following current on the spatial and temporal distributions of wave current induced pore water pressure in the front and the back of as well as around the perimeter of and at the bottom of the monopile note that p 0 γ w d was the static water pressure at the seabed surface where γ w was volumetric weight and d was water depth furthermore the maximum amplitude of wave current induced excess pore water pressure denoted as p corresponded to the maximum value obtained in the duration of measured time in the following analysis 4 1 monopile front under the combined action of waves and currents four measurements in front of the monopile namely points 11 z h 0 05 12 z h 0 15 13 z h 0 30 and 5 z h 0 70 referring to fig 2 were considered to examine the distributions of wave current induced pore water pressures in the temporal and spatial domains fig 8 presents the time histories of wave current induced pore water pressures in the front of the monopile the attenuation and phase lag of pore water pressure along the depth direction were clearly observed under the wave with the current the phase lag between points 11 and 5 was equivalent to 180 while it was about 130 under the wave alone results showed that in the mixed flow field formed by the wave and current the current could increase the phase lag of pore water pressure which was mainly caused by friction damping within the sand seabed it is also important to note that the following current made the amplitude of pore water pressure large especially in the upper region of the seabed for the same wave parameters t 1 6 s and h 0 12 m the maximum values of point 11 with the following current u 0 2 m s were p 11 m a x 0 406 kpa and p 5 m a x 0 039 kpa respectively while they were p 11 m a x 0 329 kpa and p 5 m a x 0 021 kpa under the wave alone the variation of the upper point 11 under the wave with a following current was larger than that under the wave alone which is discussed further below in the following examples we further focus on the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of wave current induced pore water pressure in various conditions which was non dimensionalized by static water pressure p 0 fig 9 illustrates the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various wave periods for wave height h 0 12 m the results showed that pore water pressure increased with the increase of the wave period and the current put a drag on the attenuation of pore water pressure along the depth direction compared with cases under the wave alone the maximum value of p p 0 increased significantly under the wave with the current taking the case of wave height h 0 12 m and wave period t 1 6 maximum dimensionless excess pore water pressure p p 0 measured at point 11 was 0 069 with current velocity u 0 2 m s while it was only 0 056 under the wave alone another variation was that the influence of the variation of the wave period on pore water pressure was mainly concentrated in the range of 0 3 times the seabed depth under the wave alone while in the mixed flow field variations of the period still had a great influence on the amplitude of pore water pressure at z h 0 70 that is the current could enlarge the influence range of the wave period on pore water pressure within the seabed fig 10 illustrates the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of the wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various wave heights for a wave period t 1 6 s the results show that compared with the influence of the wave period on the distribution variation law and influence range of pore water pressure the influence of the wave height on pore water pressures in the front of the monopile is similar note that for the case with current u 0 2 m s the rising percentage of pore water pressure measured at point 11 reaches 42 4 24 4 15 8 and 12 5 as wave height increases from 0 06 to 0 14 m with an interval of 0 02 m that is the effect of wave height on the growth of pore water pressure decreases with the increase of the wave height a similar variation trend also exists for the cases under the wave alone fig 11 plots the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of the wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various current velocities and wave heights as shown in the figure current velocity increases the amplitudes of pore water pressures along the depth direction at the monopile front within the upper seabed to a different extent and the attenuation trend of pore water pressure could be slowed down under the wave with a large current if a following current existed in the wave field there was a significant difference in pore water pressure especially for point 13 at z h 0 3 considering the case of h 0 12 m and t 1 6 s with current u 0 1 m s the increasing multiples of pore water pressures measured at points 11 12 13 and 5 were 0 09 0 93 2 53 and 0 65 times that of the same wave condition alone respectively pore water pressure of point 13 at z h 0 3 increased mostly due to the existence of the current with the same wave parameters the variation effect of the current velocities on pore water pressure gradually decreased along the depth direction except for point 5 under h 0 14 m t 1 6 s and u 0 3 m s this was mainly because pore water pressure was larger than the initial effective stress at point 5 and some of the soil became unstable and was even liquefied the redistribution of internal force within the seabed under the combined action of waves and currents then made the pore water pressure at point 5 less than that under wave load therefore it can be seen that pore water pressure at z h 0 3 was most significantly affected by the existence of the current compared with the cases under the wave alone and variations of current velocities had a significant effect on pore water pressure position near the seabed surface which is a noteworthy result 4 2 monopile back under the combined action of waves and currents four points behind the monopile namely points 17 z h 0 05 18 z h 0 15 19 z h 0 30 and 7 z h 0 70 referring to fig 2 were studied to examine the distributions of wave current induced pore water pressure in the temporal and spatial domain fig 12 shows the time histories of wave current induced pore water pressures behind the monopile to clarify the time histories of the pore water pressures the measured pore water pressures at points 18 19 and 7 were enlarged five times under the wave alone compared with cases under the wave alone the amplitudes of pore water pressures in the back of the monopile were larger and attenuation decreased more slowly along the depth under the wave with the following current this was mainly due to the increase in the wave pressure acting on the seabed surface when the current was superimposed on the wave furthermore the phase lag between points 17 and 7 was equivalent to 126 under the combined action of waves and currents while it was only 45 under wave load this shows that the phase lag of the pore water pressure in the back of the monopile was smaller than that in the front of the monopile because of the existence of the monopile therefore it is clear that the current had a significant effect on the time history and spatial distribution of pore water pressure behind the monopile next parametric analyses of wave parameters and current velocities on the vertical distributions of wave current induced pore water pressures were performed fig 13 illustrates the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various wave periods for wave height h 0 12 m as shown in the figure pore water pressures at four points behind the monopile increased and the attenuation of pore water pressure decreased with the increase of the wave period which was similar to the variations of pore water pressures in the front of the monopile with periods except for differences in variation degree and position furthermore it can be seen that the pore water pressure of point 17 at z h 0 05 was most affected by the variation of the wave period under the wave alone while point 18 at z h 0 15 achieved a large rising percentage as the wave period increased from 1 0 to 2 0 s under the coexistence of waves and currents from another point of view it was shown that the current promoted pore water pressure to penetrate deep into the seabed fig 14 plots the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of the wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various wave heights for wave period t 1 6 s it can be seen that a larger wave height and the existence of a current could increase pore water pressures at the back of the monopile compared with the variations of pore water pressures at the front of the monopile with different wave heights the amplitudes of pore water pressures behind the monopile were smaller and the influential level of wave height was distinct to position considering the cases under the wave alone with t 1 6 s the reduction percentage of pore water pressure measured at point 18 at z h 0 15 accounted for 94 8 94 5 94 3 89 4 and 85 7 of the total measured attenuation as wave height increased from 0 06 to 0 14 m at 0 02 m intervals while it was only 51 2 46 7 46 0 45 6 and 43 9 of total measured attenuation at z h 0 15 under the action of waves and currents that is pore water pressure was attenuated quickly in the upper seabed in the 0 15 m range under wave load while its attenuation was slowed down in the combined action of waves and currents moreover the reduction percentage of pore water pressure declined with the increase of wave height fig 15 shows the vertical distributions of the maximum amplitudes of wave current induced pore water pressures p p 0 versus soil depth z h for various current velocities and wave heights as shown in the figure the influence of current velocity on the variations of amplitudes of pore water pressures along the depth behind the monopile was more significant than that at the front side the amplitudes of pore water pressures increased with increasing current velocities considering the specific experimental case of h 0 12 m and t 1 6 s with u 0 1 m s current the increasing percentages of pore water pressures measured at points 17 18 19 and 7 reached 16 8 268 8 88 2 and 11 1 compared with the same wave condition respectively the largest increment occurred at point 18 mainly due to the existence of the current the current could make the pore water pressure permeate downward moreover the variation of current velocity had a considerable effect on the pore water pressure at point 7 at z h 0 7 behind the monopile in comparison with the small influence of the current on the pore water pressure at point 5 at z h 0 7 in front of the monopile 4 3 around the monopile perimeter at z h 0 15 the effects of wave parameters and current velocity on the vertical distributions of pore water pressures have been discussed the variation of pore water pressure in the plane are analyzed in detail five pore pressure transducers were distributed around the monopile at z h 0 15 they were points 12 θ 0 14 θ 45 15 θ 90 16 θ 135 and 18 θ 180 referring to fig 2 in which θ represents the angle between pore pressure transducer and the flume central line in the counterclockwise direction θ 0 represents the front of the monopile and θ 180 is the back fig 16 plots the time histories of wave current induced pore water pressures around the monopile for various current velocities at z h 0 15 results showed that the amplitudes of pore water pressures decreased gradually with the increase of θ which was mainly due to the shielding effect of the monopile on the flow field the maximum was achieved at the front of the monopile considering the case under wave load as shown in fig 16a the nonlinear fluctuations of pore water pressures can be found at points 16 and 18 it is shown that the superimposition of incident reflection and diffraction waves made the variation of pore water pressure obviously three dimensionally nonlinear at the back part of the monopile when waves and currents coexist in the flow field as shown in fig 16b the amplitudes of pore water pressures increase significantly moreover the time histories of pore water pressures especially measured at points 16 and 18 did not show the nonlinear fluctuations that have been found in the case under wave load this phenomenon manifested that the current could restrain the nonlinear fluctuation around the monopile at z h 0 15 mainly due to the reduction of the ratio of monopile diameter to wavelength moreover the phase lag between points 12 and 18 was about 12 under the wave load while the phase of the back point 18 was about 47 ahead of the front point 12 in the mixed flow field this indicated that the current had a more significant effect on the phase of pore water pressure at plane z h 0 15 than on that measured in the vertical distribution next we study the effect of wave parameters and current velocity on pore water pressures around the monopile at z h 0 15 fig 17 illustrates the distributions of pore water pressures around the monopile for various wave periods for h 0 12 m at z h 0 15 a larger period means a greater wave energy which then generates larger pore water pressure around the monopile at z h 0 15 the maximum pore water pressure was always obtained at the front of the monopile while the location of the minimum pore water pressure remained to be discussed considering the cases under wave load as shown in fig 17a when the wave period was smaller such as t 1 0 or 1 2 s the lateral pore water pressure at point 15 was the smallest when the wave period is larger such as t 1 6 or 2 0 s the smallest was reached at point 16 not the back point 18 this was mainly due to the weaker shielding effect of the monopile on the wave with a longer wavelength considering the cases under the action of wave with current as shown in fig 17b the amplitudes of the dimensionless pore water pressure were obviously larger than those without the superimposed current the maximum and minimum pore water pressures were obtained at the front and the back of the monopile respectively the difference between the pore water pressure at the front side and that at the back side of the monopile decreased with an increasing wave period furthermore with the increase of the wave period the maximum increment of pore water pressure was transferred from the front to the lateral of the monopile and was finally obtained behind the monopile with more wave energy being transmitted to the back of the monopile under external loads fig 18 describes the distributions of pore water pressures around the monopile for various wave heights for t 1 6 s at z h 0 15 as for the cases under wave loads shown in fig 18a the increment of pore water pressure in the front of the monopile was larger than that at the back side which indicated that the increase of wave height could significantly affect the amplitude of pore water pressure at the front side this was mainly due to the higher wave height resulting in greater wave energy reaching at the front of the monopile when waves and currents coexisted in the flow field as shown in fig 18b the distributions of pore water pressures around the monopile at z h 0 15 had some different characteristics this indicated that the current could obviously promote the increase of pore water pressure behind the monopile relative to the cases under the action of wave the maximum pore water pressure was obtained in the front of the monopile due to the large wave energy furthermore the variations of pore water pressures around the monopile at z h 0 15 increased with a relatively stable increment as wave height increased from 0 06 to 0 14 m compared with the effect of the wave period on the increment of pore water pressure therefore the current could promote the influence of wave height on pore water pressures around the monopile especially on pore water pressure at the back side fig 19 depicts the distributions of the maximum pore water pressures around the monopile at z h 0 15 for various current velocities and wave heights results showed that the current could significantly increase pore water pressures around the monopile even though current velocity and wave height were relatively small as shown in fig 19a the difference between the wave and current induced pore water pressure and the wave induced pore water pressure around the monopile is obvious this is consistent with as mentioned above the influence of the current on the pore water pressure at the front of the monopile being weaker than that at the back side in terms of growth proportion moreover with the increase of the current velocity the influence of the current on the flow field behind the monopile became more significant this indicated that a larger current velocity caused a greater increase of pore water pressure behind the monopile 4 4 at the monopile bottom at z h 0 7 in previous studies pile foundations were mostly fixed at the bottom of seabed to further study the seabed response around the pile foundations thus it was impossible to analyze variations of pore water pressures at the bottom of the pile foundations in order to overcome this deficiency in our experiment four points were measured in the z h 0 7 plane namely point 5 θ 0 point 8 θ 90 point 7 θ 180 and point 9 θ 270 referring to fig 2 which were 0 1 m away from the bottom of the monopile fig 20 displays the time histories of wave current induced pore water pressures at the bottom of the monopile at z h 0 7 results showed that the time histories of pore water pressures at z h 0 7 were sawtooth curves rather than smooth curves which was mainly due to interference to signal transmission of the pore pressure transducers located deep in the seabed at the lateral sides there were differences both in the amplitude and the phase of the pore water pressure between points 8 and 9 and the difference would become larger when the current was superimposed on the wave the asymmetry of the flow field at the lateral sides of the monopile resulted in asymmetries of the amplitude and phase of pore water pressure moreover the amplitudes of pore water pressures at the front and the back of the monopile were larger than those in both lateral sides mainly due to the weaker disturbance of the flow field at the lateral sides furthermore it indicated that the current could restrain the phase advance the phase of the back point 7 was about 135 ahead of the front point 5 at z h 0 7 under the wave alone while it was 95 when the wave and current coexisted in the flow field this was mainly due to the edge effect at the bottom of the monopile which promoted the redistribution of internal forces in the seabed fig 21 plots the distributions of pore water pressures at the monopile bottom for various wave periods for h 0 12 m at z h 0 7 in the figure the effect of the wave period on pore water pressure at the front and the back of the monopile was more obvious than that on both the lateral sides resulting from the more turbulent flow field at the front and back sides considering the cases under wave load as shown in fig 21a the pore water pressure measured at point 5 located at the front side was larger than that measured at point 7 located at the back side if the current and wave coexisted in the flow field as shown in fig 21b the amplitudes of pore water pressures measured at z h 0 7 were larger than those under wave load and the asymmetry of pore water pressure measured at both lateral sides became more visible this indicates that the following current not only increased the amplitude of pore water pressure but also enhanced the asymmetry of the flow field at both the lateral sides of the monopile moreover it should be noted that except for the case of wave period t 1 0 s pore water pressure at the front side was larger than that at the back side of the monopile the main reason was that when the wave period was t 1 0 s the redistribution of internal force within the deep seabed made the pore water pressure at the back side of the monopile larger than that at the front side when the wave period was larger the greater wave energy made the pore water pressure at the front side larger in general the influence of the wave period on the amplitudes of pore water pressures at the z h 0 7 plane was weaker than that measured at z h 0 15 as a small part of the wave energy could be transmitted to the deep seabed due to friction damping within the seabed fig 22 presents distributions of pore water pressures at the bottom of monopile for various wave heights for t 1 6 s at z h 0 7 results indicated that under the action of the wave as shown in fig 22a the amplitude of the pore water pressure at the front of the monopile was larger than that at the back side and the amplitudes of pore water pressures at both lateral sides increased in a smaller range with increasing wave height if the wave was superimposed on the current in the flow field as shown in fig 22b the asymmetry of pore water pressures measured at both lateral sides appeared again moreover the position of the maximum of pore water pressures at the z h 0 7 plane was related to the wave height when the wave height was small such as wave heights less than 0 12 m for the considered experimental parameters the maximum pore water pressure was obtained at point 7 at the back side mainly because the redistribution of internal force within the deep seabed made the pore water pressure at the back side larger than that at the front side with the increase of wave height a greater wave energy played a major role in making the pore water pressure at the front side larger in addition variations in pore water pressures measured at z h 0 7 were two orders less than those measured at z h 0 15 this was mainly due to the friction damping within the seabed which made the variation of wave height unable to cause an obvious change in the pore water pressure in the deep seabed fig 23 depicts distributions of the maximum pore water pressures at the bottom of the monopile at z h 0 7 for various current velocities and wave heights results showed that the influence of the current velocity on variations in pore water pressures at z h 0 7 was closely related to wave height the amplitudes and asymmetry of pore water pressures measured at both lateral sides at z h 0 7 namely points 8 and 9 increased under the action of larger waves superimposed on the larger current pore water pressure measured at the back point 7 increased with the increase in current velocity and wave height however at the upstream side when the wave height was small such as h 0 06 m or h 0 10 m shown in fig 23a b pore water pressure measured at the front point 5 under the combined action of the wave and the current was smaller than that measured at point 7 of the downstream side and smaller than that under wave load this is mainly because the redistribution of internal force below the monopile within the seabed played an important role in the case with a small wave height for a larger wave height pore water pressure measured at the front point 5 was larger compared with that measured at the back point 7 mainly due to the larger wave pressure acting on the seabed surface in the front of the monopile moreover taking the case of h 0 14 m and current u 0 3 m s as shown in fig 23d muddy fluid was visible in the flume pore water pressure measured at point 5 showed significant decrease on the contrary pore water pressure measured at point 7 experienced an obvious increase mainly owing to the soil loss caused by the seabed liquefaction 5 conclusions in this paper a comprehensive experimental investigation on regular wave and current induced hydrodynamic and seabed responses around a partially embedded monopile was reported twenty incident wave conditions in which h ranged from 0 06 to 0 14 m and t varied from 1 0 to 2 0 s were experimentally tested three current velocities u varying from 0 1 to 0 3 m s were considered to comprehensively study wave current interaction hydrodynamic response and pore water pressure within the seabed around the monopile were monitored in the experimental process the variation of pore water pressure in time and space had attracted much more attention due to a closer correlation with seabed stability based on experiment data the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hydrodynamic response under the combined action of waves and currents was significantly different from that under wave loading for variations of wave profiles around the monopile when waves and currents coexisted in the flow field the wave trough of the incident wave became smaller and gentler the wave profile at the lateral side rather than the front of the monopile fluctuated first due to the driving effect of the current moreover the peak value of the dynamic wave pressure at the front side increased while the trough value decreased as the current was superimposed on the wave field 2 regarding the vertical distributions of pore water pressures higher wave energy with larger current velocity caused larger amplitudes and slower attenuation of pore water pressures along the depth under the action of the wave load the variations of pore water pressures mainly concentrated in the range of z h 0 30 at the front of the monopile and z h 0 15 at the back side for various wave parameters however under the combined action of waves and currents more wave energy could be transmitted to the deeper seabed which led to greater pore water pressures around the monopile the influence of the variations in current velocities on pore water pressures gradually decreased in depth and could be neglected at z h 0 30 at the front of the monopile while the influence was considerable even at z h 0 70 in the back side of the monopile moreover the current made the phase lag in the front side of the monopile larger than that in the back side 3 when considering the horizontal distributions of pore water pressures the amplitudes of pore water pressures in the plane increased with increasing wave energy and they could be even larger under the combined action of waves and currents in the z h 0 15 plane wave parameters had a more significant effect on the amplitudes of pore water pressures at the front side under the wave action while the current evidently strengthened the influence of wave parameters on the amplitudes of pore water pressures behind the monopile in the z h 0 70 plane the asymmetry of pore water pressures measured at both lateral sides became more significant under the action of a higher wave energy with larger current velocity in addition wave height affected the relative magnitude of the pore water pressures at the front side and the back side of the monopile in general the influence of the current on the amplitudes of pore water pressures at z h 0 70 was smaller but more complex compared with that at z h 0 15 credit authorship contribution statement linya chen investigation formal analysis validation writing original

21883,wave energy converters wecs have been deployed onshore nearshore and offshore to convert ocean wave movement into electricity the exploitation of renewable energy sources has restrictions in the case of wave energy high installation maintenance and decommissioning costs have limited their commercial use moreover these offshore operations can be compromised by safety issues this paper draws attention to offshore operation safety of a wec developed by uppsala university specifically this paper investigates what sea states are suitable for the safe deployment of a wec from a barge this study follows recommendations in dnv rp h103 for analysis of offshore operations namely lifting through the wave zone ansys aqwa is used to find hydrodynamic forces acting on a typical barge using frequency domain analysis based on these hydrodynamic simulation results and methodology given in dnv rp h103 tables are created to show the sea states that would allow for the safe installation of a wec using a typical barge considered sea states have significant wave heights varying between 0 m and 3 m and the wave zero crossing periods varying between 3 s and 13 s the wec submersions are considered between 0 m and 7 m i e when the wec is in the air until it is fully submerged keywords wave energy converter offshore operations hydrodynamic analysis slack sling criterion hoisting system failure offshore deployment 1 introduction wave energy is a challenging field as it involves high forces and low speeds these issues require proposing new and effective technology to absorb the abundant energy of ocean waves today many designs of wave energy converters wecs exist but most are still at an early stage of development bahaj 2011 mueller and wallace 2008 some of these wec designs include point absorbers which are characterized by their small size relative to the wavelength over 50 of proposed wec designs use point absorbers rusu and onea 2018 such devices can be installed in arrays to increase the power production however the deployment and maintenance of each device in an open sea are time consuming and require expensive offshore operations as noted in irena 2014 improvements in the next generation of wecs could reduce the costs of power take off by 22 installation by 18 operation and maintenance by 17 foundation and mooring by 6 and grid connection by 5 this work aims to identify the sea states that pose a risk of failure of the crane s hoisting system while deploying an uppsala university uu wec from a barge the wec developed at uu uses a point absorber buoy with a direct drive linear generator power take off that is the buoy absorbs wave energy while floating on the water surface and the linear generator is mounted on a concrete foundation placed on the seabed a translator the moving part inside of the linear generator is connected by a guiding rope to the buoy voltage is induced in the stator windings due to the motion of the translator relative to the stator this design uses few moving parts to simplify the mechanical system with the aim to reduce maintenance costs in a highly challenging sea environment lejerskog et al 2015 lejerskog et al 2009 wecs need to be deployed and operational in energetic seas moreover the offshore installation of the generator is associated with risks and high costs initially the wecs developed at uu chatzigiannakou et al 2017 parwal et al 2015 were designed to operate in moderate sea states for example the most frequent significant wave height at lysekil sweden s west coast is no more than 1 m compared to lysekil the waves at the wave hub of the north sea uk are higher with longer zero crossing periods smith et al 2012 the uu wec is a scalable device that can be adjusted for many wave climates several studies have discussed the deployment and maintenance procedure of uu wecs and the related risks are discussed in chatzigiannakou et al 2017 leijon et al 2008 remouit et al 2018 the type of deployment vessel will affect the operational weather window typically barges are used for offshore tasks because they have large decks and high cargo capacities however barges can only operate in mild wave conditions i e when sea states are calm moreover barges do not have a propulsion system so they are transported by a tugboat an arrangement that restricts their maneuverability requiring more time to position however these disadvantages are balanced by the availability and relatively low rental cost of barges this study focuses on the readily available and relatively inexpensive to rent svitzer ark barge this study increases the knowledge about safe marginal and dangerous sea states for the deployment of the multibody system the wec and the barge interaction that is conditions for critical operations need to be identified as all safety regulations must be satisfied throughout the operation imo 2010 the behavior of the vessel involved in offshore operations can be estimated by calculating forces and response amplitude operators raos for different sea states different degrees of freedom must be evaluated to model real conditions of a multi body system hydrodynamic forces namely excitation and radiation forces acting on the vessel during the deployment of a wec are calculated using the potential flow theory numerical analysis is commonly used to predict the dynamics of offshore structures imo 2010 peng et al 2015 fluid flow around a structure can be determined using the laplace equation if the boundary conditions initial conditions and a fine mesh for computation to discretize the domain are applied 2 background and method 2 1 input 2 1 1 general input we applied the simplified method of lifting through the wave zone to the barge assuming it is fixed at one point and the hydrodynamic impact of the wec s submersion is negligible previous experiences reveal that barges can be firmly moored using four point mooring where the mooring anchor for each of the four moorings is placed 200 m from the vessel chatzigiannakou et al 2017 the coefficient and distance input for these calculations is shown in table 1 2 1 2 barge because the svitzer ark barge fig 1 has been used to deploy several uu wecs it was chosen as the basis for the calculations of hydrodynamic response the dimensions of the svitzer ark barge are presented in table 2 2 1 2 1 hydrodynamic modelling of vessel response the results are shown for zero crossing periods between 3 and 13 s due to restrictive combinations of significant wave heights and zero crossing periods see equation 26 during the operation the barge is considered fixed i e its speed during the procedure is 0 m s the barge s motion response in heave roll and pitch are illustrated in fig 2 a c the wec is submerged next to the vessel in fig 2 the raos are illustrated for two wec submersions 0 25 m and 7 m the raos of the barge for heave roll and pitch in all submersions of the wec are perfectly overlapping suggesting that the influence of the wec on the barge is negligible 2 1 3 wec description and placement the second structure used in the calculations is the uu s wec which is mounted on a concrete foundation fig 3 a and b the wec s dimensions are shown in table 3 the barge wec crane system relative to the global coordinates and the incoming wave direction are illustrated in fig 4 the barge and wec models are simulated in ansys aqwa thereafter hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces are found in aqwa for every 0 25 m of the wec s submersion and for zero crossing periods from 2 to 20 s the angle of attack of the incoming wave is along the y axis 2 2 water structure interaction external flows surrounding bodies can be represented by the linear potential flow theory in this case the fluid is assumed to be irrotational without vorticity incompressible constant density and inviscid zero viscosity the viscous effects occur in the thin boundary layer next to the body and can be neglected mccomb et al 2013 if we define the potential function ϕ as a function of displacement x y z and time t to represent the fluid velocity field ϕ must satisfy the conditions for conservation of mass and momentum considering the velocity potential of ϕ the equations for conservation of mass and momentum under the given assumptions are reduced to the laplace equation chanson 2009 1 2 ϕ 0 the total velocity potential can be expressed as a superposition of contributions of incident wave and disturbances of floating body presence and motion 2 ϕ ϕ r ϕ d ϕ i where ϕ r is the radiation potential ϕ d is the diffraction potential and ϕ i is the incident wave potential hydrodynamic forces radiation excitation and hydrostatic restoring forces acting on a body can be calculated by integrating the hydrodynamic pressure on the body surface the forces depend on the body form as well as on the frequency and amplitude of the incoming waves folley 2016 provides numerical modelling

operation dnvgl 2016 recommends that risk assessment should be performed during the early planning stages of an operation this timing is important because risk mitigating tactics should be developed during the design phase rather than the operation phase in the case studied here the considerations during identifying risks expand from the vessel and wec design to weather conditions this paper details how a hoisting system can fail during installation of a uu wec from a barge this failure can be related to the following conditions a exceeding the limiting lifting capacity of the crane slings shackles and crane hook b exceeding the crane tip velocity and c other safety factors as given below the likelihood of failure in the hoisting system depends on the steel wire safety load factor the minimum breaking load the fulfillment of static strength and the slack sling criteria as specified in dnv rp h103 dnv 2011 and dnvgl rp g107 dnvgl 2016 2 3 1 steel wire safety steel wire safety load factor s f is determined using the following equation 5 s f l o a d 2 3 ψ where ψ is the dynamic load factor for the crane the concept of the safety factor in general is defined by the following equation 6 s f 10 4 0 885 s w l 1910 where s w l is the safe working load as defined by the manufacturer 2 3 2 minimum breaking load moreover the minimum breaking load b of steel wire ropes

formula gives proof of static strength 8 f s d s f r d s where f s d s is the design rope force and f r d s is the limit design rope force the design rope force in vertical hoisting is calculated as follows 9 f s d s m h r g n f ϕ f s 1 f s 2 f s 3 γ p γ n where m h r is the mass of the hoist load or that part of the mass of the hoist load that is acting on the rope falls under consideration g is

calculated as follows 11 γ r b 1 34 5 d d 0 8 4 where d is the minimum relevant diameter and d is the rope diameter if the load is larger than the hoisting system s capacity then the hoisting line will snap the above safety factor regarding crane hooks and cables have to be inspected for each crane used in a wec installation in this paper we assume that the crane satisfies the criteria 2 4 hydrodynamic and static forces for slack sling criterion the slack sling criteria defined in dnv rp h103 dnv 2011 and gu et al n d require the use of the simplified method for lifting through wave zone this method estimates the forces acting on the wec so as to confirm whether the crane and hoisting system capacity are adequate this paper assumes that the horizontal extent of the wec is small

entails stability risks for a significant wave height 1 75 m fig 5b the same analysis is carried out for all other sea states 3 2 risk assessment of deployment for a hook lowering velocity of 0 1 m s according to the slack sling criteria dnv 2011 dnvgl 2016 the applicable ranges of the significant wave heights are calculated using the following formula 24 8 9 h s g t z 13 the barge and wec

s zero crossing period for significant wave heights greater than 0 25 m and up to 2 m and respective zero crossing periods of 3 s 13 s the operation enters an area where installation can be dangerous and therefore should be carried out cautiously finally for the same zero crossing periods and significant wave heights of 2 3 m the installation should be aborted as the risk for failure is significant 4 discussion one of the limiting factors of the calculations is that although all the forces presented in the standard dnv 2011 and used in the paper are time dependent only their maxima over each sea state i e 30 min largest values are calculated and compared following the calculations the table that indicates the permissible and restrictive installation sea states significant wave height h s corresponding to zero crossing period t z for the barge wec and depth circumstances is set up according to the slack sling criteria table 4 depicts the safe cautionary and dangerous wave conditions in accordance to the fulfillment of the slack sling criteria we studied the impact of different hook lowering velocities on the restrictive operational sea states 4 1 impact of the hook velocity below we investigate how the hook velocity affects the sea states when installation is permitted the results for when v c equals 0 25 m s 0 5 m s and 0 6 m s are shown in tables 5 7 respectively table 4 v c 0 1 m s and table 5 0 25 m s do not differ considerably however compared to table 4 table 5 has a slightly larger restrictive area of operation no and caution between significant wave height 2 m and zero crossing period from 4 5 to 13 s and significant wave height 1 75 m for zero crossing periods of 4 s 13 s table 6 v c 0 5 m s compared to table 4 v c 0 1 m s is substantially altered showing a permissible area for the operational wave weather window for 0 m of significant wave height for zero crossing periods of 3 s 13 s a cautionary area for significant wave heights 0 25 m 1 m for the same zero crossing periods and prohibited area for significant wave height of 1 25 m 3 m and zero crossing periods of 3 5 s 13 s table 7 v c equal to 0 6 m s indicates no permissible operations i e no green areas or ok areas but table 7 does indicate a caution zone for 0 m 0 75 m significant wave height and zero crossing periods of 3 s 13 s and the prohibitive zone i e red areas or no areas is expanded for 1 m 3 m significant wave height for 3 s 13 s zero crossing periods in other words while the operation for v c 0 25 m s can be carried out similarly as for v c 0 1 m s when the hook lowering velocity is 0 5 m s the operational windows are decreased significantly a speed of v c 0 6 m s should be avoided since there is no permissible wave zone for the operation 4 2 impact of the wave climate fig 6 shows the sea states in hours as a function of significant wave height and zero crossing period at lysekil where the uu wecs are deployed usually using a barge similar to the svitzer ark the sea states observed in the area have periods of 2 12 s and significant wave height from 0 m to 4 m the prevailing significant wave height is 0 5 m 1 m with a 3 s 4 s zero crossing period for about 1154 h year followed by 0 m 0 5 m significant wave height and zero crossing period of 2 s 3 s about 1004 h year according to the calculations of this study for v c 0 1 m s the uu wec s installation can be carried out safely or with caution for the most frequently occurring wave conditions scenarios that potentially provide enough time for installation fig 7 presents the percentages of the sea states occurrence as a function of significant wave height and zero crossing period of the wave hub test site at the north coast of cornwall the cornwall site is characterized by higher significant wave heights and zero crossing periods than the lysekil area the wave hub site has sea states of 0 m 6 5 m significant wave height and 2 s 11 5 s zero crossing period although typically the waves are 1 m 1 5 m with a 5 s 5 5 s period 4 6 of the total time year the second most frequent sea states observed are for 1 m 1 5 m wave heights and 5 5 s 6 s period 4 3 of the total time year the uu wec can still be deployed at the cornwall site but with caution and for fewer sea states than at the lysekil area the cornwall test site i e the wave hub site is about 55 m deep lysekil area is about 25 m deep that is the cornwall test site will require a longer deployment weather window for installations the deployment of a wec at the lysekil site 25 m deep will take approximately 4 min with a crane tip velocity of 0 1 m s adding to this 5 min to lift the generator before submersion the total installation time will not exceed 9 min deploying the same device with the same lowering velocity at the wave hub site 55 m deep will take about 9 min adding the lifting time the total deployment time will be 14 min in other words submerging the same wec at the cornwall site takes 1 5 more time than it does at the lysekil area but both operations can be completed within the same 30 min time window finally considering table 4 and figs 6 and 7 the operability of the installation operation can be calculated as an estimation of the available time for installation compared to the total time the permissible sea states for deploying the uu wec are of 0 m 0 25 m wave height and 3 s 13 s wave period to facilitate the combination of table 4 data with figs 6 and 7 we will consider sea states of wave heights 0 m 0 5 m and periods 3 s 13 s these states are found at the lysekil site 37 44 of the time yearly while at the cornwall site are encountered 0 8 of the total time this can indicate that for such short time available for deployment at the wave hub site another installation method e g instead of using a time consuming barge a faster specialized vessel could be hired for the operation 5 conclusions an uu type wec can be safely installed with a barge similar to the svitzer ark for significant wave heights up to 0 25 m and zero crossing periods from 3 to 13 s for the same zero crossing periods and significant wave heights over 0 25 m and up to 2 m the deployment procedure can be carried out with caution significant wave heights over 2 m and up to 3 m and with zero crossing periods of 3 s 13 s are restrictive to offshore deployment operations the hook lowering velocity plays an important role in the safety of the operation that is when the hook lowering velocity increases it affects the drag f d slam f s l a m and characteristic hydrodynamic f h y d forces which results in decreasing the safe operational sea states this installation strategy of using a standard barge to deploy a uu type wec can be carried out in locations other than the lysekil site for example at the wave hub test area in cornwall however since the wave conditions in cornwall are more severe than in lysekil this operation may require longer time periods because of narrower weather windows this study could be applied to other vessels such as tugboats or specialized vessels for offshore operations and in more test locations and sea states with the aim to find the optimal deployment method according to an area s sea conditions this approach will optimize the installation procedures lowering the overall cost by avoiding rental expenses for

21883,wave energy converters wecs have been deployed onshore nearshore and offshore to convert ocean wave movement into electricity the exploitation of renewable energy sources has restrictions in the case of wave energy high installation maintenance and decommissioning costs have limited their commercial use moreover these offshore operations can be compromised by safety issues this paper draws attention to offshore operation safety of a wec developed by uppsala university specifically this paper investigates what sea states are suitable for the safe deployment of a wec from a barge this study follows recommendations in dnv rp h103 for analysis of offshore operations namely lifting through the wave zone ansys aqwa is used to find hydrodynamic forces acting on a typical barge using frequency domain analysis based on these hydrodynamic simulation results and methodology given in dnv rp h103 tables are created to show the sea states that would allow for the safe installation of a wec using a typical barge considered sea states have significant wave heights varying between 0 m and 3 m and the wave zero crossing periods varying between 3 s and 13 s the wec submersions are considered between 0 m and 7 m i e when the wec is in the air until it is fully submerged keywords wave energy converter offshore operations hydrodynamic analysis slack sling criterion hoisting system failure offshore deployment 1 introduction wave energy is a challenging field as it involves high forces and low speeds these issues require proposing new and effective technology to absorb the abundant energy of ocean waves today many designs of wave energy converters wecs exist but most are still at an early stage of development bahaj 2011 mueller and wallace 2008 some of these wec designs include point absorbers which are characterized by their small size relative to the wavelength over 50 of proposed wec designs use point absorbers rusu and onea 2018 such devices can be installed in arrays to increase the power production however the deployment and maintenance of each device in an open sea are time consuming and require expensive offshore operations as noted in irena 2014 improvements in the next generation of wecs could reduce the costs of power take off by 22 installation by 18 operation and maintenance by 17 foundation and mooring by 6 and grid connection by 5 this work aims to identify the sea states that pose a risk of failure of the crane s hoisting system while deploying an uppsala university uu wec from a barge the wec developed at uu uses a point absorber buoy with a direct drive linear generator power take off that is the buoy absorbs wave energy while floating on the water surface and the linear generator is mounted on a concrete foundation placed on the seabed a translator the moving part inside of the linear generator is connected by a guiding rope to the buoy voltage is induced in the stator windings due to the motion of the translator relative to the stator this design uses few moving parts to simplify the mechanical system with the aim to reduce maintenance costs in a highly challenging sea environment lejerskog et al 2015 lejerskog et al 2009 wecs need to be deployed and operational in energetic seas moreover the offshore installation of the generator is associated with risks and high costs initially the wecs developed at uu chatzigiannakou et al 2017 parwal et al 2015 were designed to operate in moderate sea states for example the most frequent significant wave height at lysekil sweden s west coast is no more than 1 m compared to lysekil the waves at the wave hub of the north sea uk are higher with longer zero crossing periods smith et al 2012 the uu wec is a scalable device that can be adjusted for many wave climates several studies have discussed the deployment and maintenance procedure of uu wecs and the related risks are discussed in chatzigiannakou et al 2017 leijon et al 2008 remouit et al 2018 the type of deployment vessel will affect the operational weather window typically barges are used for offshore tasks because they have large decks and high cargo capacities however barges can only operate in mild wave conditions i e when sea states are calm moreover barges do not have a propulsion system so they are transported by a tugboat an arrangement that restricts their maneuverability requiring more time to position however these disadvantages are balanced by the availability and relatively low rental cost of barges this study focuses on the readily available and relatively inexpensive to rent svitzer ark barge this study increases the knowledge about safe marginal and dangerous sea states for the deployment of the multibody system the wec and the barge interaction that is conditions for critical operations need to be identified as all safety regulations must be satisfied throughout the operation imo 2010 the behavior of the vessel involved in offshore operations can be estimated by calculating forces and response amplitude operators raos for different sea states different degrees of freedom must be evaluated to model real conditions of a multi body system hydrodynamic forces namely excitation and radiation forces acting on the vessel during the deployment of a wec are calculated using the potential flow theory numerical analysis is commonly used to predict the dynamics of offshore structures imo 2010 peng et al 2015 fluid flow around a structure can be determined using the laplace equation if the boundary conditions initial conditions and a fine mesh for computation to discretize the domain are applied 2 background and method 2 1 input 2 1 1 general input we applied the simplified method of lifting through the wave zone to the barge assuming it is fixed at one point and the hydrodynamic impact of the wec s submersion is negligible previous experiences reveal that barges can be firmly moored using four point mooring where the mooring anchor for each of the four moorings is placed 200 m from the vessel chatzigiannakou et al 2017 the coefficient and distance input for these calculations is shown in table 1 2 1 2 barge because the svitzer ark barge fig 1 has been used to deploy several uu wecs it was chosen as the basis for the calculations of hydrodynamic response the dimensions of the svitzer ark barge are presented in table 2 2 1 2 1 hydrodynamic modelling of vessel response the results are shown for zero crossing periods between 3 and 13 s due to restrictive combinations of significant wave heights and zero crossing periods see equation 26 during the operation the barge is considered fixed i e its speed during the procedure is 0 m s the barge s motion response in heave roll and pitch are illustrated in fig 2 a c the wec is submerged next to the vessel in fig 2 the raos are illustrated for two wec submersions 0 25 m and 7 m the raos of the barge for heave roll and pitch in all submersions of the wec are perfectly overlapping suggesting that the influence of the wec on the barge is negligible 2 1 3 wec description and placement the second structure used in the calculations is the uu s wec which is mounted on a concrete foundation fig 3 a and b the wec s dimensions are shown in table 3 the barge wec crane system relative to the global coordinates and the incoming wave direction are illustrated in fig 4 the barge and wec models are simulated in ansys aqwa thereafter hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces are found in aqwa for every 0 25 m of the wec s submersion and for zero crossing periods from 2 to 20 s the angle of attack of the incoming wave is along the y axis 2 2 water structure interaction external flows surrounding bodies can be represented by the linear potential flow theory in this case the fluid is assumed to be irrotational without vorticity incompressible constant density and inviscid zero viscosity the viscous effects occur in the thin boundary layer next to the body and can be neglected mccomb et al 2013 if we define the potential function ϕ as a function of displacement x y z and time t to represent the fluid velocity field ϕ must satisfy the conditions for conservation of mass and momentum considering the velocity potential of ϕ the equations for conservation of mass and momentum under the given assumptions are reduced to the laplace equation chanson 2009 1 2 ϕ 0 the total velocity potential can be expressed as a superposition of contributions of incident wave and disturbances of floating body presence and motion 2 ϕ ϕ r ϕ d ϕ i where ϕ r is the radiation potential ϕ d is the diffraction potential and ϕ i is the incident wave potential hydrodynamic forces radiation excitation and hydrostatic restoring forces acting on a body can be calculated by integrating the hydrodynamic pressure on the body surface the forces depend on the body form as well as on the frequency and amplitude of the incoming waves folley 2016 provides numerical modelling of floaters and calculations of hydrodynamic forces acting on the floaters under dynamic and kinematic boundary conditions response amplitude operator rao determines likely behavior of a floating body

rao s phase indicates the phase shift between the motion of the body and the waves journée and massie 2001 2 3 probability of hoisting system failure to secure an acceptable level of risk of the operation dnvgl 2016 recommends that risk assessment should be performed during the early planning stages of an operation this timing is important because risk mitigating tactics should be developed during the design phase rather than the operation phase in the case studied here the considerations during identifying risks expand from the vessel and wec design to weather conditions this paper details how a hoisting system can fail during installation of a uu wec from a barge this failure can be related to the following conditions a exceeding the limiting lifting capacity of the crane slings shackles and crane hook b exceeding the crane tip velocity and c other safety factors as given below the likelihood of failure in the hoisting system depends on the steel wire safety load factor the minimum breaking load the fulfillment of static strength and the slack sling criteria as specified in dnv rp h103 dnv 2011 and dnvgl rp g107 dnvgl 2016 2 3 1 steel wire safety steel wire

calculated as follows 11 γ r b 1 34 5 d d 0 8 4 where d is the minimum relevant diameter and d is the rope diameter if the load is larger than the hoisting system s capacity then the hoisting line will snap the above safety factor regarding crane hooks and cables have to be inspected for each crane used in a wec installation in this paper we assume that the crane satisfies the criteria 2 4 hydrodynamic and static forces for slack sling criterion the slack sling criteria defined in dnv rp h103 dnv 2011 and gu et al n d require the use of the simplified method for lifting through wave

permissible operations i e no green areas or ok areas but table 7 does indicate a caution zone for 0 m 0 75 m significant wave height and zero crossing periods of 3 s 13 s and the prohibitive zone i e red areas or no areas is expanded for 1 m 3 m significant wave height for 3 s 13 s zero crossing periods in other words while the operation for v c 0 25 m s can be carried out similarly as for v c 0 1 m s when the hook lowering velocity is 0 5 m s the operational windows are decreased significantly a speed of v c 0 6 m s should be avoided since there is no permissible wave zone for the operation 4 2 impact of the wave climate fig 6 shows the sea states in hours as a function of significant wave height and zero crossing period at lysekil where the uu wecs are deployed usually using a barge similar to the svitzer ark the sea states observed in the area have periods of 2 12 s and significant wave height from 0 m to 4 m the prevailing significant wave height is 0 5 m 1 m with a 3 s 4 s zero crossing period for about 1154 h year followed by 0 m 0 5 m significant wave height and zero crossing period of 2 s 3 s about 1004 h year according to the calculations of this study for v c 0 1 m s the uu wec s installation can be carried out safely or with caution for the most frequently occurring wave conditions scenarios that potentially provide enough time for installation fig 7 presents the percentages of the sea states occurrence as a function of significant wave height and zero crossing period of the wave hub test site at the north coast of cornwall the cornwall site is characterized by higher significant wave heights and zero crossing periods than the lysekil area the wave hub site has sea states of 0 m 6 5 m significant wave height and 2 s 11 5 s zero crossing period although typically the waves are 1 m 1 5 m with a 5 s 5 5 s period 4 6 of the total time year the second most frequent sea states observed are for 1 m 1 5 m wave heights and 5 5 s 6 s period 4 3 of the total time year the uu wec can still be deployed at the cornwall site but with caution and for fewer sea states than at the lysekil area the cornwall test site i e the wave hub site is about 55 m deep lysekil area is about 25 m deep that is the cornwall test site will require a longer deployment weather window for installations the deployment of a wec at the lysekil site 25 m deep will take approximately 4 min with a crane tip velocity of 0 1 m s adding to this 5 min to lift the generator before submersion the total installation time will not exceed 9 min deploying the same device with the same lowering velocity at the wave hub site 55 m deep will take about 9 min adding the lifting time the total deployment time will be 14 min in other words submerging the same wec at the cornwall site takes 1 5 more time than it does at the lysekil area but both operations can be completed within the same 30 min time window finally considering table 4 and figs 6 and 7 the operability of the installation operation can be calculated as an estimation of the available time for installation compared to the total time the permissible sea states for deploying the uu wec are of 0 m 0 25 m wave height and 3 s 13 s wave period to facilitate the combination of table 4 data with figs 6 and 7 we will consider sea states of wave heights 0 m 0 5 m and periods 3 s 13 s these states are found at the lysekil site 37 44 of the time yearly while at the cornwall site are encountered 0 8 of the total time this can indicate that for such short time available for deployment at the wave hub site another installation method e g instead of using a time consuming barge a faster specialized vessel could be hired for the operation 5 conclusions an uu type wec can be safely installed with a barge similar to the svitzer ark for significant wave heights up to 0 25 m and zero crossing periods from 3 to 13 s for the same zero crossing periods and significant wave heights over 0 25 m and up to 2 m the deployment procedure can be carried out with caution significant wave heights over 2 m and up to 3 m and with zero crossing periods of 3 s 13 s are restrictive to offshore deployment operations the hook lowering velocity plays an important role in the safety of the operation that is when the hook lowering velocity increases it affects the drag f d slam f s l a m and characteristic hydrodynamic f h y d forces which results in decreasing the safe operational sea states this installation strategy of using a standard barge to deploy a uu type wec can be carried out in locations other than the lysekil site for example at the wave hub test area in cornwall however since the wave conditions in cornwall are more severe than in lysekil this operation may require longer time periods because of narrower weather windows this study could be applied to other vessels such as tugboats or specialized vessels for offshore operations and in more test locations and sea states with the aim to find the optimal deployment method according to an area s sea conditions this approach will optimize the installation procedures lowering the overall cost by avoiding rental expenses for idle vessels credit authorship contribution statement maria angeliki chatzigiannakou conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing

21884,in order to solve the difficult physical problem of moving structures through free surface and stratified fluid interface the paper presents and develops a new method based on surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh to handle transient density interface and moving boundary therein quad tree data storage structure adaptive grid techniques and high resolution reconstruction limiter are introduced to improve computational efficiency and precision hybrid mesh systems of structural and cartesian cut cell mesh are extended to be applied in the laminar flow problem at low reynolds number on this basis a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models falling through air water air oil and oil water interfaces are carried out respectively then several cases are taken to validate the numerical method sequentially the characteristics of interface variation and closure shape versus different density ratios are compared and the effect of stratified fluid interface on the hydrodynamic force of moving body is mainly discussed in summary this paper unifies free surface and stratified fluid interface together as density interface which can be handled and studied by the same numerical method thus by combining water entry with stratified fluid problem the influence of various density interfaces on moving body can be better analyzed keywords moving body free surface stratified fluid interface surface capturing method cartesian cut cell mesh experimental test 1 introduction with the demands of ever growing energy more and more attentions have been paid to the exploitation of ocean resources developing towards deep sea which should cause the lifting operation of underwater equipment such as subsea manifold christmas tree etc to be a very common and crucial engineering technique as shown in fig 1 in deep sea the environment condition is rather complicated and the stratification phenomenon of sea water density in vertical direction is obvious due to various effects for example temperature gradient salinity difference and so on thus not only free surface but also stratified fluid interface should be considered in the whole process of lifting operation during the process of subsea structures through free surface or stratified fluid interface some engineering accidents such as slack and oscillation of hoisting wire location deviation and so on may occur therefore it is very important to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of moving body through free surface and stratified fluid interface for analyzing the physics model of lifting operation due to the complexity of coupling instantaneous moving density interface and solid boundary it is complicated and difficult to solve these problems therein the free surface and stratified fluid interface are both caused by the variable fluid density and thus can be treated as unified density interface compared with traditional numerical methods to deal with the density interface such as surface fitting method farm et al 1994 glimm et al 1988 lemos 1992 and surface tracking method hirt and nicholls 1981 youngs 1982 and kleefsman et al 2005 surface capturing method was presented and improved by kelecy and pletcher 1997 pan and chang 2000 qian et al 2006 and wang and wang 2009 in the method both stratified fluid and gas fields were solved simultaneously then the location and shape of the density surface can be captured as a contact discontinuity in the density field therefore this method not only has the ability to simulate complicated moving density interface but also has better computational efficiency by eliminating the need for complex surface tracking and reconstruction procedures furthermore compared with traditional structured mesh and unstructured grid method cartesian cut cell mesh coirier and powell 1993 yang et al 1997a b causon et al 2001 qian et al 2006 and wang and wang 2009 as a newly developed mesh method has the advantage to handle the moving body by updating a few cut cells locally rather than re meshing the whole flow domain which is straightforward and easily automated and can be selected as basic mesh scheme therefore this paper creates a unified layer model with inhomogeneous fluid density to simulate the moving body through the free surface and stratified fluid interface as a density discontinuity the numerical method based on surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh for moving body through unified density interface is described in section 2 therein the quad tree data storage structure adaptive grid techniques and high resolution reconstruction limiter are further introduced to improve the computational efficiency and numerical precision furthermore hybrid mesh systems of structural and cartesian cut cell mesh are extended to be applied in the laminar flow problem at low reynolds number moreover a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models passing through air water air oil and oil water interfaces were carried out in harbin engineering university to validate the numerical method of this paper in section 3 finally the differences of interface variation and closure shape versus various physical processes are analyzed and then the effect of stratified fluid interface on the hydrodynamic force of moving body is discussed in section 4 2 improvement and description of numerical method according to the experimental measurement about the fluid field near free surface the fluid characteristics can be found to vary in a narrow band so free surface can be numerically handled as discontinuous density interface kelecy and pletcher 1997 furthermore a simplified two layer model with two different densities is a classic analytical technique to solve the stratified fluid problem perova 2013 therein the fluid density can be thought to have a sudden change and the interface can be also treated as discontinuous density interface as shown in fig 2 thus this paper unifies free surface and stratified fluid interface together as density interface which can be handled and studied by the same numerical layer model and surface capturing method 2 1 governing equations here surface capturing method is used to treat free surface and stratified fluid interface in this method governing equations are the 2d incompressible unsteady inviscid fluid system with a variable density field and the governing equations can be written in conservation form the mass conservation equation 1 ρ t ρ u x ρ v y 0 the x direction momentum equation 2 ρ u t ρ uu p x ρ uv y ρ b x the y direction momentum equation 3 ρ v t ρ vu x ρ vv p y ρ b y the incompressibility constraint equation 4 u x v y 0 where ρ is the fluid density u and v represent the x and y directional fluid velocities p is the fluid pressure and b x and b y are the x and y directional accelerations of body force 2 2 boundary conditions boundary conditions of computational domain include the following two kinds outlet or open boundary a zero gradient condition is applied in the velocity and density and the pressure at this boundary is fixed which allows fluid to enter or leave the computational domain freely according to the local flow velocity and direction solid body boundary the no penetration and no slip conditions can be applied to the velocity and the density is assumed to have a zero normal gradient for the case that a free rigid body moves with one degree up or down the projection method for momentum equations 2 and 3 is adopted and the pressure boundary condition can be described as p 0 ρ v s t ρ g here v s is the vertical velocity of body with positive direction upwards 2 3 cartesian cut cell mesh and improved quad tree data storage structure in the present study 2d circular model is mainly studied and its cartesian cut cell mesh is used as grid system which includes three kinds of cells solid cell s fluid cell f and cut cell c as shown in fig 3 the geometric and fluid information are stored in these cells furthermore the generating steps of cartesian cut cell mesh are described in detail in the references of causon et al 2001 and wang and wang 2009 due to the relative low efficiency of linked list structure in the original method wang and wang 2009 for data search the quad tree structure is used as an alternative to improve the data storage here the generation steps are briefly introduced as shown in fig 4 initially the fluid domain should be determined and then the initial cartesian mesh a is created next according to a certain condition the mesh a can be split into four sub meshes b c d and e therein the mesh c can be further subdivided into other four smaller meshes f g h and i based on the quad tree data storage structure the mesh generation should become quicker the efficiency to seek data should be obviously enhanced on this basis data management modes of three levels versus node line and face 2d cell from low to high are created therein the node numbers and spatial coordinates of three directions are stored in the corresponding fortran structure then the line numbers two end point numbers and line length are reserved in the line structure finally the information of face structure mainly includes respective grid types refinement depth center coordinates face number node information line message fluid density fluid velocities fluid pressure variable gradient and so on 2 4 numerical discrete scheme based on the surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh a cell central finite volume method is used for numerical discretization in the numerical scheme the numerical flux at each edge of fluid cell is calculated by means of roe s approximate riemann solver qian et al 2006 roe 1978 furthermore a least square method wang and wang 2009 is used to obtain variable gradients in the linear representation and numerical limiter qian et al 2006 is taken to maintain monotony of numerical scheme and control spurious oscillations next the flux on the moving solid boundary is calculated by exact riemann discontinuous solution wang and wang 2009 finally dual time stepping technique with artificial compressibility method soh and doodrich 1988 is applied in time advancing to form linear equations at each time step which can be solved by an approximate lu factorization alu scheme pan and lomax 1988 for more details please refer to wang and wang 2009 2 5 fluid body interaction for some cases of body freely falling through density interface in this paper the fluid body interactions need to be considered and thus a fully body fluid coupled method kleefsman et al 2005 should be employed to calculate the transient body velocity and displacement the body velocity at each physical time step is computed by 5 v s n 1 k 1 ω v s n δ t f b o d y k m 1 ω v s n 1 k where δ t is the physical time interval m is the mass of body and v s n is the vertical body velocity at the physical time n ω is a relaxation parameter to control the stability of sub iteration which is in the range from 0 to 1 the larger the ω is the faster the convergence rate of sub iteration is the equation 5 describes a sub iterative process of fluid body coupling at each physical moment when the absolute value of v s n 1 k 1 v s n 1 k is less than 10 3 the sub iteration is convergent and the v s n 1 k 1is taken as the new velocity boundary condition v s n 1of solid body for the next physical time step n 1 the vertical displacement of solid body is calculated by 6 y s n 1 δ t v s n v s n 1 2 where y s n 1 is the new displacement condition of solid body for the next physical time step n 1 2 6 extended method to laminar flow problem at low reynolds number hybrid grid systems of structural and cartesian cut cell mesh are introduced into the original method to solve the laminar flow problem at low reynolds number firstly body fitted structural meshes can be created based on the surface shape of moving body then splitting algorithm is applied to judge the intersection relationship between outermost boundaries of structural mesh and cartesian cut cell mesh as shown in fig 5 in order to eliminate the effect of minimum cell on the calculation precision and stability the locations of min cell and its largest neighbor cell are confirmed whose residuals should be jointly numerically calculated through volume weighted average method furthermore the concept of viscous flux at each cell edge is introduced which can be averagely evaluated according to directional derivative versus fluid velocities of adjacent meshes sang and li 2003 2 7 grid adaptive technique and high resolution scheme by introducing adaptive theory the grid adaptive technique of cartesian cut cell mesh according to the fluid variable gradient as reference parameter is presented based on the quad tree structure of data storage the refinement of adaptive grid is carried out by judging the change of selected variable gradient versus the adjacent meshes therein the gradient of fluid variables fluid density velocity pressure etc is chosen as adaptive parameters and then its correlative threshold about refinement operation is defined when the adaptive parameter in the cell center is larger than the given threshold value the grid cells on its both sides are labelled and should be adaptively refined furthermore in the reconstruction process of fluid variable the nonlinear limiter is introduced into the gradient to better simulate the two layer model with two different densities and the density interface as contact discontinuity which can control spurious oscillation and enhance the accuracy on the basis of original scheme wang and wang 2009 the high resolution superbee limiter based on the adaptive technique of cartesian cut cell mesh is improved as an alternative of traditional minmod limiter near the density interface here taking the water entry case of 2d circular structure for example adaptive mesh system and free surface profiles with different numerical schemes at two moments are numerically calculated and compared in fig 6 from the figure it can be found that based on the fluid density gradient the meshes near free surface can be automatically refined according to the adaptive theory which should better improve the numerical resolution and precision along with superbee limiter 3 experiments and validation of numerical method in order to better validate the numerical method of this paper a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models falling through air water air oil and oil water interfaces were carried out in harbin engineering university to study moving structure through free surface and stratified fluid interface then the experimental data and classic results campbell and weynberg 1980 greenhow and lin 1983 are used to validate the numerical method of this paper 3 1 description on experiments of moving body through density interface in the experiments the soybean oil density 920 kg m3 and viscosity 8 5 10 3 kg m s and water density 998 2 kg m3 and viscosity 1 0 10 3 kg m s were chosen as test fluids the main experimental equipment include glass flume high speed camera light source and so on as plotted in fig 8 to shoot the phenomenon of moving body through free surface and stratified fluid interface as described in fig 7 the test fluid were evenly arranged in the glass flume 1 which is 0 4m 0 4m 0 4m to form the steady density interface 2 as shown in fig 9 then the high speed camera 3 and light source 4 were turned on next various initial heights of lowering device 5 were set and the cylindrical model 6 which is 15 mm diameter 150 mm length and 0 053 kg weight should fall freely by observing the process of cylinder passing through the density interface the relative data signal can be passed on to personal computer 7 3 2 validation of the present numerical method in this section a 2d computational domain of 0 3 0 3m was created and the cylindrical model is 15 mm diameter the physical and pseudo time step δ t and δ τ were 0 0001 and 0 01s β was 500 and ω was taken as 0 8 the location and shape of interface were determined as the density contour with the average value ρ 0 of the two fluid densities and all density interface plots were created by using 10 evenly spaced contours between 0 9ρ 0 and 1 1ρ 0 firstly two cases are chosen as validation examples therein the first case is oil thickness 6 cm and the initial moment corresponds to the cylindrical model contacting the interface between air and oil the second case is oil thickness 3 cm and the bottom of the cylinder is 27 cm up from the air oil interface then the cylindrical model began to fall freely in this test case the motion of cylinder needs to be calculated from the body fluid interaction as described in section 2 5 then the experimental repeatability and numerical convergence are mainly discussed in fig 10 from fig 10 a it can be found that experimental results versus three different processes are almost the same as each other which validate the experiments of this paper to have good repeatability furthermore in fig 10 b and c when the grid sizes reduce to a certain extent the falling heights versus different meshes are considered to be same and the numerical solution with mesh size 1 5 mm is approximately close to the experimental data which can validate the numerical method to be convergent and accurate thus based on calculation precision and speed the grid discretization scheme δ x δ y 1 5 mm should be applied in this numerical test furthermore time histories of falling heights during the whole process of cylindrical model through air oil and oil water interfaces are shown in fig 11 as shown in the figure the numerical results by the present method with viscous effect are basically in better agreement with those of the experimental data but it is a pity that with this method the solutions of falling height are still a little bit overestimated which may be caused by the effect of different dimensions between numerical simulation of this paper two dimensions and experiment three dimensions on the other hand due to the high viscosity of oil the concept of viscous flux should be considered and then the extended numerical scheme in section 2 6 can be validated to be accurate enough to solve the viscous laminar flow problem at low reynolds number then the water entry problem of a 2d circular model is analyzed to validate the present numerical method the zero time t 0 of this case was selected as the moment that the bottom of the cylinder is 5 cm up from the initial free surface thus the free surface profile at a classic moment of cylinder entering water is simulated and shown in fig 12 along with the experiment of this paper and greenhow and lin 1983 from the figure it can be found that by referring to the experimental photograph of greenhow the high speed camera of experiments in this paper can be validated then as the cylinder pierces the surface the phenomenon that the water rises up along the each side of the body and the displacement waves are formed can be well predicted by the present method furthermore the classic surface profiles at the later stage of water entry by numerical and experimental method of this paper are plotted in fig 13 it can be also seen that the numerical method can be better applied to accurately simulate the free surface shape including complicated jet flow secondly the stratified fluid problem with oil and water is studied by numerical and experimental methods the zero time t 0 of this case was selected as the moment that the bottom of the cylinder is 5 cm up from the interface of water and oil with 5 cm thickness then the shapes of stratified fluid interface at the initial and later stages of cylindrical model from oil to water can be compared by various methods and shown in figs 14 and 15 from the figure it can be found that by comparing with the experimental image of this paper the deformation of oil water interface can be precisely numerically simulated by the present method furthermore the appearances of the oil bubbles at three classic moments are numerically calculated and photographed as expressed in fig 16 which shows that the numerical method of this paper can be successfully applied to predict the separation process of the fluid bubbles of low density furthermore the water entry case of the 2d circular model with the constant velocity 1 m s was chosen to validate the numerical method to calculate the slamming load then the slamming coefficient of the circular cylinder by this paper is calculated and compared with the experiment data campbell and weynberg 1980 as shown in fig 17 therein cs f ρgv 2 is the slamming coefficient f is the vertical hydrodynamic v denotes the velocity of the body and r is the radius of the circular cylinder in the present method the hydrodynamic f on the cylinder can be obtained by direct integration of the pressure over the body surface and is plotted in the figure compared with the results the numerical solutions of this paper are closer to the experiment data but it can be found that by the present method the moment corresponding to the maximum cs is delayed slightly the reason may be that before the cylinder as a blunt body contacts the initial clam free surface due to the effect of airflow in the air gap the deformation of the free surface has been produced which will delay the moment of water entry 4 discussion about the hydrodynamic characteristic of moving body through density interface the test case of moving circular model through free surface air density 1 225 kg m3 water density 1025 kg m3 and stratified fluid interface upper fluid density 976 19 kg m3 lower fluid density 1025 kg m3 density ratio 1 05 were numerically simulated the model was created on a square domain of 3 0 5 5m occupied by two fluids a cylinder with 0 055m radius moved through free surface with the constant velocity 1 m s and the zero time t 0s of this case was selected as the moment that the bottom of the cylinder is 0 55m up from the initial density interface free surface or stratified fluid interface by the analysis of mesh sensitivity based on calculation precision and speed the grid discretization scheme 260 380 with unequal spacing will be taken as initial mesh system therein the local zone near solid boundary is divided equally with δ x δ y 0 002m then with the cell being away from the cylinder the size of cell gradually increases with the specific value in the method the physical and pseudo time interval δ t and δ τ were 0 0001s and 0 01s β was 500 and ω was taken as 0 8 on this basis the contour of fluid density during water entry at various moments are numerically simulated and plotted in fig 18 therein the red color denotes the water with density 1025 kg m3 and the blue zone is the air with density 1 225 kg m3 then the cylinder begins to move downwards in air and the air near the body surface is in motion together with the cylinder when the cylinder is close to the free surface the air gap between the body surface and free surface is relatively small thus the influence of the air in the air gap on the free surface becomes very important which causes the deformation of the free surface that is why the cylinder is also in air meanwhile the air escapes from the air gap with high speed as the cylinder pierces the surface the water rises up along the each side of the body and the displacement waves are formed as the body travels further into the water the two intersections between each edge of the body and the free surface continue to move up to the top of the cylinder and then towards each other after the free surface is reconnected the water particles near the solid boundary are forced to move together with the body and flow through both sides to the rear point of the cylinder in addition a jet flow is created upwards above the cylinder then due to the effect of gravity the jet flow begins to move downwards and almost vanishes meanwhile additional displacement waves occur and travel outward again furthermore the contour of fluid density and stratified fluid interface at various moments are shown in fig 19 therein the red color denotes the heavy water with density 1025 kg m3 and the blue zone is the light water with density 976 19 kg m3 when there is a certain distance between the cylinder and density interface the surface has deformed greatly then the 2d circular model begins to touch the surface and brings the contact parts to move downward simultaneously during the above process there are basically no uplifted zones of surface and displacement waves at the both sides of the cylinder sequentially the surfaces directly move towards the center of the circular model and then are reconnected next the density interface above the cylinder should transform from concave to convex shape thus a small scale ascending jet is formed and damply falls down quickly until displacement waves happen and spread outward by synthetically comparing the figs 18 and 19 it can be concluded that the distinctive density ratios can affect the shape and development of density interfaces then the differences of the two cases can be summarized as follows 1 when the cylinder doesn t contact the density interface whether the surface can produce a large deformation or not is one of the difference 2 during the process of moving cylinder through the density interface the shapes at the both sides of the body are distinguished from each other therein whether the uplifted zones of surface and displacement waves can happen or not is major difference 3 as the surfaces above the cylinder are reconnected the shapes of air bubble and fluid bubble with smaller density versus two cases are distinctive 4 after the surfaces are shallow closure the velocities and max heights of jet flow are different from each other furthermore the sequential displacement waves versus two cases are distinguishing furthermore here during the whole process of the cylinder through the stratified fluid interface the shape and profile of fluid bubble with low density and stratified fluid interface at various moments are further plotted in fig 20 to study the physical phenomenon in the figure when the circle is close to the fluid interface it would result in the interface with a large deformation then the circle goes through and finally the interface is reconnected again then the circle further travels the low density fluid begins to present asymmetry and finally separates from the circle the details of physical phenomenon can be further described as follows at t 0 0s the initial position of the cylinder and the calm density interface are shown in the first graph then the cylinder begins to move downwards in low density fluid and the fluid near the body surface is in motion together with the cylinder when the cylinder is close to the stratified fluid interface the gap between the body surface and interface is relative small thus the influence of the low density fluid in the gap on the interface becomes very important which causes the large deformation of the fluid interface as the cylinder pierces the interface the high density fluid began to move towards the top of the cylinder due to the pressure difference after the interface is reconnected the fluid particles with high density near the solid boundary are forced to move together with the body and flow through both sides to the rear point of the cylinder meanwhile the partial fluid particles with low density are trapped inside the high density fluid and move together with the cylinder as the body travels further into the high density fluid the shape of low density fluid begins to present asymmetry then the asymmetry gradually strengthens until the low density fluid separates from the cylinder with the fluid zone of low density being far away finally the fluid field near the cylinder tends towards stability furthermore the time history of hydrodynamic force on 2d circular cylinder through stratified fluid interface is shown in fig 21 from the figure it can be found that at the initial time the hydrodynamic force is equal to the buoyancy for the low density and then gradually increases due to unsteady motions and reaction of stratified fluid interface until the cylinder contacts the interface the hydrodynamic force begins to be basically steady unlike water entry process the force on cylinder has no sudden change during the cylinder through stratified fluid interface which may result from the large deformation of the stratified fluid interface with small density ratio at about t 0 7s i e during the moving body through the stratified fluid interface there is no relative large slamming pressure on the cylinder the variation of hydrodynamic force only results from the distinction of hydrostatic pressure due to the density difference of two kinds of fluids however it should be noted that as the body travels further into the high density fluid a max peak of hydrodynamic force increase by about 30 occurs at about t 2 1s which may be caused by the deformation and separation of the fluid zone with low density next along with a series of fluid variation as shown in fig 20 the fourteenth and fifteenth graphs at the moments of t 2 2 and 2 3s the hydrodynamic force presents vibration attenuation and finally becomes stable again finally in order to provide more details during the circular cylinder through stratified fluid interface the velocity vector and pressure distributions around the cylinder at time t 0 7 and 2 1s are simulated and shown in figs 22 and 23 therein non dimensional x coordinate is defined as x r and non dimensional pressure is p ρv 2 in the fig 22 a it can be found that two symmetry velocity vortices are formed in the wake region at t 0 7s and thus between the two vortices a high pressure peak can be caused on the center of cylindrical top meanwhile the flows around both sides of the cylinder interact with the two vortices which can result in two high pressure areas near left and right sides as shown in fig 23 a from the figure it can be also seen that there are no very large slamming pressures on the bottom of the cylinder at t 0 7s furthermore in fig 22 b at t 2 1s the low density fluid separates from the cylinder and velocity vortex presents asymmetry so there are only two asymmetric high pressure peak on the cylindrical top as plotted in fig 23 b which causes the relative pressure difference between the bottom and top to be larger therefore a max peak of hydrodynamic force increase by about 30 occurs at about t 2 1s 5 conclusions in this paper a novel numerical method based on the surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh is presented to innovatively unify the free surface and stratified fluid interface together as contact interface it can successfully solve the physical problem of moving body through the density interface in the numerical calculation finite volume method and corresponding numerical schemes roe s approximate riemann solver dual time stepping technique fluid body interaction scheme hybrid mesh system grid adaptive technique and so on are applied then a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models falling through air water air oil and oil water interfaces are carried out to validate the accuracy of the present method then by combining water entry with stratified fluid problem the influence of various density interfaces on moving body can be better analyzed and the characteristics of the hydrodynamic force of moving body through stratified fluid interface are mainly discussed thus some useful conclusions have been made and the calculation method can be provided for practical engineering to guide the lowering operation of subsea structures 1 the numerical method based on surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh can be successfully adopted to solve the physical problem with fluid density interface a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models falling through air water air oil and oil water interfaces are carried out respectively to validate the accuracy of the present method 2 there are four main differences of the shape and development of density interfaces during the circular model moving through free surface and stratified fluid interface which include a when the body doesn t contact the density interface whether the surface can produce a large deformation or not is one of the difference b during the process of the body piercing the density interface whether the uplifted zones of surface and displacement waves can happen or not is major difference c as the surfaces above the cylinder are reconnected again the shapes and shedding modes of the bubbles of air or fluid with smaller density are the difference d after the surfaces are shallow closure the shapes of jet flow and sequential displacement waves are the difference 3 during the cylindrical model moving through the stratified fluid interface the fluid with low density should be trapped deform and separate which can influence interface profile and hydrodynamic force on the model 4 during the moving body through the stratified fluid interface there is no relative large slamming pressure on the cylinder and the variation of hydrodynamic force only results from the distinction of hydrostatic pressure due to the density difference of two kinds of fluids there are two noteworthy aspects one is that the force has no sudden change during the circular model through interface which would be caused by the small density ratio the other is that a max peak should occur and may be caused by the deformation and separation of the fluid bubbles with low density which should be paid more attentions to in the lowering operation of subsea structures in future the practical environmental conditions including the surface wave and internal wave should be further studied for the deep water project about water entry and lowering operation

method and cartesian cut cell mesh to handle transient density interface and moving boundary therein quad tree data storage structure adaptive grid techniques and high resolution reconstruction

reynolds number on this basis a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models falling through air water air oil and oil water interfaces are carried out respectively then several cases are taken to validate the numerical method sequentially the characteristics of interface variation and closure shape versus different density ratios are compared and the effect of stratified fluid interface on the hydrodynamic force of moving body is mainly discussed in summary this paper unifies free surface and stratified fluid interface together as density interface which can be handled and studied by the same numerical method thus by combining water entry with stratified fluid problem the influence of various density interfaces on moving body can be better analyzed keywords moving body free surface stratified fluid interface surface capturing method cartesian cut cell mesh experimental test 1 introduction with the demands of ever growing energy more and more attentions have been paid to the exploitation of ocean resources developing towards deep sea which should cause the lifting operation of underwater equipment such as subsea manifold christmas tree etc to be a very common and crucial engineering technique as shown in fig 1 in deep sea the environment condition is rather complicated and the stratification phenomenon of sea water density in vertical direction is obvious due to various effects for example temperature gradient salinity difference and so on thus not only free surface but also stratified fluid interface should be considered in the whole process of lifting operation during the process of subsea structures through free surface or stratified fluid interface some engineering accidents such as slack and oscillation of hoisting wire location deviation and so on may occur therefore it is very important to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of moving body through free surface and stratified fluid interface for analyzing the physics model of lifting operation due to the complexity of coupling instantaneous moving density interface and solid boundary it is complicated and difficult to solve these problems therein the free surface and stratified fluid interface are both caused by the variable fluid density and thus can be treated as unified density interface compared with traditional numerical methods to deal with the density interface such as surface fitting method farm et al 1994 glimm et al 1988 lemos 1992 and surface tracking method hirt and nicholls 1981 youngs 1982 and kleefsman et al 2005 surface capturing method was presented and improved by kelecy and pletcher 1997 pan and chang 2000 qian et al 2006 and wang and wang 2009 in the method both stratified fluid and gas fields were solved simultaneously then the location and shape of the density surface can be captured as a contact discontinuity in the density field therefore this method not only has the ability to simulate complicated moving density interface but also has better computational efficiency by eliminating the need for complex surface tracking and reconstruction procedures furthermore compared with traditional structured mesh and unstructured grid method cartesian cut cell mesh coirier and powell 1993 yang et al 1997a b causon et al 2001 qian et al 2006 and wang and wang 2009 as a newly developed mesh method has the advantage to handle the moving body by updating a few cut cells locally rather than re meshing the whole flow domain which is straightforward and easily automated and can be selected as basic mesh scheme therefore this paper creates a unified layer model with inhomogeneous fluid density to simulate the moving body through the free surface and stratified fluid interface as a density discontinuity the numerical method based on surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh for moving body through unified density interface is described in section 2 therein the quad tree data storage structure adaptive grid techniques and high resolution reconstruction limiter are further introduced to improve the computational efficiency and numerical precision furthermore hybrid mesh systems of structural and cartesian cut cell mesh are extended to be applied in the laminar flow problem at low reynolds number moreover a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models passing through air water air oil and oil water interfaces were carried out in harbin engineering university to validate the numerical method of this paper in section 3 finally the differences of interface variation and closure shape versus various physical processes are analyzed and then the effect of stratified fluid interface on the hydrodynamic force of moving body is discussed in section 4 2 improvement and description of numerical method according to the experimental measurement about the fluid field near free surface the fluid characteristics can be found to vary in a narrow band so free surface can be numerically handled as discontinuous density interface kelecy and pletcher 1997 furthermore a simplified two layer model with two different densities is a classic analytical technique to solve the stratified fluid problem perova 2013 therein the fluid density can be thought to have a sudden change and the interface can be also treated as discontinuous density interface as shown in fig 2 thus this paper unifies free surface and stratified fluid interface together as density interface which can be handled and studied by the same numerical layer model and surface capturing method 2 1 governing equations here surface capturing method is used to treat free surface and stratified fluid interface in this method governing equations are the 2d incompressible unsteady inviscid fluid system with a variable density field and the governing equations can be written in conservation form the mass conservation equation 1 ρ t ρ u x ρ v y 0 the x direction momentum equation 2 ρ u t ρ uu p x ρ uv y ρ b x the y direction momentum equation 3 ρ v t ρ vu x ρ vv p y ρ b y the incompressibility constraint equation 4 u x v y 0 where ρ is the fluid density u and v represent the x and y directional fluid velocities p is the fluid pressure and b x and b y are the x and y directional accelerations of body force 2 2 boundary conditions boundary conditions of computational domain include the following two kinds outlet or open boundary a zero gradient condition is applied in the velocity and density and the pressure at this boundary is fixed which allows fluid to enter or leave the computational domain freely according to the local flow velocity and direction solid body boundary the no penetration and no slip conditions can be applied to the velocity and the density is assumed to have a zero normal gradient for the case that a free rigid body moves with one degree up or down the projection method for momentum equations 2 and 3 is adopted and the pressure boundary condition can be described as p 0 ρ v s t ρ g here v s is the vertical velocity of body with positive direction upwards 2 3 cartesian cut cell mesh and improved quad tree data storage structure in the present study 2d circular model is mainly studied and its cartesian cut cell mesh is used as grid system which includes three kinds of cells solid cell s fluid cell f and cut cell c as shown in fig 3 the geometric and fluid information are stored in these cells furthermore the generating steps of cartesian cut cell mesh are described in detail in the references of causon et al 2001 and wang and wang 2009 due to the relative low efficiency of linked list structure in the original method wang and wang 2009 for data search the quad tree structure is used as an alternative to improve the data storage here the generation steps are briefly introduced as shown in fig 4 initially the fluid domain should be determined and then the initial cartesian mesh a is created next according to a certain condition the mesh a can be split into four sub meshes b c d and e therein the mesh c can be further subdivided into other four smaller meshes f g h and i based on the quad tree data storage structure the mesh generation should become quicker the efficiency to seek data should be obviously enhanced on this basis data management modes of three levels versus node line and face 2d cell from low to high are created therein the node numbers and spatial coordinates of three directions are stored in the corresponding fortran structure then the line numbers two end point numbers and line length are reserved in the line structure finally the information of face structure mainly includes respective grid types refinement depth center coordinates face number node information line message fluid density fluid velocities fluid pressure variable gradient and so on 2 4 numerical discrete scheme based on the surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh a cell central finite volume method is used for numerical discretization in the numerical scheme the numerical flux at each edge of fluid cell is calculated by means of roe s approximate riemann solver qian et al 2006 roe 1978 furthermore a least square method wang and wang 2009 is used to obtain variable gradients in the linear representation and numerical limiter qian et al 2006 is taken to maintain monotony of numerical scheme and control spurious oscillations next the flux on the moving solid boundary is calculated by exact riemann discontinuous solution wang and wang 2009 finally dual time stepping technique with artificial compressibility method soh and doodrich 1988 is applied in time advancing to form linear equations at each time step which can be solved by an approximate lu factorization alu scheme pan and lomax 1988 for more details please refer to wang and wang 2009 2 5 fluid body interaction for some cases of body freely falling through density interface in this paper the fluid body interactions need to be considered and thus a fully body fluid coupled method kleefsman et al 2005 should be employed to calculate the transient body velocity and displacement the body velocity at each physical time step is computed by 5 v s n 1 k 1 ω v s n δ t f b o d y k m 1 ω v s n 1 k where δ t is the physical time interval m is the mass of body and v s n is the vertical body velocity at the physical time n ω is a relaxation parameter to control the stability of sub iteration which is in the range from 0 to 1 the larger the ω is the faster the convergence rate of sub iteration is the equation 5 describes a sub iterative process of fluid body coupling at each physical moment when the absolute value of v s n 1 k 1 v s n 1 k is less than 10 3 the sub iteration is convergent and the v s n 1 k 1is taken as the new velocity boundary condition v s n 1of solid body for the next physical time step n 1 the vertical displacement of solid body is calculated by 6 y s n 1 δ t v s n v s n 1 2 where y s n 1 is the new displacement condition of solid body for the next physical time step n 1 2 6 extended method to laminar flow problem at low reynolds number hybrid grid systems of structural and cartesian cut cell mesh are introduced into the original method to solve the laminar flow problem at low reynolds number firstly body fitted structural meshes can be created based on the surface shape of moving body then splitting algorithm is applied to judge the intersection relationship between outermost boundaries of structural mesh and cartesian cut cell mesh as shown in fig 5 in order to eliminate the effect of minimum cell on the calculation precision and stability the locations of min cell and its largest neighbor cell are confirmed whose residuals should be jointly numerically calculated through volume weighted average method furthermore the concept of viscous flux at each cell edge is introduced which can be averagely evaluated according to directional derivative versus fluid velocities of adjacent meshes sang and li 2003 2 7 grid adaptive technique and high resolution scheme by introducing adaptive theory the grid adaptive technique of cartesian cut cell mesh according to the fluid variable gradient as reference parameter is presented based on the quad tree structure of data storage the refinement of adaptive grid is carried out by judging the change of selected variable gradient versus the adjacent meshes therein the gradient of fluid variables fluid density velocity pressure etc is chosen as adaptive parameters and then its correlative threshold about refinement operation is defined when the adaptive parameter in the cell center is larger than the given threshold value the grid cells on its both sides are labelled and should be adaptively refined furthermore in the reconstruction process of fluid variable the nonlinear limiter is introduced into the gradient to better simulate the two layer model with two different densities and the density interface as contact discontinuity which can control spurious oscillation and enhance the accuracy on the basis of original scheme wang and wang 2009 the high resolution superbee limiter based on the adaptive technique of cartesian cut cell mesh is improved as an alternative of traditional minmod limiter near the density interface here taking the water entry case of 2d circular structure for example adaptive mesh system and free surface profiles with different numerical schemes at two moments are numerically calculated and compared in fig 6 from the figure it can be found that based on the fluid density gradient the meshes near free surface can be automatically refined according to the adaptive theory which should better improve the numerical resolution and precision along with superbee limiter 3 experiments and validation of numerical method in order to better validate the numerical method of this paper a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models falling through air water air oil and oil water interfaces were carried out in harbin engineering university to study moving structure through free surface and stratified fluid interface then the experimental data and classic results campbell and weynberg 1980 greenhow and lin 1983 are used to validate the numerical method of this paper 3 1 description on experiments of moving body through density interface in the experiments the soybean oil density 920 kg m3 and viscosity 8 5 10 3 kg m s and water density 998 2 kg m3 and viscosity 1 0 10 3 kg m s were chosen as test fluids the main experimental equipment include glass flume high speed camera light source and so on as plotted in fig 8 to shoot the phenomenon of moving body through free surface and stratified fluid interface as described in fig 7 the test fluid were evenly arranged in the glass flume 1 which is 0 4m 0 4m 0 4m to form the steady density interface 2 as shown in fig 9 then the high speed camera 3 and light source 4 were turned on next various initial heights of lowering device 5 were set and the cylindrical model 6 which is 15 mm diameter 150 mm length and 0 053 kg weight should fall freely by observing the process of cylinder passing through the density interface the relative data signal can be passed on to personal computer 7 3 2 validation of the present numerical method in this section a 2d computational domain of 0 3 0 3m was created and the cylindrical model is 15 mm diameter the physical and pseudo time step δ t and δ τ were 0 0001 and 0 01s β was 500 and ω was taken as 0 8 the location and shape of interface were determined as the density contour with the average value ρ 0 of the two fluid densities and all density interface plots were created by using 10 evenly spaced contours between 0 9ρ 0 and 1 1ρ 0 firstly two cases are chosen as validation examples therein the first case is oil thickness 6 cm and the initial moment corresponds to the cylindrical model contacting the interface between air and oil the second case is oil thickness 3 cm and the bottom of the cylinder is 27 cm up from the air oil interface then the cylindrical model began to fall freely in this test case the motion of cylinder needs to be calculated from the body fluid interaction as described in section 2 5 then the experimental repeatability and numerical convergence are mainly discussed in fig 10 from fig 10 a it can be found that experimental results versus three different processes are almost the same as each other which validate the experiments of this paper to have good repeatability furthermore in fig 10 b and c when the grid sizes reduce to a certain extent the falling heights versus different meshes are considered to be same and the numerical solution with mesh size 1 5 mm is approximately close to the experimental data which can validate the numerical method to be convergent and accurate thus based on calculation precision and speed the grid discretization scheme δ x δ y 1 5 mm should be applied in this numerical test furthermore time histories of falling heights during the whole process of cylindrical model through air oil and oil water interfaces are shown in fig 11 as shown in the figure the numerical results by the present method with viscous effect are basically in better agreement with those of the experimental data but it is a pity that with this method the solutions of falling height are still a little bit overestimated which may be caused by the effect of different dimensions between numerical simulation of this paper two dimensions and experiment three dimensions on the other hand due to the high viscosity of oil the concept of viscous flux should be considered and then the extended numerical scheme in section 2 6 can be validated to be accurate enough to solve the viscous laminar flow problem at low reynolds number then the water entry problem of a 2d circular model is analyzed to validate the present numerical method the zero time t 0 of this case was selected as the moment that the bottom of the cylinder is 5 cm up from the initial free surface thus the free surface profile at a classic moment of cylinder entering water is simulated and shown in fig 12 along with the experiment of this paper and greenhow and lin 1983 from the figure it can be found that by referring to the experimental photograph of greenhow the high speed camera of experiments in this paper can be validated then as the cylinder pierces the surface the phenomenon that the water rises up along the each side of the body and the displacement waves are formed can be well predicted by the present method furthermore the classic surface profiles at the later stage of water entry by numerical and experimental method of this paper are plotted in fig 13 it can be also seen that the numerical method can be better applied to accurately simulate the free surface shape including complicated jet flow secondly the stratified fluid problem with oil and water is studied by numerical and experimental methods the zero time t 0 of this case was selected as the moment that the bottom of the cylinder is 5 cm up from the interface of water and oil with 5 cm thickness then the shapes of stratified fluid interface at the initial and later stages of cylindrical model from oil to water can be compared by various methods and shown in figs 14 and 15 from the figure it can be found that by comparing with the experimental image of this paper the deformation of oil water interface can be precisely numerically simulated by the present method furthermore the appearances of the oil bubbles at three classic moments are numerically calculated and photographed as expressed in fig 16 which shows that the numerical method of this paper can be successfully applied to predict the separation process of the fluid bubbles of low density furthermore the water entry case of the 2d circular model with the constant velocity 1 m s was chosen to validate the numerical method to calculate the slamming load then the slamming coefficient of the circular cylinder by this paper is calculated and compared with the experiment data campbell and weynberg 1980 as shown in fig 17 therein cs f ρgv 2 is the slamming coefficient f is the vertical hydrodynamic v denotes the velocity of the body and r is the radius of the circular cylinder in the present method the hydrodynamic f on the cylinder can be obtained by direct integration of the pressure over the body surface and is plotted in the figure compared with the results the numerical solutions of this paper are closer to the experiment data but it can be found that by the present method the moment corresponding to the maximum cs is delayed slightly the reason may be that before the cylinder as a blunt body contacts the initial clam free surface due to the effect of airflow in the air gap the deformation of the free surface has been produced which will delay the moment of water entry 4 discussion about the hydrodynamic characteristic of moving body through density interface the test case of moving circular model through free surface air density 1 225 kg m3 water density 1025 kg m3 and stratified fluid interface upper fluid density 976 19 kg m3 lower fluid density 1025 kg m3 density ratio 1 05 were numerically simulated the model was created on a square domain of 3 0 5 5m occupied by two fluids a cylinder with 0 055m radius moved through free surface with the constant velocity 1 m s and the zero time t 0s of this case was selected as the moment that the bottom of the cylinder is 0 55m up from the initial density interface free surface or stratified fluid interface by the analysis of mesh sensitivity based on calculation precision and speed the grid discretization scheme 260 380 with unequal spacing will be taken as initial mesh system therein the local zone near solid boundary is divided equally with δ x δ y 0 002m then with the cell being away from the cylinder the size of cell gradually increases with the specific value in the method the physical and pseudo time interval δ t and δ τ were 0 0001s and 0 01s β was 500 and ω was taken as 0 8 on this basis the contour of fluid density during water entry at various moments are numerically simulated and plotted in fig 18 therein the red color denotes the water with density 1025 kg m3 and the blue zone is the air with density 1 225 kg m3 then the cylinder begins to move downwards in air and the air near the body surface is in motion together with the cylinder when the cylinder is close to the free surface the air gap between the body surface and free surface is relatively small thus the influence of the air in the air gap on the free surface becomes very important which causes the deformation of the free surface that is why the cylinder is also in air meanwhile the air escapes from the air gap with high speed as the cylinder pierces the surface the water rises up along the each side of the body and the displacement waves are formed as the body travels further into the water the two intersections between each edge of the body and the free surface continue to move up to the top of the cylinder and then towards each other after the free surface is reconnected the water particles near the solid boundary are forced to move together with the body and flow through both sides to the rear point of the cylinder in addition a jet flow is created upwards above the cylinder then due to the effect of gravity the jet flow begins to move downwards and almost vanishes meanwhile additional displacement waves occur and travel outward again furthermore the contour of fluid density and stratified fluid interface at various moments are shown in fig 19 therein the red color denotes the heavy water with density 1025 kg m3 and the blue zone is the light water with density 976 19 kg m3 when there is a certain distance between the cylinder and density interface the surface has deformed greatly then the 2d circular model begins to touch the surface and brings the contact parts to move downward simultaneously during the above process there are basically no uplifted zones of surface and displacement waves at the both sides of the cylinder sequentially the surfaces directly move towards the center of the circular model and then are reconnected next the density interface above the cylinder should transform from concave to convex shape thus a small scale ascending jet is formed and damply falls down quickly until displacement waves happen and spread outward by synthetically comparing the figs 18 and 19 it can be concluded that the distinctive density ratios can affect the shape and development of density interfaces then the differences of the two cases can be summarized as follows 1 when the cylinder doesn t contact the density interface whether the surface can produce a large deformation or not is one of the difference 2 during the process of moving cylinder through the density interface the shapes at the both sides of the body are distinguished from each other therein whether the uplifted zones of surface and displacement waves can happen or not is major difference 3 as the surfaces above the cylinder are reconnected the shapes of air bubble and fluid bubble with smaller density versus two cases are distinctive 4 after the surfaces are shallow closure the velocities and max heights of jet flow are different from each other furthermore the sequential displacement waves versus two cases are distinguishing furthermore here during the whole process of the cylinder through the stratified fluid interface the shape and profile of fluid bubble with low density and stratified fluid interface at various moments are further plotted in fig 20 to study the physical phenomenon in the figure when the circle is close to the fluid interface it would result in the interface with a large deformation then the circle goes through and finally the interface is reconnected again then the circle further travels the low density fluid begins to present asymmetry and finally separates from the circle the details of physical phenomenon can be further described as follows at t 0 0s the initial position of the cylinder and the calm density interface are shown in the first graph then the cylinder begins to move downwards in low density fluid and the fluid near the body surface is in motion together with the cylinder when the cylinder is close to the stratified fluid interface the gap between the body surface and interface is relative small thus the influence of the low density fluid in the gap on the interface becomes very important which causes the large deformation of the fluid interface as the cylinder pierces the interface the high density fluid began to move towards the top of the cylinder due to the pressure difference after the interface is reconnected the fluid particles with high density near the solid boundary are forced to move together with the body and flow through both sides to the rear point of the cylinder meanwhile the partial fluid particles with low density are trapped inside the high density fluid and move together with the cylinder as the body travels further into the high density fluid the shape of low density fluid begins to present asymmetry then the asymmetry gradually strengthens until the low density fluid separates from the cylinder with the fluid zone of low density being far away finally the fluid field near the cylinder tends towards stability furthermore the time history of hydrodynamic force on 2d circular cylinder through stratified fluid interface is shown in fig 21 from the figure it can be found that at the initial time the hydrodynamic force is equal to the buoyancy for the low density and then gradually increases due to unsteady motions and reaction of stratified fluid interface until the cylinder contacts the interface the hydrodynamic force begins to be basically steady unlike water entry process the force on cylinder has no sudden change during the cylinder through stratified fluid interface which may result from the large deformation of the stratified fluid interface with small density ratio at about t 0 7s i e during the moving body through the stratified fluid interface there is no relative large slamming pressure on the cylinder the variation of hydrodynamic force only results from the distinction of hydrostatic pressure due to the density difference of two kinds of fluids however it should be noted that as the body travels further into the high density fluid a max peak of hydrodynamic force increase by about 30 occurs at about t 2 1s which may be caused by the deformation and separation of the fluid zone with low density next along with a series of fluid variation as shown in fig 20 the fourteenth and fifteenth graphs at the moments of t 2 2 and 2 3s the hydrodynamic force presents vibration attenuation and finally becomes stable again finally in order to provide more details during the circular cylinder through stratified fluid interface the velocity vector and pressure distributions around the cylinder at time t 0 7 and 2 1s are simulated and shown in figs 22 and 23 therein non dimensional x coordinate is defined as x r and non dimensional pressure is p ρv 2 in the fig 22 a it can be found that two symmetry velocity vortices are formed in the wake region at t 0 7s and thus between the two vortices a high pressure peak can be caused on the center of cylindrical top meanwhile the flows around both sides of the cylinder interact with the two vortices which can result in two high pressure areas near left and right sides as shown in fig 23 a from the figure it can be also seen that there are no very large slamming pressures on the bottom of the cylinder at t 0 7s furthermore in fig 22 b at t 2 1s the low density fluid separates from the cylinder and velocity vortex presents asymmetry so there are only two asymmetric high pressure peak on the cylindrical top as plotted in fig 23 b which causes the relative pressure difference between the bottom and top to be larger therefore a max peak of hydrodynamic force increase by about 30 occurs at about t 2 1s 5 conclusions in this paper a novel numerical method based on the surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh is presented to innovatively unify the free surface and stratified fluid interface together as contact interface it can successfully solve the physical problem of moving body through the density interface in the numerical calculation finite volume method and corresponding numerical schemes roe s approximate riemann solver dual time stepping technique fluid body interaction scheme hybrid mesh system grid adaptive technique and so on are applied then a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models falling through air water air oil and oil water interfaces are carried out to validate the accuracy of the present method then by combining water entry with stratified fluid problem the influence of various density interfaces on moving body can be better analyzed and the characteristics of the hydrodynamic force of moving body through stratified fluid interface are mainly discussed thus some useful conclusions have been made and the calculation method can be provided for practical engineering to guide the lowering operation of subsea structures 1 the numerical method based on surface capturing method and cartesian cut cell mesh can be successfully adopted to solve the physical problem with fluid density interface a series of experimental tests of cylindrical models falling through air water air oil and oil water interfaces are carried out respectively to validate the accuracy of the present method 2 there are four main differences of the shape and development of density interfaces during the circular model moving through free surface and stratified fluid interface which include a when the body doesn t contact the density interface whether the surface can produce a large deformation or not is one of the difference b during the process of the body piercing the density interface whether the uplifted zones of surface and displacement waves can happen or not is major difference c as the surfaces above the cylinder are reconnected again the shapes and shedding modes of the bubbles of air or fluid with smaller density are the difference d after the surfaces are shallow closure the shapes of jet flow and sequential displacement waves are the difference 3 during the cylindrical model moving through the stratified fluid interface the fluid with low density should be trapped deform and separate which can influence interface profile and hydrodynamic force on the model 4 during the moving body through the stratified fluid interface there is no relative large slamming pressure on the cylinder and the variation of hydrodynamic force only results from the distinction of hydrostatic pressure due to the density difference of two kinds of fluids there are two noteworthy aspects one is that the force has no sudden change during the circular model through interface which would be caused by the small density ratio the other is that a max peak should occur and may be caused by the deformation and separation of the fluid bubbles with low density which should be paid more attentions to in the lowering operation of subsea structures in future the practical environmental conditions including the surface wave and internal wave should be further studied for the deep water project about water entry and lowering operation of subsea structures in stratified fluid acknowledgement the authors are grateful to professor a man zhang and associate professor shi ping wang at the harbin engineering university in china for
