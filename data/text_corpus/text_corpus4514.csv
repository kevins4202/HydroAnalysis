as well as tail water depth on dry and wet beds respectively the free surface evolution is analyzed through the volume of fluid vof method the sensitivity to mesh resolution and turbulence closure models are evaluated in three cell sizes and four models respectively likewise the turbulence closure models namely reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and large eddies simulation les are compared with the previous experimental data the les showed relatively better agreement than other ones on the free surface evolution the results declared the crucial role of the initial and geometrical conditions on the free surface progression flow energy outflow and inflow hydrographs and the resultant forces keywords dam break initial conditions and reservoir geometry vof les dry and wet beds 1 introduction the ideal sudden dam break represents the overturning of the still water column within a prismatic reservoir due to the removing of a sluice gate this mechanism causes the formation of the rapid unsteady flow the priority to this phenomenon is to predict the hydraulic characteristics of the devastating floods flood routing risk management and hazard analysis in this regard the initial conditions and the reservoir geometry carry out a key role in modifying the hydraulic characteristics ritter 1892 presented an analytical solution based on the saint venant equations to describe the inviscid dam break flow over a smooth horizontal dry bed the dam break wave front tip moves at a constant velocity u f 2 c 0 2 g h 0 towards the downstream channel outlet where the u f c 0 g and h 0 represent the flow forehead velocity the surface wave celerity gravity acceleration and the reservoir initial water level respectively accordingly the dam break flow toward the downstream is governed through initial conditions h 0 nsom et al 2000 2018 crespo et al 2009 in the ritter solution there are no resistance terms while the flow velocity and free surface profile are considered constant and smooth the resistance factors are including the flume bed and walls roughness that causes the curving of the free surface in the tip region dressler 1954 whitham 1955 chanson 2010 nsom et al 2000 2018 yang et al 2018 deng et al 2018 therefore the effects of water viscosity and the bed topography on flow evolution are substantial in real dam failures nsom et al 2000 2018 indicated that the inertial and the shear regimes are governed on dam break flow during the very initial to last stages respectively further the dam break flow pattern including the free surface evolution wave velocity and pressure variations have been scrutinized in previous studies fraccarollo and toro 1995 lobovský et al 2014 larocque et al 2013 soarez frazao and zech 2007 2008 zech and aleixo 2011 the effects of the reservoir shape on the dam break have been reported in a few papers khankandi et al 2012 hooshyaripor et al 2017 likewise the dam break flow characteristics over the wet bed have been reported in previous studies stoker 1948 1957 stansby et al 1998 crespo et al 2009 jánosi et al 2004 yang et al 2018 and ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 further much of the researches devoted to the application of the shallow water equations swe in solving the dam break problem hunt 1984 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 soares frazão and zech 2008 in the swe the hydrodynamic pressure distribution and the vertical component of the flow acceleration are assumed to be negligible while the dam break flow is three dimensional at the early stages in the near field consequently the non hydrostatic pressure distribution and the velocity vertical component are significant kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 stansby et al 1998 mohapatra et al 2004 yang et al 2018 in contrary the 3d models based on the navier stokes n st equations accurately predict the unsteady flow characteristics with high precision in this regard the standard vof technique is employed to track the free surface propagation and the expansion of the water air interface this technique provides superior performance in the modeling of the free surface flows with the sudden deformation of the water air interface further it demands fewer computational efforts compared with the other numerical methods biscarini et al 2010 marsooli and wu 2014 yang et al 2018 nguyen et al 2014 larocque et al 2013 khrabry et al 2016 accordingly larocque et al 2013 biscarini et al 2010 özgökmen et al 2007 and christensen and deigaard 2001 demonstrated that applying the les method leads to accurate results in modeling the dam break phenomenon it can reliably predict the dam break flow hydraulic characteristics likewise the application of this model effectively reduces the computational efforts by eliminating the smallest turbulence length scales in the current study the four turbulence models namely k ε k w rng rans models and les are compared with the laboratory data the les indicated a more satisfactory agreement with the measurement than other used models in the prediction of the free surface evolution and flow depth temporal variations previous experimental studies focused on the dam break wave front evolution advancing distance and the wave velocity as well as the pressure fluctuations in a given reach not the entire flow field however the dam break unsteady flow characteristics has not been reported profoundly some of these characteristics are the hydrograph of the dam outflow the inflow hydrograph of a downstream control section the specific energy and resulting forces within the reservoir while in the preliminary design and efficient operation of dams hazard analysis floods routing and zoning it s necessary to predict the dam break flow features in detail further the previous numerical studies mainly focused on the evaluation of the efficiency of computational methods in solving the shallow water equations whereas the comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal variations of the dam break characteristics is ignored therefore this paper aims to provide an extensive comparative study on the effects of the initial water level and reservoir geometry on the dam break flow over dry and wet beds the flow induced the dam break on dry and wet beds is simulated in ten various cases figs 1 and 2 all modeling is performed using the flow 3d cfd package through finite volume standard vof method hirt and nichols 1981 duz et al 2013 the turbulent flow characteristics are studied employing the les closure model ultimately the current results can contribute to well understand the dam break flow phenomena over dry and wet beds likewise it s of interest in a broad range of the ocean civil and the environment engineers 2 governing equations 2 1 equations of fluid motion the mass continuity and momentum equations are employed to universally describe the fluid motion under the forces applied to it in eqs 1 7 the fluid pressure velocity and density fields represent the

control volume in the absence of the source terms is equal to zero further newton s second law states the fluid momentum is proportional to the resultant of the inertial compression gravity and the viscosity forces in the flow field therefore the n st equations 2 4 through involving the vof scalar functions are employed to describe the incompressible flow properties under the forces imposed on that nielsen et al 2013 in eqs 1 4 a x a y a z and f represent the fraction area and the volume functions in the three coordinates x y and z respectively likewise ρ μ p u v w represent the water density the dynamic viscosity fluid pressure and flow velocity in three orthogonal cartesian coordinates where g x g y g z represent the body accelerations in three directions x y and z respectively further the μ is a coefficient in the laminar and turbulent flows represents the molecular viscosity and μ t ρ υ k e d υ t respectively in this relation the υ t and k e d represent eddy viscosity and diffusion colli and bisang 2018 flow science 2012 eq 5 is solved for the incompressible flow to calculate the f values in the donor acceptor method the upstream and downstream information of a mesh cell is employed to predict the free surface deformations and the flux f values in this way the flux passing of the unit cross section of a cell face along the x abscissa in a time step δ t is equal to l f a x u δ t where u represents the velocity perpendicular to the cell face if the sign of the velocity u is positive then the upstream and downstream cells are considered as the donor and acceptor respectively the temporal progression of the flux f passing through the cross section is calculated according to eqs 5 7 in these equations f 1 f 2 and f 2m represent the fluxes passing through the mesh cells and the maximum value of f 2 respectively the f 1 depends on the length of the cells interface relative to the flow transient along it the donor or the acceptor further the f 2 passes from the donor upstream cell harlow and welch 1965 hirt and nichols 1981 barkhudarov 2003 yao 2004 brethour 2009 marsooli and wu 2014 pourshahbaz et al 2017 2 2 turbulence modeling in the large eddy simulation les closure model the large scale turbulence structures are resolved within the computational grid while the small scale structures are evaluated through the sub grid scale sgs closure the model is time dependent and three dimensional likewise it provides more information about turbulence characteristics than the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models the effects of the small eddies in the computational grid are involved using the length l t filter length the size of the eddies containing the kinetic energy is greater than the filter length in eq 8 where the ν t c s and s i j represent the turbulence viscosity strain rate tensor and the smagorinsky s coefficient equal to 0 167 8 l t δ x δ y δ z 1 3 9 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ k k 2 ν t s i j 2 c s l t 2 s i j s i j 10 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i s i j 2 s i j s i j the sgs tensor values are calculated using eqs 9 and 10 the filter operation decomposes the fluid velocity into the unsolved and resolved components the fluctuations in flow characteristics are evaluated through the n st equations smagorinsky 1963 flow science 2012 kim et al 2017 2 3 discretizing the equations of motion the discrete form of eqs 1 4 is according to the flow 3d user manual 2012 the approximations of the acceleration and the viscosity have the second order precision of time and space all terminations of the momentum except the advection are evaluated through the standard central difference method in the discretization the time step is controlled through the courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability and convergence criteria eqs 11 13 based on the cfl condition the relation between the time step and length interval is according to u δ t δ x 1 parambath 2010 likewise based on the convergence criteria the iterations residual values e should be less than 0 001 e 0 001 in eq 13 α represents the weighting factor which is equal to zero in second order approximations the fluid can t flow and diffuse in more than one mesh cell whereas based on eq 13 because of the over smoothing of the solution the stability parameter α values are small hirt and nichols 1981 yao 2004 flow science 2012 11 δ t 0 45 min f δ x i a x u f δ y j a

boundary conditions are according to figs 1 3 and tables 1 1 3 the still water within the dam reservoir is introduced to the model employing the volume of fluid function f the other dimensions are proportional to the flume total length l t while the computational grid is of a non conforming variable type of rectangular cells in the non conforming mesh the resolution increases automatically near the boundaries and the blocks interfaces this type of the grid is appropriate for the physical domain including the regions that require a higher density of the cells nodes wang et al 2016 whereas raising the number of the mesh blocks leads to increase the calculations time and the storage space as well as the accuracy of the results the computational domain is divided into three distinct parts by mesh blocks as shown in fig 3 throughout the computational domain the firm boundaries including the rigid walls and bottom of the flume are considered as no slip conditions likewise the upper boundary z max is a symmetry condition it means the fluid slips free on that and the tangential shear stress is equal to zero further the free surface represents a boundary condition at the free surface the relative fluid pressure and the tangential stresses are equal to zero further through involving the stagnation pressure at the beginning point of the dam reservoir the fluid velocity in the upstream boundary is equal to zero likewise the continuative condition is imposed on the interface of two blocks to smoothed fluid entry and the exit 3 results and discussion the models were verified through the lobosky et al 2014 fraccarollo and toro 1995 as well as ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 dam break experiments tables 4 4 1 the sensitivity analysis of the modeling results was carried out on the mesh cells dimensions and turbulence closure models in this regard three cells sizes were selected equal to 10 20 and 40 mm the accuracy of the models in predicting the free surface height and the temporal variation of the flow depth was evaluated employing the nrmse in eq 14 x i exp x i mod x exp max and x exp min represent the experimental numerical maximum and minimum values of the x variable in table 4 1 the reverse grid spacing r k is calculated from eq 15 where the n yz 1 and n yz 2 represent the number of the mesh blocks cells within the plane yz vertical cross section in the models 1 and 2 respectively nguyen et al 2014 14 n r m s e i 1 n x i exp x i mod 2 x exp max x exp min 15 r k n y z 2 n y z 1 in table 4 1 the r k value is duplicated by doubling the mesh resolution δ y 2 δ y 1 12 6 2 likewise according to table 4 1 with 1 6 and 3 2 times the r k the processing time t cpu values are 2 4 and 12 3 frc1 frc3 and three and 25 times ozm1 ozm3 respectively one of the limitations of the standard vof method in free surface modeling is the fluid loss in numerical estimations of the momentum advection mampaey and xu 1995 and nguyen et al 2014 while the relation between the fluid loss and its volume in the computational domain has not been reported in previous studies yang et al 2018 nguyen et al 2014 marsooli and wu 2014 larocque et al 2013 further the average processing time for every mesh cell and the effect of the mesh quality on the simulation results has not been investigated in these researches therefore the above parameters are discussed in the present paper the average processing time for every cell and mesh quality play the key role in the computational costs and accuracy of modeling results respectively all simulations were carried out employing the intel i7 3 6 ghz processor with four cores total eight threads in table 6 the average simulation time t s and the number of cells n c are equal to 22 9h and 1139162 this time is equal to 824 seconds for every 0 1s of the t s shakibaeinia and jin 2011 and 0 073 second for every cell n c 1 according to tables 4 1 5 2 while the mesh resolution is one third the nrmse value increases about 0 07 at point 0 frc1 frc3 dam site the optimize meshes cells sizes are selected based on the nrmse and the truncation error caused by grid resolution ε values eq 16 the ε value equals to zero means the grid is independent of the cells size where ε ϕ g i and ϕ represent the truncation error through the resolution the grid s independent and dependent results respectively wei et al 2006 robinson et al 2015 in eq 16 assuming ϕ equals to nrmse the ε values are evaluated according to eq 16 1 marsooli and wu 2014 larocque et al 2013 compared the les and k ε performance in numerical modeling the dam break free surface evolution however the accuracy of other turbulence models like the k w and rng have evaluated seldom in table 4 2 the results from the les show a better agreement with the experimental data than other models except at t s 0 37s indeed the les predicts the free surface evolution more accurate than other models in table 4 3 the results predicted by les and k ε are close however the les shows a better match with the measurement than the k w and rng in the near field points 0 4a accordingly the les satisfactory predicts the temporal variation of the dam break flow depth these results are consistent with those of obtained by larocque et al 2013 and özgökmen et al 2007 in tables 5 1 5 2 the grid independent condition is fulfilled in minimum cells sizes equal to 2 cm however this condition is not satisfied with the ozm1 ozm3 models in these cases the accuracy of results depends on the mesh resolution therefore in this study the minimum mesh cells size in all models is equal to 2 cm table 6 in vof code of the flow 3d there are two sources of the fluid loss f li first the kinetic energy loss because of changing the flow direction in the boundaries second the poor approximations of the momentum advection particularly in the channel boundaries mampaey and xu 1995 therefore the mean fluid loss values are calculated through the weighted averaging eq 17 where f li v fi and f l represent the loss percentage the calculated volume of fluid in a mesh block and weighted average of fluid loss 16 ε ϕ g i ϕ 16 1 ε n r m s e g i n r m s e while the f li and v fi values are evaluated directly and displayed as the output results further the maximum and minimum values of the fluid loss f l belong to the s1 0 3 and s1 3 models table 6 it can conclude that the fluid loss would approximately increase by increment the fluid volume in the computational domain the convergence and accuracy of the simulations strongly depend on the size of the mesh cells and aspect ratios of the x y and z directions 17 f l i 1 n v f i f l i i 1 n v f i in this way the maximum aspects ratio x y y z and z x as well as the maximum inter block cell sizes should not surpass the three and two respectively flow science 2012 according to table 6 these conditions are fulfilled in this study therefore the quality of the meshes is satisfactory in all modeling in table 6 increasing the total number of the mesh cells leads to enhancing the processing time t cpu indeed the t cpu values are about four times by 3 8 times the number of mesh cells in the s1 5 s1 6 however this ratio depends on the mesh cells size the dimensions of the computational domain and its geometric complexity in fig 4 there is a satisfactory agreement between the calculated and the experimental results indeed the model provides a superior efficiency in accurately predicting the free surface profile flow advancing distances and the run up over the downstream wall without the wave breaking down in fig 5 m1 m6 there is a little difference between the experimental and calculated results however the model overestimates the temporal variation of the flow depth near field points 0 and point 4a at the initial stages t s 1 s in contrast in m3 m6 m9 cases the model underestimates and overestimates the temporal variation of the flow depth in the far field point 8a at the initial and the middle to last stages respectively in m7 m9 with increasing the cell dimensions the model efficiency decreases in predicting the temporal variations of the flow depth especially in the dam site point 0 in all simulations the water column is completely overturned through its weight whereas there is no gate at the dam site ye et al 2016 demonstrated the flow forehead velocity in the with gate case is less than the without gate further in real dam failures there is a lag between the formation of the dam break bore and its propagation over the downstream channel szymkiewicz 2010 therefore the without gate case is an approximate assumption of studying the dam break flow characteristics in the cases m1 m4 there is a good agreement with the experimental at very initial stage in m2 m3 m6 and m9 the model underestimates the jet body maximum height jet crest however the model overestimates the jet body advancing distances of the cases m1 m5 m8 it means the flow velocity is higher than the experimental results the free surface fluctuations in the jet body region in experimental are more than modeling results in cases m3 m6 m9 at t s 1 42s in all simulations the dam break unsteady flow is formed at t g 0 1s lauber and hager 1998 and vischer and hager 1998 demonstrated the dam break considered as instantaneous if the gate completely removed from the domain during t g 2 h 0 g and t g 1 5625 h 0 g respectively soares frazão and zech 2007 in this study both of these criteria are fulfilled at every initial water levels h 0 0 375 0 75m t g 0 1s 0 244 0 282 0 345s the effects of the dam reservoir length on velocity and vorticity distribution across the flow field have not been reported in previous studies mohapatra et al 2004 crespo et al 2009 yang et al 2010 yang et al 2018 bukreev and gusev 2005 cheng et al 2012 and khayyer and gotoh 2010 in fig 6 s1 0 1 2 the flow advancing distance and velocity are increased by increment the reservoir initial water level the maximum and minimum velocities belong to the forehead region and the reservoir beginning point respectively indeed there is a significant gradient between the flow forehead and back regions this velocity gradient causes the curving of the free surface profile and non hydrostatic distribution of the pressure mohapatra et al 2004 and yang et al 2010 indicated the pressure distribution is non hydrostatic and nonlinear in the forehead region the prim reason is the rapid variations in the flow depth and the water air transient interface further this curvature is reduced and the free surface profile is smoothed with increasing the initial water level at the moment t s 4s the reason is the flow velocity and the kinetic energy are attenuated during the middle to last stages t s 3 10 s likewise the velocity vectors are distributed over the horizontal direction parallel to the flume bottom zech and aleixo 2011 the calculated velocity peak values obtain less than the ritter 1892 analytical solution u f 2 gh 0 however the asymptotic value u f 2 m s being acceptable to all cases further the flow forehead velocity is about 1 4 times by increasing the initial water level from h 0 w 4 to h 0 w 2 table 1 1 in fig 6 s1 1 s1 3 s1 4 the increasing of the reservoir length does not affect the flow velocity significantly according to yang et al 2018 the dam break flow over the dry bed consists of two distinct stages very initial and the relatively stable the dam reservoir water column is overturned under the gravity force during time interval t s 0 0 1s the velocity vertical component w is dominant and the static pressure values are maximum near the flume bed the free surface profile in the dam reservoir and the forehead regions is of the convex shape whereas it s a concave shaped in the distance between these two regions in the second stage t s 0 1s the free surface curvature decreases and the profile is gradually placed parallel to the bottom likewise the horizontal velocity component u is dominant in contrast in the current study the effects of the gravity force on the free surface evolution is significant as shown in fig 6 at t s 0 5s the free surface curvature is close to the vertical line during very initial stages t s 0 0 5s further the initial water level is determinant factor of changing remarkably the flow velocity in fig 6 s1 5 1 6 changing the reservoir width do not affect the flow velocity the possible reason is that with raising the reservoir width the downstream channel width is increased equally therefore based on the continuity principal there is no difference in the velocity and flow rate of these cases in fig 6 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the dam break sudden impact to the tail water leads to mixing and instant formation of a tongue like jet according to yang et al 2018 and crespo et al 2009 the tongue like jet is formed if the downstream channel to the reservoir depth ratio r w h 0 h wt is less than 0 4 in contrast for r w 0 4 the flow propagates to the downstream with the mushroom shape in this research the r w values in all cases are smaller than 0 4 r w1 0 05 0 5 r w2 0 1 0 5 r w3 0 15 0 5 whereas the free surface profile is standing in the jet formation place at the initial stage ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 demonstrated the possible reason for this deformation is the drags resistance of the tail water against the dam break flow propagation while the flow velocity gradient is remarkable in this region the jet propagation to the downstream causes the mixing of the dam break flow to the tail water during t s 0 5 4s as a result the free surface height is reduced while the profile curvature is modified in the upstream of the jet likewise there is a significant fluctuation in the free surface in the jet body mohapatra et al 2004 indicated there are significant undulations in flow forehead region in the case r 0 4 however the free surface fluctuations are observed in the cases r 0 4 fig 6 s1 0 1 1 0 3 indeed the profile is divided into the three distinct parts of the downstream jet body and its upstream at the downstream the profile is approximately smooth and unchanged because there is no mixing in this region the flow regime is subcritical because of the low velocity fig 8 s1 0 1 1 0 3 in the jet body region the flow velocity is higher than its upstream and downstream further the flow regime is transient and near critical depending on the r values the regime is subcritical to near or supercritical to near critical r 0 1 or r 0 1 indeed the jet advances towards the flume outlet as a moving positive bore over the tail water based on the stoker solution 1948 1957 the flow is uniform in the jet body region further the flow velocity is proportional to u s t 2 2 1 75 h w t 0 25 pritchard and hogg 2002 however the significant free surface fluctuations in the jet body region fig 5 1 6 are in contradiction with the uniform flow assumption likewise according to fig 6 s1 0 1 s1 0 3 the stoker solution is underestimate the jet body progression u st 0 4 0 11 and 0 09 m s in the cases h wt 0 05 0 1 0 15m respectively the velocity decreases from the flow forehead region to the end point of the jet body in the upstream the flow obtains maximum velocity in the region near the jet body downstream interface whereas the reservoir outflow velocity is less and more than the jet body and the downstream respectively the flow regime is subcritical like the downstream of the jet however the velocity is increased from the beginning point of the dam reservoir to the jet body the gradient of the free surface profile in this region is greater than the jet body and the downstream likewise the flow velocity is increased at the flume outlet by raising the h wt values r 0 1 0 33 the possible reasons are that the inertia force is increased at the flume outlet by increment the tail water level consequently the kinetic energy resulting from the jet impact to the downstream region is raised by increment the initial water level therefore the flow velocity is increased at the flume outlet further in fig 6 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the flow velocity is reduced during very initial to the middle stages of the dam break t s 0 5 3s by increment the ratio r yang et al 2018 and crespo et al 2009 numerically demonstrated the bottom friction is the primary dissipation mechanism in the dam break over the wet bed further the bed resistance is attenuated with raising the tail water depth yang et al 2018 whereas the resistance force induced by the bottom friction is negligible compared with the tail water drag in the initial to the middle stages fig 6 s1 0 1 1 s1 0 3 3 in fig 6 1 s1 0 1 6 the low density counterclockwise vorticities negative values are formed near field in the vicinity of the flume walls in these regions the resistance induced by friction causes the transition from the laminar to the turbulent further the vertical velocity gradient leads to formation the wall s and free shear layers over the rigid boundaries and the flow forehead respectively likewise the hairpin vortices are formed within the forehead region the vorticities have positive clockwise spin in this region according to bukreev and gusev 2005 and cheng et al 2012 sudden removing the sluice gate leads to formation the vorticities in the near field at the early stages in contrast in the present study there is not any gate in the dam site further the dam break flow is generated and developed under free overturning of the reservoir water therefore no vorticities are formed near the dam site in the dry bed cases in fig 6 1 s1 0 1 s1 0 3 the vortices are mixed severely along the jet body light color whereas the hairpin vortices are formed at the jet body downstream interface dark color according to khayyer and gotoh 2010 the significant vorticities are appeared in the dam break flow tail water interface at the early stages the possible reason is the resistance of the downstream still water against the dam break flow evolution in fig 7 s1 0 1 2 the free surface height is raised by increment the dam reservoir water level further its value in the case h 0 0 75m is about twice the h 0 0 375 m at the moment t s 2s therefore the free surface height has a direct connection to the dam reservoir water level h 0 during the initial to the middle stages further the free surface height at the moment t s 2s is about half of the t s 4s indeed the h value is about halved by doubling the time t s otherwise the free surface curvature is modified during time t s 2 4s whereas it changes from convex to concave from the beginning point to the flume outlet deng et al 2018 indicated the free surface height of the water air transitional interface forehead region increases faster in the initial than the later stages however the free surface in the forehead region includes a steep slope close to the vertical line according to dressler 1954 and whitham 1955 the main reason for this deformation is the flow resistance resulting in the bottom and walls roughness in fig 7 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the free surface height is raised by increment the reservoir length the obvious reason is that the reservoir elongated across the x direction without changing the l t value further the difference between the h values of l r 7 5m and the other cases is significant in downstream of the dam x 5 15 m at t s 2s however this difference is remarkable in the reservoir x 0 5m at t s 4s in fig 7 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the free surface height doesn t change by increment the reservoir width this result is contradicting to those experimentally obtained by khankandi et al 2012 experimental results they showed that the flow velocity cross waves propagation and the water levels increase by increment the reservoir width whereas in present study the effect of the reservoir width on the flow evolution is significant if there is a difference between the dam section in upstream and the downstream in fig 7 s1 0 1 1 0 3 raising the r values leads to increase the free surface height of the upstream and downstream regions likewise it leads to the fluctuations in the jet body region it should be noted that the jet body is displaced to the dam reservoir by increasing the r values while the h values are the same in the x 4m and x 3m at t s 2s and t s 4s respectively the flow forehead advancing over the dry and wet beds has been compared seldom jánosi et al 2004 in fig 8 s1 0 1 2 the flow forehead advancing to the flume outlet x f is increased from very initial to the middle stages further the x f values are raised by increment the h 0 whereas the maximum advancing distance x fmax is about 1 45 times by doubling the h 0 values in fig 8 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the x f values in the cases l r 5m 7 5m are more than the l r 3 75m however there is no direct relationship between the x f and l r hunt 1984 showed that the advancing distance and the flow velocity are a function of the l r in this regard the swe solution asymptotically valid at x f 4l r in fig 8 s1 1 1 5 1 6 increasing the dam reservoir width does not affect the x f values according to deng et al 2018 the x f represents a significant factor affecting the free surface height and the shape of the water air transition interface indeed the resistance effects of the roughness on the dam break flow are raised by increment the x f values likewise the flow acceleration in the horizontal direction is larger than the vertical with increasing the x f values stansby et al 1998 the flow resistance causes the conversion of the kinetic energy to the potential and thermal near the rigid walls and the bottom surfaces therefore the h values are attenuated with the dam break flow advancing to the downstream in fig 8 s1 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 the x fmax value of the dry at the moment t s 2s is about 1 5 times the wet bed in the case of the h wt 0 15m further the x f values are reduced with increasing the r from 0 1 to 0 3 in fig 9 the dam break froude number is calculated according to relation f r v d a g d a v where the v da g and d av represent the depth averaged velocity the gravity acceleration and the average flow depth respectively flow science 2012 accurately calculating the froude number plays a significant role in the dynamic analysis laboratory modeling and time scaling of the dam break sequential events in fig 9 s1 0 1 2 raising the h 0 does not considerably affect the fr within the dam reservoir region x 0 5m however it causes the raising the fr values between the dam and the flume outlet the flow regime is subcritical critical and supercritical within the dam reservoir near field and the downstream channel respectively the dam break flow regime variation has been reported by yang et al 2018 nsom et al 2000 2018 and kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 however the froude number variations across the flow field have been reported quantitatively seldom soares frazão and zech 2008 and hooshyaripor et al 2017 they demonstrated the flow regime changes from the supercritical to subcritical in the downstream by the free surface evolution further the effects of the dam reservoir width as well as the tail water level on the fr values have not been studied to our knowledge in fig 9 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the fr is attenuated with increasing the dam reservoir length the reason is the flow depth is raised by increasing the l r values fig 6 s1 3 1 4 likewise the subcritical regime transits to the supercritical at the greater distances from the reservoir x 4 8m by increment the l r values in fig 9 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the fr does not change by increasing the reservoir width the reason is the dam reservoir width does not affect the flow velocity fig 6 s1 5 1 6 in fig 9 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the fr is increased by reducing the h wt because the downstream drag resistance force is raised by increment the h wt values the effect of the tail water and the time scaling of the dam break floods outflow and inflow hydrographs have not been profoundly evaluated in previous studies hooshyaripor et al 2017 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 and fraccarollo and toro 1995 however the accurate evaluation of the dam break outflow hydrographs and the depth is crucial in the flood mitigation programs further the river base flow represents a determinant factor in the downstream inflow hydrograph shape and temporal variation of the dam break flood depth accordingly the time scaling plays a significant role in the hazard analysis and the flood management actions in fig 10 s1 0 s1 0 3 the maximum reservoir outflow depth d changes remarkably during three distinct stages a very initial stage t s 0 0 5s the d values rapidly decrease by a steep slope the main reason is the vertical component of the flow acceleration is considerable because of overcoming the net gravity force water column weight whereas the d values are approximately halved likewise the kinetic energy values are significant during this stage b very initial to the middle stage the d values are relatively constant d eq the flow is developed along the horizontal direction more than the vertical further there is a relative balance between the kinetic and potential energies c the middle to last stage the d values attenuate gradually by a moderate gradient the potential energy overcomes on the kinetic one while the viscosity effects dominate the dam break flow likewise the flow regime changes from the supercritical to subcritical during the stages a to c in fig 10 s1 0 1 2 the d and t eq the duration corresponding to d eq values are increased and attenuated by raising the h 0 respectively indeed the duration of the equilibrium between the kinetic and potential energies is reduced by increment the h 0 it means the raising of the h 0 values causes the increasing the energy dissipation of the dam reservoir outflow however all depth diagrams are converged on each other at the stage c t s 5s 10s in fig 10 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the d values are raised by increment the l r during the stage c it s consistent with hooshyaripor et al 2017 experimental results likewise the d eq is the same in all cases d eq 0 2m all diagrams are converged on each other during t s 0 3s therefore the reservoir length has no effect on the d values during stages a and b in fig 10 s1 1 1 5 1 6 increasing the reservoir width w does not affect the d in fig 10 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the d is increased by raising the r in the case r 0 3 h wt 0 15m the d values are raised during t s 2 3s because of the jet progression within the dam reservoir in fig 11 the shapes of the dam reservoir outflow hydrographs are corresponding to fig 10 ones in all cases the outflow flux q increases by a high gradient and then decreases slightly during the stage a rising limb indeed the peak outflow flux q p is very transient the rising limbs are steep because of the sudden overturning of the water column at very initial stages further the period to reach the peak outflow flux t p is constant and equal to twice the instantaneous dam break time t g t p 2tg 0 2s therefore both the dam break initial conditions and the dam reservoir geometry do not affect the t p likewise the q values are constant equilibrium flow rate q e at the stage b whereas these are reduced gradually at the stage c recession limb in fig 11 s1 0 1 2 the outflow fluxes q q p and q e increase while the t eq decreases by increment the h 0 values likewise all hydrographs are converged on each other at the t s 5s the q values are about four times by doubling the h 0 in fig 11 s1 1 1 3 1 4 raising the l r does not affect the t p q p and q e however it leads to increase the t eq and decrease the falling limb length respectively accordingly the t eq values are about twice by doubling the l r indeed the flood flux recession occurs more rapidly by reducing the dam reservoir volume in fig 11 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the q p and q e values are about four times by doubling the reservoir width w whereas the t eq and the falling limb lengths are approximately attenuated by increment the w further the q p in the case of s1 6 w 3 3w 1 is about twice the s1 4 l r3 3lr 1 in fig 11 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the q p and q e are attenuated by increment the h wt the possible reason is raising the h wt values causes increasing the drag resistance force against the dam reservoir outflow therefore the dam reservoir outflow flux shows a slight decrement by increasing the h wt values in fig 12 all inflow hydrographs except the s1 0 1 1 0 3 are approximately bell shaped while there is not a constant inflow flux as q e in these cases because there is a base flow tail water in the downstream channel further the dam reservoir outflow reaches to the mesh block 3 about 1 s therefore the q values are equal to zero during initial stages t 0 1s in fig 12 s1 0 1 2 s1 1 1 3 1 4 and s1 1 1 5 1 6 the q p is raised by increment the h 0 l r and w respectively in fig 12 s1 0 1 2 the t p and the falling limb lengths are decreased and increased by raising the h 0 respectively the prime reason is that raising the h 0 leads to increase the inflow velocity and the flux values in fig 12 s1 1 1 3 1 4 raising the l r values causes reducing the inflow velocity therefore the t p and the flood recession flux are increased by increment the l r values in fig 12 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the flood recession flux is increased by raising the w while the t p values are relatively constant in fig 12 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the inflow hydrographs are not bell shaped indeed the tail water leads to lag the flood recession further the q e values are attenuated by increment the h wt in fig 13 s1 0 1 2 in all modeling cases the flow regime changes from the subcritical to supercritical from the top to down of the d c 2 3 e c it represents the linear relationship between the flow critical depth and the specific energy in a rectangular channel all diagrams are parabolic shaped while their vertex points do not intersect the d c 2 3 e c line the specific energy diagrams are displaced to the right side of the e s axis by increment the h 0 in fig 13 s1 1 1 3 1 4 and s1 1 1 5 1 6 the dam reservoir length and width do not have significant effects on the specific energy values at the moment t s 1s further the specific energy diagrams shapes are asymmetrical before the dam break the distribution of the water pressure in the dam reservoir is hydrostatic and the resistance shears forces values are negligible nsom et al 2000 2018 the dam break pressure forces applied to the downstream obstacles and flume the wall have been experimentally and numerically evaluated in the previous studied stoker 1948 soarez frazao and zech 2008 nsom et al 2000 2018 marsooli and wu 2014 lobovský et al 2014 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 ahmed et al 2018 whereas the resultant forces applied to the dam reservoir during the dam break have not been reported so far the fundamental importance of these forces is in calculating the dam reservoir dynamic response the flood routing and the outflow rates during the dam break in fig 14 the resultant shear force f s is increased by a steep slope during very initial to the middle stages respectively the possible reason is that the outflow velocity gradient is significant during very initial stages therefore the tangential and normal stresses are increased suddenly in the dam reservoir while the outflow velocity and then the stresses value are modified during the middle to last stages in fig 14 s1 0 1 2 the f s is increased by raising the h 0 while the duration of the maximum shears force t shmax is attenuated by increment the h 0 the diagrams s1 1 s1 3 are converged on each other at the moment t s 1s and t s 5s further the t shmax is increased by raising the l r the resultant shears force values are 0 001 times the pressure exerted on the dam reservoir the minimum shears force is related to the moments t s 0 still water and t s 10s in fig 14 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the f s and f smax are raised by increment the dam reservoir width indeed these values are four times with doubling the dam reservoir width w while the t shmax does not change in fig 14 s1 0 1 1 0 3 increasing the h wt leads to reduce the f s values likewise the f s values of the dry is about four times in the wet bed chanson 2010 indicated the f smax and f smin are applied to the flow forehead and the dam reservoir beginning point respectively while the shear force is exponentially attenuated from the peak value to the zero between these two points in fig 15 the resultant pressure forces are raised during very initial to the middle stages while these values are attenuated from the middle to the last stages fraccarollo and toro 1995 and nsom et al 2000 2018 demonstrated the pressure forces induced the water overturning overcome the friction resistance of the initial stages while the friction and viscosity caused to attenuate the pressure forces during the middle to the last stages likewise the dam break flow is three dimensional during very initial stage because of the large vertical acceleration component however the dam break flow is nearly one dimensional during the middle to last stages the maximum resultant pressure forces are applied to the bottom of the dam reservoir in fig 15 s1 0 1 2 the f p and t pmax values are increased by raising the h 0 in fig 15 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the case l r 7 5m obtains the highest f p values of all diagrams further there is a slight difference between f p in the cases l r 3 75m and l r 5m in fig 15 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the f p values are increased by raising the dam reservoir width while the reservoir width has not a significant effect on t pm in fig 15 s1 0 1 1 0 3 raising the h wt causes increasing the f p values while in all diagrams the f p values are constant during t s 2 5s likewise the presence of the tail water level increases the t pm values 4 conclusion in the current study the effects of the initial water level the dam reservoir length and width were evaluated on the dam break flow over the dry and wet beds the standard vof method was employed to track the free surface evolution hirt and nichols 1981 while the turbulence characteristics were calculated through the les closure model the modeling results were validated using the previous dam break experiments lobovský et al 2014 fraccarollo and toro 1995 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 the significant results of this paper represent in the two distinct parts of dam break over the dry and wet beds as follows over the dry bed raising the dam reservoir water level causes an increase the free surface height the advancing distance and the flow velocity likewise it leads to increase the downstream specific energy the outflow maximum depth and the hydrograph the resultant shears and pressure forces whereas it leads to relative decline of the froude number in the middle to last stages raising the reservoir length leads to attenuate the dam break froude number during the middle to last stages however it causes an increase the free surface height the outflow maximum depth and the hydrograph during the middle to last stages nevertheless it does not affect the downstream specific energy further it leads to raise the resultant shears forces in the dam reservoir increasing the reservoir width does not affect the free surface height the advancing distance and the flow velocity the temporal variations of the dam break froude number the reservoir outflow depth as well as the downstream specific energy however it increases the dam outflow rate the resultant shears and pressure forces the positive and low density negative vorticities are formed within the flow forehead region and near field in the vicinity of the flume walls respectively further the free surface height and curvature are modified rapidly in the dam break over the wet bed therefore three distinct parts are apparently distinguished including the downstream the body and the upstream of the flow jet in the downstream the dam break flow does not mix with the water column therefore the shape of the free surface profile is completely smooth and it s almost horizontal the jet body is formed in the distance between the dam break flow and the downstream tail water in this area the velocity value is higher than the upstream and downstream tail water further the flow regime is transient and near critical the flow velocity is decreased from the jet body downstream interface to its end point in the upstream the regime is subcritical because of low velocity the free surface profile curvature of this area is higher than the jet body and the downstream therefore over the wet bed increasing the tail water level reduces the flow velocity during the initial to the middle stages further it leads to increase the free surface height the free surface fluctuations in the jet body region as well as the maximum depth of the dam reservoir outflow in return it causes an attenuate in the outflow hydrograph and the resultant shears and pressure forces it s satisfactory concluded that the vof along with the les turbulence closure model obtain high accuracy in predicting the dam break flow characteristics the modeling efficiency strongly depends on the mesh resolution however the parallel processing could effectively decrease the computational efforts further the mutual effects of the mixed layer sediments bed the substrate penetration and fluid leakage as well as the channel shape factor are not included in the simulations accordingly the model s performance could test for the numerical simulation of the dam break floods in the large reaches of the river for higher generalization all modeling can be carried out in the case of the dam break evolution over the flood plain as a future work the simultaneous effects of the bed vegetation porosity and permeability complex geometry and flood plain obstacles can be included in the dam break over the wet bed likewise the air entrainment flow turbulence energy dissipation and the boundary layer development near field can be studied in the dam break over the rough and mobile beds the hydraulics effects of the river tributaries the diversion dams and the shore protection structures can be studied on the dam break floods acknowledgements authors wish to acknowledge the bu ali sina university of hamedan iran that in the framework of this project made available the processing facilities where all modelings have been done 
22570,this paper presents a comparative study of the influence of the initial and geometrical conditions on dam break flow the conditions are including the reservoir still water level length and width as well as tail water depth on dry and wet beds respectively the free surface evolution is analyzed through the volume of fluid vof method the sensitivity to mesh resolution and turbulence closure models are evaluated in three cell sizes and four models respectively likewise the turbulence closure models namely reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and large eddies simulation les are compared with the previous experimental data the les showed relatively better agreement than other ones on the free surface evolution the results declared the crucial role of the initial and geometrical conditions on the free surface progression flow energy outflow and inflow hydrographs and the resultant forces keywords dam break initial conditions and reservoir geometry vof les dry and wet beds 1 introduction the ideal sudden dam break represents the overturning of the still water column within a prismatic reservoir due to the removing of a sluice gate this mechanism causes the formation of the rapid unsteady flow the priority to this phenomenon is to predict the hydraulic characteristics of the devastating floods flood routing risk management and hazard analysis in this regard the initial conditions and the reservoir geometry carry out a key role in modifying the hydraulic characteristics ritter 1892 presented an analytical solution based on the saint venant equations to describe the inviscid dam break flow over a smooth horizontal dry bed the dam break wave front tip moves at a constant velocity u f 2 c 0 2 g h 0 towards the downstream channel outlet where the u f c 0 g and h 0 represent the flow forehead velocity the surface wave celerity gravity acceleration and the reservoir initial water level respectively accordingly the dam break flow toward the downstream is governed through initial conditions h 0 nsom et al 2000 2018 crespo et al 2009 in the ritter solution there are no resistance terms while the flow velocity and free surface profile are considered constant and smooth the resistance factors are including the flume bed and walls roughness that causes the curving of the free surface in the tip region dressler 1954 whitham 1955 chanson 2010 nsom et al 2000 2018 yang et al 2018 deng et al 2018 therefore the effects of water viscosity and the bed topography on flow evolution are substantial in real dam failures nsom et al 2000 2018 indicated that the inertial and the shear regimes are governed on dam break flow during the very initial to last stages respectively further the dam break flow pattern including the free surface evolution wave velocity and pressure variations have been scrutinized in previous studies fraccarollo and toro 1995 lobovský et al 2014 larocque et al 2013 soarez frazao and zech 2007 2008 zech and aleixo 2011 the effects of the reservoir shape on the dam break have been reported in a few papers khankandi et al 2012 hooshyaripor et al 2017 likewise the dam break flow characteristics over the wet bed have been reported in previous studies stoker 1948 1957 stansby et al 1998 crespo et al 2009 jánosi et al 2004 yang et al 2018 and ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 further much of the researches devoted to the application of the shallow water equations swe in solving the dam break problem hunt 1984 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 soares frazão and zech 2008 in the swe the hydrodynamic pressure distribution and the vertical component of the flow acceleration are assumed to be negligible while the dam break flow is three dimensional at the early stages in the near field consequently the non hydrostatic pressure distribution and the velocity vertical component are significant kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 stansby et al 1998 mohapatra et al 2004 yang et al 2018 in contrary the 3d models based on the navier stokes n st equations accurately predict the unsteady flow characteristics with high precision in this regard the standard vof technique is employed to track the free surface propagation and the expansion of the water air interface this technique provides superior performance in the modeling of the free surface flows with the sudden deformation of the water air interface further it demands fewer computational efforts compared with the other numerical methods biscarini et al 2010 marsooli and wu 2014 yang et al 2018 nguyen et al 2014 larocque et al 2013 khrabry et al 2016 accordingly larocque et al 2013 biscarini et al 2010 özgökmen et al 2007 and christensen and deigaard 2001 demonstrated that applying the les method leads to accurate results in modeling the dam break phenomenon it can reliably predict the dam break flow hydraulic characteristics likewise the application of this model effectively reduces the computational efforts by eliminating the smallest turbulence length scales in the current study the four turbulence models namely k ε k w rng rans models and les are compared with the laboratory data the les indicated a more satisfactory agreement with the measurement than other used models in the prediction of the free surface evolution and flow depth temporal variations previous experimental studies focused on the dam break wave front evolution advancing distance and the wave velocity as well as the pressure fluctuations in a given reach not the entire flow field however the dam break unsteady flow characteristics has not been reported profoundly some of these characteristics are the hydrograph of the dam outflow the inflow hydrograph of a downstream control section the specific energy and resulting forces within the reservoir while in the preliminary design and efficient operation of dams hazard analysis floods routing and zoning it s necessary to predict the dam break flow features in detail further the previous numerical studies mainly focused on the evaluation of the efficiency of computational methods in solving the shallow water equations whereas the comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal variations of the dam break characteristics is ignored therefore this paper aims to provide an extensive comparative study on the effects of the initial water level and reservoir geometry on the dam break flow over dry and wet beds the flow induced the dam break on dry and wet beds is simulated in ten various cases figs 1 and 2 all modeling is performed using the flow 3d cfd package through finite volume standard vof method hirt and nichols 1981 duz et al 2013 the turbulent flow characteristics are studied employing the les closure model ultimately the current results can contribute to well understand the dam break flow phenomena over dry and wet beds likewise it s of interest in a broad range of the ocean civil and the environment engineers 2 governing equations 2 1 equations of fluid motion the mass continuity and momentum equations are employed to universally describe the fluid motion under the forces applied to it in eqs 1 7 the fluid pressure velocity and density fields represent the

control volume in the absence of the source terms is equal to zero further newton s second law states the fluid momentum is proportional to the resultant of the inertial compression gravity and the viscosity forces in the flow field therefore the n st equations 2 4 through involving the vof scalar functions are employed to describe the incompressible flow properties under the forces imposed on that nielsen et al 2013 in eqs 1 4 a x a y a z and f represent the fraction area and the volume functions in the three coordinates x y and z respectively likewise ρ μ p u v w represent the water density the dynamic viscosity fluid pressure and flow velocity in three orthogonal cartesian coordinates where g x g y g z represent the body accelerations in three directions x y and z respectively further the μ is a coefficient in the laminar and turbulent flows represents the molecular viscosity and μ t ρ υ k e d υ t respectively in this relation the υ t and k e d represent eddy viscosity and diffusion colli and bisang 2018 flow science 2012 eq 5 is solved for the incompressible flow to calculate the f values in the donor acceptor method the upstream and downstream information of a mesh cell is employed to predict the free surface deformations and the flux f values in this way the flux passing of the unit cross section of a cell face along the x abscissa in a time step δ t is equal to l f a x u δ t where u represents the velocity perpendicular to the cell face if the sign of the velocity u is positive then the upstream and downstream cells are considered as the donor and acceptor respectively the temporal progression of the flux f passing through the cross section is calculated according to eqs 5 7 in these equations f 1 f 2 and f 2m represent the fluxes passing through the mesh cells and the maximum value of f 2 respectively the f 1 depends on the length of the cells interface relative to the flow transient along it the donor or the acceptor further the f 2 passes from the donor upstream cell harlow and welch 1965 hirt and nichols 1981 barkhudarov 2003 yao 2004 brethour 2009 marsooli and wu 2014 pourshahbaz et al 2017 2 2 turbulence modeling in the large eddy simulation les closure model the large scale turbulence structures are resolved within the computational grid while the small scale structures are evaluated through the sub grid scale sgs closure the model is time dependent and three dimensional likewise it provides more information about turbulence characteristics than the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models the effects of the small eddies in the computational grid are involved using the length l t filter length the size of the eddies containing the kinetic energy is greater than the filter length in eq 8 where the ν t c s and s

2 u i x j u j x i s i j 2 s i j s i j the sgs tensor values are calculated using eqs 9 and 10 the filter operation decomposes the fluid velocity into the unsolved and resolved components the fluctuations in flow characteristics are evaluated through the n st equations smagorinsky 1963 flow science 2012 kim et al 2017 2 3 discretizing the equations of motion the discrete form of eqs 1 4 is according to the flow 3d user manual 2012 the approximations of the acceleration and the viscosity have the second order precision of time and space all terminations of the momentum except the advection are evaluated through the standard central difference method in the discretization the time step is controlled through the courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability and convergence criteria eqs 11 13 based on the cfl condition the relation between the time step and length interval is according to u δ t δ x 1 parambath 2010 likewise based on the convergence criteria the iterations residual values e should be less than 0 001 e 0 001 in eq 13 α represents the weighting factor which is equal to zero in second order approximations the fluid can t flow and diffuse in more than one mesh cell whereas based on eq 13 because of the over smoothing of the solution the stability parameter α values are small hirt and nichols 1981 yao 2004 flow science 2012 11 δ t 0 45 min f δ x i a x u f δ y j a

boundary conditions are according to figs 1 3 and tables 1 1 3 the still water within the dam reservoir is introduced to the model employing the volume of fluid function f the other dimensions are proportional to the flume total length l t while the computational grid is of a non conforming variable type of rectangular cells in the non conforming mesh the resolution increases automatically near the boundaries and the blocks interfaces this type of the grid is appropriate for the physical domain including the regions that require a higher density of the cells nodes wang et al 2016 whereas raising the number of the mesh blocks leads to increase the calculations time and the storage space as well as the accuracy of the results the computational domain is divided into three distinct parts by mesh blocks as shown in fig 3 throughout the computational domain the firm boundaries including the rigid walls and bottom of the flume are considered as no slip conditions likewise the upper boundary z max is a symmetry condition it means the fluid slips free on that and the tangential shear stress is equal to zero further the free surface represents a boundary condition at the free surface the relative fluid pressure and the tangential stresses are equal to zero further through involving the stagnation pressure at the beginning point of the dam reservoir the fluid velocity in the upstream boundary is equal to zero likewise the continuative condition is imposed on the interface of two blocks to smoothed fluid entry and the exit 3 results and discussion the models were verified through the lobosky et al 2014 fraccarollo and toro 1995 as well as ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 dam break experiments tables 4 4 1 the sensitivity analysis of the modeling results was carried out on the mesh cells dimensions and turbulence closure models in this regard three cells sizes were selected equal to 10 20 and 40 mm the accuracy of the models in predicting the free surface height and the temporal variation of the flow depth was evaluated employing the nrmse in eq 14 x i exp x i mod x exp max and x exp min represent the experimental numerical maximum and minimum values of the x variable in table 4 1 the reverse grid spacing r k is calculated from eq 15 where the n yz 1 and n yz 2 represent the number of the mesh blocks cells within the plane yz vertical cross section in the models 1 and 2 respectively nguyen et al 2014 14 n r m s e i 1 n x i exp x i mod 2 x exp max x exp min 15 r k n y z 2 n y z 1 in table 4 1 the r k value is duplicated by doubling the mesh resolution δ y 2 δ y 1 12 6 2 likewise according to table 4 1 with 1 6 and 3 2 times the r k the processing time t cpu values are 2 4 and 12 3 frc1 frc3 and three and 25 times ozm1 ozm3 respectively one of the limitations of the standard vof method in free surface modeling is the fluid loss in numerical estimations of the momentum advection mampaey and xu 1995 and nguyen et al 2014 while the relation between the fluid loss and its volume in the computational domain has not been reported in previous studies yang et al 2018 nguyen et al 2014 marsooli and wu 2014 larocque et al 2013 further the average processing time for every mesh cell and the effect of the mesh quality on the simulation results has not been investigated in these researches therefore the above parameters are discussed in the present paper the average processing time for every cell and mesh quality play the key role in the computational costs and accuracy of modeling results respectively all simulations were carried out employing the intel i7 3 6 ghz processor with four cores total eight threads in table 6 the average simulation time t s and the number of cells n c are equal to 22 9h and 1139162 this time is equal to 824 seconds for every 0 1s of the t s shakibaeinia and jin 2011 and 0 073 second for every cell n c 1 according to tables 4 1 5 2 while the mesh resolution is one third the nrmse value increases about 0 07 at point 0 frc1 frc3 dam site the optimize meshes cells sizes are selected based on the nrmse and the truncation error caused by grid resolution ε values eq 16 the ε value equals to zero means the grid is independent of the cells size where ε ϕ g i and ϕ represent the truncation error through the resolution the grid s independent and dependent results respectively wei et al 2006 robinson et al 2015 in eq 16 assuming ϕ equals to nrmse the ε values are evaluated according to eq 16 1 marsooli and wu 2014 larocque et al 2013 compared the les and k ε performance in numerical modeling the dam break free surface evolution however the accuracy of other turbulence models like the k w and rng have evaluated seldom in table 4 2 the results from the les show a better agreement with the experimental data than other models except at t s 0 37s indeed the les predicts the free surface evolution more accurate than other models in table 4 3 the results predicted by les and k ε are close however the les shows a better match with the measurement than the k w and rng in the near field points 0 4a accordingly the les satisfactory predicts the temporal variation of the dam break flow depth these results are consistent with those of obtained by larocque et al 2013 and özgökmen et al 2007 in tables 5 1 5 2 the grid independent condition is fulfilled in minimum cells sizes equal to 2 cm however this condition is not satisfied with the ozm1 ozm3 models in these cases the accuracy of results depends on the mesh resolution therefore in this study the minimum mesh cells size in all models is equal to 2 cm table 6 in vof code of the flow 3d there are two sources of the fluid loss f li first the kinetic energy loss because of changing the flow direction in the boundaries second the poor approximations of the momentum advection particularly in the channel boundaries mampaey and xu 1995 therefore the mean fluid loss values are calculated through the weighted averaging eq 17 where f li v fi and f l represent the loss percentage the calculated volume of fluid in a mesh block and weighted average of fluid loss 16 ε ϕ g i ϕ 16 1 ε n r m s e g i n r m s e while the f li and v fi values are evaluated directly and displayed as the output results further the maximum and minimum values of the fluid loss f l belong to the s1 0 3 and s1 3 models table 6 it can conclude that the fluid loss would approximately increase by increment the fluid volume in the computational domain the convergence and accuracy of the simulations strongly depend on the size of the mesh cells and aspect ratios of the x y and z directions 17 f l i 1 n v f i f l i i 1 n v f i in this way the maximum aspects ratio x y y z and z x as well as the maximum inter block cell sizes should not surpass the three and two respectively flow science 2012 according to table 6 these conditions are fulfilled in this study therefore the quality of the meshes is satisfactory in all modeling in table 6 increasing the total number of the mesh cells leads to enhancing the processing time t cpu indeed the t cpu values are about four times by 3 8 times the number of mesh cells in the s1 5 s1 6 however this ratio depends on the mesh cells size the dimensions of the computational domain and its geometric complexity in fig 4 there is a satisfactory agreement between the calculated and the experimental results indeed the model provides a superior efficiency in accurately predicting the free surface profile flow advancing distances and the run up over the downstream wall without the wave breaking down in fig 5 m1 m6 there is a little difference between the experimental and calculated results however the model overestimates the temporal variation of the flow depth near field points 0 and point 4a at the initial stages t s 1 s in contrast in m3 m6 m9 cases the model underestimates and overestimates the temporal variation of the flow depth in the far field point 8a at the initial and the middle to last stages respectively in m7 m9 with increasing the cell dimensions the model efficiency decreases in predicting the temporal variations of the flow depth especially in the dam site point 0 in all simulations the water column is completely overturned through its weight whereas there is no gate at the dam site ye et al 2016 demonstrated the flow forehead velocity in the with gate case is less than the without gate further in real dam failures there is a lag between the formation of the dam break bore and its propagation over the downstream channel szymkiewicz 2010 therefore the without gate case is an approximate assumption of studying the dam break flow characteristics in the cases m1 m4 there is a good agreement with the experimental at very initial stage in m2 m3 m6 and m9 the model underestimates the jet body maximum height jet crest however the model overestimates the jet body advancing distances of the cases m1 m5 m8 it means the flow velocity is higher than the experimental results the free surface fluctuations in the jet body region in experimental are more than modeling results in cases m3 m6 m9 at t s 1 42s in all simulations the dam break unsteady flow is formed at t g 0 1s lauber and hager 1998 and vischer and hager 1998 demonstrated the dam break considered as instantaneous if the gate completely removed from the domain during t g 2 h 0 g and t g 1 5625 h 0 g respectively soares frazão and zech 2007 in this study both of these criteria are fulfilled at every initial water levels h 0 0 375 0 75m t g 0 1s 0 244 0 282 0 345s the effects of the dam reservoir length on velocity and vorticity distribution across the flow field have not been reported in previous studies mohapatra et al 2004 crespo et al 2009 yang et al 2010 yang et al 2018 bukreev and gusev 2005 cheng et al 2012 and khayyer and gotoh 2010 in fig 6 s1 0 1 2 the flow advancing distance and velocity are increased by increment the reservoir initial water level the maximum and minimum velocities belong to the forehead region and the reservoir beginning point respectively indeed there is a significant gradient between the flow forehead and back regions this velocity gradient causes the curving of the free surface profile and non hydrostatic distribution of the pressure mohapatra et al 2004 and yang et al 2010 indicated the pressure distribution is non hydrostatic and nonlinear in the forehead region the prim reason is the rapid variations in the flow depth and the water air transient interface further this curvature is reduced and the free surface profile is smoothed with increasing the initial water level at the moment t s 4s the reason is the flow velocity and the kinetic energy are attenuated during the middle to last stages t s 3 10 s likewise the velocity vectors are distributed over the horizontal direction parallel to the flume bottom zech and aleixo 2011 the calculated velocity peak values obtain less than the ritter 1892 analytical solution u f 2 gh 0 however the asymptotic value u f 2 m s being acceptable to all cases further the flow forehead velocity is about 1 4 times by increasing the initial water level from h 0 w 4 to h 0 w 2 table 1 1 in fig 6 s1 1 s1 3 s1 4 the increasing of the reservoir length does not affect the flow velocity significantly according to yang et al 2018 the dam break flow over the dry bed consists of two distinct stages very initial and the relatively stable the dam reservoir water column is overturned under the gravity force during time interval t s 0 0 1s the velocity vertical component w is dominant and the static pressure values are maximum near the flume bed the free surface profile in the dam reservoir and the forehead regions is of the convex shape whereas it s a concave shaped in the distance between these two regions in the second stage t s 0 1s the free surface curvature decreases and the profile is gradually placed parallel to the bottom likewise the horizontal velocity component u is dominant in contrast in the current study the effects of the gravity force on the free surface evolution is significant as shown in fig 6 at t s 0 5s the free surface curvature is close to the vertical line during very initial stages t s 0 0 5s further the initial water level is determinant factor of changing remarkably the flow velocity in fig 6 s1 5 1 6 changing the reservoir width do not affect the flow velocity the possible reason is that with raising the reservoir width the downstream channel width is increased equally therefore based on the continuity principal there is no difference in the velocity and flow rate of these cases in fig 6 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the dam break sudden impact to the tail water leads to mixing and instant formation of a tongue like jet according to yang et al 2018 and crespo et al 2009 the tongue like jet is formed if the downstream channel to the reservoir depth ratio r w h 0 h wt is less than 0 4 in contrast for r w 0 4 the flow propagates to the downstream with the mushroom shape in this research the r w values in all cases are smaller than 0 4 r w1 0 05 0 5 r w2 0 1 0 5 r w3 0 15 0 5 whereas the free surface profile is standing in the jet formation place at the initial stage ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 demonstrated the possible reason for this deformation is the drags resistance of the tail water against the dam break flow propagation while the flow velocity gradient is remarkable in this region the jet propagation to the downstream causes the mixing of the dam break flow to the tail water during t s 0 5 4s as a result the free surface height is reduced while the profile curvature is modified in the upstream of the jet likewise there is a significant fluctuation in the free surface in the jet body mohapatra et al 2004 indicated there are significant undulations in flow forehead region in the case r 0 4 however the free surface fluctuations are observed in the cases r 0 4 fig 6 s1 0 1 1 0 3 indeed the profile is divided into the three distinct parts of the downstream jet body and its upstream at the downstream the profile is approximately smooth and unchanged because there is no mixing in this region the flow regime is subcritical because of the low velocity fig 8 s1 0 1 1 0 3 in the jet body region the flow velocity is higher than its upstream and downstream further the flow regime is transient and near critical depending on the r values the regime is subcritical to near or supercritical to near critical r 0 1 or r 0 1 indeed the jet advances towards the flume outlet as a moving positive bore over the tail water based on the stoker solution 1948 1957 the flow is uniform in the jet body region further the flow velocity is proportional to u s t 2 2 1 75 h w t 0 25 pritchard and hogg 2002 however the significant free surface fluctuations in the jet body region fig 5 1 6 are in contradiction with the uniform flow assumption likewise according to fig 6 s1 0 1 s1 0 3 the stoker solution is underestimate the jet body progression u st 0 4 0 11 and 0 09 m s in the cases h wt 0 05 0 1 0 15m respectively the velocity decreases from the flow forehead region to the end point of the jet body in the upstream the flow obtains maximum velocity in the region near the jet body downstream interface whereas the reservoir outflow velocity is less and more than the jet body and the downstream respectively the flow regime is subcritical like the downstream of the jet however the velocity is increased from the beginning point of the dam reservoir to the jet body the gradient of the free surface profile in this region is greater than the jet body and the downstream likewise the flow velocity is increased at the flume outlet by raising the h wt values r 0 1 0 33 the possible reasons are that the inertia force is increased at the flume outlet by increment the tail water level consequently the kinetic energy resulting from the jet impact to the downstream region is raised by increment the initial water level therefore the flow velocity is increased at the flume outlet further in fig 6 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the flow velocity is reduced during very initial to the middle stages of the dam break t s 0 5 3s by increment the ratio r yang et al 2018 and crespo et al 2009 numerically demonstrated the bottom friction is the primary dissipation mechanism in the dam break over the wet bed further the bed resistance is attenuated with raising the tail water depth yang et al 2018 whereas the resistance force induced by the bottom friction is negligible compared with the tail water drag in the initial to the middle stages fig 6 s1 0 1 1 s1 0 3 3 in fig 6 1 s1 0 1 6 the low density counterclockwise vorticities negative values are formed near field in the vicinity of the flume walls in these regions the resistance induced by friction causes the transition from the laminar to the turbulent further the vertical velocity gradient leads to formation the wall s and free shear layers over the rigid boundaries and the flow forehead respectively likewise the hairpin vortices are formed within the forehead region the vorticities have positive clockwise spin in this region according to bukreev and gusev 2005 and cheng et al 2012 sudden removing the sluice gate leads to formation the vorticities in the near field at the early stages in contrast in the present study there is not any gate in the dam site further the dam break flow is generated and developed under free overturning of the reservoir water therefore no vorticities are formed near the dam site in the dry bed cases in fig 6 1 s1 0 1 s1 0 3 the vortices are mixed severely along the jet body light color whereas the hairpin vortices are formed at the jet body downstream interface dark color according to khayyer and gotoh 2010 the significant vorticities are appeared in the dam break flow tail water interface at the early stages the possible reason is the resistance of the downstream still water against the dam break flow evolution in fig 7 s1 0 1 2 the free surface height is raised by increment the dam reservoir water level further its value in the case h 0 0 75m is about twice the h 0 0 375 m at the moment t s 2s therefore the free surface height has a direct connection to the dam reservoir water level h 0 during the initial to the middle stages further the free surface height at the moment t s 2s is about half of the t s 4s indeed the h value is about halved by doubling the time t s otherwise the free surface curvature is modified during time t s 2 4s whereas it changes from convex to concave from the beginning point to the flume outlet deng et al 2018 indicated the free surface height of the water air transitional interface forehead region increases faster in the initial than the later stages however the free surface in the forehead region includes a steep slope close to the vertical line according to dressler 1954 and whitham 1955 the main reason for this deformation is the flow resistance resulting in the bottom and walls roughness in fig 7 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the free surface height is raised by increment the reservoir length the obvious reason is that the reservoir elongated across the x direction without changing the l t value further the difference between the h values of l r 7 5m and the other cases is significant in downstream of the dam x 5 15 m at t s 2s however this difference is remarkable in the reservoir x 0 5m at t s 4s in fig 7 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the free surface height doesn t change by increment the reservoir width this result is contradicting to those experimentally obtained by khankandi et al 2012 experimental results they showed that the flow velocity cross waves propagation and the water levels increase by increment the reservoir width whereas in present study the effect of the reservoir width on the flow evolution is significant if there is a difference between the dam section in upstream and the downstream in fig 7 s1 0 1 1 0 3 raising the r values leads to increase the free surface height of the upstream and downstream regions likewise it leads to the fluctuations in the jet body region it should be noted that the jet body is displaced to the dam reservoir by increasing the r values while the h values are the same in the x 4m and x 3m at t s 2s and t s 4s respectively the flow forehead advancing over the dry and wet beds has been compared seldom jánosi et al 2004 in fig 8 s1 0 1 2 the flow forehead advancing to the flume outlet x f is increased from very initial to the middle stages further the x f values are raised by increment the h 0 whereas the maximum advancing distance x fmax is about 1 45 times by doubling the h 0 values in fig 8 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the x f values in the cases l r 5m 7 5m are more than the l r 3 75m however there is no direct relationship between the x f and l r hunt 1984 showed that the advancing distance and the flow velocity are a function of the l r in this regard the swe solution asymptotically valid at x f 4l r in fig 8 s1 1 1 5 1 6 increasing the dam reservoir width does not affect the x f values according to deng et al 2018 the x f represents a significant factor affecting the free surface height and the shape of the water air transition interface indeed the resistance effects of the roughness on the dam break flow are raised by increment the x f values likewise the flow acceleration in the horizontal direction is larger than the vertical with increasing the x f values stansby et al 1998 the flow resistance causes the conversion of the kinetic energy to the potential and thermal near the rigid walls and the bottom surfaces therefore the h values are attenuated with the dam break flow advancing to the downstream in fig 8 s1 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 the x fmax value of the dry at the moment t s 2s is about 1 5 times the wet bed in the case of the h wt 0 15m further the x f values are reduced with increasing the r from 0 1 to 0 3 in fig 9 the dam break froude number is calculated according to relation f r v d a g d a v where the v da g and d av represent the depth averaged velocity the gravity acceleration and the average flow depth respectively flow science 2012 accurately calculating the froude number plays a significant role in the dynamic analysis laboratory modeling and time scaling of the dam break sequential events in fig 9 s1 0 1 2 raising the h 0 does not considerably affect the fr within the dam reservoir region x 0 5m however it causes the raising the fr values between the dam and the flume outlet the flow regime is subcritical critical and supercritical within the dam reservoir near field and the downstream channel respectively the dam break flow regime variation has been reported by yang et al 2018 nsom et al 2000 2018 and kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 however the froude number variations across the flow field have been reported quantitatively seldom soares frazão and zech 2008 and hooshyaripor et al 2017 they demonstrated the flow regime changes from the supercritical to subcritical in the downstream by the free surface evolution further the effects of the dam reservoir width as well as the tail water level on the fr values have not been studied to our knowledge in fig 9 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the fr is attenuated with increasing the dam reservoir length the reason is the flow depth is raised by increasing the l r values fig 6 s1 3 1 4 likewise the subcritical regime transits to the supercritical at the greater distances from the reservoir x 4 8m by increment the l r values in fig 9 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the fr does not change by increasing the reservoir width the reason is the dam reservoir width does not affect the flow velocity fig 6 s1 5 1 6 in fig 9 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the fr is increased by reducing the h wt because the downstream drag resistance force is raised by increment the h wt values the effect of the tail water and the time scaling of the dam break floods outflow and inflow hydrographs have not been profoundly evaluated in previous studies hooshyaripor et al 2017 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 and fraccarollo and toro 1995 however the accurate evaluation of the dam break outflow hydrographs and the depth is crucial in the flood mitigation programs further the river base flow represents a determinant factor in the downstream inflow hydrograph shape and temporal variation of the dam break flood depth accordingly the time scaling plays a significant role in the hazard analysis and the flood management actions in fig 10 s1 0 s1 0 3 the maximum reservoir outflow depth d changes remarkably during three distinct stages a very initial stage t s 0 0 5s the d values rapidly decrease by a steep slope the main reason is the vertical component of the flow acceleration is considerable because of overcoming the net gravity force water column weight whereas the d values are approximately halved likewise the kinetic energy values are significant during this stage b very initial to the middle stage the d values are relatively constant d eq the flow is developed along the horizontal direction more than the vertical further there is a relative balance between the kinetic and potential energies c the middle to last stage the d values attenuate gradually by a moderate gradient the potential energy overcomes on the kinetic one while the viscosity effects dominate the dam break flow likewise the flow regime changes from the supercritical to subcritical during the stages a to c in fig 10 s1 0 1 2 the d and t eq the duration corresponding to d eq values are increased and attenuated by raising the h 0 respectively indeed the duration of the equilibrium between the kinetic and potential energies is reduced by increment the h 0 it means the raising of the h 0 values causes the increasing the energy dissipation of the dam reservoir outflow however all depth diagrams are converged on each other at the stage c t s 5s 10s in fig 10 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the d values are raised by increment the l r during the stage c it s consistent with hooshyaripor et al 2017 experimental results likewise the d eq is the same in all cases d eq 0 2m all diagrams are converged on each other during t s 0 3s therefore the reservoir length has no effect on the d values during stages a and b in fig 10 s1 1 1 5 1 6 increasing the reservoir width w does not affect the d in fig 10 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the d is increased by raising the r in the case r 0 3 h wt 0 15m the d values are raised during t s 2 3s because of the jet progression within the dam reservoir in fig 11 the shapes of the dam reservoir outflow hydrographs are corresponding to fig 10 ones in all cases the outflow flux q increases by a high gradient and then decreases slightly during the stage a rising limb indeed the peak outflow flux q p is very transient the rising limbs are steep because of the sudden overturning of the water column at very initial stages further the period to reach the peak outflow flux t p is constant and equal to twice the instantaneous dam break time t g t p 2tg 0 2s therefore both the dam break initial conditions and the dam reservoir geometry do not affect the t p likewise the q values are constant equilibrium flow rate q e at the stage b whereas these are reduced gradually at the stage c recession limb in fig 11 s1 0 1 2 the outflow fluxes q q p and q e increase while the t eq decreases by increment the h 0 values likewise all hydrographs are converged on each other at the t s 5s the q values are about four times by doubling the h 0 in fig 11 s1 1 1 3 1 4 raising the l r does not affect the t p q p and q e however it leads to increase the t eq and decrease the falling limb length respectively accordingly the t eq values are about twice by doubling the l r indeed the flood flux recession occurs more rapidly by reducing the dam reservoir volume in fig 11 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the q p and q e values are about four times by doubling the reservoir width w whereas the t eq and the falling limb lengths are approximately attenuated by increment the w further the q p in the case of s1 6 w 3 3w 1 is about twice the s1 4 l r3 3lr 1 in fig 11 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the q p and q e are attenuated by increment the h wt the possible reason is raising the h wt values causes increasing the drag resistance force against the dam reservoir outflow therefore the dam reservoir outflow flux shows a slight decrement by increasing the h wt values in fig 12 all inflow hydrographs except the s1 0 1 1 0 3 are approximately bell shaped while there is not a constant inflow flux as q e in these cases because there is a base flow tail water in the downstream channel further the dam reservoir outflow reaches to the mesh block 3 about 1 s therefore the q values are equal to zero during initial stages t 0 1s in fig 12 s1 0 1 2 s1 1 1 3 1 4 and s1 1 1 5 1 6 the q p is raised by increment the h 0 l r and w respectively in fig 12 s1 0 1 2 the t p and the falling limb lengths are decreased and increased by raising the h 0 respectively the prime reason is that raising the h 0 leads to increase the inflow velocity and the flux values in fig 12 s1 1 1 3 1 4 raising the l r values causes reducing the inflow velocity therefore the t p and the flood recession flux are increased by increment the l r values in fig 12 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the flood recession flux is increased by raising the w while the t p values are relatively constant in fig 12 s1 0 1 1 0 3 the inflow hydrographs are not bell shaped indeed the tail water leads to lag the flood recession further the q e values are attenuated by increment the h wt in fig 13 s1 0 1 2 in all modeling cases the flow regime changes from the subcritical to supercritical from the top to down of the d c 2 3 e c it represents the linear relationship between the flow critical depth and the specific energy in a rectangular channel all diagrams are parabolic shaped while their vertex points do not intersect the d c 2 3 e c line the specific energy diagrams are displaced to the right side of the e s axis by increment the h 0 in fig 13 s1 1 1 3 1 4 and s1 1 1 5 1 6 the dam reservoir length and width do not have significant effects on the specific energy values at the moment t s 1s further the specific energy diagrams shapes are asymmetrical before the dam break the distribution of the water pressure in the dam reservoir is hydrostatic and the resistance shears forces values are negligible nsom et al 2000 2018 the dam break pressure forces applied to the downstream obstacles and flume the wall have been experimentally and numerically evaluated in the previous studied stoker 1948 soarez frazao and zech 2008 nsom et al 2000 2018 marsooli and wu 2014 lobovský et al 2014 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 ahmed et al 2018 whereas the resultant forces applied to the dam reservoir during the dam break have not been reported so far the fundamental importance of these forces is in calculating the dam reservoir dynamic response the flood routing and the outflow rates during the dam break in fig 14 the resultant shear force f s is increased by a steep slope during very initial to the middle stages respectively the possible reason is that the outflow velocity gradient is significant during very initial stages therefore the tangential and normal stresses are increased suddenly in the dam reservoir while the outflow velocity and then the stresses value are modified during the middle to last stages in fig 14 s1 0 1 2 the f s is increased by raising the h 0 while the duration of the maximum shears force t shmax is attenuated by increment the h 0 the diagrams s1 1 s1 3 are converged on each other at the moment t s 1s and t s 5s further the t shmax is increased by raising the l r the resultant shears force values are 0 001 times the pressure exerted on the dam reservoir the minimum shears force is related to the moments t s 0 still water and t s 10s in fig 14 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the f s and f smax are raised by increment the dam reservoir width indeed these values are four times with doubling the dam reservoir width w while the t shmax does not change in fig 14 s1 0 1 1 0 3 increasing the h wt leads to reduce the f s values likewise the f s values of the dry is about four times in the wet bed chanson 2010 indicated the f smax and f smin are applied to the flow forehead and the dam reservoir beginning point respectively while the shear force is exponentially attenuated from the peak value to the zero between these two points in fig 15 the resultant pressure forces are raised during very initial to the middle stages while these values are attenuated from the middle to the last stages fraccarollo and toro 1995 and nsom et al 2000 2018 demonstrated the pressure forces induced the water overturning overcome the friction resistance of the initial stages while the friction and viscosity caused to attenuate the pressure forces during the middle to the last stages likewise the dam break flow is three dimensional during very initial stage because of the large vertical acceleration component however the dam break flow is nearly one dimensional during the middle to last stages the maximum resultant pressure forces are applied to the bottom of the dam reservoir in fig 15 s1 0 1 2 the f p and t pmax values are increased by raising the h 0 in fig 15 s1 1 1 3 1 4 the case l r 7 5m obtains the highest f p values of all diagrams further there is a slight difference between f p in the cases l r 3 75m and l r 5m in fig 15 s1 1 1 5 1 6 the f p values are increased by raising the dam reservoir width while the reservoir width has not a significant effect on t pm in fig 15 s1 0 1 1 0 3 raising the h wt causes increasing the f p values while in all diagrams the f p values are constant during t s 2 5s likewise the presence of the tail water level increases the t pm values 4 conclusion in the current study the effects of the initial water level the dam reservoir length and width were evaluated on the dam break flow over the dry and wet beds the standard vof method was employed to track the free surface evolution hirt and nichols 1981 while the turbulence characteristics were calculated through the les closure model the modeling results were validated using the previous dam break experiments lobovský et al 2014 fraccarollo and toro 1995 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 the significant results of this paper represent in the two distinct parts of dam break over the dry and wet beds as follows over the dry bed raising the dam reservoir water level causes an increase the free surface height the advancing distance and the flow velocity likewise it leads to increase the downstream specific energy the outflow maximum depth and the hydrograph the resultant shears and pressure forces whereas it leads to relative decline of the froude number in the middle to last stages raising the reservoir length leads to attenuate the dam break froude number during the middle to last stages however it causes an increase the free surface height the outflow maximum depth and the hydrograph during the middle to last stages nevertheless it does not affect the downstream specific energy further it leads to raise the resultant shears forces in the dam reservoir increasing the reservoir width does not affect the free surface height the advancing distance and the flow velocity the temporal variations of the dam break froude number the reservoir outflow depth as well as the downstream specific energy however it increases the dam outflow rate the resultant shears and pressure forces the positive and low density negative vorticities are formed within the flow forehead region and near field in the vicinity of the flume walls respectively further the free surface height and curvature are modified rapidly in the dam break over the wet bed therefore three distinct parts are apparently distinguished including the downstream the body and the upstream of the flow jet in the downstream the dam break flow does not mix with the water column therefore the shape of the free surface profile is completely smooth and it s almost horizontal the jet body is formed in the distance between the dam break flow and the downstream tail water in this area the velocity value is higher than the upstream and downstream tail water further the flow regime is transient and near critical the flow velocity is decreased from the jet body downstream interface to its end point in the upstream the regime is subcritical because of low velocity the free surface profile curvature of this area is higher than the jet body and the downstream therefore over the wet bed increasing the tail water level reduces the flow velocity during the initial to the middle stages further it leads to increase the free surface height the free surface fluctuations in the jet body region as well as the maximum depth of the dam reservoir outflow in return it causes an attenuate in the outflow hydrograph and the resultant shears and pressure forces it s satisfactory concluded that the vof along with the les turbulence closure model obtain high accuracy in predicting the dam break flow characteristics the modeling efficiency strongly depends on the mesh resolution however the parallel processing could effectively decrease the computational efforts further the mutual effects of the mixed layer sediments bed the substrate penetration and fluid leakage as well as the channel shape factor are not included in the simulations accordingly the model s performance could test for the numerical simulation of the dam break floods in the large reaches of the river for higher generalization all modeling can be carried out in the case of the dam break evolution over the flood plain as a future work the simultaneous effects of the bed vegetation porosity and permeability complex geometry and flood plain obstacles can be included in the dam break over the wet bed likewise the air entrainment flow turbulence energy dissipation and the boundary layer development near field can be studied in the dam break over the rough and mobile beds the hydraulics effects of the river tributaries the diversion dams and the shore protection structures can be studied on the dam break floods acknowledgements authors wish to acknowledge the bu ali sina university of hamedan iran that in the framework of this project made available the processing facilities where all modelings have been done 
22571,roll amplitudes of parametric roll in regular head waves are sometimes underestimated by motion calculations including ikeda s roll damping prediction method especially for the case of the large roll amplitude caused by high wave height in this case generally the ship has significant relative draught changing because of its heave and pitch it may be said that the effects of the change in relative draught on roll damping is significant however in ikeda s prediction method the bilge keel component which is the largest component of total roll damping does not take the effects of draught

damping affect significantly roll near its resonance frequency as one of prediction methods of the viscous effects ikeda prediction method ikeda et al 1978a b is well known however it is pointed out by tanaka et al 1981 that the method overestimates the roll damping when the method is applied to a ship with shallow draught and the tendency is more significant as kg height of the center of gravity of the ship is lower moreover it is explained that the reasons of the overestimation are that the interactions of waves made by hull and bilge keels decrease the wave making damping component and the free surface effects decrease the size of vortexes shed by bilge keels the previous study by katayama and matsuoka 2017 point out that the effects of free surface kg and underwater hull aspects h 0 b 2d the half breadth to draught ratio are not included in measured data for developing the prediction method then the characteristics of the roll damping of a ship with shallow draught and low kg is investigated to improve the bilge keel damping component of ikeda s prediction method by multiplying a correction factor obtained from the difference between the results of ikeda s prediction method and measured ones however that is not enough because the correction does not consider the hydrodynamic mechanism of the bilge keel roll damping component necessarily ikeda s prediction method consists theoretical formulas and empirical formulas based on hydrodynamic phenomenon with empirical coefficients according to measured data therefore it may be significant for accuracy of estimation by ikeda s prediction method to improve on the empirical formula or coefficients included by the method in this study in order to improve the bilge keel damping component of ikeda s prediction method as a first step the characteristics of the correction coefficient f to take account of the increment of flow velocity at the bilge by h 0 is investigated by cfd in recent years the studies on roll damping using cfd have been carried out actively and continuously e g yeung et al 1998 2013 yeung and ananthakrishnan 1992 korpus and falzarano 1997 miller et al 2002 wilson et al 2006 wanderley et al 2007

acting on bilge keels attached on the 2d cylinder with forced sinusoidal rolling is calculated by cfd and the results are compared with the measured results by ikeda et al 1977 and the drag forces acting on the bilge keels attached on the 2d hull without free surface which has systematically changed h 0 and the area coefficient σ area of section divided by bd is calculated by cfd an improved correction coefficient f is proposed 2 normal force damping of bilge keel of ikeda s method in ikeda s method the bilge keel component b bk of roll damping coefficient is divided into 2 components 1 b b k b n b s where b n is the normal force component due to the normal force acting on the bilge keels and b s is the hull pressure component due to the pressure on the hull surface created by the bilge keels the normal force component b n is deduced from the experimental results of oscillating flat plates by ikeda et al 1976 1978a the drag coefficient c d of an oscillating flat plate depends on the kc number keulegan carpenter number from the measurement of the drag coefficient c d from free roll decay tests of an ellipsoid with and without bilge keels and measured drag coefficients c d of the bilge keels is in good agreement with the ones of the oscillating flat plates the prediction formula for the drag coefficient of the normal force of a pair of the bilge keels proposed by ikeda is the following 2 c d 22 5 b b k π r ϕ a f 2 40 22 5 k c 2 40 where b bk is the breadth or height of the bilge keel ϕ a radian is roll amplitude r is the distance from the roll axis to the hull surface attached on the bilge keel and kc is keulegan carpenter number when form of a cross section is circle f in eq 2 is 1 0 the equivalent linear sectional damping coefficient b n is 3 b n 8 3 π ρ r 3 ω ϕ a b b k f 2 c d where ω is roll angular frequency and f is the correction factor to take account of the increment of flow velocity at the bilge caused by hull form determined from the experiments 4 f 1 0 0 3 e 160 1 σ where σ is area coefficient of the cross section σ area of section divided by bd b and d are breadth and draught in order to determine the empirical formula of f the following experiment and analysis are carried out by ikeda et al 1977 1979 for the comparison between predicted data and experimental ones ikeda et al 1977 1979 assumed that the roll damping coefficient b bk due to bilge keels can be obtained by subtracting the damping for a naked hull from one for the hull with bilge keels a forced roll tests in horizontal plane are carried out to avoid the free surface effects and the formula of f is fitted by comparisons between predicted and measured data for four 2d models with various bilge radius shown in table 1 as this table shows half breadth to draught ratio h 0 of models is near 1 23 that is average value of cargo ships at that time 3 drag force of bilge keel attched on 2d cylinder 3 1 setup of cfd there are various turbulence models such as the k ε model the k ω model and the reynolds stress model rsm in this study the k ε model is employed based on yildiz and katayama 2017 because its calculation speed is fast and the flow separation point is clear and it is the tip of bilge keel in this study the flow separation means vortex shedding the computational condition of cfd are shown in table 2 table 2 is decided by referring yildiz and katayama 2017 fig 1 shows the computational model used in this study there are two mesh zones the moving fluid zone mfz and the remaining stationary zone rsz mfz is rotated with the 2d cylinder around the roll axis in order not to disturb the region around the 2d cylinder there is the interface between rsz and mfz to avoids mesh deforming issues the both zones are connected using mesh overlaying technique as a result of mesh division the number of elements is 440 000 the boundary conditions are also shown in fig 1 the circular outer boundary on rsz is located far enough from the 2d cylinder so that it can be assumed that the velocity and pressure field generated by the oscillating the 2d cylinder are not affected by the outer boundary the calculation domain is actually 3d and thickness of domain is thin in order to calculate quickly the boundary condition of surfaces of two plates sandwiching the domain is free slip the boundary condition of the 2d cylinder is non slip to simulate 2 dimensional flow very thin cells are employed and the number of mesh in depth direction is 1 the effect of gravity is not considered in this model the calculated conditions of forced roll test are shown in table 3 fig 1 also shows the bilge keel of the 2d cylinder model the radius of the cylinder is r 0 15m the bilge keel is attached on a line passing through the center of roll the height and thickness of the bilge keel are b bk 0 01m and t bk 0 001m and it is shown in table 4 this analysis model is constructed based on the experiment conducted by ikeda et al 1976 1978a mfz is forced sinusoidal rolling and the normal force acting on the bilge keel is calculated by integrating the pressure distribution on the bilge keel 3 2 calculated result the forced roll angle ϕ t is defined by 5 ϕ t ϕ a sin ω t here f t denotes the time history of the calculated force under the forced sine roll and it can be expressed as eq 6 by using fourier series 6 f t f 0 n 1 f n sin n ω t ε n then the equivalent linear amplitude of force component in proportion to roll angular velocity can be expressed as follow 7 f f 1 sin ε 1 in the following sections f is called the amplitude of drag the roll angleϕ and the calculated force f is as shown in fig 2 the model is moving transiently for first two seconds but after that it moves sine rolling the drag coefficient c d is obtained from eq 8 with calculated drag acting on a bilge keel 8 c d f 1 2 ρ s b k r ϕ a ω 2 where s bk is the projection area of bilge keel ϕ a is roll amplitude and ω is roll angular frequency fig 3 shows comparison between c d proposed by ikeda et al 1976 1978a with measured data and the calculated results by cfd shown by dot line the calculated results are slightly bigger than ikeda s empirical formula shown by solid line ikeda et al 1976 1978a obtains the drag acting on bilge keel by subtracting the damping of a naked hull from that of the hull with bilge keel based on the assumption that frictional damping component of the naked hull and the hull with bilge keels are the same fig 4 shows calculated shear stress on hull surface of a naked hull and the hull with bilge keel by cfd at the moment when roll velocity is maximum this figure shows that these are not the same and it means that frictional damping components of the naked hull and the hull with bilge keel are not the same therefore the drag is re obtained according to the analysis way of ikeda et al 1976 1978a fig 5 shows the comparison between the re obtained results shown by dot dash line and the results shown in fig

factor f in the discussion f does not consider the effects of h 0 half breadth to draught ratio and the free surface effects but only σ area coefficient in this section in order to be applicable ikeda s method in recent wide breadth and shallow draught ships a forced roll test for these hull shapes is carried out using cfd in the calculation the effects of h 0 and σ on f are investigated to improve f 4 1 setup of cfd fig 6 shows a domain of calculation and a model in this model the rotating body is made by the upper semicircle and the lower half part in lower half part ship model under draught with bilge keel is modelled the bilge keel is attached on a line passing through the center of roll to investigate the effect of bilge keel and hull shape the lower half is changed from the analysis model used in the previous section the analysis model is very thin in thick direction as described in the same way as previous section as a result of mesh division the number of elements is 570 000 the gravity is not considered the rolling motion is forcibly applied to the hull as same as the previous analysis the k ε model is also employed in this analysis as the turbulence model the roll axis is the center of the circle mfz is forced sinusoidal rolling and the normal force acting on the bilge keel is calculated by integrating the pressure distribution on the bilge keel table 5 shows the particulars of model under draught and table 6 shows the computational condition of cfd these conditions follow the conditions of ikeda et al experiment 4 2 characteristics of c d and f fig 7 shows the calculated drag coefficients by cfd a dotted line indicates the drag coefficient of the bilge keel on a 2d cylinder and 4 marks indicate the drag coefficients of the bilge keels on 2d rectangles with the same bilge radius and 4 different h 0 whose area coefficient is not the same but almost same as shown in table 5 from this figure it is found that the drag coefficients of the bilge keels on 2d rectangles decrease according to increase of kc number as same as the drag coefficient of the bilge keel on a 2d cylinder and the drag coefficients of the bilge keels on 2d rectangles decrease according to increase of h 0 fig 8 shows the effects of roll period on the drag coefficient from this figure it is also found that there is not significant effects of roll period on c d fig 9 shows the correction factor obtained from eq 6 by using data shown in fig 6 9 f c d 1 k c c d 0 k c where c d0 kc is the drag coefficient of bilge keel on a 2d cylinder shown in fig 7 c d1 kc is the drag coefficients of bilge keels on 2d rectangles shown in fig 6 f is a correction factor of flow velocity at bilge caused by hull form from this figure it is noted that f increases according to decrease of h 0 and f is almost constant for change of kc number 4 3 modification of f from the results in the section 4 2 it is noted that the correction factor f has the effects of h 0 in this section the f is modified to take account the effects of h 0 fig 10 shows the correction factors f obtained from eq 6 by using the calculated drag coefficients of the bilge keels on 2d rectangles shown in table 6 in the section 2 it is already explained how to decide eq 4 which is the empirical formula of the f by ikeda et al 1977 1979 eq 4 is fitted by comparisons between predicted and measured value for four 2d models with various bilge radius whose h 0 is near 1 23 then by using the calculated results shown in fig 10 the ratios of the f for various h 0 to f for h 0 1 23 are obtained and the ratios are shown in fig 11 from this figure it is found that the ratio is constant in spite of area coefficient σ and the relation between the ratio and h 0 is obtained from this figure and the relation is shown in fig 12 and the relation is expressed by the following formula 10 g h 0 0 35 h 0 0 75 where g h 0 is the correction factor of the f and f g h 0 is modified correction factor 4 4 modified ikeda s method in the subsection 4 3 the correction factor g h 0 of the f is proposed as eq 10 in the process of obtaining g h 0 the effects of the water surface are not taken into account and the height of roll center is d by the way in ikeda s method the height of roll center is expressed by kg generally it means that the roll axis of the motion equation is defined as the center of gravity fig 13 shows comparisons between the estimated bilge keel component by modified ikeda s method and measured results by katayama and matsuoka 2017 in this figure the results by ikeda s original method are also shown it should be noted that the original and the modified ikeda s methods consider the position and angle of the bilge keel by the method presented to ikeda and katayama 1994 from this figure the modified ikeda s method is better than the original method however the modification is not enough accuracy to express the effect of h 0 for different kg and also the effects of amplitude at shallow draught because the modification does not consider the effects of kg and the free surface it is future works to include these effects on the correction factor f 5 conclusions in this study in order to improve bilge keel damping component the characteristics of the correction coefficient f to take account of the increment of flow velocity at the bilge by hull shape is investigated by cfd star ccm the following conclusions are obtained 1 the calculated drag coefficients of the bilge keel on a 2d cylinder by cfd is slightly larger than the value of ikeda s empirical formula regardless of kc number however its characteristics is similar 2 the drag coefficients of the bilge keels on 2d rectangles with the same bilge radius and 4 different h 0 decreases according to increase of kc number as same as the drag coefficient of the bilge keel on a 2d cylinder and the drag coefficients of the bilge keels on 2d rectangles decrease according to increase of h 0 and the drag coefficients are not significant effects of roll period 3 the correction factor f increases according to decrease of h 0 and the f is almost constant for change of kc number 4 in order to take account of the effects of h 0 on the f the f is modified and it is confirmed that the modified ikeda s method is in better agreement with the measured results than the original method which considers the location and angle of the bilge keel however the modification is not enough to express the effect of h 0 for different kg which means the height of roll center and also the effects of large amplitude at shallow draught because the modification does not consider the effects of kg and the free surface in the future work the modifications which consider the effects of the free surface and kg will be carried out to take enough accuracy for large roll amplitude shallow draught and high kg cases acknowledgements some parts of this research were carried out as joint research with classnk 
22571,roll amplitudes of parametric roll in regular head waves are sometimes underestimated by motion calculations including ikeda s roll damping prediction method especially for the case of the large roll amplitude caused by high wave height in this case generally the ship has significant relative draught changing because of its heave and pitch it may be said that the effects of the change in relative draught on roll damping is significant however in ikeda s prediction method the bilge keel component which is the largest component of total roll damping does not take the effects of draught as the effects of draught there are at least two related significant effects on the bilge keel roll damping component not fully considers for developing ikeda s prediction method they are the effects

improve bilge keel damping component the characteristics of the correction coefficient f to take account of the increment of flow velocity at the bilge by hull shape is investigated by cfd star ccm the following conclusions are obtained 1 the calculated drag coefficients of the bilge keel on a 2d cylinder by cfd is slightly larger than the value of ikeda s empirical formula regardless of kc number however its characteristics is similar 2 the drag coefficients of the bilge keels on 2d rectangles with the same bilge radius and 4 different h 0 decreases according to increase of kc number as same as the drag coefficient of the bilge keel on a 2d cylinder and the drag coefficients of the bilge keels on 2d rectangles decrease according to increase of h 0 and the drag coefficients are not significant effects of roll period 3 the correction factor f increases according to decrease of h 0 and the f is almost constant for change of kc number 4 in order to take account of the effects of h 0 on the f the f is modified and it is confirmed that the modified ikeda s method is in better agreement with the measured results than the original method which considers the location and angle of the bilge keel however the modification is not enough to express the effect of h 0 for different kg which means the height of roll center and also the effects of large amplitude at shallow draught because the modification does not consider the effects of kg and the free surface in the future work the modifications which consider the effects of the free surface and kg will be carried out to take enough accuracy for large roll amplitude shallow draught and high kg cases acknowledgements some parts of this research were carried out as joint research with classnk 
22572,internal solitary waves were generated in a density stratified two layer fluid a cylindrical pile composed of five sections was arranged throughout the water depth the flow field induced by internal solitary wave was measured by applying piv technique the forces on three of the sections which were in different layers or at different depth in the same layer were obtained based on the experimental data of flow field and forces the hydrodynamic coefficients of c d and c m were calculated for each cylinder section the variation trend of the coefficients with re and newly defined kc were obtained the flow field information load characteristics and hydrodynamic coefficients are greatly different between the upper and lower layers and almost the same at different depth in the same layer it is suggested to select different empirical coefficients when calculating internal solitary wave force on the structure parts in different layers besides the variation trend of hydrodynamic coefficient under the condition of internal solitary wave has some similarities to that under the condition of combined wave current flow keywords internal solitary wave model test flow field wave force hydrodynamic coefficients 1 introduction internal solitary wave isw which is frequently observed in the ocean ostrovsky and stepanyants 1989 stanton and ostrovsky 1998 ramos et al 2009 li et al 2011 li and farmer 2011 has aroused widespread concern around the world due to its great harm to the offshore structures a considerable number of accidents caused by internal waves have been reported cai and gan 2001 ebbesmeyer et al 1991 circular cylinder is the main form of offshore structures such as the spar columns of tension leg platform tlp and the riser system consequently knowledge of properties of internal solitary waves and the loads they may cause on the circular cylinder is of great significance for offshore oil and gas exploitation projects isws are gravity waves exiting at the interface of two flow layers having different densities they are reported to have quite large amplitudes up to 170 m lien et al 2014 alford et al 2015 chen m et al 2017 and may locally introduce strong varying currents in the full depth of the ocean the induced current flow in opposite directions in the two layers and the value of velocity is different along the depth of the water choi and camassa 1999 camassa et al 2006 morison formula was introduced to calculate the internal wave load as the wave length is very large with respect to the horizontal size of the offshore structures cai et al 2003 afterwards the internal wave load on cylindrical piles were calculated and studied cai et al 2008 du et al 2007 xie et al 2010 2011 it was demonstrated that the internal soliton caused huge horizontal force and torque on the structures in the above papers the researchers had chosen the hydrodynamic coefficients which are important empirical parameters in morison formula based on the surface wave principle recently the coefficients were researched under the condition of internal solitary wave huang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 2018 in the previous literature the study of isw load characteristic has been mainly focused on the whole structure and the same coefficients have been selected for the whole structure no matter for the part in the upper layer or the lower layer however on account of the different characteristics of the flow at different depth especially in the different layers there may be some differences for internal solitary wave force and hydrodynamic coefficients along the depth these differences are crucial when analyzing the dynamic response of ocean structures which are across the interface especially for the flexible risers which work in the full depth of the water the different magnitudes of isw force on the cylinder segments at different depth have been preliminarily studied wang et al 2016 it is worthwhile to conduct an experiment to detailedly investigate the different characteristics of internal soliton load and hydrodynamic coefficients on the structure parts at different depth in this paper an experiment was conducted with internal solitary waves propagating in a two layer fluid a cylindrical pile composed of five sections was arranged throughout the water depth both the load and the hydrodynamic coefficients for the sections which were in different layers or at different depth in the same layer are studied comparatively the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief description of experimental set up in section 3 the analytical method of hydrodynamic coefficients is described section 4 presents the experimental results including internal wave profiles instantaneous velocities horizontal forces on the cylinders and the hydrodynamic coefficients finally the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 experimental set up this experiment was carried out in the stratified flow and internal wave flume in the physical ocean laboratory at ocean university of china a sketch of this experiment is presented in fig 1 the flume is 15 m long and with a cross section of 0 35 m wide by 0 6 m high a two layer fluid consisting of two brine water layers with different densities was prepared by using the classical two bucket method the lighter water with a density of ρ 1 was injected into the flume to a desired depth then the heavier water of ρ 2 was injected slowly and carefully beneath the lighter layer in this way the pycnocline was fairly thin the thickness of the upper layers was h 1 and that of the lower layer was h 2 isws were generated at one end of the tank by using the gravity collapse method as described by grue et al 1999 in details the wedge shaped plates were fixed at the other end in order to damp out the incoming waves high quality depression isws with different wave heights were generated by changing the collapse height there were 4 working conditions in this experiment with the collapse heights of 10 15 20 and 25 c m selected the value of the main parameters is listed in table 1 since one aim of this investigation is on the difference in the isw load at different depth five separated vertical cylinder parts were placed under the water at different depth three of them numbered as cylinder 1 3 in fig 1 were connected to the support by force sensors to obtain the horizontal forces caused by isws however the other two parts were fixed directly to the support with a purpose of simulating a whole pile so the three measuring sections were the focus of this experiment the diameter of each cylinder was d and the length was l the vertical coordinate value at the center of cylinder 1 was z 0 047 m in this way cylinder 1 could be kept submerged in the upper layer during the course of wave propagation cylinder 2 and 3 were kept in the lower layer with the respective coordinate value of z 0 225 m and z 0 317 m in order to measure the force on each cylinder without mutual interference a small gap was left between the adjacent parts on account of the narrowness of each gap the inducing influence on the surrounding flow could be negligible the other focus of this paper is on the difference of the empirical hydrodynamic coefficients at different depth thus the data of the horizontal velocity and acceleration induced by isws had to be obtained in order to calculate these coefficients by using morison formula in previous study about the coefficients huang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 2018 the flow field have been simulated theoretically however the data were experimentally measured in this paper in this way the results can be more reliable particle image velocity piv technology was used to measure the horizontal velocities in the middle of the tank the position of measurement area marked as a in fig 1 had been confirmed before the formal experiments began it was ahead of the vertical cylinders and the distance between their middle lines was l 1 the piv system which was used in this paper is shown in fig 2 the basic principle of piv is to measure the velocity of tracer particles which have been interspersed in water as the particles are suspended and motivated by water their velocities represent that of flow field a disk laser was used to light up the particles and a high speed camera was equipped to take pictures within the measurement area at a frequency of 50 h z during the propagation of internal waves one of the samples is shown in fig 3 the bright white spots in the picture are the instantaneous position of particles processing the continuous pictures by digiflow the data of horizontal velocity can be obtained at different depth along the middle line b in order to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients the data of flow field at the location of vertical cylinders instead of that at line b should be obtained as the generated wave would stably propagate in the stratified water at a constant speed the background flow field surrounding the cylinders is considered the same as that at section b except a time delay of δ t l 1 c c is the phase velocity of isws and it can be acquired by the following method as is shown in fig 3 the dividing line between two layers is emerged because of the gray level difference the time history cures of interface position can be collected respectively at section a and b by gradation analysis and the propagation time δ t from section a to b can be got then the phase velocity can be calculated as c l 2 δ t where l 2 is the distance between section a and b with all the above methods the background flow velocity at the position of cylinders was obtained 3 analytical method of c d and c m since one of the objectives in this paper is to compare the hydrodynamic coefficients in different depth it is necessary to introduce the method of calculating the coefficients based on the obtained experimental data there are two kinds of methods to derive hydrodynamic coefficients which are described as temporal domain analysis and frequency domain analysis kang et al 1990 as the load induced by internal solitary wave does not vary periodically the frequency domain analysis cannot be used in this paper the temporal domain analysis is divided into instantaneous value method and the least square method the least square method is selected in this paper on account of its extensive use and high accuracy according to morison formula the horizontal force on per unit length of vertical cylinder is calculated by the equation below 1 f z t c d f d z t c m f i z t here f d z t and f i z t are respectively given by 2 f d z t 1 2 ρ i d u x z t u x z t 3 f i z t π 4 ρ i d 2 u x z t t ρ i is the density of the water layer where the target cylinder section was immersed for cylinder 1 ρ i ρ 1 and ρ i ρ 2 for the other two cylinders d is the diameter of cylinder u x z t is the instantaneous horizontal velocity induced by isw at the location of the central axis of vertical cylinders the theoretical force on each cylinder f t can be obtained by integrating f z t between the two ends 4 f t z 1 z 2 f z t d z c d f 1 t c m f 2 t where 5 f 1 t z 1 z 2 f d z t d z 6 f 2 t z 1 z 2 f i z t d z z 1 and z 2 are the vertical coordinate values at both ends of the target cylinder there must be residuals between the theoretical forces and the experimental data the sum of the squares of the residuals are calculated as 7 q i 0 n c d f 1 t i c m f 2 t i f m t i 2 where f m t i is the experimental force on target cylinder at the moment of t i the main principle of least square method is to compute c d and c m with a purpose of minimizing the value of q thus q c d 0 and q c m 0 are required in this case c d and c m are computed as follows 8 c d f 1 m f 22 f 2 m f 12 f 11 f 22 f 12 f 12 9 c m f 2 m f 11 f 1 m f 12 f 11 f 22 f 12 f 12 where f 11 i 0 n f 1 t i 2 f 12 i 0 n f 1 t i f 2 t i f 22 i 0 n f 2 t i 2 f 1 m i 0 n f 1 t i f m t i f 2 m i 0 n f 2 t i f m t i 4 results and analysis 4 1 isw profile isws keep the profile and phase velocity during the propagation osborne and burch 1980 grimshaw et al 2010 in order to confirm the steady propagation of isws and get the phase velocity c the wave profiles at sections a and b were obtained respectively fig 4 shows the time history of interface displacement for all the 4 working conditions the displacements are nondimensionalized by use of h 1 as can be seen from the figures the wave profiles are almost the same between the two sections in each subfigure it indicates that isws propagate steadily from section a to b hence they are considered to propagate steadily forward from each subfigure the abscissa values of the two curves at trough can be read and the difference δ t 1 can be calculated then the phase velocity c can be calculated by c l 2 δ t 1 moreover it can be seen from the figures that the nondimensionalized wave heights under the 4 working conditions are respectively η 0 43 0 62 0 78 and 0 85 4 2 instantaneous horizontal velocity in this section the experimental data of horizontal velocity measured at plane b are shown and discussed firstly the velocities are compared between not only the different layers but the different depth in the same layer afterwards the variation characteristics of horizontal velocity and acceleration with time are discussed the data of velocity at section b are plotted in fig 5 in the subfigures 5 c and d a small number of test data near the surface which have been circled in the figures are obviously discontinuous with the surrounding data the reason is that the induced velocity near the surface under conditions 3 and 4 is so high that piv system cannot measure them correctly although the errors will hinder the calculation of coefficients for cylinder 1 under conditions 3 and 4 they can be neglected due to the fact that the coefficient contrast between the two layers can be offered in conditions 1 and 2 as is shown in fig 5 the velocity is almost evenly distributed along the depth in the same layer however the direction of velocity is always opposite in the two layers this is the same conclusion as that obtained in the literature grue et al 1999 it is proved that the flow field measurement method adopted in this paper is reliable in order to investigate the time varying characteristics of horizontal velocity and acceleration more intuitively the time history curves of horizontal velocity are plotted in fig 6 on account of the fact that velocity values are almost equal at different depth within the same layer only the data at the middle depths of each layer z 0 5 h 1 and z 0 5 h 2 are plotted the acceleration data are acquired by a derivative of velocity and plotted in fig 7 in view of the measuring errors under conditions 3 and 4 only the data under conditions 1 and 2 are exhibited however it is enough to analyze the time varying characteristics of flow field from fig 6 it is seen that the direction of velocity are always opposite in the two layers which has been mentioned above the velocity values increased to the maximum and then decreased with time comparing the velocity curves to the wave profiles in fig 4 it can be observed that the velocity reaches the maximum at just the moment when the trough arrives it can also be seen from fig 6 that the maximum of horizontal velocity in upper layer is about 3 times of that in lower layer it indicates that the velocity values are of great difference between the layers as is seen in fig 7 the acceleration in the same layer is not always in the same direction which is different from the variations of velocity however it is evident that the direction of acceleration in the two layers is always opposite which is in the same rules as the velocity as for the value of acceleration that in the upper layer is much larger than that in lower layer according to the above analysis it has been proved that there are significant differences in the flow field which is induced by isw between the two layers these differences are reflected in both the direction and the value of flow velocities and accelerations thus the considerable difference may lead to different properties of the force applied to the structures in the two layers moreover little change has been observed for the flow filed at different depth in the same layer 4 3 horizontal forces on cylinders the horizontal forces on the three vertical cylinder parts are recorded by means of analyzing the time history curves the loading characteristics are studied the cylinder 1 has always been in the upper layer and the cylinder 2 and 3 have been at different depth in the lower layer by comparing the horizontal force data on cylinder 1 with cylinders 2 and 3 the internal soliton load characteristics on structure part at different layers are investigated the data of cylinder 2 and 3 are compared with the aim to research the loading characteristics at different depth in the same layer the time history curves of horizontal forces nondimensionalized by f f ρ i π 4 d 2 l are obtained in fig 8 in consideration of the different layers where the cylinders are submerged the different densities ρ i are used in the dimensionless formula for cylinder 1 the density is selected as ρ i ρ 1 for the other two cylinders the density is ρ i ρ 2 it can be seen from the figures that the forces on cylinder 1 are much larger than that on cylinder 2 or 3 and the direction is opposite most of the time however the forces on cylinders 2 and 3 have the same direction and the nearby equal value thus there are significant differences between the internal soliton loads on the structures in the different layers while few differences have been demonstrated for the load on the structures at different depth in the same layer based on the above conclusions it can be assumed that for a vertical cylindrical structure which is always in one layer the upper layer or lower one during the process of wave propagation the horizontal forces are approximately uniformly distributed along the height of the structure the resultant force is large while the moment is small however for a cylindrical structure that crosses the inner face the forces have a distribution in opposite direction along the height as a result the resultant force is smaller and the moment is larger therefore the magnitude of isw load is related to the height of the structure respectively immersed in the upper and lower layers for a floating structure the isw load is affected by the draft for underwater structures the load is influenced by the location of structure as is seen from fig 8 the direction of forces exerted on cylinder 1 is positive firstly and turns to the opposite later on as the peak value in the positive direction is much larger than that in the opposite the horizontal force on cylinder 1 has a strong unidirectional impact nevertheless for the forces on cylinder 2 and 3 it shows a stronger oscillation characteristic instead of unidirectional impact in order to study the reason why the isw force has the above different characteristics on the cylinders in different layers the horizontal forces are decomposed into drag forces and inertial forces and they are analyzed respectively the drag forces are calculated by f d c d f 1 t and inertial forces are calculated by f m c m f 2 t where f 1 t and f 2 t are computed by equations 5 and 6 and the values of c d and c m are obtained in section 4 4 both the drag forces and inertial forces are nondimensionalized using the same formula for f as the cylinders 2 and 3 are in the same layer only the data for one of them are necessary thus the forces on cylinder 1 and 2 under the working condition 1 are plotted in fig 9 as is seen in fig 9 no matter for cylinder 1 or 2 the shape of the drag force curve is similar to that of the velocity curves in fig 6 a the shape of the inertial force curves is similar to that of the acceleration curves in fig 7 a the drag forces are unidirectional and the inertial forces are oscillating the total horizontal force is described as the superposition of the drag force and the inertial force so it has both unidirectional impact and bidirectional oscillation which has been exhibited in fig 8 from fig 9 a the maximum drag force on cylinder 1 is significantly larger than the amplitude of the inertial force as a result the resultant force has a stronger unidirectional impact on cylinder 1 however the amplitude of the inertial force is larger for cylinder 2 so the total force is more oscillating therefore it can be concluded that the internal solitary waves have strong unidirectional impact on the structure part in the upper layer and strong oscillation on the part in the lower one in order to reflect the unidirectional characteristic of internal soliton load on the cylinders a parameter r is defined in this paper 10 r f e x t 1 f e x t 2 here f e x t 1 is the extreme value of the force in the principal direction for the cylinder immersed in the upper layer the principal direction is active for the cylinders in the lower layer the principal direction is the opposite f e x t 2 represents the extreme value of the force in the opposite direction hence the larger the parameter r is the more unidirectional the force is the data of r are calculated for the three cylinder sections in the 4 working conditions and showed in table 2 the value of r for cylinder 1 is much larger than that for cylinder 2 and 3 under the same working condition for the same cylinder r increases as the wave height increases thus the internal soliton load on the structure part submerged in the upper layer is more unidirectional while it is more oscillating for the structure part in the lower layer and the unidirectional characteristic is stronger as the wave height is higher 4 4 the hydrodynamic coefficients in previous studies the same hydrodynamic coefficients have been selected for the structure parts in the upper layer and lower one as discussed above both the flow field and load characteristics are significantly different between the upper and lower layers therefore it is necessary to investigate the difference of hydrodynamic coefficients in the two layers based on the experimental data of flow field and horizontal force on each cylinder segment the empirical coefficients of c d and c m are obtained by using the least square method mentioned in chapter 3 in order to verify the accuracy of hydrodynamic coefficient the calculation results of horizontal force which are based on the obtained coefficients and morison formula are compared with the test results fig 10 shows the comparison results under the working condition 1 the calculated results agree well with the experimental data the calculated result is slightly larger than the measured one at the peak and the curve is slightly steeper than the measured one this is because the calculation result is based on the flow field at section b which is upstream of the cylinder and the internal solitary wave propagates from section b to the location of cylinders causing energy loss and amplitude reduction according to the isw theory the shape of wave profile tends to flatten out with the decrease of amplitude and nonlinearity of internal wave the results of c d are listed in table 3 and that of c m are in table 4 as the flow field under the working conditions 3 and 4 are not accurately measured the coefficients for cylinder 1 cannot be obtained in the two working conditions it can be seen from table 3 that c d for cylinder 1 is significantly different from that for cylinders 2 and 3 the data are almost equal for cylinder 2 and 3 under the same working condition as is shown in table 4 the values of c m are close for the three cylinders in the current prediction model of internal solitary wave force the hydrodynamic coefficient is selected based on the parameters of the upper fluid flow field without considering the differences between the upper and lower layers it can be seen from tables 3 and 4 that the hydrodynamic coefficients in the lower layer especially the drag force coefficients are quite different from those in the upper layer in order to study the influence of hydrodynamic coefficient differences in different flow layers on the calculation results of internal solitary wave forces two calculation results for cylinder 2 are compared in fig 11 cal 1 curves are obtained based on the coefficients of cylinder 2 itself cal 2 curves are obtained by using coefficients of cylinder 1 which is in the upper layer the test results are also used for comparison since the forces on cylinder 2 and 3 are close only the results of cylinder 2 are analyzed since the hydrodynamic coefficient data of cylinder 1 are not obtained in the working conditions 3 and 4 only the results under conditions 1 and 2 are shown in fig 11 the cal 1 curves are closer to the experimental results at the trough the result of cal 2 is larger than that of experiment and cal 1 therefore if the difference of hydrodynamic coefficients between the upper and lower layers is ignored to calculate the internal solitary wave force the calculating force on the structure segment in the lower layer will be too large this is due to the adoption of a larger c d which is seen from the data in tables 3 and 4 according to the analysis in section 4 3 the drag force component becomes more and more dominant with the increase of the amplitude of the internal solitary wave therefore it can be predicted that the difference of hydrodynamic coefficients in the upper and lower fluid has an increasing influence on the calculation result of isw force with the increase of the amplitude under the conditions of working condition 1 and 2 the results of cal 2 are respectively 11 2 and 13 7 larger than that of cal 1 which confirms the above prediction the amplitude of actual isw is usually very large in the ocean thus the coefficient difference between the layers should not be ignored reynolds number r e is one of the influence factors of coefficients in the flow field caused by internal solitary waves the reynolds number is usually calculated by the maximum velocity r e m a x u m a x d μ in this paper r e m a x is calculated based on the measured velocity at the center of each cylinder in combination with the hydrodynamic coefficient results of each cylinder the variation trend of c d and c m with r e m a x is studied at present several experimental studies have been conducted on hydrodynamic coefficients under the condition of isws most of which are carried out on specific floating structures the measured isw forces contain froude krylov forces on horizontal structures in huang et al 2013 only the horizontal forces on vertical columnar structures are studied which is similar to the study in this paper therefore the hydrodynamic coefficient results in this paper are compared with those in huang et al 2013 as shown in fig 12 huang et al 2013 obtained the trend that the drag force coefficient decreased with the increase of r e m a x in his study it should be noted that the minimum r e m a x in the working conditions of huang et al 2013 is about r e m a x 3000 while the working conditions in this paper are mainly in the range of r e m a x 3000 the results in the range of r e m a x 3000 in this paper are in good agreement with the curve in huang et al 2013 in addition according to the experimental results of this paper c d increases with the r e m a x when within the range of r e m a x 3000 as for the inertial coefficient c m it was selected as c m 2 0 in huang et al 2013 which does not change with r e m a x according to the results in fig 12 b the c m data calculated in this paper basically remains unchanged with the increase of r e m a x and the value of c m is close to that of c m 2 0 therefore it is reasonable to take c m 2 0 k c number is another factor that affects the hydrodynamic coefficient in the present study k c number is calculated according to the calculation method of k c number under the condition of oscillating flow caused by surface wave the formula is k c u m a x t d where t is the characteristic period of the internal solitary wave and d is the diameter of the cylinder the flow induced by isw is unidirectional which is significantly different from the bidirectional oscillating flow caused by the surface wave but similar to the combined wave current flow with the velocity ratio of u c u w 1 u c represents the velocity of the current and u w represents the velocity amplitude caused by the surface wave the hydrodynamic coefficients under the combined wave current flow have been maturely studied and plenty of experimental data have been obtained if the correlation between the dynamic coefficients under the condition of isw and the results under the combined wave current flow a lot of research work on isw force can be reduced the analysis below is carried out with this goal as was described in iwagaki et al 1983 about the k c number in the combined wave current flow k c was defined as the ratio of π times of the maximum one way movement distance of water particle in a wave cycle and the diameter of the cylinder the same definition is used in this paper for the condition of isw so the k c number of each cylinder is calculated as 11 k c π s d where s is the maximum one way movement distance of water particle in a wave cycle as the horizontal velocity in the same layer is uniformly distributed along the depth the horizontal velocity data at the center point of each cylinder are used to calculate s 12 s t 1 t 2 u t dt where t 1 and t 2 are the corresponding moments when u 5 u m a x before and after the peak respectively so t t 2 t 1 is the characteristic period of the internal solitary wave based on the hydrodynamic coefficients and k c numbers of each cylinder segment the relationship of c d k c and c m k c were studied respectively the scatter plot was drawn and compared with the results in the wave current field obtained in iwagaki et al 1983 as shown in fig 13 for the data of c d under the condition of isw c d increases with k c number in the range of k c 13 and decreases when k c 13 the variation trend of c d with k c under the condition of internal solitary wave is similar to the result under the wave current flow except that the value of c d in isw is about 1 larger than that in wave current it is noted that the hydrodynamic coefficient in wave current condition is calculated based on the wave force after several wave cycles when the flow around the cylinder has been fully evolved while the internal solitary wave has only one period and the surrounding flow has not been evolved that may be the reason for the difference in values between the two conditions for the c m the c m k c relationship under the condition of internal solitary wave is similar to those in the combined wave field as is shown in fig 13 b due to the fewer working conditions and smaller k c number range tested in this paper the correlation between the hydrodynamic coefficient of the two flow fields still needs a further study 5 conclusions prior work has studied both the flow field induced by internal solitary wave and the internal soliton load on vertical cylinders by conducting a physical modelling experiment the difference of the flow field at different depth and the characteristics of the load on the cylinder sections at different depth have been focused on besides the empirical coefficients under the condition of internal solitary wave have been studied the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the flow field caused by internal solitary wave is very different between different flow layers and almost the same in the same layer this leads to significant differences in the characteristics of isw force on structural segments in different flow layers and almost identical in the same layer at different depths as a result the load of internal solitary wave on the structure is affected by the submerged height of the structure in the upper and lower layers respectively therefore the draft of the floating structure and the location of the underwater structure should be taken into account when analyzing the internal solitary wave load on marine engineering structure 2 when calculating the horizontal force of internal solitary wave using morison formula the value of hydrodynamic coefficient especially the value of c d is quite different between upper and lower layers this leads to the calculating deviation of the force on the structure segment in the lower layer calculated according to the traditional method the deviation increases with the increase of the amplitude of the internal solitary wave therefore it is suggested to select the hydrodynamic coefficients respectively according to the velocity data of the upper and lower layers 3 under the condition of internal solitary wave the drag force coefficient c d first increases and then decreases with r e m a x and the inertial force coefficient c m remains basically unchanged with r e m a x the variation trend of the coefficients with the newly defined k c number is similar to that in the combined wave current flow except that the value of c d has a fixed deviation the specific relationship between hydrodynamic coefficients and r e k c number is necessary when calculating the isw force as there are fewer test conditions and the range of r e number and k c number is small in this paper the formula for the above relationship are not given in addition considering the generation difficulty of large scale internal solitary wave the correlation between the coefficients in isw and combined wave current flow is worth further investigation acknowledgment

22572,internal solitary waves were generated in a density stratified two layer fluid a cylindrical pile composed of five sections was arranged throughout the water depth the flow field induced by

were obtained the flow field information load characteristics and hydrodynamic coefficients are greatly different between the upper and lower layers and almost the same at different depth in the same layer it is suggested to select different empirical coefficients when calculating internal solitary wave force on the structure parts in different layers besides the variation trend of hydrodynamic coefficient under the condition of internal solitary wave has some similarities to that under the condition of combined wave current flow keywords internal solitary wave model test flow field wave force hydrodynamic coefficients 1 introduction internal solitary wave isw which is frequently observed in the ocean ostrovsky and stepanyants 1989 stanton and ostrovsky 1998 ramos et al 2009 li et al 2011 li and farmer 2011 has aroused widespread concern around the world due to its great harm to the offshore structures a considerable number of accidents caused by internal waves have been reported cai and gan 2001 ebbesmeyer et al 1991 circular cylinder is the main form of offshore structures such as the spar columns of tension leg platform tlp and the riser system consequently knowledge of properties of internal solitary waves and the loads they may cause on the circular cylinder is of great significance for offshore oil and gas exploitation projects isws are gravity waves exiting at the interface of two flow layers having different densities they are reported to have quite large amplitudes up to 170 m lien et al 2014 alford et al 2015 chen m et al 2017 and may locally introduce strong varying currents in the full depth of the ocean the induced current flow in opposite directions in the two layers and the value of velocity is different along the depth of the water choi and camassa 1999 camassa et al 2006 morison formula was introduced to calculate the internal wave load as the wave length is very large with respect to the horizontal size of the offshore structures cai et al 2003 afterwards the internal wave load on cylindrical piles were calculated and studied cai et al 2008 du et al 2007 xie et al 2010 2011 it was demonstrated that the internal soliton caused huge horizontal force and torque on the structures in the above papers the researchers had chosen the hydrodynamic coefficients which are important empirical parameters in morison formula based on the surface wave principle recently the coefficients were researched under the condition of internal solitary wave huang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 2018 in the previous literature the study of isw load characteristic has been mainly focused on the whole structure and the same coefficients have been selected for the whole structure no matter for the part in the upper layer or the lower layer however on account of the different characteristics of the flow at different depth especially in the different layers there may be some differences for internal solitary wave force and hydrodynamic coefficients along the depth these differences are crucial when analyzing the dynamic response of ocean structures which are across the interface especially for the flexible risers which work in the full depth of the water the different magnitudes of isw force on the cylinder segments at different depth have been preliminarily studied wang et al 2016 it is worthwhile to conduct an experiment to detailedly investigate the different characteristics of internal soliton load and hydrodynamic coefficients on the structure parts at different depth in this paper an experiment was conducted with internal solitary waves propagating in a two layer fluid a cylindrical pile composed of five sections was arranged throughout the water depth both the load and the hydrodynamic coefficients for the sections which were in different layers or at different depth in the same layer are studied comparatively the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief description of experimental set up in section 3 the analytical method of hydrodynamic coefficients is described section 4 presents the experimental results including internal wave profiles instantaneous velocities horizontal forces on the cylinders and the hydrodynamic coefficients finally the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 experimental set up this experiment was carried out in the stratified flow and internal wave flume in the physical ocean laboratory at ocean university of china a sketch of this experiment is presented in fig 1 the flume is 15 m long and with a cross section of 0 35 m wide by 0 6 m high a two layer fluid consisting of two brine water layers with different densities was prepared by using the classical two bucket method the lighter water with a density of ρ 1 was injected into the flume to a desired depth then the heavier water of ρ 2 was injected slowly and carefully beneath the lighter layer in this way the pycnocline was fairly thin the thickness of the upper layers was h 1 and that of the lower layer was h 2 isws were generated at one end of the tank by using the gravity collapse method as described by grue et al 1999 in details the wedge shaped plates were fixed at the other end in order to damp out the incoming waves high quality depression isws with different wave heights were generated by changing the collapse height there were 4 working conditions in this experiment with the collapse heights of 10 15 20 and 25 c m selected the value of the main parameters is listed in table 1 since one aim of this investigation is on the difference in the isw load at different depth five separated vertical cylinder parts were placed under the water at different depth three of them numbered as cylinder 1 3 in fig 1 were connected to the support by force sensors to obtain the horizontal forces caused by isws however the other two parts were fixed directly to the support with a purpose of simulating a whole pile so the three measuring sections were the focus of this experiment the diameter of each cylinder was d and the length was l the vertical coordinate value at the center of cylinder 1 was z 0 047 m in this way cylinder 1 could be kept submerged in the upper layer during the course of wave propagation cylinder 2 and 3 were kept in the lower layer with the respective coordinate value of z 0 225 m and z 0 317 m in order to measure the force on each cylinder without mutual interference a small gap was left between the adjacent parts on account of the narrowness of each gap the inducing influence on the surrounding flow could be negligible the other focus of this paper is on the difference of the empirical hydrodynamic coefficients at different depth thus the data of the horizontal velocity and acceleration induced by isws had to be obtained in order to calculate these coefficients by using morison formula in previous study about the coefficients huang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 2018 the flow field have been simulated theoretically however the data were experimentally measured in this paper in this way the results can be more reliable particle image velocity piv technology was used to measure the horizontal velocities in the middle of the tank the position of measurement area marked as a in fig 1 had been confirmed before the formal experiments began it was ahead of the vertical cylinders and the distance between their middle lines was l 1 the piv system which was used in this paper is shown in fig 2 the basic principle of piv is to measure the velocity of tracer particles which have been interspersed in water as the particles are suspended and motivated by water their velocities represent that of flow field a disk laser was used to light up the particles and a high speed camera was equipped to take pictures within the measurement area at a frequency of 50 h z during the propagation of internal waves one of the samples is shown in fig 3 the bright white spots in the picture are the instantaneous position of particles processing the continuous pictures by digiflow the data of horizontal velocity can be obtained at different depth along the middle line b in order to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients the data of flow field at the location of vertical cylinders instead of that at line b should be obtained as the generated wave would stably propagate in the stratified water at a constant speed the background flow field surrounding the cylinders is considered the same as that at section b except a time delay of δ t l 1 c c is the phase velocity of isws and it can be acquired by the following method as is shown in fig 3 the dividing line between two layers is emerged because of the gray level difference the time history cures of interface position can be collected respectively at section a and b by gradation analysis and the propagation time δ t from section a to b can be got then the phase velocity can be calculated as c l 2 δ t where l 2 is the distance between section a and b with all the above methods the background flow velocity at the position of cylinders was obtained 3 analytical method of c d and c m since one of the objectives in this paper is to compare the hydrodynamic coefficients in different depth it is necessary to introduce the method of calculating the coefficients based on the obtained experimental data there are two kinds of methods to derive hydrodynamic coefficients which are described as temporal domain analysis and frequency domain analysis kang et al 1990 as the load induced by internal solitary wave does not vary periodically the frequency domain analysis cannot be used in this paper the temporal domain analysis is divided into instantaneous value method and the least square method the least square method is selected in this paper on account of its extensive use and high accuracy according to morison formula the horizontal force on per unit length of vertical cylinder is calculated by the equation below 1 f z t c d f d z t c m f i z t here f d z t and f i z t are respectively given by 2 f d z t 1 2 ρ i d u x z t u x z t 3 f i z t π 4 ρ i d 2 u x z t t ρ i is the density of the water layer where the target cylinder section was immersed for cylinder 1 ρ i ρ 1 and ρ i ρ 2 for the other two cylinders d is the diameter of cylinder u x z t is the instantaneous horizontal velocity induced by isw at the location of the central axis of vertical cylinders the theoretical force on each cylinder f t can be obtained by integrating f z t between the two ends 4 f t z 1 z 2 f z t d z c d f 1 t c m f 2 t where 5 f 1 t z 1 z 2 f d z t d z 6 f 2 t z 1 z 2 f i z t d z z 1 and z 2 are the vertical coordinate values at both ends of the target cylinder there must be residuals between the theoretical forces and the experimental data the sum of the squares of the residuals are calculated as 7 q i 0 n c d f 1 t i c m f 2 t i f m t i 2 where f m t i is the experimental force on target cylinder at the moment of t i the main principle of least square method is to compute c d and c m with a purpose of minimizing the value of q thus q c d 0 and q c m 0 are required in this case c d and c m are computed as follows 8 c d f 1 m f 22 f 2 m f 12 f 11 f 22 f 12 f 12 9 c m f 2 m f 11 f 1 m f 12 f 11 f 22 f 12 f 12 where f 11 i 0 n f 1 t i 2 f 12 i 0 n f 1 t i f 2 t i f 22 i 0 n f 2 t i 2 f 1 m i 0 n f 1 t i f m t i f 2 m i 0 n f 2 t i f m t i 4 results and analysis 4 1 isw profile isws keep the profile and phase velocity during the propagation osborne and burch 1980 grimshaw et al 2010 in order to confirm the steady propagation of isws and get the phase velocity c the wave profiles at sections a and b were obtained respectively fig 4 shows the time history of interface displacement for all the 4 working conditions the displacements are nondimensionalized by use of h 1 as can be seen from the figures the wave profiles are almost the same between the two sections in each subfigure it indicates that isws propagate steadily from section a to b hence they are considered to propagate steadily forward from each subfigure the abscissa values of the two curves at trough can be read and the difference δ t 1 can be calculated then the phase velocity c can be calculated by c l 2 δ t 1 moreover it can be seen from the figures that the nondimensionalized wave heights under the 4 working conditions are respectively η 0 43 0 62 0 78 and 0 85 4 2 instantaneous horizontal velocity in this section the experimental data of horizontal velocity measured at plane b are shown and discussed firstly the velocities are compared between not only the different layers but the different depth in the same layer afterwards the variation characteristics of horizontal velocity and acceleration with time are discussed the data of velocity at section b are plotted in fig 5 in the subfigures 5 c and d a small number of test data near the surface which have been circled in the figures are obviously discontinuous with the surrounding data the reason is that the induced velocity near the surface under conditions 3 and 4 is so high that piv system cannot measure them correctly although the errors will hinder the calculation of coefficients for cylinder 1 under conditions 3 and 4 they can be neglected due to the fact that the coefficient contrast between the two layers can be offered in conditions 1 and 2 as is shown in fig 5 the velocity is almost evenly distributed along the depth in the same layer however the direction of velocity is always opposite in the two layers this is the same conclusion as that obtained in the literature grue et al 1999 it is proved that the flow field measurement method adopted in this paper is reliable in order to investigate the time varying characteristics of horizontal velocity and acceleration more intuitively the time history curves of horizontal velocity are plotted in fig 6 on account of the fact that velocity values are almost equal at different depth within the same layer only the data at the middle depths of each layer z 0 5 h 1 and z 0 5 h 2 are plotted the acceleration data are acquired by a derivative of velocity and plotted in fig 7 in view of the measuring errors under conditions 3 and 4 only the data under conditions 1 and 2 are exhibited however it is enough to analyze the time varying characteristics of flow field from fig 6 it is seen that the direction of velocity are always opposite in the two layers which has been mentioned above the velocity values increased to the maximum and then decreased with time comparing the velocity curves to the wave profiles in fig 4 it can be observed that the velocity reaches the maximum at just the moment when the trough arrives it can also be seen from fig 6 that the maximum of horizontal velocity in upper layer is about 3 times of that in lower layer it indicates that the velocity values are of great difference between the layers as is seen in fig 7 the acceleration in the same layer is not always in the same direction which is different from the variations of velocity however it is evident that the direction of acceleration in the two layers is always opposite which is in the same rules as the velocity as for the value of acceleration that in the upper layer is much larger than that in lower layer according to the above analysis it has been proved that there are significant differences in the flow field which is induced by isw between the two layers these differences are reflected in both the direction and the value of flow velocities and accelerations thus the considerable difference may lead to different properties of the force applied to the structures in the two layers moreover little change has been observed for the flow filed at different depth in the same layer 4 3 horizontal forces on cylinders the horizontal forces on the three vertical cylinder parts are recorded by means of analyzing the time history curves the loading characteristics are studied the cylinder 1 has always been in the upper layer and the cylinder 2 and 3 have been at different depth in the lower layer by comparing the horizontal force data on cylinder 1 with cylinders 2 and 3 the internal soliton load characteristics on structure part at different layers are investigated the data of cylinder 2 and 3 are compared with the aim to research the loading characteristics at different depth in the same layer the time history curves of horizontal forces nondimensionalized by f f ρ i π 4 d 2 l are obtained in fig 8 in consideration of the different layers where the cylinders are submerged the different densities ρ i are used in the dimensionless formula for cylinder 1 the density is selected as ρ i ρ 1 for the other two cylinders the density is ρ i ρ 2 it can be seen from the figures that the forces on cylinder 1 are much larger than that on cylinder 2 or 3 and the direction is opposite most of the time however the forces on cylinders 2 and 3 have the same direction and the nearby equal value thus there are significant differences between the internal soliton loads on the structures in the different layers while few differences have been demonstrated for the load on the structures at different depth in the same layer based on the above conclusions it can be assumed that for a vertical cylindrical structure which is always in one layer the upper layer or lower one during the process of wave propagation the horizontal forces are approximately uniformly distributed along the height of the structure the resultant force is large while the moment is small however for a cylindrical structure that crosses the inner face the forces have a distribution in opposite direction along the height as a result the resultant force is smaller and the moment is larger therefore the magnitude of isw load is related to the height of the structure respectively immersed in the upper and lower layers for a floating structure the isw load is affected by the draft for underwater structures the load is influenced by the location of structure as is seen from fig 8 the direction of forces exerted on cylinder 1 is positive firstly and turns to the opposite later on as the peak value in the positive direction is much larger than that in the opposite the horizontal force on cylinder 1 has a strong unidirectional impact nevertheless for the forces on cylinder 2 and 3 it shows a stronger oscillation characteristic instead of unidirectional impact in order to study the reason why the isw force has the above different characteristics on the cylinders in different layers the horizontal forces are decomposed into drag forces and inertial forces and they are analyzed respectively the drag forces are calculated by f d c d f 1 t and inertial forces are calculated by f m c m f 2 t where f 1 t and f 2 t are computed by equations 5 and 6 and the values of c d and c m are obtained in section 4 4 both the drag forces and inertial forces are nondimensionalized using the same formula for f as the cylinders 2 and 3 are in the same layer only the data for one of them are necessary thus the forces on cylinder 1 and 2 under the working condition 1 are plotted in fig 9 as is seen in fig 9 no matter for cylinder 1 or 2 the shape of the drag force curve is similar to that of the velocity curves in fig 6 a the shape of the inertial force curves is similar to that of the acceleration curves in fig 7 a the drag forces are unidirectional and the inertial forces are oscillating the total horizontal force is described as the superposition of the drag force and the inertial force so it has both unidirectional impact and bidirectional oscillation which has been exhibited in fig 8 from fig 9 a the maximum drag force on cylinder 1 is significantly larger than the amplitude of the inertial force as a result the resultant force has a stronger unidirectional impact on cylinder 1 however the amplitude of the inertial force is larger for cylinder 2 so the total force is more oscillating therefore it can be concluded that the internal solitary waves have strong unidirectional impact on the structure part in the upper layer and strong oscillation on the part in the lower one in order to reflect the unidirectional characteristic of internal soliton load on the cylinders a parameter r is defined in this paper 10 r f e x t 1 f e x t 2 here f e x t 1 is the extreme value of the force in the principal direction for the cylinder immersed in the upper layer the principal direction is active for the cylinders in the lower layer the principal direction is the opposite f e x t 2 represents the extreme value of the force in the opposite direction hence the larger the parameter r is the more unidirectional the force is the data of r are calculated for the three cylinder sections in the 4 working conditions and showed in table 2 the value of r for cylinder 1 is much larger than that for cylinder 2 and 3 under the same working condition for the same cylinder r increases as the wave height increases thus the internal soliton load on the structure part submerged in the upper layer is more unidirectional while it is more oscillating for the structure part in the lower layer and the unidirectional characteristic is stronger as the wave height is higher 4 4 the hydrodynamic coefficients in previous studies the same hydrodynamic coefficients have been selected for the structure parts in the upper layer and lower one as discussed above both the flow field and load characteristics are significantly different between the upper and lower layers therefore it is necessary to investigate the difference of hydrodynamic coefficients in the two layers based on the experimental data of flow field and horizontal force on each cylinder segment the empirical coefficients of c d and c m are obtained by using the least square method mentioned in chapter 3 in order to verify the accuracy of hydrodynamic coefficient the calculation results of horizontal force which are based on the obtained coefficients and morison formula are compared with the test results fig 10 shows the comparison results under the working condition 1 the calculated results agree well with the experimental data the calculated result is slightly larger than the measured one at the peak and the curve is slightly steeper than the measured one this is because the calculation result is based on the flow field at section b which is upstream of the cylinder and the internal solitary wave propagates from section b to the location of cylinders causing energy loss and amplitude reduction according to the isw theory the shape of wave profile tends to flatten out with the decrease of amplitude and nonlinearity of internal wave the results of c d are listed in table 3 and that of c m are in table 4 as the flow field under the working conditions 3 and 4 are not accurately measured the coefficients for cylinder 1 cannot be obtained in the two working conditions it can be seen from table 3 that c d for cylinder 1 is significantly different from that for cylinders 2 and 3 the data are almost equal for cylinder 2 and 3 under the same working condition as is shown in table 4 the values of c m are close for the three cylinders in the current prediction model of internal solitary wave force the hydrodynamic coefficient is selected based on the parameters of the upper fluid flow field without considering the differences between the upper and lower layers it can be seen from tables 3 and 4 that the hydrodynamic coefficients in the lower layer especially the drag force coefficients are quite different from those in the upper layer in order to study the influence of hydrodynamic coefficient differences in different flow layers on the calculation results of internal solitary wave forces two calculation results for cylinder 2 are compared in fig 11 cal 1 curves are obtained based on the coefficients of cylinder 2 itself cal 2 curves are obtained by using coefficients of cylinder 1 which is in the upper layer the test results are also used for comparison since the forces on cylinder 2 and 3 are close only the results of cylinder 2 are analyzed since the hydrodynamic coefficient data of cylinder 1 are not obtained in the working conditions 3 and 4 only the results under conditions 1 and 2 are shown in fig 11 the cal 1 curves are closer to the experimental results at the trough the result of cal 2 is larger than that of experiment and cal 1 therefore if the difference of hydrodynamic coefficients between the upper and lower layers is ignored to calculate the internal solitary wave force the calculating force on the structure segment in the lower layer will be too large this is due to the adoption of a larger c d which is seen from the data in tables 3 and 4 according to the analysis in section 4 3 the drag force component becomes more and more dominant with the increase of the amplitude of the internal solitary wave therefore it can be predicted that the difference of hydrodynamic coefficients in the upper and lower fluid has an increasing influence on the calculation result of isw force with the increase of the amplitude under the conditions of working condition 1 and 2 the results of cal 2 are respectively 11 2 and 13 7 larger than that of cal 1 which confirms the above prediction the amplitude of actual isw is usually very large in the ocean thus the coefficient difference between the layers should not be ignored reynolds number r e is one of the influence factors of coefficients in the flow field caused by internal solitary waves the reynolds number is usually calculated by the maximum velocity r e m a x u m a x d μ in this paper r e m a x is calculated based on the measured velocity at the center of each cylinder in combination with the hydrodynamic coefficient results of each cylinder the variation trend of c d and c m with r e m a x is studied at present several experimental studies have been conducted on hydrodynamic coefficients under the condition of isws most of which are carried out on specific floating structures the measured isw forces contain froude krylov forces on horizontal structures in huang et al 2013 only the horizontal forces on vertical columnar structures are studied which is similar to the study in this paper therefore the hydrodynamic coefficient results in this paper are compared with those in huang et al 2013 as shown in fig 12 huang et al 2013 obtained the trend that the drag force coefficient decreased with the increase of r e m a x in his study it should be noted that the minimum r e m a x in the working conditions of huang et al 2013 is about r e m a x 3000 while the working conditions in this paper are mainly in the range of r e m a x 3000 the results in the range of r e m a x 3000 in this paper are in good agreement with the curve in huang et al 2013 in addition according to the experimental results of this paper c d increases with the r e m a x when within the range of r e m a x 3000 as for the inertial coefficient c m it was selected as c m 2 0 in huang et al 2013 which does not change with r e m a x according to the results in fig 12 b the c m data calculated in this paper basically remains unchanged with the increase of r e m a x and the value of c m is close to that of c m 2 0 therefore it is reasonable to take c m 2 0 k c number is another factor that affects the hydrodynamic coefficient in the present study k c number is calculated according to the calculation method of k c number under the condition of oscillating flow caused by surface wave the formula is k c u m a x t d where t is the characteristic period of the internal solitary wave and d is the diameter of the cylinder the flow induced by isw is unidirectional which is significantly different from the bidirectional oscillating flow caused by the surface wave but similar to the combined wave current flow with the velocity ratio of u c u w 1 u c represents the velocity of the current and u w represents the velocity amplitude caused by the surface wave the hydrodynamic coefficients under the combined wave current flow have been maturely studied and plenty of experimental data have been obtained if the correlation between the dynamic coefficients under the condition of isw and the results under the combined wave current flow a lot of research work on isw force can be reduced the analysis below is carried out with this goal as was described in iwagaki et al 1983 about the k c number in the combined wave current flow k c was defined as the ratio of π times of the maximum one way movement distance of water particle in a wave cycle and the diameter of the cylinder the same definition is used in this paper for the condition of isw so the k c number of each cylinder is calculated as 11 k c π s d where s is the maximum one way movement distance of water particle in a wave cycle as the horizontal velocity in the same layer is uniformly distributed along the depth the horizontal velocity data at the center point of each cylinder are used to calculate s 12 s t 1 t 2 u t dt where t 1 and t 2 are the corresponding moments when u 5 u m a x before and after the peak respectively so t t 2 t 1 is the characteristic period of the internal solitary wave based on the hydrodynamic coefficients and k c numbers of each cylinder segment the relationship of c d k c and c m k c were studied respectively the scatter plot was drawn and compared with the results in the wave current field obtained in iwagaki et al 1983 as shown in fig 13 for the data of c d under the condition of isw c d increases with k c number in the range of k c 13 and decreases when k c 13 the variation trend of c d with k c under the condition of internal solitary wave is similar to the result under the wave current flow except that the value of c d in isw is about 1 larger than that in wave current it is noted that the hydrodynamic coefficient in wave current condition is calculated based on the wave force after several wave cycles when the flow around the cylinder has been fully evolved while the internal solitary wave has only one period and the surrounding flow has not been evolved that may be the reason for the difference in values between the two conditions for the c m the c m k c relationship under the condition of internal solitary wave is similar to those in the combined wave field as is shown in fig 13 b due to the fewer working conditions and smaller k c number range tested in this paper the correlation between the hydrodynamic coefficient of the two flow fields still needs a further study 5 conclusions prior work has studied both the flow field induced by internal solitary wave and the internal soliton load on vertical cylinders by conducting a physical modelling experiment the difference of the flow field at different depth and the characteristics of the load on the cylinder sections at different depth have been focused on besides the empirical coefficients under the condition of internal solitary wave have been studied the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the flow field caused by internal solitary wave is very different between different flow layers and almost the same in the same layer this leads to significant differences in the characteristics of isw force on structural segments in different flow layers and almost identical in the same layer at different depths as a result the load of internal solitary wave on the structure is affected by the submerged height of the structure in the upper and lower layers respectively therefore the draft of the floating structure and the location of the underwater structure should be taken into account when analyzing the internal solitary wave load on marine engineering structure 2 when calculating the horizontal force of internal solitary wave using morison formula the value of hydrodynamic coefficient especially the value of c d is quite different between upper and lower layers this leads to the calculating deviation of the force on the structure segment in the lower layer calculated according to the traditional method the deviation increases with the increase of the amplitude of the internal solitary wave therefore it is suggested to select the hydrodynamic coefficients respectively according to the velocity data of the upper and lower layers 3 under the condition of internal solitary wave the drag force coefficient c d first increases and then decreases with r e m a x and the inertial force coefficient c m remains basically unchanged with r e m a x the variation trend of the coefficients with the newly defined k c number is similar to that in the combined wave current flow except that the value of c d has a fixed deviation the specific relationship between hydrodynamic coefficients and r e k c number is necessary when calculating the isw force as there are fewer test conditions and the range of r e number and k c number is small in this paper the formula for the above relationship are not given in addition considering the generation difficulty of large scale internal solitary wave the correlation between the coefficients in isw and combined wave current flow is worth further investigation acknowledgment

22573,the re installation of jack up rigs near an existing footprint left by the previous installation can be problematic due to the development of horizontal and moment loads on the spudcan footing and hence on the rigs this paper reports large deformation finite element results of spudcan footprint interaction in non uniform clay deposits the performance of the numerical model was verified by simulations of existing centrifuge tests a detailed parametric study was carried out varying influential factors including the initial spudcan penetration depth to form the footprint spudcan diameters soil sensitivity undrained shear strength profile and the offset distance between spudcan and footprint centres the effects of these factors on the development of the vertical horizontal and moment loads are quantified and the peak magnitudes of the induced horizontal and moment loads at different offset distances are then compared it is found through the numerical analyses that the critical offset distance which maximises the peak horizontal and moment loads on the spudcan ranges between 0 5 and 0 75 times the diameter of the spudcan used for the formation of the footprint by contrast an

the disturbed soil in the footprint area and b the slope at the footprint perimeter iso 2012 these lead to different vertical and horizontal soil resistance on the two sides of the spudcan foundation for spudcan penetration near or partially overlapping the footprint and hence horizontal and moment loads are induced the induced loads cause large detrimental stresses in the jack up legs and hence may lead to structural failure of the jack up rig osborne et al 2006 teh et al 2006 cassidy et al 2009 current industry standard iso 19905 1 iso 2012 recommends keeping an edge to edge distance of one spudcan diameter between the spudcan and the footprint although previous experimental studies suggested different critical offset distances between the centres of spudcan and footprint of 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 spudcan diameter that maximised the peak horizontal and moment loads the effect of offset distance was investigated only for shallow penetration depth of 0 31 0 61 spudcan diameter stewart and finnie 2001 cassidy et al 2009 or within the depth of footprint cavity kong et al 2013 it is hard to reproduce the entire process of spudcan re installation over an existing footprint using traditional small strain numerical approaches one of the earliest attempts was made by jardine et al 2002 who simulated spudcan footprint interaction on a three layer deposit but the problem was simplified as plane strain recently three dimensional large deformation finite element ldfe methods were employed to reproduce spudcan re installation on footprints hartono et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 however only one analysis was presented by hartono et al 2014 while zhang et al 2015 investigated idealised footprint without considering soil strength heterogeneity caused by spudcan installation and extraction the spudcan installation depth and the undrained shear strength profile explored in previous experimental and numerical studies were very limited all these studies except those with manually created footprints used the same spudcan during the processes of footprint formation and spudcan re installation while in practice jack up rigs with different sizes of spudcan footings may be deployed moreover the magnitudes of the induced horizontal and moment loads are dependent on the soil heterogeneity caused by the formation of the footprint leung et al 2007 gan et al 2012 but the effect of soil sensitivity on the spudcan footprint interaction has not been explored yet this paper reports the results from a comprehensive numerical study of spudcan footprint interaction a spudcan was first installed and extracted in order to form the footprint and another spudcan with the same or different diameter was re installed at a certain offset distance compared to previous studies a more extensive range of parameters within the practical interest is covered including the initial penetration depth that forms the footprint the relative sizes of the spudcans used for the initial penetration and re installation soil sensitivity the undrained shear strength profiles of the deposits and the offset distance between spudcan and footprint centres the maximum magnitudes of the loads induced at different offset distances are then compared with the aim of exploring the offset distances that are critical to the rigs during spudcan footprint interaction in non uniform clays 2 numerical model as spudcan penetration is accompanied by significant soil movement deformation and remoulding hossain and randolph 2009 hossain et al 2014 ldfe analyses were carried out using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach in the commercial package abaqus explicit simulia 2014 the schematic of the problem is illustrated in fig 1 where the footprint is formed by the initial penetration and extraction of a spudcan with diameter dini in the non uniform clay deposit with the effective unit weight of γ the intact undrained shear strength of the clay is su sum kz where sum is the intact undrained shear strength at the seabed surface and k is the rate of increase in su with the soil depth z the spudcan interacting with the footprint has a diameter of drep and is displaced vertically at an offset distance β from the centre of the initial penetration or footprint 2 1 model set up by considering the three dimensional loading condition and the geometrical symmetry a half three dimensional model was used as shown in fig 2 two spudcan diameters of 10 and 18 m were simulated with the spudcan shape scaled from those of the mod v class a jack ups cassidy et al 2009 hossain et al 2015 unless otherwise stated to avoid the boundary effect in the analyses the dimensions of the soil domain were chosen as 180 m in length 72 m on the left side of the footprint centre and 108 m on the offset side 72 m in width and 35 63 m in depth for different installation depths the spudcan together with the jack up leg was modelled as a rigid body the lateral and rotational spudcan displacements were not allowed and thus possible leg splay during spudcan footprint interaction was not simulated the reactions i e the loads induced at the load reference point lrp were recorded including the vertical v horizontal h and moment m loads as shown in fig 1 with the sign convention for v h and m following butterfield et al 1997 the positive horizontal and moment loads prevent the spudcan from moving towards the footprint and rotating anti clockwise respectively smooth soil spudcan interface was adopted in the analysis unless otherwise stated the soil was discretised as eulerian elements the eulerian mesh included the original soil domain and an overlying layer initially filled with void material to accommodate possible upward soil movement at the seabed surface a cuboid of fine mesh was created along the trajectory of the spudcans with the minimum element size of 0 025 min dini drep the penetration velocity of spudcan in the numerical analysis was taken as 0 3 m s balancing the computational cost and accuracy which was testified as sufficiently slow to minimise the inertial effect this is similar to the conclusions drawn by qiu and henke 2011 tho et al 2012 and zheng et al 2015b 2017 who adopted the penetration velocity of 0 5 0 17 and 0 1 m s respectively 2 2 constitutive model the elastoplastic tresca model was adopted but extended to capture strain rate and strain softening effects of clay deposits the incorporation of strain rate dependency minimises the effect of mesh dependency related to softening materials which has been recognised as one of the effective methods as it prevents the governing equations from losing ellipticity needleman 1988 oka 2005 zhou and randolph 2007 the undrained shear strength suc is updated following einav and randolph 2005 as 1 s uc 1 μ max γ γ ref γ ref δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u the first bracketed term augments the strength according to the maximum shear strain rate γ relative to a reference value γ ref of 1 h which falls within the range for typical triaxial tests erbrich 2005 the rate parameter μ was taken as 0 1 for circular spudcan foundations low et al 2008 the second bracketed term represents the strength degradation due to the accumulated absolute plastic shear strain ξ and δrem is the inverse of sensitivity st the relative ductility is controlled by the parameter ξ95 which represents the cumulative shear strain required for 95 remoulding a typical value of ξ95 1200 was adopted which falls within the typical range of 10 25 as suggested by randolph 2004 through matching degradation curves from cyclic penetration and extraction tests on t bar and ball penetrometers the same set of parameters have been adopted by zheng et al 2015a 2015b 2016 2018 to simulate centrifuge tests of spudcan penetration in clays with reasonable agreement obtained between numerical and experiment results similar values of the above parameters were also used by dutta et al 2015 hossain et al 2014 hossain et al 2015 tho et al 2012 wang et al 2010 and zhou and randolph 2009 in the simulations of centrifuge tests and case histories for different offshore geotechnical problems it should be noted that variation of the parameters in equation 1 may vary the computed spudcan response to some extent as detailed by hossain and randolph 2009 a uniform stiffness ratio of e suc 200 was adopted where e is the young s modulus considering relatively fast penetration of spudcans in the field all the analyses simulated undrained conditions in clay layers with poisson s ratio of 0 49 the geostatic stress conditions were modelled with the coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest of 1 2 3 variation of parameters in numerical analyses the numerical analyses performed are summarised in table 1 where dini is the initial installation depth measured from the intact mudline to the lrp of the spudcan the centrifuge tests reported by cassidy et al 2009 and gan et al 2012 i e group i in table 1 were reproduced for verification purpose the parameters in the retrospective simulations were the same as those reported except for the sensitivity st of which no exact value is given the sensitivity of uwa university of western australia kaolin clay used in the centrifuge tests of cassidy et al 2009 and gan et al 2012 has a typical range of st 2 3 hu et al 2014 as such a value of st 2 8 was adopted for the centrifuge tests by cassidy et al 2009 since the same value was taken by zheng et al 2015a 2016 2017 2018 for the simulation of centrifuge tests of spudcan penetration in uwa kaolin clays a value of st 2 0 was chosen for the centrifuge test by gan et al 2012 who reported st 2 2 5 a parametric study groups ii vi table 1 varying parameters within the practical interest was then conducted to investigate the effects of initial penetration depth spudcan diameter soil sensitivity undrained shear strength profile and offset distance 3 numerical results and discussion the load penetration profiles from the simulations of centrifuge tests and the parametric study are discussed in this section the profiles are presented in terms of v h and m or dimensionless quantities v asu0 h asu0 and m adrepsu0 varying as a function of the penetration depth d where a is the plan area of the spudcan on which the loads are measured and su0 is the undrained shear strength at the spudcan base level see fig 1 3 1 simulation of centrifuge tests 3 1 1 cassidy et al 2009 cassidy et al 2009 conducted centrifuge tests in non uniform overconsolidated clay investigating the effects of offset distance preload level and jack up leg stiffness on the spudcan footprint interaction response retrospective numerical analyses were performed for preload levels of 40 60 and 80 mn of which the v h and m profiles are available in the publication the spudcan diameter and soil parameters for each test are listed in group i table 1 two spudcan shapes mod v and 116c were modelled while the same spudcan was used in each test to form the footprint initial penetration and then re penetrate the deposit i e dini drep in the initial penetration stage of the centrifuge tests the spudcan penetrated to a depth where the predetermined preload level was achieved while in the numerical analyses the spudcan penetrated to the corresponding average depth measured in the tests of the same preload level the footprint geometries in the centrifuge tests and the numerical analyses after the initial penetration and extraction of the spudcan are plotted in fig 3 the computed footprint depths range between 0 21 0 29dini which are deeper than the measured ones ranging between 0 047 0 082dini the main reason may be that base suction was not considered in the numerical simulation during spudcan extraction due to the limitation of the cel approach which may have resulted in a deeper footprint nevertheless similar to the centrifuge test results the computed footprint depths also increase with increasing magnitude of preload i e initial penetration depth and are within the typical range of 0 16 0 33dini reported by case histories and other centrifuge tests rapoport and young 1987 stewart and finnie 2001 teh et al 2010 gan et al 2012 hossain et al 2017 fig 4 shows the penetration resistance vertical load profiles from the numerical analyses and centrifuge tests for both the initial penetration and re installation of the spudcan for the initial penetration cassidy et al 2009 reported the resistance profiles from all the centrifuge tests which are assumed to have the same undrained shear strength profile so the upper and lower bounds for each spudcan model are included in fig 4a for comparison for the re installation only the data for test otdr3 are available which are compared with the numerical result in fig 4b overall the computed vertical load during initial penetration is bounded by the centrifuge test results while the experimental and numerical penetration resistance profiles for spudcan re installation are close the major difference appears at shallow penetration of d 3 m which may be caused by a the deeper footprint in the numerical analysis and b the existence of stronger top soils in the centrifuge tests compared to the adopted linear strength profile which resulted from the preparation of overconsolidated clay sample in the centrifuge test purwana et al 2005 cassidy et al 2009 wang and bienen 2016 the horizontal and moment loads induced during spudcan footprint interaction are compared in fig 5 the measured and computed profiles are in a relatively reasonable agreement the peak h and m values are generally overestimated by the numerical analyses this may be caused by the deeper footprint in the numerical analysis the overestimation may also be partly attributed to the rigid jack up leg assumed in the numerical simulation which did not allow any lateral displacement of the spudcan during spudcan footprint interaction the model legs in the tests have a certain flexural stiffness which allowed the spudcan to move laterally due to leg deflection under the horizontal force and moment the incorporation of structural flexibility may lead to a reduction on the induced loads when compared to a rigid leg stewart and finnie 2001 kong 2012 kong et al 2013 3 1 2 gan et al 2012 to further validate the numerical model numerical analysis was performed simulating the centrifuge test oc3 conducted by gan et al 2012 in the centrifuge test the spudcan was extracted immediately after it penetrated to the initial penetration depth and then re installed after a prototype time of 1 year the spudcan diameter and soil parameters are listed in group i table 1 the measured and computed contour plots of the undrained shear strength just before spudcan re installation are compared in fig 6 the measured contour was generated from the undrained shear strength profiles obtained from a series of ball penetrometer tests which were performed at 0 25dini intervals away from the footprint centre up to a distance of 1 5dini gan et al 2012 it should be noted that the contour map reported by gan et al 2012 is for the shear strength ratio between the footprint and the undisturbed soil data points of the reported contour lines for the shear strength ratio were digitised and then used to generate the contour map for the undrained shear strength it can be seen that the computed footprint depth is about 0 21dini which is slightly deeper than that observed from the centrifuge test this is consistent with the comparison discussed previously for cassidy et al 2009 the major disturbed area z dini 0 7 radial distance 0 5dini in the numerical simulation has a lower strength compared to that observed from the centrifuge test however it should be noted that an elapsed time of 1 year was modelled in the centrifuge test allowing the footprint to consolidate before the strength contour was measured this process was not simulated in the numerical analysis fig 7 compares the experimental and numerical results of the vertical horizontal and moment loads the penetration resistance profiles during initial penetration are close but tend to diverge after a penetration depth of around 4 m while the computed vertical loads during the re installation of the spudcan are higher than the centrifuge test data this may be explained by the fact that the fitted undrained shear strength profile which was used in the retrospective simulation is generally higher than that measured by t bar tests see fig 2 of gan et al 2012 the depth where the v profiles of initial penetration start to diverge is nearly identical to the depth where the fitted and measured undrained shear strength profiles start to diverge nevertheless the peak h and m values are reasonably simulated with an error of 2 9 and 18 0 respectively total stress analyses were performed and hence suction was not simulated during spudcan extraction nevertheless the reasonable agreement between the measured and computed results for a number of five centrifuge tests from two different previous studies suggests that the neglect of base suction in the numerical simulation may have a minimal effect on the spudcan footprint interaction response 3 2 effect of initial penetration depth on induced loads to investigate the effect of the initial penetration depth on the spudcan footprint interaction response the v h and m profiles at the critical offset distance suggested by cassidy et al 2009 i e β dini 0 5 for dini dini 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 are plotted in fig 8 the other parameters were taken as dini drep 18 m su 5 1z kpa and st 2 8 group ii table 1 for the comparison of vertical loads the penetration resistance profile from initial penetration is included in fig 8a due to soil remoulding around the footprint area all the penetration resistance profiles from spudcan re installation are lower than that from spudcan penetration in the intact seabed the discrepancy between the v profiles for initial penetration and re installation enhances with increasing initial penetration depth dini dini but they all tend to merge back into the response of spudcan penetration in the intact soil as the spudcan approaches the initial penetration depth therefore caution should be exercised in practice to ensure that the jack up leg used in the re installation is sufficiently long as the penetration depth is increased during the re installation compared with the initial penetration under the same vertical load especially for the footprint formed by deep initial penetration the value of h increases rapidly at shallow depths when the spudcan base starts to interact with the footprint slope and then shows a plateau before decreasing almost linearly with penetration depth the most detrimental horizontal load for dini dini 0 5 is positive with the value of 0 89 mn by contrast for dini dini 1 0 and 1 5 the positive peak h values that occur at shallow penetration depths are similar to that of dini dini 0 5 but negative h values with larger magnitudes are developed for deep penetration however this may not be the case in the field as the equivalent leg stiffness ei l3 where ei is the flexural rigidity of the leg and l is the leg length measured from the hull to the spudcan reduces significantly for deep penetration which as discussed previously can lead to a significant reduction in the magnitude of the induced loads the m profiles remain positive until reducing sharply as the spudcan approaches dini for dini dini 0 5 and 1 0 the moment load increases monotonically with penetration depth forming peak m values of 26 22 mn m and 28 11 mn m near the initial penetration depth respectively the m profile for dini dini 1 5 increases up to the depth of about d dini 0 66 d 12 m and then decreases with penetration depth the rate of reduction increases rapidly as the spudcan approaches the initial penetration depth similar forms of the h and m profiles were reported by gan et al 2012 3 3 effect of spudcan diameters on induced loads different jack up rigs with different sizes of spudcans may be used at the same sites therefore the effect of spudcan diameters on the spudcan footprint interaction response is explored by adopting different spudcan diameters for the initial penetration and the re installation i e dini drep two groups of numerical analyses were performed a spudcan re installation near a footprint created by a larger spudcan dini 18 m and drep 10 m group iii table 1 and b spudcan re installation near a footprint created by a smaller spudcan dini 10 m and drep 18 m group iv table 1 the undrained strength profile was selected as su 5 1z kpa and st 2 8 and the footprint was formed by spudcan penetration to the depth of dini 9 m as larger spudcan diameter intrinsically leads to larger magnitude of loads to eliminate this effect the normalised profiles v asu0 h asu0 and m adrepsu0 at the offset distance of β dini 0 5 are plotted in fig 9 the corresponding profiles from the numerical analyses for dini drep 10 m and dini drep 18 m are also included to compare the vertical loads induced during spudcan footprint interaction the penetration resistance profiles from the initial penetration of spudcans of dini 10 and 18 m are also plotted in fig 9a it is seen that the normalised profiles from the initial penetration of spudcans of different diameters are identical to each other once the spudcans are fully embedded by contrast the normalised penetration resistance profiles from spudcan re installation are affected by the relative size of spudcans used for initial penetration and re installation the normalised penetration resistance profiles for spudcan re installation are lower than those for initial penetration once the spudcan penetrates over the initial mudline the larger the extent of the footprint area and hence the disturbed and remoulded area compared to the spudcan diameter used for re installation the lower the vertical bearing capacity is mobilised at least up to the initial penetration depth dini for example once the spudcan is fully embedded the vertical load for the case of dini drep 18 m is generally 5 15 lower than that for dini 10 m and drep 18 m after the spudcan penetrates over the initial penetration depth the v profiles start to merge together with the response of initial penetration regardless of the spudcan diameters for the induced horizontal and moment loads the normalised profiles for dini 18 m and drep 10 m are lower than those for dini drep 18 m at shallow penetration depths but the discrepancy diminishes with spudcan penetration this is due to the difference in soil heterogeneity and evolution of soil flow mechanism during the penetration of the spudcans with different diameters as illustrated in fig 10 where the velocity vectors and shear strength contours are plotted at touchdown level d 0 fig 10a shows that the difference in soil strength between the two sides of the large spudcan drep 18 m is greater than the small one drep 10 m resulting in larger magnitudes of resultant resistances leftward force and anticlockwise moment about lrp and hence positive h and m values meanwhile the soil underneath the spudcan of drep 10 m is predominantly directed horizontally towards the footprint centre the soil flow underneath the spudcan of drep 18 m is similar but with additional resistance resulting from the outward and upward soil flow around the spudcan edge on the offset side for spudcan penetration below the footprint cavity e g d 8 m fig 10b demonstrates similar soil flow mechanisms around both spudcans and the undrained shear strengths around the edges of the two spudcans are also similar which lead to close resultant resistances at this depth the horizontal force and moment for dini 18 m and drep 10 m are found to be higher than those for dini drep 10 m this may be due to the difference in the dimensions of the footprints formed by different dini the footprints formed by dini 18 m and 10 m have the depths of about 5 3 m and 3 1 m respectively with similar slopes of 0 27 and 0 3 the discrepancy between h profiles is more significant than that between m profiles this is consistent with the findings by kong et al 2013 that for the same spudcan interacting with footprints with different depths but with the same footprint slope and ratio of offset distance to footprint width an increase in footprint depth results in increasing horizontal load while its influence on increasing the moment load is less significant among the four spudcan footprint interaction responses the magnitudes of the normalised horizontal and moment loads for dini 10 m and drep 18 m are the lowest while its normalised penetration resistance i e vertical bearing capacity factor is the highest as dini drep the footprint dimensions and the extent of the soil remoulding relative to drep are smaller than those with dini drep therefore one of the possible scenarios to lower the risk of spudcan footprint interaction if possible is to employ a jack up rig with a larger spudcan than the one that forms the footprint 3 4 effect of sensitivity on induced loads the v h and m profiles obtained from numerical analyses of group v in table 1 for β dini 0 5 are plotted in fig 11 to investigate the effect of sensitivity st on the development of the vertical horizontal and moment loads during spudcan footprint interaction the value of st was varied as 2 8 4 and 5 while the other parameters were kept constant it is seen from fig 11a that similar to previous findings the penetration resistance profiles for spudcan re installation are much lower than those for initial penetration but tend to merge back into the initial penetration response as the spudcan approaches the initial penetration depth the v profile also becomes lower for a higher sensitivity however the effect of sensitivity on the re installation is much more obvious than on the initial penetration as st increases from 2 8 to 5 the penetration resistance profile from initial penetration reduces by 7 while that from re installation has a 20 overall reduction fig 11b indicates that although similar horizontal loads are induced at shallow penetration depths up to d 6 7 m the form of the h profile has changed as st increases from 2 8 to 5 instead of deceasing monotonically with penetration depth to a negative value the h profile for st 5 remains positive before the spudcan approaches the initial penetration depth dini variation of soil sensitivity does not change the form of the m profile which increases monotonically with penetration depth until a sharp reduction as the spudcan approaches dini for the explored sensitivities and penetration depths the most detrimental moment loads peak m values are all positive and increase with increasing sensitivity with the magnitudes of 14 5 mn m 33 5 mn m and 39 7 mn m for st 2 8 4 and 5 respectively the velocity vectors and soil strength contours at the penetration depth of d 16 m are plotted in fig 12 to illustrate the reason for the variation of h and m profiles with soil sensitivity although the soil failure mechanisms for different sensitivities are similar with localised soil flow on both sides of the spudcan the soil strengths on the footprint side decrease with increasing sensitivity and the strengths are similar on the offset side negative horizontal load is induced at deep spudcan penetration for a relatively low sensitivity of 2 8 as the sensitivity increases from 2 8 to 5 the horizontal load due to strength heterogeneity becomes more dominant and the spudcan tends to slide from the strong soil to the weak the induced moment load remains positive until the spudcan gets close to dini triggering the squeezing soil failure mechanism underneath the footprint side of the spudcan base the remoulded soil between the spudcan base and the intact soil below dini is squeezed out horizontally towards the footprint centre leading to a sharp increase of vertical resistance on the footprint side of the spudcan and hence a corresponding reduction on the positive moment load 3 5 effect of undrained shear strength profile fig 13 compares the profiles of vertical horizontal and moment loads for the spudcan of dini drep 18 m penetrating in five different undrained shear strength profiles at the critical offset distance β dini 0 5 with sum 0 5 and 10 kpa k 1 and 2 kpa m and the initial penetration depth of dini dini 1 0 group vi table 1 the relationship between the v profiles of initial penetration and re installation is similar to previous findings for clarity penetration resistance profiles from initial penetration are only plotted for the normalised value v asu0 as shown in fig 13a to compare with those from re installation it is demonstrated that the magnitude of vertical load during spudcan footprint interaction is dominated by the local undrained shear strength su0 at the penetration depth with higher local strength leading to higher penetration resistance by contrast the normalised penetration resistance profiles from initial penetration and re installation merge into their respective narrow bands as deep localised failure mechanism is attained hossain et al 2014 the average value of the band for re installation is about 35 lower than that for spudcan penetration in intact soil but the spudcan footprint interaction response appears to return to the initial penetration response for spudcan penetration over the initial penetration depth the effect of undrained shear strength profile on the development of horizontal and moment loads is investigated in fig 13b and c respectively overall the peak values of h and m augments with the increase of the undrained shear strength because of the greater difference between the undrained shear strengths of the soil on the two sides of the spudcan the comparison indicates that the strength gradient k plays a more dominant role on the development of the h and m values compared to the soil strength sum at the mudline for the dimensionless quantities the normalised value h asu0 is generally lower for higher sum and k values while the normalised moment m adrepsu0 merges together after several metres of penetration and reduces almost linearly with depth before a sharp reduction as the spudcan approaches dini regardless of the strength parameters 3 6 identification of critical offset distances fig 14 is plotted to identify the critical offset distance for spudcan re installation in clay with the undrained shear strength increasing with depth covering a more comprehensive range of parameters of practical interest groups ii group vi table 1 as noted previously the negative horizontal load induced at deep spudcan penetration may not be realistic in the field therefore only the positive peak horizontal and moment loads of each load penetration profile are plotted as a function of the normalised offset distance β dini the maximum peak values of h and m are induced at a critical offset distance of β dini between 0 5 and 0 75 regardless of the variation of the initial penetration depth spudcan diameters soil sensitivity and undrained shear strength profile as evidenced by fig 10a the identified critical offset distance may attribute to a combination of a the major disturbed remoulded area of the footprint typically has a lateral extent of around 0 5 0 75dini and hence for spudcan re installation at β dini 0 5 0 75 the difference in soil resistance on the two sides of the spudcan base is more significant compared to other offset distances which results in larger induced loads b the footprint cavity is usually 0 75 1 0dini in radius and a slope failure like soil flow mechanism is developed as the spudcan starts to interact with the footprint at an offset distance of β dini 0 5 0 75 which leads to a higher tendency for the spudcan to slide towards the footprint centre and hence larger induced loads it is noted that for some cases the peak horizontal and moment loads at the offset distances of β dini 0 25 and 1 0 can still be comparable to those at β dini 0 5 and 0 75 a noticeable reduction on the peak loads can be seen for most cases when the offset distance increases to β dini 1 5 for cases where the same spudcan is used for the initial penetration and re installation dini drep the peak horizontal and moment loads at β dini 1 5 respectively range within about 40 60 and 15 25 of those at the critical offset distance by contrast percentages of only 11 5 and 4 3 are found for dini 18 m and drep 10 m while percentages as high as 79 9 and 57 9 have resulted from dini 10 m and drep 18 m fig 14b to explore the offset distance where the footprint has minimal effect on the re installation additional analyses were performed considering β dini 1 75 and 2 0 for group ii of table 1 with dini dini 1 0 as well as β dini 1 9 and 2 7 for group iv of table 1 the computed peak loads are included correspondingly in figs 14a and b numerical results indicate that the spudcan re installation is no longer affected by the footprint with β dini 2 0 for dini drep 18 m i e group ii table 1 by contrast an offset distance of β dini 2 7 is required for dini 10 m and drep 18 m i e group iv table 1 which is equivalent to β drep 1 5 if the larger spudcan diameter is used to normalise the offset distance furthermore the horizontal and moment loads are almost negligible at β dini 1 5 for dini 18 m and drep 10 m i e group iii table 1 see fig 14b therefore it is considered that an offset distance of 1 5 2 0 times max dini drep is able to result in a minimal influence of the footprint on the re installation a series of numerical analyses were also performed for a spudcan with a fully rough base the parameters in group ii of table 1 were considered with dini dini 1 0 and β dini 0 25 1 75 the computed peak horizontal and moment loads at different offset distances are included in fig 14a due to the additional frictional resistance at the spudcan soil interface the re installation of spudcan with a rough base induces higher loads than a smooth spudcan in particular for β dini 1 0 where the footprint underneath the spudcan tends to undergo a slope failure like soil flow mechanism nevertheless the roughness of the spudcan base has no effect on the critical offset distance as the maximum peak loads are still induced at β dini 0 5 which is consistent with the smooth spudcans 4 conclusions for spudcan footprint interaction in clay deposits only a very limited range of installation depths and undrained shear strengths have been investigated in previous studies this paper presents numerical results from a large number of large deformation finite element analyses the numerical model has been validated against the centrifuge test data from existing publications a parametric study has then been conducted covering a comprehensive range of parameters within the practical interest including the initial penetration depth dini spudcan diameters adopted for initial penetration dini and re installation drep soil sensitivity st undrained shear strength profile su and offset distance β the vertical horizontal and moment loads induced during spudcan footprint interaction have been compared the comparisons have indicated the following key conclusions a for spudcan re installation near the footprint at β dini 0 5 the penetration resistance profile during spudcan re installation is lower than that during initial penetration the discrepancy increases with increasing dini dini but will diminish as the spudcan approaches dini caution should be exercised in practice to ensure that the jack up leg is sufficiently long for the re installation especially for a footprint formed by deep initial penetration b for spudcan re installation near the footprint at β dini 0 5 with different spudcan diameters the normalised horizontal and moment loads are the lowest for dini drep while the corresponding normalised penetration resistance i e vertical bearing capacity factor is the highest therefore one of the possible scenarios to lower the risk of spudcan footprint interaction if possible is to employ a jack up rig with a larger spudcan than the one that forms the footprint c the sensitivity has insignificant effect on the peak horizontal load induced at shallow penetration depths during spudcan footprint interaction while higher sensitivity leads to increased peak moment load reduced penetration resistance and hence a higher risk from spudcan footprint interaction d the critical offset distance that induces the maximum peak horizontal and moment

22573,the re installation of jack up rigs near an existing footprint left by the previous installation can be problematic due to the development of horizontal and moment loads on the spudcan footing and hence on the rigs this paper reports large deformation finite element results of spudcan footprint interaction in non uniform clay deposits the performance of the numerical model was verified by simulations of existing centrifuge tests a detailed parametric study was carried out varying influential factors including the initial spudcan penetration depth to form the footprint spudcan diameters soil sensitivity undrained shear strength profile and the offset distance between spudcan and footprint centres the effects of these factors on the development of the vertical horizontal and moment loads are quantified and the peak magnitudes of the induced horizontal and moment loads at different offset distances are then compared it is found through the numerical analyses that the critical offset distance which maximises the peak horizontal and moment loads on the spudcan ranges between 0 5 and 0 75 times the diameter of the spudcan used for the formation of the footprint by contrast an offset distance of 1 5 2 0 times the diameter of the larger spudcan of those used for initial penetration and re installation is able to result in a minimal influence of the footprint on the re

mobile jack up rigs are self elevating platforms that are widely used in offshore hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation in shallow to moderate water depths today s jack ups typically consist of a buoyant triangular platform supported by three independent vertically retractable k lattice legs each resting on a spudcan footing due to their flexibility and cost effectiveness and the increasing number of production sites worldwide there is an escalating demand for jack up rigs to return to established sites to drill additional wells to provide a workover platform or to install new structures killalea 2002 gan et al 2012 hossain et al 2017 however the interaction between the spudcan and the footprint which refers to seabed depression or crater left from previous spudcan installations can be problematic grammatikopoulou et al 2007 insafejip 2011 iso 2012 hartono et al 2014 the problems of spudcan footprint interaction arise from a the difference in resistance between original soil and the disturbed soil in the footprint area and b the slope at the footprint perimeter iso 2012 these lead to different vertical and horizontal soil resistance on the two sides of the spudcan foundation for spudcan penetration near or partially overlapping the footprint and hence horizontal and moment loads are induced the induced loads cause large detrimental stresses in the jack up legs and hence may lead to structural failure of the jack up rig osborne et al 2006 teh et al 2006 cassidy et al 2009 current industry standard iso 19905 1 iso 2012 recommends keeping an edge to edge distance of one spudcan diameter between the spudcan and the footprint although previous experimental studies suggested different critical offset distances between the centres of spudcan and footprint of 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 spudcan diameter that maximised the peak horizontal and moment loads the effect of offset distance was investigated only for shallow penetration depth of 0 31 0 61 spudcan diameter stewart and finnie 2001 cassidy et al 2009 or within the depth of footprint cavity kong et al 2013 it is hard to reproduce the entire process of spudcan re installation over an existing footprint using traditional small strain numerical approaches one of the earliest attempts was made by jardine et al 2002 who simulated spudcan footprint interaction on a three layer deposit but the problem was simplified as plane strain recently three dimensional large deformation finite element ldfe methods were employed to reproduce spudcan re installation on footprints hartono et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 however only one analysis was presented by hartono et al 2014 while zhang et al 2015 investigated idealised footprint without considering soil strength heterogeneity caused by spudcan installation and extraction the spudcan installation depth and the undrained shear strength profile explored in previous experimental and numerical studies were very limited all these studies except those with manually created footprints used the same spudcan during the processes of footprint formation and spudcan re installation while in practice jack up rigs with different sizes of spudcan footings may be deployed moreover the magnitudes of the induced horizontal and moment loads are dependent on the soil heterogeneity caused by the formation of the footprint leung et al 2007 gan et al 2012 but the effect of soil sensitivity on the spudcan footprint interaction has not been explored yet this paper reports the results from a comprehensive numerical study of spudcan footprint interaction a spudcan was first installed and extracted in order to form the footprint and another spudcan with the same or different diameter was re installed at a certain offset distance compared to previous studies a more extensive range of parameters within the practical interest is covered including the initial penetration depth that forms the footprint the relative sizes of the spudcans used for the initial penetration and re installation soil sensitivity the undrained shear strength profiles of the deposits and the offset distance between spudcan and footprint centres the maximum magnitudes of the loads induced at different offset distances are then compared with the aim of exploring the offset distances that are critical to the rigs during spudcan footprint interaction in non uniform clays 2 numerical model as spudcan penetration is accompanied by significant soil movement deformation and remoulding hossain and randolph 2009 hossain et al 2014 ldfe analyses were carried out using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach in the commercial package abaqus explicit simulia 2014 the schematic of the problem is illustrated in fig 1 where the footprint is formed by the initial penetration and extraction of a spudcan with diameter dini in the non uniform clay deposit with the effective unit weight of γ the intact undrained shear strength of the clay is su sum kz where sum is the intact undrained shear strength at the seabed surface and k is the rate of increase in su with the soil depth z the spudcan interacting with the footprint has a diameter of drep and is displaced vertically at an offset distance β from the centre of the initial penetration or footprint 2 1 model set up by considering the three dimensional loading condition and the geometrical symmetry a half three dimensional model was used as shown in fig 2 two spudcan diameters of 10 and 18 m were simulated with the spudcan shape scaled from those of the mod v class a jack ups cassidy et al 2009 hossain et al 2015 unless otherwise stated to avoid the boundary effect in the analyses the dimensions of the soil domain were chosen as 180 m in length 72 m on the left side of the footprint centre and 108 m on the offset side 72 m in width and 35 63 m in depth for different installation depths the spudcan together with the jack up leg was modelled as a rigid body the lateral and rotational spudcan displacements were not allowed and thus possible leg splay during spudcan footprint interaction was not simulated the reactions i e the loads induced at the load reference point lrp were recorded including the vertical v horizontal h and moment m loads as shown in fig 1 with the sign convention for v h and m following butterfield et al 1997 the positive horizontal and moment loads prevent the spudcan from moving towards the footprint and rotating anti clockwise respectively smooth soil spudcan interface was adopted in the analysis unless otherwise stated the soil was discretised as eulerian elements the eulerian mesh included the original soil domain and an overlying layer initially filled with void material to accommodate possible upward soil movement at the seabed surface a cuboid of fine mesh was created along the trajectory of the spudcans with the minimum element size of 0 025 min dini drep the penetration velocity of spudcan in the numerical analysis was taken as 0 3 m s balancing the computational cost and accuracy which was testified as sufficiently slow to minimise the inertial effect this is similar to the conclusions drawn by qiu and henke 2011 tho et al 2012 and zheng et al 2015b 2017 who adopted the penetration velocity of 0 5 0 17 and 0 1 m s respectively 2 2 constitutive model the elastoplastic tresca model was adopted but extended to capture strain rate and strain softening effects of clay deposits the incorporation of strain rate dependency minimises the effect of mesh dependency related to softening materials which has been recognised as one of the effective methods as it prevents the governing equations from losing ellipticity needleman 1988 oka 2005 zhou and randolph 2007 the undrained shear strength suc is updated following einav and randolph 2005 as 1 s uc 1 μ max γ γ ref γ ref δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u the first bracketed term augments the strength according to the maximum shear strain rate γ relative to a reference value γ ref of 1 h which falls within the range for typical triaxial tests erbrich 2005 the rate parameter μ was taken as 0 1 for circular spudcan foundations low et al 2008 the second bracketed term represents the strength degradation due to the accumulated absolute plastic shear strain ξ and δrem is the inverse of sensitivity st the relative ductility is controlled by the parameter ξ95 which represents the cumulative shear strain required for 95 remoulding a typical value of ξ95 1200 was adopted which falls within the typical range of 10 25 as suggested by randolph 2004 through matching degradation curves from cyclic penetration and extraction tests on t bar and ball penetrometers the same set of parameters have been adopted by zheng et al 2015a 2015b 2016 2018 to simulate centrifuge tests of spudcan penetration in clays with reasonable agreement obtained between numerical and experiment results similar values of the above parameters were also used by dutta et al 2015 hossain et al 2014 hossain et al 2015 tho et al 2012 wang et al 2010 and zhou and randolph 2009 in the simulations of centrifuge tests and case histories for different offshore geotechnical problems it should be noted that variation of the parameters in equation 1 may vary the computed spudcan response to some extent as detailed by hossain and randolph 2009 a uniform stiffness ratio of e suc 200 was adopted where e is the young s modulus considering relatively fast penetration of spudcans in the field all the analyses simulated undrained conditions in clay layers with poisson s ratio of 0 49 the geostatic stress conditions were modelled with the coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest of 1 2 3 variation of parameters in numerical analyses the numerical analyses performed are summarised in table 1 where dini is the initial installation depth measured from the intact mudline to the lrp of the spudcan the centrifuge tests reported by cassidy et al 2009 and gan et al 2012 i e group i in table 1 were reproduced for verification purpose the parameters in the retrospective simulations were the same as those reported except for the sensitivity st of which no exact value is given the sensitivity of uwa university of western australia kaolin clay used in the centrifuge tests of cassidy et al 2009 and gan et al 2012 has a typical range of st 2 3 hu et al 2014 as such a value of st 2 8 was adopted for the centrifuge tests by cassidy et al 2009 since the same value was taken by zheng et al 2015a 2016 2017 2018 for the simulation of centrifuge tests of spudcan penetration in uwa kaolin clays a value of st 2 0 was chosen for the centrifuge test by gan et al 2012 who reported st 2 2 5 a parametric study groups ii vi table 1 varying parameters within the practical interest was then conducted to investigate the effects of initial penetration depth spudcan diameter soil sensitivity undrained shear strength profile and offset distance 3 numerical results and discussion the load penetration profiles from the simulations of centrifuge tests and the parametric study are discussed in this section the profiles are presented in terms of v h and m or dimensionless quantities v asu0 h asu0 and m adrepsu0 varying as a function of the penetration depth d where a is the plan area of the spudcan on which the loads are measured and su0 is the undrained shear strength at the spudcan base level see fig 1 3 1 simulation of centrifuge tests 3 1 1 cassidy et al 2009 cassidy et al 2009 conducted centrifuge tests in non uniform overconsolidated clay investigating the effects of offset distance preload level and jack up leg stiffness on the spudcan footprint interaction response retrospective numerical analyses were performed for preload levels of 40 60 and 80 mn of which the v h and m profiles are available in the publication the spudcan diameter and soil parameters for each test are listed in group i table 1 two spudcan shapes mod v and 116c were modelled while the same spudcan was used in each test to form the footprint initial penetration and then re penetrate the deposit i e dini drep in the initial penetration stage of the centrifuge tests the spudcan penetrated to a depth where the predetermined preload level was achieved while in the numerical analyses the spudcan penetrated to the corresponding average depth measured in the tests of the same preload level the footprint geometries in the centrifuge tests and the numerical analyses after the initial penetration and extraction of the spudcan are plotted in fig 3 the computed footprint depths range between 0 21 0 29dini which are deeper than the measured ones ranging between 0 047 0 082dini the main reason may be that base suction was not considered in the numerical simulation during spudcan extraction due to the limitation of the cel approach which may have resulted in a deeper footprint nevertheless similar to the centrifuge test results the computed footprint depths also increase with increasing magnitude of preload i e initial penetration depth and are within the typical range of 0 16 0 33dini reported by case histories and other centrifuge tests rapoport and young 1987 stewart and finnie 2001 teh et al 2010 gan et al 2012 hossain et al 2017 fig 4 shows the penetration resistance vertical load profiles from the numerical analyses and centrifuge tests for both the initial penetration and re installation of the spudcan for the initial penetration cassidy et al 2009 reported the resistance profiles from all the centrifuge tests which are assumed to have the same undrained shear strength profile so the upper and lower bounds for each spudcan model are included in fig 4a for comparison for the re installation only the data for test otdr3 are available which are compared with the numerical result in fig 4b overall the computed vertical load during initial penetration is bounded by the centrifuge test results while the experimental and numerical penetration resistance profiles for spudcan re installation are close the major difference appears at shallow penetration of d 3 m which may be caused by a the deeper footprint in the numerical analysis and b the existence of stronger top soils in the centrifuge tests compared to the adopted linear strength profile which resulted from the preparation of overconsolidated clay sample in the centrifuge test purwana et al 2005 cassidy et al 2009 wang and bienen 2016 the horizontal and moment loads induced during spudcan footprint interaction are compared in fig 5 the measured and computed profiles are in a relatively reasonable agreement the peak h and m values are generally overestimated by the numerical analyses this may be caused by the deeper footprint in the numerical analysis the overestimation may also be partly attributed to the rigid jack up leg assumed in the numerical simulation which did not allow any lateral displacement of the spudcan during spudcan footprint interaction the model legs in the tests have a certain flexural stiffness which allowed the spudcan to move laterally due to leg deflection under the horizontal force and moment the incorporation of structural flexibility may lead to a reduction on the induced loads when compared to a rigid leg stewart and finnie 2001 kong 2012 kong et al 2013 3 1 2 gan et al 2012 to further validate the numerical model numerical analysis was performed simulating the centrifuge test oc3 conducted by gan et al 2012 in the centrifuge test the spudcan was extracted immediately after it penetrated to the initial penetration depth and then re installed after a prototype time of 1 year the spudcan diameter and soil parameters are listed in group i table 1 the measured and computed contour plots of the undrained shear strength just before spudcan re installation are compared in fig 6 the measured contour was generated from the undrained shear strength profiles obtained from a series of ball penetrometer tests which were performed at 0 25dini intervals away from the footprint centre up to a distance of 1 5dini gan et al 2012 it should be noted that the contour map reported by gan et al 2012 is for the shear strength ratio between the footprint and the undisturbed soil data points of the reported contour lines for the shear strength ratio were digitised and then used to generate the contour map for the undrained shear strength it can be seen that the computed footprint depth is about 0 21dini which is slightly deeper than that observed from the centrifuge test this is consistent with the comparison discussed previously for cassidy et al 2009 the major disturbed area z dini 0 7 radial distance 0 5dini in the numerical simulation has a lower strength compared to that observed from the centrifuge test however it should be noted that an elapsed time of 1 year was modelled in the centrifuge test allowing the footprint to consolidate before the strength contour was measured this process was not simulated in the numerical analysis fig 7 compares the experimental and numerical results of the vertical horizontal and moment loads the penetration resistance profiles during initial penetration are close but tend to diverge after a penetration depth of around 4 m while the computed vertical loads during the re installation of the spudcan are higher than the centrifuge test data this may be explained by the fact that the fitted undrained shear strength profile which was used in the retrospective simulation is generally higher than that measured by t bar tests see fig 2 of gan et al 2012 the depth where the v profiles of initial penetration start to diverge is nearly identical to the depth where the fitted and measured undrained shear strength profiles start to diverge nevertheless the peak h and m values are reasonably simulated with an error of 2 9 and 18 0 respectively total stress analyses were performed and hence suction was not simulated during spudcan extraction nevertheless the reasonable agreement between the measured and computed results for a number of five centrifuge tests from two different previous studies suggests that the neglect of base suction in the numerical simulation may have a minimal effect on the spudcan footprint interaction response 3 2 effect of initial penetration depth on induced loads to investigate the effect of the initial penetration depth on the spudcan footprint interaction response the v h and m profiles at the critical offset distance suggested by cassidy et al 2009 i e β dini 0 5 for dini dini 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 are plotted in fig 8 the other parameters were taken as dini drep 18 m su 5 1z kpa and st 2 8 group ii table 1 for the comparison of vertical loads the penetration resistance profile from initial penetration is included in fig 8a due to soil remoulding around the footprint area all the penetration resistance profiles from spudcan re installation are lower than that from spudcan penetration in the intact seabed the discrepancy between the v profiles for initial penetration and re installation enhances with increasing initial penetration depth dini dini but they all tend to merge back into the response of spudcan penetration in the intact soil as the spudcan approaches the initial penetration depth therefore caution should be exercised in practice to ensure that the jack up leg used in the re installation is sufficiently long as the penetration depth is increased during the re installation compared with the initial penetration under the same vertical load especially for the footprint formed by deep initial penetration the value of h increases rapidly at shallow depths when the spudcan base starts to interact with the footprint slope and then shows a plateau before decreasing almost linearly with penetration depth the most detrimental horizontal load for dini dini 0 5 is positive with the value of 0 89 mn by contrast for dini dini 1 0 and 1 5 the positive peak h values that occur at shallow penetration depths are similar to that of dini dini 0 5 but negative h values with larger magnitudes are developed for deep penetration however this may not be the case in the field as the equivalent leg stiffness ei l3 where ei is the flexural rigidity of the leg and l is the leg length measured from the hull to the spudcan reduces significantly for deep penetration which as discussed previously can lead to a significant reduction in the magnitude of the induced loads the m profiles remain positive until reducing sharply as the spudcan approaches dini for dini dini 0 5 and 1 0 the moment load increases monotonically with penetration depth forming peak m values of 26 22 mn m and 28 11 mn m near the initial penetration depth respectively the m profile for dini dini 1 5 increases up to the depth of about d dini 0 66 d 12 m and then decreases with penetration depth the rate of reduction increases rapidly as the spudcan approaches the initial penetration depth similar forms of the h and m profiles were reported by gan et al 2012 3 3 effect of spudcan diameters on induced loads different jack up rigs with different sizes of spudcans may be used at the same sites therefore the effect of spudcan diameters on the spudcan footprint interaction response is explored by adopting different spudcan diameters for the initial penetration and the re installation i e dini drep two groups of numerical analyses were performed a spudcan re installation near a footprint created by a larger spudcan dini 18 m and drep 10 m group iii table 1 and b spudcan re installation near a footprint created by a smaller spudcan dini 10 m and drep 18 m group iv table 1 the undrained strength profile was selected as su 5 1z kpa and st 2 8 and the footprint was formed by spudcan penetration to the depth of dini 9 m as larger spudcan diameter intrinsically leads to larger magnitude of loads to eliminate this effect the normalised profiles v asu0 h asu0 and m adrepsu0 at the offset distance of β dini 0 5 are plotted in fig 9 the corresponding profiles from the numerical analyses for dini drep 10 m and dini drep 18 m are also included to compare the vertical loads induced during spudcan footprint interaction the penetration resistance profiles from the initial penetration of spudcans of dini 10 and 18 m are also plotted in fig 9a it is seen that the normalised profiles from the initial penetration of spudcans of different diameters are identical to each other once the spudcans are fully embedded by contrast the normalised penetration resistance profiles from spudcan re installation are affected by the relative size of spudcans used for initial penetration and re installation the normalised penetration resistance profiles for spudcan re installation are lower than those for initial penetration once the spudcan penetrates over the initial mudline the larger the extent of the footprint area and hence the disturbed and remoulded area compared to the spudcan diameter used for re installation the lower the vertical bearing capacity is mobilised at least up to the initial penetration depth dini for example once the spudcan is fully embedded the vertical load for the case of dini drep 18 m is generally 5 15 lower than that for dini 10 m and drep 18 m after the spudcan penetrates over the initial penetration depth the v profiles start to merge together with the response of initial penetration regardless of the spudcan diameters for the induced horizontal and moment loads the normalised profiles for dini 18 m and drep 10 m are lower than those for dini drep 18 m at shallow penetration depths but the discrepancy diminishes with spudcan penetration this is due to the difference in soil heterogeneity and evolution of soil flow mechanism during the penetration of the spudcans with different diameters as illustrated in fig 10 where the velocity vectors and shear strength contours are plotted at touchdown level d 0 fig 10a shows that the difference in soil strength between the two sides of the large spudcan drep 18 m is greater than the small one drep 10 m resulting in larger magnitudes of resultant resistances leftward force and anticlockwise moment about lrp and hence positive h and m values meanwhile the soil underneath the spudcan of drep 10 m is predominantly directed horizontally towards the footprint centre the soil flow underneath the spudcan of drep 18 m is similar but with additional resistance resulting from the outward and upward soil flow around the spudcan edge on the offset side for spudcan penetration below the footprint cavity e g d 8 m fig 10b demonstrates similar soil flow mechanisms around both spudcans and the undrained shear strengths around the edges of the two spudcans are also similar which lead to close resultant resistances at this depth the horizontal force and moment for dini 18 m and drep 10 m are found to be higher than those for dini drep 10 m this may be due to the difference in the dimensions of the footprints formed by different dini the footprints formed by dini 18 m and 10 m have the depths of about 5 3 m and 3 1 m respectively with similar slopes of 0 27 and 0 3 the discrepancy between h profiles is more significant than that between m profiles this is consistent with the findings by kong et al 2013 that for the same spudcan interacting with footprints with different depths but with the same footprint slope and ratio of offset distance to footprint width an increase in footprint depth results in increasing horizontal load while its influence on increasing the moment load is less significant among the four spudcan footprint interaction responses the magnitudes of the normalised horizontal and moment loads for dini 10 m and drep 18 m are the lowest while its normalised penetration resistance i e vertical bearing capacity factor is the highest as dini drep the footprint dimensions and the extent of the soil remoulding relative to drep are smaller than those with dini drep therefore one of the possible scenarios to lower the risk of spudcan footprint interaction if possible is to employ a jack up rig with a larger spudcan than the one that forms the footprint 3 4 effect of sensitivity on induced loads the v h and m profiles obtained from numerical analyses of group v in table 1 for β dini 0 5 are plotted in fig 11 to investigate the effect of sensitivity st on the development of the vertical horizontal and moment loads during spudcan footprint interaction the value of st was varied as 2 8 4 and 5 while the other parameters were kept constant it is seen from fig 11a that similar to previous findings the penetration resistance profiles for spudcan re installation are much lower than those for initial penetration but tend to merge back into the initial penetration response as the spudcan approaches the initial penetration depth the v profile also becomes lower for a higher sensitivity however the effect of sensitivity on the re installation is much more obvious than on the initial penetration as st increases from 2 8 to 5 the penetration resistance profile from initial penetration reduces by 7 while that from re installation has a 20 overall reduction fig 11b indicates that although similar horizontal loads are induced at shallow penetration depths up to d 6 7 m the form of the h profile has changed as st increases from 2 8 to 5 instead of deceasing monotonically with penetration depth to a negative value the h profile for st 5 remains positive before the spudcan approaches the initial penetration depth dini variation of soil sensitivity does not change the form of the m profile which increases monotonically with penetration depth until a sharp reduction as the spudcan approaches dini for the explored sensitivities and penetration depths the most detrimental moment loads peak m values are all positive and increase with increasing sensitivity with the magnitudes of 14 5 mn m 33 5 mn m and 39 7 mn m for st 2 8 4 and 5 respectively the velocity vectors and soil strength contours at the penetration depth of d 16 m are plotted in fig 12 to illustrate the reason for the variation of h and m profiles with soil sensitivity although the soil failure mechanisms for different sensitivities are similar with localised soil flow on both sides of the spudcan the soil strengths on the footprint side decrease with increasing sensitivity and the strengths are similar on the offset side negative horizontal load is induced at deep spudcan penetration for a relatively low sensitivity of 2 8 as the sensitivity increases from 2 8 to 5 the horizontal load due to strength heterogeneity becomes more dominant and the spudcan tends to slide from the strong soil to the weak the induced moment load remains positive until the spudcan gets close to dini triggering the squeezing soil failure mechanism underneath the footprint side of the spudcan base the remoulded soil between the spudcan base and the intact soil below dini is squeezed out horizontally towards the footprint centre leading to a sharp increase of vertical resistance on the footprint side of the spudcan and hence a corresponding reduction on the positive moment load 3 5 effect of undrained shear strength profile fig 13 compares the profiles of vertical horizontal and moment loads for the spudcan of dini drep 18 m penetrating in five different undrained shear strength profiles at the critical offset distance β dini 0 5 with sum 0 5 and 10 kpa k 1 and 2 kpa m and the initial penetration depth of dini dini 1 0 group vi table 1 the relationship between the v profiles of initial penetration and re installation is similar to previous findings for clarity penetration resistance profiles from initial penetration are only plotted for the normalised value v asu0 as shown in fig 13a to compare with those from re installation it is demonstrated that the magnitude of vertical load during spudcan footprint interaction is dominated by the local undrained shear strength su0 at the penetration depth with higher local strength leading to higher penetration resistance by contrast the normalised penetration resistance profiles from initial penetration and re installation merge into their respective narrow bands as deep localised failure mechanism is attained hossain et al 2014 the average value of the band for re installation is about 35 lower than that for spudcan penetration in intact soil but the spudcan footprint interaction response appears to return to the initial penetration response for spudcan penetration over the initial penetration depth the effect of undrained shear strength profile on the development of horizontal and moment loads is investigated in fig 13b and c respectively overall the peak values of h and m augments with the increase of the undrained shear strength because of the greater difference between the undrained shear strengths of the soil on the two sides of the spudcan the comparison indicates that the strength gradient k plays a more dominant role on the development of the h and m values compared to the soil strength sum at the mudline for the dimensionless quantities the normalised value h asu0 is generally lower for higher sum and k values while the normalised moment m adrepsu0 merges together after several metres of penetration and reduces almost linearly with depth before a sharp reduction as the spudcan approaches dini regardless of the strength parameters 3 6 identification of critical offset distances fig 14 is plotted to identify the critical offset distance for spudcan re installation in clay with the undrained shear strength increasing with depth covering a more comprehensive range of parameters of practical interest groups ii group vi table 1 as noted previously the negative horizontal load induced at deep spudcan penetration may not be realistic in the field therefore only the positive peak horizontal and moment loads of each load penetration profile are plotted as a function of the normalised offset distance β dini the maximum peak values of h and m are induced at a critical offset distance of β dini between 0 5 and 0 75 regardless of the variation of the initial penetration depth spudcan diameters soil sensitivity and undrained shear strength profile as evidenced by fig 10a the identified critical offset distance may attribute to a combination of a the major disturbed remoulded area of the footprint typically has a lateral extent of around 0 5 0 75dini and hence for spudcan re installation at β dini 0 5 0 75 the difference in soil resistance on the two sides of the spudcan base is more significant compared to other offset distances which results in larger induced loads b the footprint cavity is usually 0 75 1 0dini in radius and a slope failure like soil flow mechanism is developed as the spudcan starts to interact with the footprint at an offset distance of β dini 0 5 0 75 which leads to a higher tendency for the spudcan to slide towards the footprint centre and hence larger induced loads it is noted that for some cases the peak horizontal and moment loads at the offset distances of β dini 0 25 and 1 0 can still be comparable to those at β dini 0 5 and 0 75 a noticeable reduction on the peak loads can be seen for most cases when the offset distance increases to β dini 1 5 for cases where the same spudcan is used for the initial penetration and re installation dini drep the peak horizontal and moment loads at β dini 1 5 respectively range within about 40 60 and 15 25 of those at the critical offset distance by contrast percentages of only 11 5 and 4 3 are found for dini 18 m and drep 10 m while percentages as high as 79 9 and 57 9 have resulted from dini 10 m and drep 18 m fig 14b to explore the offset distance where the footprint has minimal effect on the re installation additional analyses were performed considering β dini 1 75 and 2 0 for group ii of table 1 with dini dini 1 0 as well as β dini 1 9 and 2 7 for group iv of table 1 the computed peak loads are included correspondingly in figs 14a and b numerical results indicate that the spudcan re installation is no longer affected by the footprint with β dini 2 0 for dini drep 18 m i e group ii table 1 by contrast an offset distance of β dini 2 7 is required for dini 10 m and drep 18 m i e group iv table 1 which is equivalent to β drep 1 5 if the larger spudcan diameter is used to normalise the offset distance furthermore the horizontal and moment loads are almost negligible at β dini 1 5 for dini 18 m and drep 10 m i e group iii table 1 see fig 14b therefore it is considered that an offset distance of 1 5 2 0 times max dini drep is able to result in a minimal influence of the footprint on the re installation a series of numerical analyses were also performed for a spudcan with a fully rough base the parameters in group ii of table 1 were considered with dini dini 1 0 and β dini 0 25 1 75 the computed peak horizontal and moment loads at different offset distances are included in fig 14a due to the additional frictional resistance at the spudcan soil interface the re installation of spudcan with a rough base induces higher loads than a smooth spudcan in particular for β dini 1 0 where the footprint underneath the spudcan tends to undergo a slope failure like soil flow mechanism nevertheless the roughness of the spudcan base has no effect on the critical offset distance as the maximum peak loads are still induced at β dini 0 5 which is consistent with the smooth spudcans 4 conclusions for spudcan footprint interaction in clay deposits only a very limited range of installation depths and undrained shear strengths have been investigated in previous studies this paper presents numerical results from a large number of large deformation finite element analyses the numerical model has been validated against the centrifuge test data from existing publications a parametric study has then been conducted covering a comprehensive range of parameters within the practical interest including the initial penetration depth dini spudcan diameters adopted for initial penetration dini and re installation drep soil sensitivity st undrained shear strength profile su and offset distance β the vertical horizontal and moment loads induced during spudcan footprint interaction have been compared the comparisons have indicated the following key conclusions a for spudcan re installation near the footprint at β dini 0 5 the penetration resistance profile during spudcan re installation is lower than that during initial penetration the discrepancy increases with increasing dini dini but will diminish as the spudcan approaches dini caution should be exercised in practice to ensure that the jack up leg is sufficiently long for the re installation especially for a footprint formed by deep initial penetration b for spudcan re installation near the footprint at β dini 0 5 with different spudcan diameters the normalised horizontal and moment loads are the lowest for dini drep while the corresponding normalised penetration resistance i e vertical bearing capacity factor is the highest therefore one of the possible scenarios to lower the risk of spudcan footprint interaction if possible is to employ a jack up rig with a larger spudcan than the one that forms the footprint c the sensitivity has insignificant effect on the peak horizontal load induced at shallow penetration depths during spudcan footprint interaction while higher sensitivity leads to increased peak moment load reduced penetration resistance and hence a higher risk from spudcan footprint interaction d the critical offset distance that induces the maximum peak horizontal and moment loads is ranged between β dini 0 5 and 0 75 regardless of the variation of the initial penetration depth spudcan diameters soil sensitivity and undrained shear strength profile e an offset distance of 1 5 2 0 times max dini drep is able to result in a minimal influence of the footprint on the re installation acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of

22574,in this paper unsteady cavitating flows around a twisted naca 66 mod hydrofoil are simulated with both standard and non linear k ε turbulence models for the standard k ε turbulence model no significant cavitation shedding is observed and size of the calculated cavitation regions is much smaller than the experimental results for the non linear k ε turbulence model fair agreement with the experimental data are observed for the cavitation region flow structures and the primary cavitation shedding frequency it is observed that the non dimensional primary shedding frequency based on the maximum cavity length s t l c depends linearly on the factor 1 σ and the side entrant jets is the inducement of the secondary shedding of the cloud cavitation at last a 7 3 attenuation law similar to other les results is captured in the broadband parts of the psd curves of the pressure and hydrodynamic force keywords twisted hydrofoil side entrant jets non linear turbulence model 1 introduction three dimensional unsteady cavitating flow is a complex multi phase turbulent flow including phase transitions flow separations and multi scale vortex structures unsteady cavitation often occurs on lifting surfaces such as surface ships and underwater vehicles which it is the major cause of performance deterioration vibration noise and even surface erosion of those underwater equipments the occurrence of unsteady partial cavitation is often related to the presence of the re entrant jets in the cavity closure region lush and skipp 1986 used the high speed photography technique to study the cavitating flow in a duct and the periodic shedding of partial cavitation induced by re entrant flow was observed in their study in order to give a better visualization of re entrant jets the dye injection technique was used on the experimental study of a plano convex foil cavitating flow le et al 1993 they found that unlike the thin stable cavity flow thick cavity flow was always unsteady and the re entrant jet played a key role in the shedding of cloud cavitation high speed photography and pressure measurement technique were used to study the cloud shedding on a two dimensional hydrofoil by kawanami et al 1997 in their study the re entrant jets were observed and they found that the cloud cavitation can be effectively inhibited by placing a small obstacle on the suction surface of the foil callenaere et al 2001 experimentally investigated the unsteady cavitation on a two dimensional backward facing step they found that the cavity thickness and the adverse pressure gradient are the most important parameters in the analysis of the re entrant jet instability laberteaux and ceccio 2001a experimentally studied the partial cavitating flows on two dimensional wedges plano convex hydrofoil and naca 0009 hydrofoil the re entrant jets were not observed in both two dimensional wedges and plano convex hydrofoil flow but the re entrant jets were observed in the flow around the two dimensional naca 0009 hydrofoil and cause periodic shedding of the cloud cavitation in the study by laberteaux and ceccio 2001b stable partial cavitation with re entrant flow was observed for flows around a three dimensional hydrofoil this does not necessarily mean that unsteady cloud cavitation with re entrant flow cannot be observed in three dimensional hydrofoil foeth et al 2006 and foeth et al 2008 used time resolved piv and high speed camera to study the partial cavitation on a three dimensional twisted hydrofoil with a span wise varied angle of attack and they found that the primary shedding of cloud cavitation depends on the momentum and direction of re entrant flow and the secondary shedding is induced by the side entrant jets in the closure region of a cavity accurate calculating the unsteady behaviors of the cavitating flows is one of the major goals of the numerical simulations the key factors for obtaining fine results from cavitating flow simulations are cavitation models and turbulence models homogeneous hypothesis has been widely used in cavitating flow simulation in this hypothesis the cavitating area is considered as a single fluid with fully mixed vapor and liquid kubota et al 1992 under this hypothesis two kinds of models are often used one is the state equation model e g coutier delgosha et al 2003b and goncalves and patella 2009 previous experimental studies laberteaux and ceccio 2001b gopalan et al 2002 shown that the baroclinic torque term is the key factor for the vorticity production in the partial cavity closure region but in the state equation model the gradients of density and pressure always keep in parallel so this model cannot properly reflect the baroclinic torque term the other is the transport equation model which is based on rayleigh plesset equations and an additional equation of vapor or liquid volume fraction which including source terms for condensation and evaporation is needed merkle 1998 there are many similar cavitation models based on the transport equation model e g kunz et al 2000 schnerr and sauer 2001 singhal et al 2002 and zwart et al 2004 many comparative studies on those cavitation models especially for the empirical parameters in the source terms have been done in the past ten years senocak and wei 2004 frikha et al 2008 morgut et al 2011 ducoin et al 2012 another crucial technique for cavitating flow simulation is the turbulence modeling although high accuracy methods like large eddy simulation les and partially averaged navier stokes pans method girimaji 2006 have been successfully applied to cavitating flow simulation in recent years bensow and bark 2010 ji et al 2013 2015 chen et al 2017 long et al 2018 the huge consumptions of computing resource limit the wide application of those methods in the industrial field reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations remain the primary cfd solver in practical cavitating flow simulations due to its low computational cost and reasonable accuracy kunz et al 2000 coutier delgosha et al 2003a wilson et al 2006 goncalves and patella 2009 goncalves 2011 morgut et al 2011 decaix and goncalvès 2013 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 most of the turbulence models are based on the boussinesq viscosity hypothesis which has been used successfully in turbulent flows dominated by shear stress pope 2001 in this kind of flow the constitute relationship between strain rate and reynolds stress tensor can be described by a linear expression however this kind of linear model fails for the strong separation or rotating flows experimental studies in eddy flows shown that the strain rate and reynolds stress are not aligned in strong swirling flow region chow et al 1997a b recently churchfield and blaisdell 2009 found that for most of the typical turbulence models including one equation model two equation models and shear stress transport model none of them can accurately capture the spatial lag between the reynolds stress and the corresponding strain rate components in the strong swirling regions to get out from this predicament the performance of the nonlinear turbulence model proposed by shih et al 1993 1995 is investigated for cavitating flows with separation in this paper this nonlinear k ε model has been successfully applied for tip vortex simulations in our previous study liu et al 2016 the main purpose of the present paper is to study the effect of cavity growth and shedding of the cloud cavitating flows the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 we first present the mathematical formulations and numerical method used in this study in section 2 1 then the cavitation and turbulence models are presented in sections 2 2 and 2 3 respectively the simulation setup and the validations are presented in section 3 detailed results and discussions are presented in section 4 finally we summarize this work and draw the main conclusions in section 5 2 descriptions of the problems and numerical methods in the present study a similarly twisted hydrofoil of foeth et al 2006 but with different wing section was used a pair of extra straight parts 12 5 mm for each is installed on both sides of this twisted middle part and the size of this foil is 225 100mm which is different with the delft twisted hydrofoil 294 150mm the experimental results used in this paper are provided by the china ship scientific research center cssrc and part of the experimental results can be found in peng et al 2016 the three dimensional naca 66 mod twisted hydrofoil used in this paper was shown in fig 1 for the torsional part the angle increases smoothly toward the center along the span wise and in both sides the angle increase from α m i n 0 to α m a x 11 the angle along the span wise can be described by a polynomial which is presented in eq 1 in this study the angle of attack of the whole twisted hydrofoil is α 2 and the inflow velocity is u 7 m s the cavitation number σ p p v 1 2 ρ u 2 varies from 1 3 to 1 8 and the static pressure p is adjusted based on the cavitation number 1 α α m i n 0 z 12 5 α m a x 16 z 3 12 z 2 1 α m i n 12 5 z 212 5 α m a x 212 5 z 225 where z z 12 5 200 1 2 2 1 governing equations for multiphase flow simulation in this paper the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are solved coupled with mass transfer model and turbulence model a homogeneous hypothesis is used to simplify the complex multiphase flow problem to a simpler single flow problem which means that the slip velocity between those two phases is ignored under this homogeneous mixture assumption the mixture density is presented in eq 2 2 ρ m ρ l α l ρ v α v and the mixture dynamic viscosity has a similar expression 3 μ m μ l α l μ v α v where ρ l is the water density and ρ v is the vapor density μ l and μ v are the dynamic viscosity of water and vapor respectively α l and α v are the volume fractions of water and vapor respectively the relationship between these two volume fractions is α l 1 α v the continuity and momentum equations for the cavitating flow are 4 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 5 t ρ m u i x j ρ m u i u j p x i x j μ m u i x j u j x i ρ m τ i j x j where τ i j is the reynolds stress and will be calculated by a nonlinear viscosity model in section 2 3 2 2 cavitation model the cavitation model used in this paper was proposed by schnerr and sauer 2001 and the vapor water volume fractions are governed by the vapor volume fraction transport equations 6 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u j x j m m m where m c v ρ l ρ v ρ m 3 α v r b 2 3 min 0 p p v ρ l m c c ρ l ρ v ρ m 3 1 α v r b 2 3 max 0 p p v ρ l r b α v 1 α v 3 4 π 1 n 1 3 and m m m is the net phase change rate of vapor m and m is the vapor generation and condensation rates respectively r b is the radius of cavitation bubble n is the number density of cavitation bubbles p v is the saturated vapor pressure from the vapor volume fraction transport equation we can see that the processes of condensation and vaporization are determined by the local pressure in this simulation the number density of nuclei is n 1 6 1 0 13 nuclei m 3 the nuclei radius r 0 1 1 0 6 m and both the condensation and vaporization empirical constant c c and c v are set as 1 0 this cavitation model has been widely used in cavitating flow simulations frikha et al 2008 ji et al 2015 liu et al 2016 2 3 nonlinear viscosity model in numerical study most of the turbulent viscosity models are based on the bossinessq viscosity hypothesis such as spalart allmaras turbulence model standard k ε model k ω model and k ω sst model in this bossinessq hypothesis the deviatoric reynold stress τ i j d u i u j 2 3 k δ i j is linearly proportional to the mean rate of strain rate tensor s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 7 τ i j d 2 ν t s i j where ν t is the kinematic turbulent viscosity in the standard k ε turbulence model launder and spalding 1972 ν t c μ k 2 ε with c μ 0 9 for simple shear flows with weak mean pressure gradient and small mean streamline curvature the bossinessq viscosity hypothesis is reasonable but for those flows with strong pressure gradients and large streamline curvatures the turbulent models based on the bossinessq hypothesis will have poor applicability the closure model for rans simulations which can be successfully used in the flow simulations with strong swirling flow and large adverse pressure gradient is the reynolds stress model and the main difficulties to used reynolds stress model is the instability of the models and the complexity of the model implementation in addition the consumption of computer resources of this model is also more than the common turbulent viscosity model compared with the reynolds stress model nonlinear viscosity models add little cost on the two equation model and the nonlinear k ε model proposed by shih et al 1993 was used in present work in which the turbulent shear stress was described by the relationship as follows 8 τ i j 2 3 k δ i j 2 ν t s i j k 3 1000 η 3 ε 2 4 t i j 1 13 t i j 2 2 t i j 3 where t i j 1 u i x l u l x j u j x l u l x i 2 3 u l x k u k x l δ i j t i j 2 u i x k u j x k 1 3 u l x k u l x k δ i j t i j 3 u k x i u k x j 1 3 u l x k u l x k δ i j and kinematic viscosity ν t c μ k 2 ε where c μ 2 3 1 25 η 0 9 ζ 1 η k s ε ζ k ω ε δ i j is the kronecker delta function the nonlinear k ε model is a kind of high reynolds number model with wall functions and implemented as nonlinearkeshih in openfoam which is also known as the realizable reynolds stress algebraic equation model shih et al 1993 and this non linear model uses the same transport equations as the standard k ε model launder and spalding 1972 and the transport equations of turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε are presented as follows 9 k t u j k x j τ i j u i x j ε x j ν ν t σ k k x j 10 ε t u j ε x j c ε 1 τ i j u i x j c ε 2 ε 2 k x j ν ν t σ ε ε x j the closure coefficients are c ε 1 1 44 c ε 2 1 92 σ ε 1 3 σ k 1 0 3 validations of the computations 3 1 simulation setup cavitating flows at three different cavitation numbers were simulated in this study a multiphase flow solver inside the open source cfd package openfoam interphasechangefoam in this simulation the time dependent governing equations were discretized in both space and time domains using the node centered finite volume method the backward euler method was used for the time integration of this pde system all diffusion terms in this study were discretized using the second order central difference scheme and the second order upwind scheme is used for the convective terms in the momentum equations and turbulent transport equations the time step is 2 1 0 6 s and the maximum cfl number is under 0 5 for the cavitating flow simulations the quick discretization scheme was used to discretize the transport equation of volume fraction the pimple algorithm was used to solve the velocity pressure coupling problem between the momentum and continuity equations the outer and inner loops number of the pimple algorithm are 1 and 2 respectively one times non orthogonal correction and no sub relaxation correction was used to improve the stability of the cavitating flow simulation the simulation was started as a cavitating free flow simulation and the cavitation model will be turned on at 0 1 s as shown in fig 4 the computational domain and boundary conditions for this simulation were shown in fig 2 and the angle of attack for this twisted naca 66 mod hydrofoil is 2 the hydrofoil is located four times chord length c 0 1 m from the inlet boundary 1 125c from the top and bottom boundaries and 10c from the outlet boundary in this simulation the hydrofoil surface and the four tunnel walls were set to be non slip walls see fig 2 the fluid medium is water the kinematic viscosity is ν 9 1 0 7 m 2 s the density is ρ 1000 kg m 3 and the saturate vapor pressure p v 2337 pa according to the experimental temperature of t 20 c the inlet velocity u 7 m s so the reynolds number based on the chord length is r e 7 8 1 0 5 the outlet pressure was assigned according to the cavitation number by expression p o u t p v 1 2 ρ u 2 σ in this study three cases at different cavitation number σ 1 3 1 5 and 1 8 are studied so the corresponding outlet pressures are p o u t 34 369 pa 39297 pa and 46689 pa the values of k and ε are specified at the inlet boundary k 3 2 u i 2 ε c μ 0 75 k 1 5 c where the turbulent intensity i 0 4 these values are also set as the initial conditions in the whole computational domain 3 2 validation of the simulation setup a multi domain structured mesh was generated around this twisted hydrofoil using ansys icem for better capture of the cavitation region vortex structures local mesh refinement was performed along the spanwise and chordwise directions in the cavitation and wake region and the surface meshes on the hydrofoil surface and in the middle span section of the computational domain are shown in fig 3 the local refinement was conducted inside the openfoam and the mesh parameters for each set of mesh were presented in table 1 from the table we can see that between m2 and m1 there was about 39 increment of the total node numbers and the mesh refinement was concentrated on the span wise between m3 and m2 there was a huge increment in the total node numbers about 147 increment and the refinement was concentrated in the cloud cavitation region between m4 and m3 the refinement is concentrated on the chord wise compared with m3 the refine area is in the sheet cavitation area for the cavitation shape no significant difference can be found in the numerical results between m1 and m2 more vortex structures were captured by m2 in the downstream area of the sheet cavitation it means that the basic mesh is far from meeting the requirement of mesh density and mesh refinement around the closure region of the partial cavitation is necessary also between the second and third rows more detailed sheet and cloud cavitation structures and small scale vortex were captured from the results of m3 it means that the second level refinement is also necessary and in the last two rows of fig 3 no significant difference in both cavitation and vortex structures can be found and from the time history of the lift coefficients in fig 4 the similar tendency can also be observed there is a significant gap between the first and second lines and for the second and third curves the gap still existed but for the last two curves they almost overlap and in the relative errors based on the m4 mesh of the average lift coefficients in the time range 0 2 0 3 s a gradual reduction of errors was also observed the last two rows of table 1 therefore we choose the third mesh m3 for the cavitating flow simulations here after and for most of the foil surface the value of y is around 30 see fig 5 4 results and discussions 4 1 comparison between the standard and non linear k ε turbulence models the time histories of the lift coefficients for the standard and non linear k ε models are shown in fig 6 the average force coefficients averaged from 0 2 to 0 3 s are listed in table 3 as no corresponding force informations of the experimental study are available the relative errors are base on the results of the non linear k ε model from the force signals in fig 6 we can see that significant periodic shedding was observed in each flow for the non linear k ε model for the standard k ε model no shedding was observed even for the flow with the smallest cavitation number and a significant difference between the average force also exist between those turbulent models see table 3 and for quantitative analysis comparison of the shedding period between the experimental and numerical results are presented in table 4 for numerical study the shedding period is the reciprocal of the main shedding frequency first peak of the corresponding psds of the force coefficients shown in figs 15 17 from table 4 we can see that for the cavitating flows of σ 1 3 and 1 5 the shedding periods predicted by non linear k ε model fit well with the experimental results for σ 1 8 no significant shedding can be found in the experiment from the snapshots of the cavitation structures but the shedding phenomenon still exists for non linear k ε model at last the cavitation structures at the instance when they reach their max length are shown in fig 7 the corresponding quantitative analysis of the cavity lengths is presented in table 5 in fig 7 a significant difference of the cavitation size between the results of standard k ε model and the experimental study can be found especially for σ 1 3 and 1 5 the cavitation size is much smaller than the experimental results and the same conclusion can also drawn from the error analysis in table 5 for the non linear k ε model all the cavitation structures fit well with the corresponding experimental results especially for σ 1 3 the relative error for the cavity length is only 1 5 compared with the standard k ε model the results of non linear k ε model fit with the experimental results much better so in the following study we will use the results of non linear k ε model only 4 2 flow structures of shedding cavity for a better understanding of the shedding process snapshots of both experimental and numerical results are shown in figs 8 11 and 12 for σ 1 3 1 5 and 1 8 respectively and the predicted cavity shape is presented by the iso surface of phase function α 0 5 and the vortex structures are described by the iso surface of λ 2 1 1 0 6 figures in the left column are the experimental results and those in the middle and right columns are the predicted cavitation structures and vortex structures respectively the region inside the red and black dotted boxes are enlarged and represented in figs 9 and 10 respectively for more details in fig 9 the additional information is the streamlines colored by inflow velocity and in fig 10 the additional information is the surface pressure both re entrant and side entrant jets were clearly shown in fig 9 by the streamlines and marked by dotted arrows in fig 9 f and three sets of vortex systems can be found in fig 10 one set of vortex system inside the black dotted circle in the middle span and two sets of small vortex systems on both sides inside the red dotted circles in the first two columns of fig 8 both primary shedding and secondary shedding were observed by the numerical study and they all fit well with the experimental results the attached cavity has reached its maximum length in the last row of fig 8 and the flow will be reflected on the envelope of the cavitation interface lange and bruin 1997 the re entrant jets will have different directions in this twisted foil shown in fig 9 f side cavitation break up was found in fig 8 e 1 in the experimental study and two vapor cloud were also observed in both sides of the sheet cavitation as shown in figs 8 e 2 and 9 e inside the red dotted circles also two corresponding small vortex structures can also be found at the same location in fig 8 e 3 and in fig 10 e during one shedding process the vortex structures were concentrated at the end side of the sheet cavitation before the primary shedding as shown in fig 10 b after the primary shedding many vortex structures will shed downstream as shown in fig 10 d so in cavitation flow the cavitation is not just induced by vortex structures but also an inducement of vortex generation high pressure can be observed in the stagnation region at the downstream end of the attached cavity in fig 10 f and a which was induced by the secondary cloud cavitation collapse in fig 10 e the concentration of low and high pressure inside and outside the cavity will lead to a strong adverse pressure gradient under which an adverse jet re entrant jets will flow into the cavity bubble as shown in fig 9 f marked by a pair of black dotted arrows and the re entrant jets will move upstream along the twisted foil surface and collide with the cavitation surface in the middle region near the foil leading edge and cut apart the cavity surface in the end shown in fig 9 a and the incision is marked by a dotted black line then the size of the incision will increase quickly under the tearing force from side entrant jets and shedding off shown in fig 9 c d at the same time the cavity surface will roll up into a cavitation block and move downstream under the thrust from the main flow and a new sheet cavity will grow up following the main flow after the cutting apart process the cavitation block will shed into a cloud cavitation as shown in fig 8 d and keep on moving downstream with main flow as shown in fig 8 d f and it finally collapses in the high pressure region near the trailing edge shown in fig 9 a in the same time after the primary shedding the side entrant jets still exist see fig 9 d but the adverse pressure is weak shown in fig 10 d so the side jets are not strong enough to move up to the cavity front but they still have enough momentum to cut apart the end side of the sheet cavitation and tear off a pair of small pieces of cavitation structures as shown in fig 9 e inside the red dotted circle and these side clouds will quickly collapse in the following step shown in fig 9 f and form a high pressure zone behind the attached cavitation as shown in fig 10 f this kind of pressure distribution will result in a strong adverse pressure gradient and provide motivation for the side entrant jets in fig 9 f thus present simulation clearly reproduces the cavitation shedding patterns around this twisted hydrofoil and those phenomena fit well with the corresponding experimental results in peng et al 2016 from this study we found that the transition to cloud cavitation around the three dimensional hydrofoil will result in a significant vorticity shedding into the flow field at cavitation number σ 1 3 a regular cavitation shedding was observed and the maximum length of the sheet cavitation can reach about half of the chord length for σ 1 5 the maximum length of the sheet cavitation will shrink to about one quarter of the chord length and the cloud cavitation region was also much smaller and the major difference between the flow of σ 1 3 and σ 1 5 was in the secondary shedding no visible side cavitation structures can be found in the flow of σ 1 5 as shown in fig 11 in the first and second columns but in the vortex field secondary vortex structures can be found in fig 11 e 3 in the red dotted circles it means that the second shedding still exists for σ 1 5 flow but not that significant as the case of σ 1 3 for the cavitating flow of σ 1 8 see fig 12 compared with the shedding process of σ 1 5 the difference was not only in the maximum cavitation length reduced to about one eighth of the chord length the exact length values for each cavitating flow are presented in table 5 but also in the shedding pattern for σ 1 8 the cavitating flow will break up irregularly in a similar flow pattern as that observed by kawanami et al 1998 which is also called open partial cavity flow in the previous studies lemonnier and rowe 1988 le et al 1993 laberteaux and ceccio 2001a 4 3 characteristics of the frequency spectrum once cavity shedding occurs the lift and drag forces acting on the twisted hydrofoil will vary periodically due to the change of pressure distribution on the foil surface in each shedding cycle the corresponding frequency analysis are presented in figs 15 a 16 a and 17 a respectively distinct frequency scales can be observed in those psd curves which include two parts a narrow spectrum part and a broadband spectrum part in the psd curves of σ 1 3 two peaks of 51 9 hz and 103 7 hz were observed as the narrow spectrum in the low frequency range the first peak is related to the primary shedding and the second peak represents the second harmonics relating to the secondary shedding similar properties apply for cases of σ 1 5 and the corresponding period based on the main shedding frequency are presented in table 4 slight difference occurs for cases of σ 1 8 shown in fig 17 a only one peak can be found in the narrow spectrum the value is 155 3 hz no secondary shedding was observed for a better understanding of the shedding patterns the non dimensional frequency is introduced in the experimental studies of the cavity flow around both two dimensional naca 0009 and elliptic planform naca 0015 hydrofoil arndt et al 1995 found that the foil geometry has no significant influence on the shedding patterns and they claimed that the non dimensional frequency based on the maximum cavity length s t l c f l c u have a linear relationship with 1 σ and the value of s t σ l c f l c u 1 σ is 0 25 in the experimental study of the cavity flow around a twisted naca 0009 hydrofoil foeth et al 2008 found that the value of s t l c is in the range of 0 17 0 19 and for s t σ l c is in the range of 0 13 0 15 nearly a constant value as shown in fig 13 in a recent experimental study once again peng et al 2016 found that for both the straight and twisted naca 16012 hydrofoil the value of the non dimensional frequency s t σ l c is in a narrow range of 0 19 0 23 which implies that s t σ l c is a proper dimensionless shedding frequency and in our numerical study of the twisted naca 66 mod hydrofoil the value of s t σ l c is 0 229 0 205 and 0 199 for σ 1 3 1 5 and 1 8 respectively see fig 13 which are much more close to the experiment results of peng et al 2016 the reason for the slight difference between foeth et al 2008 and peng et al 2016 as shown in fig 13 may be that the shape of the naca 16012 differs greatly from the naca 0009 but for naca 66 mod it s shape is similar to naca 16012 so our results are more close to peng et al 2016 in the high frequency region the decay rate of psd is another important property as the force coefficients are integral quantities the pressure spectrum at specified single points are also presented for comparison in figs 15 b 16 b and 17 b as shown in fig 15 b several slopes e g 9 3 7 3 and 5 3 are used to fit the overall trend of the psd curves and it is found that the 7 3 slope fits the best the locations of the pressure monitoring points in the middle span section are shown in fig 14 the point p w a l l is placed on the suction surface of the foil with a distance of 0 6c to the leading edge and p w a k e is in the wake area of the foil with a distance of 0 5c to the trailing edge

22574,in this paper unsteady cavitating flows around a twisted naca 66 mod hydrofoil are simulated with both standard and non linear k ε turbulence models for the standard k ε turbulence model no significant cavitation shedding is observed and size of the calculated cavitation regions is much smaller than the experimental results for the non linear k ε turbulence model fair agreement with the experimental data are observed for the cavitation region flow structures and the primary cavitation shedding frequency it is observed that the non dimensional primary shedding frequency based on the maximum cavity length s t l c depends linearly on the factor 1 σ and the side entrant jets is the inducement of the secondary shedding of the cloud cavitation at last a 7 3 attenuation law similar to other les results is captured in the broadband parts of the psd curves of the pressure and hydrodynamic force keywords twisted hydrofoil side entrant jets non linear turbulence model 1 introduction three dimensional unsteady cavitating flow is a complex multi phase turbulent flow including phase transitions flow separations and multi scale vortex structures unsteady cavitation often occurs on lifting surfaces such as surface ships and underwater vehicles which it is the major cause of performance deterioration vibration noise and even surface erosion of those underwater equipments the occurrence of unsteady partial cavitation is often related to the presence of the re entrant jets in the cavity closure region lush and skipp 1986 used the high speed photography technique to study the cavitating flow in a duct and the periodic shedding of partial cavitation induced by re entrant flow was observed in their study in order to give a better visualization of re entrant jets the dye injection technique was used on the experimental study of a plano convex foil cavitating flow le et al 1993 they found that unlike the thin stable cavity flow thick cavity flow was always unsteady and the re entrant jet played a key role in the shedding of cloud cavitation high speed photography and pressure measurement technique were used to study the cloud shedding on a two dimensional hydrofoil by kawanami et al 1997 in their study the re entrant jets were observed and they found that the cloud cavitation can be effectively inhibited by placing a small obstacle on the suction surface of the foil callenaere et al 2001 experimentally investigated the unsteady cavitation on a two dimensional backward facing step they found that the cavity thickness and the adverse pressure gradient are the most important parameters in the analysis of the re entrant jet instability laberteaux and ceccio 2001a experimentally studied the partial cavitating flows on two dimensional wedges plano convex hydrofoil and naca 0009 hydrofoil the re entrant jets were not observed in both two dimensional wedges and plano convex hydrofoil flow but the re entrant jets were observed in the flow around the two dimensional naca 0009 hydrofoil and cause periodic shedding of the cloud cavitation in the study by laberteaux and ceccio 2001b stable partial cavitation with re entrant flow was observed for flows around a three dimensional hydrofoil this does not necessarily mean that unsteady cloud cavitation with re entrant flow cannot be observed in three dimensional hydrofoil foeth et al 2006 and foeth et al 2008 used time resolved piv and high speed camera to study the partial cavitation on a three dimensional twisted hydrofoil with a span wise varied angle of attack and they found that the primary shedding of cloud cavitation depends on the momentum and direction of re entrant flow and the secondary shedding is induced by the side entrant jets in the closure region of a cavity accurate calculating the unsteady behaviors of the cavitating flows is one of the major goals of the numerical simulations the key factors for obtaining fine results from cavitating flow simulations are cavitation models and turbulence models homogeneous hypothesis has been widely used in cavitating flow simulation in this hypothesis the cavitating area is considered as a single fluid with fully mixed vapor and liquid kubota et al 1992 under this hypothesis two kinds of models are often used one is the state equation model e g coutier delgosha et al 2003b and goncalves and patella 2009 previous experimental studies laberteaux and ceccio 2001b gopalan et al 2002 shown that the baroclinic torque term is the key factor for the vorticity production in the partial cavity closure region but in the state equation model the gradients of density and pressure always keep in parallel so this model cannot properly reflect the baroclinic torque term the other is the transport equation model which is based on rayleigh plesset equations and an additional equation of vapor or liquid volume fraction which including source terms for condensation and evaporation is needed merkle 1998 there are many similar cavitation models based on the transport equation model e g kunz et al 2000 schnerr and sauer 2001 singhal et al 2002 and zwart et al 2004 many comparative studies on those cavitation models especially for the empirical parameters in the source terms have been done in the past ten years senocak and wei 2004 frikha et al 2008 morgut et al 2011 ducoin et al 2012 another crucial technique for cavitating flow simulation is the turbulence modeling although high accuracy methods like large eddy simulation les and partially averaged navier stokes pans method girimaji 2006 have been successfully applied to cavitating flow simulation in recent years bensow and bark 2010 ji et al 2013 2015 chen et al 2017 long et al 2018 the huge consumptions of computing resource limit the wide application of those methods in the industrial field reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations remain the primary cfd solver in practical cavitating flow simulations due to its low computational cost and reasonable accuracy kunz et al 2000 coutier delgosha et al 2003a wilson et al 2006 goncalves and patella 2009 goncalves 2011 morgut et al 2011 decaix and goncalvès 2013 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 most of the turbulence models are based on the boussinesq viscosity hypothesis which has been used successfully in turbulent flows dominated by shear stress pope 2001 in this kind of flow the constitute relationship between strain rate and reynolds stress tensor can be described by a linear expression however this kind of linear model fails for the strong separation or rotating flows experimental studies in eddy flows shown that the strain rate and reynolds stress are not aligned in strong swirling flow region chow et al 1997a b recently churchfield and blaisdell 2009 found that for most of the typical turbulence models including one equation model two equation models and shear stress transport model none of them can accurately capture the spatial lag between the reynolds stress and the corresponding strain rate components in the strong swirling regions to get out from this predicament the performance of the nonlinear turbulence model proposed by shih et al 1993 1995 is investigated for cavitating flows with separation in this paper this nonlinear k ε model has been successfully applied for tip vortex simulations in our previous study liu et al 2016 the main purpose of the present paper is to study the effect of cavity growth and shedding of the cloud cavitating flows the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 we first present the mathematical formulations and numerical method used in this study in section 2 1 then the cavitation and turbulence models are presented in sections 2 2 and 2 3 respectively the simulation setup and the validations are presented in section 3 detailed results and discussions are presented in section 4 finally we summarize this work and draw the main conclusions in section 5 2 descriptions of the problems and numerical methods in the present study a similarly twisted hydrofoil of foeth et al 2006 but with different wing section was used a pair of extra straight parts 12 5 mm for each is installed on both sides of this twisted middle part and the size of this foil is 225 100mm which is different with the delft twisted hydrofoil 294 150mm the experimental results used in this paper are provided by the china ship scientific research center cssrc and part of the experimental results can be found in peng et al 2016 the three dimensional naca 66 mod twisted hydrofoil used in this paper was shown in fig 1 for the torsional part the angle increases smoothly toward the center along the span wise and in both sides the angle increase from α m i n 0 to α m a x 11 the angle along the span wise can be described by a polynomial which is presented in eq 1 in this study the angle of attack of the whole twisted hydrofoil is α 2 and the inflow velocity is u 7 m s the cavitation number σ p p v 1 2 ρ u 2 varies from 1 3 to 1 8 and the static pressure p is adjusted based on the cavitation number 1 α α m i n 0 z 12 5 α m a x 16 z 3 12 z 2 1 α m i n 12 5 z 212 5 α m a x 212 5 z 225 where z z 12 5 200 1 2 2 1 governing equations for multiphase flow simulation in this paper the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are solved coupled with mass transfer model and turbulence model a homogeneous hypothesis is used to simplify the complex multiphase flow problem to a simpler single flow problem which means that the slip velocity between those two phases is ignored under this homogeneous mixture assumption the mixture density is presented in eq 2 2 ρ m ρ l α l ρ v α v and the mixture dynamic viscosity has a similar expression 3 μ m μ l α l μ v α v where ρ l is the water density and ρ v is the vapor density μ l and μ v are the dynamic viscosity of water and vapor respectively α l and α v are the volume fractions of water and vapor respectively the relationship between these two volume fractions is α l 1 α v the continuity and momentum equations for the cavitating flow are 4 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 5 t ρ m u i x j ρ m u i u j p x i x j μ m u i x j u j x i ρ m τ i j x j where τ i j is the reynolds stress and will be calculated by a nonlinear viscosity model in section 2 3 2 2 cavitation model the cavitation model used in this paper was proposed by schnerr and sauer 2001 and the vapor water volume fractions are governed by the vapor volume fraction transport equations 6 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u j x j m m m where m c v ρ l ρ v ρ m 3 α v r b 2 3 min 0 p p v ρ l m c c ρ l ρ v ρ m 3 1 α v r b 2 3 max 0 p p v ρ l r b α v 1 α v 3 4 π 1 n 1 3 and m m m is the net phase change rate of vapor m and m is the vapor generation and condensation rates respectively r b is the radius of cavitation bubble n is the number density of cavitation bubbles p v is the saturated vapor pressure from the vapor volume fraction transport equation we can see that the processes of condensation and vaporization are determined by the local pressure in this simulation the number density of nuclei is n 1 6 1 0 13 nuclei m 3 the nuclei radius r 0 1 1 0 6 m and both the condensation and vaporization empirical constant c c and c v are set as 1 0 this cavitation model has been widely used in cavitating flow simulations frikha et al 2008 ji et al 2015 liu et al 2016 2 3 nonlinear viscosity model in numerical study most of the turbulent viscosity models are based on the bossinessq viscosity hypothesis such as spalart allmaras turbulence model standard k ε model k ω model and k ω sst model in this bossinessq hypothesis the deviatoric reynold stress τ i j d u i u j 2 3 k δ i j is linearly proportional to the mean rate of strain rate tensor s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 7 τ i j d 2 ν t s i j where ν t is the kinematic turbulent viscosity in the standard k ε turbulence model launder and spalding 1972 ν t c μ k 2 ε with c μ 0 9 for simple shear flows with weak mean pressure gradient and small mean streamline curvature the bossinessq viscosity hypothesis is reasonable but for those flows with strong pressure gradients and large streamline curvatures the turbulent models based on the bossinessq hypothesis will have poor applicability the closure model for rans simulations which can be successfully used in the flow simulations with strong swirling flow and large adverse pressure gradient is the reynolds stress model and the main difficulties to used reynolds stress model is the instability of the models and the complexity of the model implementation in addition the consumption of computer resources of this model is also more than the common turbulent viscosity model compared with the reynolds stress model nonlinear viscosity models add little cost on the two equation model and the nonlinear k ε model proposed by shih et al 1993 was used in present work in which the turbulent shear stress was described by the relationship as follows 8 τ i j 2 3 k δ i j 2 ν t s i j k 3 1000 η 3 ε 2 4 t i j 1 13 t i j 2 2 t i j 3 where t i j 1 u i x l u l x j u j x l u l x i 2 3 u l x k u k x l δ i j t i j 2 u i x k u j x k 1 3 u l x k u l x k δ i j t i j 3 u k x i u k x j 1 3 u l x k u l x k δ i j and kinematic viscosity ν t c μ k 2 ε where c μ 2 3 1 25 η 0 9 ζ 1 η k s ε ζ k ω ε δ i j is the kronecker delta function the nonlinear k ε model is a kind of high reynolds number model with wall functions and implemented as nonlinearkeshih in openfoam which is also known as the realizable reynolds stress algebraic equation model shih et al 1993 and this non linear model uses the same transport equations as the standard k ε model launder and spalding 1972 and the transport equations of turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε are presented as follows 9 k t u j k x j τ i j u i x j ε x j ν ν t σ k k x j 10 ε t u j ε x j c ε 1 τ i j u i x j c ε 2 ε 2 k x j ν ν t σ ε ε x j the closure coefficients are c ε 1 1 44 c ε 2 1 92 σ ε 1 3 σ k 1 0 3 validations of the computations 3 1 simulation setup cavitating flows at three different cavitation numbers were simulated in this study a multiphase flow solver inside the open source cfd package openfoam interphasechangefoam in this simulation the time dependent governing equations were discretized in both space and time domains using the node centered finite volume method the backward euler method was used for the time integration of this pde system all diffusion terms in this study were discretized using the second order central difference scheme and the second order upwind scheme is used for the convective terms in the momentum equations and turbulent transport equations the time step is 2 1 0 6 s and the maximum cfl number is under 0 5 for the cavitating flow simulations the quick discretization scheme was used to discretize the transport equation of volume fraction the pimple algorithm was used to solve the velocity pressure coupling problem between the momentum and continuity equations the outer and inner loops number of the pimple algorithm are 1 and 2 respectively one times non orthogonal correction and no sub relaxation correction was used to improve the stability of the cavitating flow simulation the simulation was started as a cavitating free flow simulation and the cavitation model will be turned on at 0 1 s as shown in fig 4 the computational domain and boundary conditions for this simulation were shown in fig 2 and the angle of attack for this twisted naca 66 mod hydrofoil is 2 the hydrofoil is located four times chord length c 0 1 m from the inlet boundary 1 125c from the top and bottom boundaries and 10c from the outlet boundary in this simulation the hydrofoil surface and the four tunnel walls were set to be non slip walls see fig 2 the fluid medium is water the kinematic viscosity is ν 9 1 0 7 m 2 s the density is ρ 1000 kg m 3 and the saturate vapor pressure p v 2337 pa according to the experimental temperature of t 20 c the inlet velocity u 7 m s so the reynolds number based on the chord length is r e 7 8 1 0 5 the outlet pressure was assigned according to the cavitation number by expression p o u t p v 1 2 ρ u 2 σ in this study three cases at different cavitation number σ 1 3 1 5 and 1 8 are studied so the corresponding outlet pressures are p o u t 34 369 pa 39297 pa and 46689 pa the values of k and ε are specified at the inlet boundary k 3 2 u i 2 ε c μ 0 75 k 1 5 c where the turbulent intensity i 0 4 these values are also set as the initial conditions in the whole computational domain 3 2 validation of the simulation setup a multi domain structured mesh was generated around this twisted hydrofoil using ansys icem for better capture of the cavitation region vortex structures local mesh refinement was performed along the spanwise and chordwise directions in the cavitation and wake region and the surface meshes on the hydrofoil surface and in the middle span section of the computational domain are shown in fig 3 the local refinement was conducted inside the openfoam and the mesh parameters for each set of mesh were presented in table 1 from the table we can see that between m2 and m1 there was about 39 increment of the total node numbers and the mesh refinement was concentrated on the span wise between m3 and m2 there was a huge increment in the total node numbers about 147 increment and the refinement was concentrated in the cloud cavitation region between m4 and m3 the refinement is concentrated on the chord wise compared with m3 the refine area is in the sheet cavitation area for the cavitation shape no significant difference can be found in the numerical results between m1 and m2 more vortex structures were captured by m2 in the downstream area of the sheet cavitation it means that the basic mesh is far from meeting the requirement of mesh density and mesh refinement around the closure region of the partial cavitation is necessary also between the second and third rows more detailed sheet and cloud cavitation structures and small scale vortex were captured from the results of m3 it means that the second level refinement is also necessary and in the last two rows of fig 3 no significant difference in both cavitation and vortex structures can be found and from the time history of the lift coefficients in fig 4 the similar tendency can also be observed there is a significant gap between the first and second lines and for the second and third curves the gap still existed but for the last two curves they almost overlap and in the relative errors based on the m4 mesh of the average lift coefficients in the time range 0 2 0 3 s a gradual reduction of errors was also observed the last two rows of table 1 therefore we choose the third mesh m3 for the cavitating flow simulations here after and for most of the foil surface the value of y is around 30 see fig 5 4 results and discussions 4 1 comparison between the standard and non linear k ε turbulence models the time histories of the lift coefficients for the standard and non linear k ε models are shown in fig 6 the average force coefficients averaged from 0 2 to 0 3 s are listed in table 3 as no corresponding force informations of the experimental study are available the relative errors are base on the results of the non linear k ε model from the force signals in fig 6 we can see that significant periodic shedding was observed in each flow for the non linear k ε model for the standard k ε model no shedding was observed even for the flow with the smallest cavitation number and a significant difference between the average force also exist between those turbulent models see table 3 and for quantitative analysis comparison of the shedding period between the experimental and numerical results are presented in table 4 for numerical study the shedding period is the reciprocal of the main shedding frequency first peak of the corresponding psds of the force coefficients shown in figs 15 17 from table 4 we can see that for the cavitating flows of σ 1 3 and 1 5 the shedding periods predicted by non linear k ε model fit well with the experimental results for σ 1 8 no significant shedding can be found in the experiment from the snapshots of the cavitation structures but the shedding phenomenon still exists for non linear k ε model at last the cavitation structures at the instance when they reach their max length are shown in fig 7 the corresponding quantitative analysis of the cavity lengths is presented in table 5 in fig 7 a significant difference of the cavitation size between the results of standard k ε model and the experimental study can be found especially for σ 1 3 and 1 5 the cavitation size is much smaller than the experimental results and the same conclusion can also drawn from the error analysis in table 5 for the non linear k ε model all the cavitation structures fit well with the corresponding experimental results especially for σ 1 3 the relative error for the cavity length is only 1 5 compared with the standard k ε model the results of non linear k ε model fit with the experimental results much better so in the following study we will use the results of non linear k ε model only 4 2 flow structures of shedding cavity for a better understanding of the shedding process snapshots of both experimental and numerical results are shown in figs 8 11 and 12 for σ 1 3 1 5 and 1 8 respectively and the predicted cavity shape is presented by the iso surface of phase function α 0 5 and the vortex structures are described by the iso surface of λ 2 1 1 0 6 figures in the left column are the experimental results and those in the middle and right columns are the predicted cavitation structures and vortex structures respectively the region inside the red and black dotted boxes are enlarged and represented in figs 9 and 10 respectively for more details in fig 9 the additional information is the streamlines colored by inflow velocity and in fig 10 the additional information is the surface pressure both re entrant and side entrant jets were clearly shown in fig 9 by the streamlines and marked by dotted arrows in fig 9 f and three sets of vortex systems can be found in fig 10 one set of vortex system inside the black dotted circle in the middle span and two sets of small vortex systems on both sides inside the red dotted circles in the first two columns of fig 8 both primary shedding and secondary shedding were observed by the numerical study and they all fit well with the experimental results the attached cavity has reached its maximum length in the last row of fig 8 and the flow will be reflected on the envelope of the cavitation interface lange and bruin 1997 the re entrant jets will have different directions in this twisted foil shown in fig 9 f side cavitation break up was found in fig 8 e 1 in the experimental study and two vapor cloud were also observed in both sides of the sheet cavitation as shown in figs 8 e 2 and 9 e inside the red dotted circles also two corresponding small vortex structures can also be found at the same location in fig 8 e 3 and in fig 10 e during one shedding process the vortex structures were concentrated at the end side of the sheet cavitation before the primary shedding as shown in fig 10 b after the primary shedding many vortex structures will shed downstream as shown in fig 10 d so in cavitation flow the cavitation is not just induced by vortex structures but also an inducement of vortex generation high pressure can be observed in the stagnation region at the downstream end of the attached cavity in fig 10 f and a which was induced by the secondary cloud cavitation collapse in fig 10 e the concentration of low and high pressure inside and outside the cavity will lead to a strong adverse pressure gradient under which an adverse jet re entrant jets will flow into the cavity bubble as shown in fig 9 f marked by a pair of black dotted arrows and the re entrant jets will move upstream along the twisted foil surface and collide with the cavitation surface in the middle region near the foil leading edge and cut apart the cavity surface in the end shown in fig 9 a and the incision is marked by a dotted black line then the size of the incision will increase quickly under the tearing force from side entrant jets and shedding off shown in fig 9 c d at the same time the cavity surface will roll up into a cavitation block and move downstream under the thrust from the main flow and a new sheet cavity will grow up following the main flow after the cutting apart process the cavitation block will shed into a cloud cavitation as shown in fig 8 d and keep on moving downstream with main flow as shown in fig 8 d f and it finally collapses in the high pressure region near the trailing edge shown in fig 9 a in the same time after the primary shedding the side entrant jets still exist see fig 9 d but the adverse pressure is weak shown in fig 10 d so the side jets are not strong enough to move up to the cavity front but they still have enough momentum to cut apart the end side of the sheet cavitation and tear off a pair of small pieces of cavitation structures as shown in fig 9 e inside the red dotted circle and these side clouds will quickly collapse in the following step shown in fig 9 f and form a high pressure zone behind the attached cavitation as shown in fig 10 f this kind of pressure distribution will result in a strong adverse pressure gradient and provide motivation for the side entrant jets in fig 9 f thus present simulation clearly reproduces the cavitation shedding patterns around this twisted hydrofoil and those phenomena fit well with the corresponding experimental results in peng et al 2016 from this study we found that the transition to cloud cavitation around the three dimensional hydrofoil will result in a significant vorticity shedding into the flow field at cavitation number σ 1 3 a regular cavitation shedding was observed and the maximum length of the sheet cavitation can reach about half of the chord length for σ 1 5 the maximum length of the sheet cavitation will shrink to about one quarter of the chord length and the cloud cavitation region was also much smaller and the major difference between the flow of σ 1 3 and σ 1 5 was in the secondary shedding no visible side cavitation structures can be found in the flow of σ 1 5 as shown in fig 11 in the first and second columns but in the vortex field secondary vortex structures can be found in fig 11 e 3 in the red dotted circles it means that the second shedding still exists for σ 1 5 flow but not that significant as the case of σ 1 3 for the cavitating flow of σ 1 8 see fig 12 compared with the shedding process of σ 1 5 the difference was not only in the maximum cavitation length reduced to about one eighth of the chord length the exact length values for each cavitating flow are presented in table 5 but also in the shedding pattern for σ 1 8 the cavitating flow will break up irregularly in a similar flow pattern as that observed by kawanami et al 1998 which is also called open partial cavity flow in the previous studies lemonnier and rowe 1988 le et al 1993 laberteaux and ceccio 2001a 4 3 characteristics of the frequency spectrum once cavity shedding occurs the lift and drag forces acting on the twisted hydrofoil will vary periodically due to the change of pressure distribution on the foil surface in each shedding cycle the corresponding frequency analysis are presented in figs 15 a 16 a and 17 a respectively distinct frequency scales can be observed in those psd curves which include two parts a narrow spectrum part and a broadband spectrum part in the psd curves of σ 1 3 two peaks of 51 9 hz and 103 7 hz were observed as the narrow spectrum in the low frequency range the first peak is related to the primary shedding and the second peak represents the second harmonics relating to the secondary shedding similar properties apply for cases of σ 1 5 and the corresponding period based on the main shedding frequency are presented in table 4 slight difference occurs for cases of σ 1 8 shown in fig 17 a only one peak can be found in the narrow spectrum the value is 155 3 hz no secondary shedding was observed for a better understanding of the shedding patterns the non dimensional frequency is introduced in the experimental studies of the cavity flow around both two dimensional naca 0009 and elliptic planform naca 0015 hydrofoil arndt et al 1995 found that the foil geometry has no significant influence on the shedding patterns and they claimed that the non dimensional frequency based on the maximum cavity length s t l c f l c u have a linear relationship with 1 σ and the value of s t σ l c f l c u 1 σ is 0 25 in the experimental study of the cavity flow around a twisted naca 0009 hydrofoil foeth et al 2008 found that the value of s t l c is in the range of 0 17 0 19 and for s t σ l c is in the range of 0 13 0 15 nearly a constant value as shown in fig 13 in a recent experimental study once again peng et al 2016 found that for both the straight and twisted naca 16012 hydrofoil the value of the non dimensional frequency s t σ l c is in a narrow range of 0 19 0 23 which implies that s t σ l c is a proper dimensionless shedding frequency and in our numerical study of the twisted naca 66 mod hydrofoil the value of s t σ l c is 0 229 0 205 and 0 199 for σ 1 3 1 5 and 1 8 respectively see fig 13 which are much more close to the experiment results of peng et al 2016 the reason for the slight difference between foeth et al 2008 and peng et al 2016 as shown in fig 13 may be that the shape of the naca 16012 differs greatly from the naca 0009 but for naca 66 mod it s shape is similar to naca 16012 so our results are more close to peng et al 2016 in the high frequency region the decay rate of psd is another important property as the force coefficients are integral quantities the pressure spectrum at specified single points are also presented for comparison in figs 15 b 16 b and 17 b as shown in fig 15 b several slopes e g 9 3 7 3 and 5 3 are used to fit the overall trend of the psd curves and it is found that the 7 3 slope fits the best the locations of the pressure monitoring points in the middle span section are shown in fig 14 the point p w a l l is placed on the suction surface of the foil with a distance of 0 6c to the leading edge and p w a k e is in the wake area of the foil with a distance of 0 5c to the trailing edge for the broadband part the pressure spectrum gain from the fft treatment of the pressure signal will decay at the rate of κ 7 3 versus wave numbers κ batchelor 1951 lesieur 2008 the 7 3 decay rate had been observed by chen et al 2017 2019 and long et al 2018 in cavitating flow simulations with les and a similar 7 3 slope was observed at the broadband spectrum of the psd curves of those force coefficients in this study 5 conclusion cavitating flows around a twisted naca 66 mod hydrofoil were investigated numerically in this study both standard and non linear k ε turbulent models were used in this cavitating flow simulations special emphasis was put on the analysis of the evolution of three dimensional cavity structures the dynamics of vortex structures the influence of cavitation number and the induced hydrodynamic behaviors during cavitation shedding processes the primary conclusions and findings are summarized as follows 1 for non linear k ε turbulence model reasonable agreements between the numerical results and the corresponding experimental data are observed 2 in each shedding process after the collapse of the secondary cloud cavitation the high pressure concentrate on the end of the sheet cavitation will form the re entrant and side entrant jets and the side entrant jets are found to be the generation mechanism of the secondary shedding of the cloud cavitation 3 the main shedding frequency agrees well with the experimental results and both the numerical results and experiment data shown that s t σ l c f l c u 1 σ is a suitable dimensionless frequency for cavitating flows on twisted hydrofoil 4 from the broadband part of the power spectral density psd of the force coefficients and pressure fluctuations for each cavitation flow the 7 3 attenuation law is captured with the non linear k ε model in a similar trend as other les simulations in previous literature acknowledgments this research has been partially funded by national natural
