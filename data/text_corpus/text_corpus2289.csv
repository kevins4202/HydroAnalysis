11445,accurate quantification of evapotranspiration et consumptive water use from planting through harvest is critical for managing limited water resources for crop irrigation our objective was to develop and apply a land crop surface residual energy balance eb method for quantifying et and to estimate et of corn zea mays l for the first time in the climate of the lower mississippi delta region actual et ete was estimated as the residual term of the energy balance equation from measurements of net solar irradiance r n and computed sensible heat h and ground heat g o fluxes the h flux was computed from measurements of the air and crop canopy temperature differential and modeling the aerodynamic resistance ra to heat and water transport in the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer above the canopy the go flux was estimated by measuring heat flux at 8 cm depth and accounting for heat storage in the soil layer above it the developed eb procedure was tested using simultaneous measurements of eb data and lysimetric et in a cotton gossypium hirsutum l field at bushland texas usa in 2008 the lysimeter measured et compared well with the computed ete under cotton rmse of daily et 1 2 mm and seasonal et within 1 error further we quantified irrigated corn et using eb in a silt loam soil at stoneville mississippi usa in 2016 the computed seasonal values of ete were greater than shortgrass reference et eto by 27 mm and less than alfalfa reference crop et etr by 80 mm the instrumentation used in the eb method can be moved and the estimated et was comparable with lysimeter measured et as such this method provides a cost effective viable alternative for quantifying et which should be broadly tested in other locations and cropping systems keywords evapotranspiration energy balance crop water requirements mississippi delta irrigation 1 introduction the eddy covariance ec and energy balance eb methods provide two scientifically sound methods for indirect but potentially accurate measurements of water fluxes from cropping systems baldochi 2003 gowda et al 2014 parent and anctil 2012 shurpali et al 2013 uddin et al 2013 because of the availability of fast response sensors and data loggers for automated measurement and storage of water and eddy transport data in the plant canopy boundary layer the ec technique is gaining a reputation as the preferred method for quantifying et amiro 2009 even after several physical and instrument corrections are applied to the flux data it has a widely acknowledged energy balance closure error between energy inputs and outputs introducing an amount of doubt in the reliability of the measured et under limited irrigation water management amiro 2009 allen et al 2011 baldochi 2003 foken et al 2006 liu et al 2017 tallec et al 2013 while the search for energy balance closure in the ec technique continues the eb approach in which all the components of energy exchange in the system other than latent heat energy are measured and accounted for in the frictional sub layer immediately above the plant canopy provides an alternative approach for fast measurement and quantification of crop et in field crops in medium size experiments amiro 2009 tanner 1960 in the eb method an energy balance equation is applied to a soil crop land area using remote or tower mounted atmospheric boundary layer sensors and near surface soil sensor measurements of the system variables bhattarai et al 2016 cammalleri et al 2012 in this approach et expressed as latent heat flux le is estimated as the residual term of the energy balance equation when other fluxes in the equation are either measured or calculated typically the sensible heat flux h is quantified assuming an air diffusion flow resistance to heat and water transport across the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer above the plant canopy also known as bulk transfer approach and soil heat flux is measured using buried heat flux plates adjusted to estimate the soil surface heat flux g o allen et al 2007a b heilman and kanemasu 1976 su 2002 many models and methods for estimating land surface et from satellite remote sensing data sebal surface energy balance algorithm for the land model for example make use of the general eb approach brunet et al 1991 bastiaanssen et al 1998 cammalleri et al 2012 mcshane et al 2017 verma et al 1976 developed a resistance energy balance resistance refers to the method for computing sensible heat flux procedure for monitoring et from sorghum sorghum bicolor l and millet panicum melimeurn l cropping systems that compared well with lysimetric measurements heilman and kanemasu 1976 developed an eb based et model that uses the diffusion resistance to heat transport in the energy balance equation they obtained et estimates within 4 and 15 bias on a seasonal basis of lysimetric measurements for soybean glycine max l and sorghum respectively simultaneous measurements of energy flux data with eb and ec approach reported comparable results in estimated et in a boreal forest system amiro 2009 kimball et al 1999 1995 1994 and triggs et al 2004 used the eb approach for comparing free air co2 enrichment effects on et from cotton gossypium hirsutum l sorghum and wheat triticum estivum l crops in these studies in general the values of sensible heat h in the eb procedure were derived from the measurements of the air and crop canopy temperature differential and modeling the aerodynamic resistance ra in vegetated land surfaces plant soil surface temperature should represent the temperature of the apparent source sink of sensible heat flux within in the plant canopy as such it should form the base measurement for quantification of the air and canopy temperature differential blonquist et al 2009 this apparent temperature known as aerodynamic temperature t o is not a directly measurable variable so crop canopy surface radiative temperature t s is commonly measured using an infrared thermometer and used as a surrogate for t o in the computations of h in cropping systems in relatively homogenous surfaces the difference between t s and t o may not be substantial but in heterogeneous crop canopy surfaces the differences can be substantial and this can lead to significant errors in the estimation of h which in turn leads to unreliable le estimates using the eb method chávez et al 2010 2005 the variable t o is defined as the temperature at the zero plane displacement height d the level to which the ground surface must be raised for the wind profile to follow a logarithmic shape plus the surface roughness length height at which wind velocity becomes zero for sensible heat transfer z h i e d z h thus t o results from the interactions of t s with the complex canopy characteristics linked to its architecture as such no known physical relationships exist between the two that can be used for predicting the value of one from the other in this context empirical relationships were derived and used in the literature for computing the value of t o from plant canopy and environmental variables in energy balance studies chávez et al 2005 for computations of t o in this study we used the equation developed by chávez et al 2010 for corn and chávez et al 2005 for cotton crops such empirical relationships linking crop specific characteristics with environmental variables were applied for simulating crop processes in cropping system models across the globe examples include the ceres rice model ritchie 1998 apsim model robertson and carberry 1998 cropsyst model stöckle et al 2003 and in modeling ecosystems norby et al 2016 rogers 2014 intensive ground based continuous monitoring of all the eb components in a cropped field are required for quantifying et based on the eb approach brown and rosenberg 1973 amiro 2009 as such application of this technology for quantifying et in cropping systems remained sporadic possibly due to the difficulties in making these continuous measurements and their storage and transmission for developing algorithms for computing resistances customized to those measurements with the advent of the modern fast response sensors data loggers and wireless communication system this is no longer considered a hindrance in adopting this technology in field research recently corn growers in the mississippi ms delta region planted an estimated 750 000 acres 303 500 ha of corn and produced about 134 bushels per acre 5400 kg ha 1 grain yield and 97 82 million bushels 6 140 161 mg in 2010 mississippi state university extension service http msucares com crops soybeans index html the long term average annual rainfall received over the mississippi delta region was approximately 1300 mm with about 30 received during the core crop growing periods from april to august saseendran et al 2016a the crop growing season rainfall is also characterized by large inter and intra seasonal variabilities in their amounts and temporal distributions to stabilize returns from crops raised in the region farmers often provide supplementary irrigations drawing water from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer in the absence of reliable information on the water needs of the crops farmers often provide arbitrary irrigations agricultural water use from this aquifer has been reported to far exceed its long term recharge rates powers 2007 global warming associated with increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere was also reported to increase pressure on irrigation water requirements in the region saseendran et al 2016b accurate timely quantification of water requirements or et of major crops cotton corn soybeans and rice grown in the region is essential for scheduling irrigations for optimizing water use efficiency wue in these cropping systems and to match irrigation withdrawals with the recharge rates of the aquifer in these contexts our objectives were to provide a synthesis of components in the eb approach and 1 develop a state of the science algorithm for computation of et based on the eb approach 2 test the et quantified using this algorithm with cotton et measured using a large scale field lysimeter at bushland tx usa and 3 use the eb algorithm to quantify et in corn at stoneville ms usa for the first time in the history of ms delta and compare it with grass and alfalfa reference crop et computed from climatological data for the location 2 methodology 2 1 the energy balance eb approach for estimating evapotranspiration et an energy balance equation for a crop soil surface can be written as 1 r n l e g 0 h δ s a i r δ s b m δ s p h where r n is the net radiation positive downward le is the latent heat flux positive upward go is the soil heat flux positive downward h is the sensible heat flux positive upward sbm is the energy stored in the biomass sair is the energy stored in the air layer and sph is the energy used in photosynthesis where δ denotes the change per unit time s units are wm 2 for energy flux and j m 2 for energy storage based upon previous work meyers and hollinger 2004 and screening calculations we assume that in summer crops 3 4 months duration like corn and cotton sair sbm and sph are negligible compared with other terms in eq 1 meyers and hollinger 2004 estimated the solar energy stored in the carbohydrate bonds from photosynthesis in the biomass and in the soil under corn when these processes were considered independently each component was found to be insignificant 5 meyers and hollinger 2004 however when these losses were combined the total loss comprised 8 14 of the net solar energy energy stored in the soil and plant canopy accounted for majority of this change in energy storage in the present study however heat storage changes in the soil water and minerals were included in eq 3 we did not compute the storage changes in crop biomass based on observations from past studies leuning et al 2012 and anderson and wang 2014 reported no net energy gain or loss due to heat storage changes in the biomass because on a daily basis energy stored in the plant biomass in the morning is returned to the air in the afternoon and evening hours in this study though we initially computed energy fluxes on a half hour interval we accumulated those fluxes for the whole day to calculate daily et at the end of the day cancelling out the gains of energy with its losses the et is calculated from eq 1 by dividing le by the latent heat of vaporization of water λ 2 501 mj kg 1 2 e t r n g 0 h λ we employed the resistance to the turbulent exchange of energy and matter between different layers of the atmosphere and the ground surface to compute et using eq 2 foken 2008 the crop surface is considered a big leaf and energy latent heat of water vapor is transferred across an atmospheric layer against a turbulent resistance this process is analogous to ohm s law for current flow in electrical conductors energy flow across the turbulent boundary layer takes place analogous to the fick s law net flux of energy is proportional to its concentration gradient 2 1 1 estimation of ground heat flux go the heat flux at the ground surface go w m 2 is estimated using the following equation kimball et al 1999 3 g 0 g 8 c s δ z δ t δ t where g 8 the soil heat flux at 8 cm depth δz

the leaf area index chávez et al 2005 reported a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 9 for regression between h values computed using t 0 estimated with the above method and t 0 obtained by inverting the energy balance equation based on triggs et al 2004 8 ρ a p d r d t a p v r v t a where ta is air temperature at 2 m above the canopy k pd is the partial pressure of dry air kpa pv is the partial

where rh is relative humidity and 11 p s a t 6 1078 10 7 5 t a 2048 625 t a 35 85 the following procedure was employed for estimating ra the main factors affecting ra are wind speed and stability of the air layer above the plant canopy and canopy characteristics linked to the canopy architecture the atmosphere can be characterized as stable unstable or neutral if ts is less than greater than or approximately equal to ta respectively when air is neutrally stable i e t s t a 0 1 c and u 0 1 m s 1 calm wind ra is set to a maximum value of 1720 s m 1 following triggs et al 2004 however when the

2 experimental data 2 2 1 lysimeter and energy balance experiments in cotton bushland experiment experiments to estimate cotton crop et using both lysimeter and energy balance methods were conducted

compute daily et details of lysimeter installation data collection procedures and calibration and maintenance are available in howell et al 1995 and evett et al 2015 the lysimetric measurement site was also equipped with instruments for measuring r n cnr4 kipp zonen air temperature and relative humidity hmp 155 vaisala wind speed csat3 3d sonic anemometer and canopy surface radiative temperature si 111 apogee mounted to view the ground at 60 zenith angle at 1 m above ground level in the center of the lysimeter field chávez et al 2009 the site was also instrumented for measuring soil heat flux using hp01sc self calibrating heat flux sensor hukseflux at 8 cm depth and soil water and temperature monitored above the flux plate both the lysimeter and energy balance components micrometeorological data were recorded on a data logger cr 7x campbell scientific inc logan ut the required micrometeorological data at bushland were collected using techniques detailed by chávez et

possible values daily lysimeter et data were computed as the difference between midnight centered 5 min average lysimeter mass values expressed as an equivalent depth of water in mm when necessary adjustments to daily et values were performed to address gains in lysimeter mass corresponding to dew and frost accumulation and rainfall and irrigation events using techniques detailed by marek et al 2014 irrigation treatments were applied to refill the soil to field capacity based on weekly neutron probe measurements to maintain the soil water content above the 50 level of maximum plant available water depletion cotton was planted on may 21 2008 and harvested on december 14 2008 however continuous measurements of energy balance data were made only from june 7 to august 20 2008 periodic measurements of biomass and lai pooled from four subsamples were made employing a destructive sampling method plant height was monitored simultaneously an exponential equation 20 l a i 0 0024 e 0 0926

content always above the 50 level of maximum plant available water in the soil approximately 40 mm of water was applied at each irrigation event nitrogen was applied at the rate of 224 kg ha 1 as uan at planting the field size for the experiment was 1 5 ha with dimensions of 200 m in the north south direction and 75 m in the east west direction the tower for measuring energy balance components was in the middle of the plot the sensors for measuring air temperature and relative humidity vaisala hmp 155 r n using nr lite2 net radiometer sensor kipp zonen infrared canopy surface temperature sensor installed to view of the ground at 60 zenith angle using si 111 standard view infrared sensor apogee and wind direction and speed using windsonic4 2d sonic wind sensor gill instruments were maintained at 1 m above the plant canopy the sensor heights were adjusted manually to maintain this height whenever there is an increase in crop height exceeding 5 cm there was adequate fetch ratio of 100 1 for distance from the edge of the crop field to the tower to the sensor height above the crop canopy in the north south direction which is also the prevailing wind direction during the crop season the fetch in the east west direction was not adequate but winds from this direction occur very rarely four soil heat flux sensors hp01sc self calibrating heat flux sensor hukseflux were installed at 8 cm depth water content and temperature in the 8 cm soil layer above the heat flux were monitored using stevens hydraprobe stevens water monitoring systems inc the lai of corn was measured every other week using accupar lp 80 ceptometer decagon devices inc plant heights were monitored every week plant biomass was measured by removing plants in 1 m2 areas twice during the crop season one at tasseling r1 stage and another at physiological maturity r6 stage all the plant measurements were replicated at four random locations in the field and used in the calculation of standard error se of measurements phenology observations were recorded every week a second order polynomial equation 22 l a i 0 0009 t p 2 0 1156 t p 0 693 was fitted r2 0 99 to the measured lai data to interpolate

the asce environmental and water resources institute asce ewri 2005 and fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 respectively from weather data collected at the location by assigning fixed resistances for the reference crop surfaces 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the eb method for quantifying et in the bushland experiment during the cotton growing season may to september in 2008 the mean daily minimum temperature varied between 9 3 c in may to 17 4 c in july and maximum temperatures between 26 5 c in september to 33 4 c in june table 1 fig 1 a cotton grown in this region on average requires about 670 mm of water to meet its et demand chávez et al 2009 water received from rains during the 2008 season was 325 mm measured monthly total rainfall varied between 37 mm in may to 138 mm in august irrigation applied during the 2008 crop season was 284 mm with monthly total applications varying between 31 mm in may to 103 mm in july monthly total lysimeter measured et fluctuated between 72 mm in may to 23 9 mm in july totaling to 805 mm during the four months on average the location receives about 560 mm of rainfall in a year in the bushland experiment substantial differences were noticed between the measured ts and computed to for instance during the daytime on a non rainy day july 7 2008 the computed to remained less than ts to ts is negative in fig 2 a this difference peaked at 4 62 c at 1 25 pm however during the nighttime the to values were higher than ts to ts is positive where the highest difference of 6 56 c occurred at 3 25 am on july 9 2008 a rainy day with contrasting weather conditions to remained above ts throughout the day with the temperature difference ranging from 2 6 to 10 4 c fig 2b chávez et al 2010 reported differences between to and ts ranging from 2 c to 3 c for uniform canopy covers and from 10 c to 15 c for partial surface vegetation cover as explained in the methodology section ra decreases with solar radiation and solar heating induced wind speed increases in the atmosphere during the daytime as such as expected the computed ra decreased at sunrise and increased at sunset mainly due to increased wind speed and more unstable air brought by the increased heating associated with increased solar radiation fig 2a and b the maximum computed ra on a non rainy day was 45 1 s m 1 during the night time and 15 2 s m 1 during the day time fig 2a the rn is the primary input energy term in the energy balance equation used for quantification of et using the eb procedure thus the accuracy of the estimated et depends on accurate measurements of rn eq 2 the rn data plotted in fig 3 a represents a non rainy day on july 7 2008 and those plotted in fig 3b represent a rainy day two days later on july 9 2008 the cotton crop was at r4 stage average lai was 3 5 and average h was 65 cm during the non rainy day on july 7 the maximum value of rn 637 w m2 s 1 was measured at 1 00 pm local time this value is realistic for the location and time of the year illustrating the high accuracy of the energy inputs into the system on july 9 the location received 21 mm of rainfall and the sky was overcast most of the day thus r n remained below 300 w m2 s 1 and when the sun reappeared after the clouds dissipated in the sky around 2 15 pm the measured r n went up to 652 w m2 s 1 fig 3b on the non rainy day with less water available for et compared to that of the rainy day more of the rn received was partitioned towards h than le and on the rainy day with more water available for et the situation reversed more of the rn was partitioned towards le than h on the non rainy day on july 7 2008 with more rn fig 3a and b go fluxes into the soil were also higher in magnitude during the day hours compared to those on the rainy day on the rainy day when the r n went up during a brief cloud free period around 02 15 pm the computed go became more positive fig 3b the magnitude of the components of the energy balance equation 2 during these two contrasting weather periods non rainy vs rainy day are representative of the measurements during the whole cotton growth season adequate responses of the sensors with changing weather both diurnal and across days give confidence in the accuracy of the sensors used in monitoring the energy balance components in the field adequate responses in the computed go h and le across changing weather conditions a rainy versus a non rainy day illustrated the correctness of the equations implemented in the methods developed for quantifying the components of the crop surface energy balance equation though the cotton crop in the experiment was planted on may 21 2008 and harvested on december 14 2008 measurements of energy balance data could be conducted only from june 7 to august 20 2008 daily ete computed using the eb method during this period matched and correlated well with the lysimeter measured etl with an r2 coefficient of determination computed as the squared value of the pearson s correlation coefficient r value of 0 86 the total ete computed during this period was 426 mm versus a measured etl value of 433 mm in other words the difference between etl and ete during this 105 day period was only 6 5 mm the root mean squared error in rmse daily etl relative to ete was 1 3 mm from these results we propose that the energy balance procedure developed above using eq 6 for computing t 0 is capable of quantifying et comparable to direct measurements of et using large scale field lysimeters hence the eb method for indirectly computing et from measurements of energy balance components in the cropping system has the potential to provide a viable alternative to more directly measuring et as a change in mass in large scale field lysimeters though simple in concept and science lysimeters are expensive and difficult to install and maintain for long term data collection the energy balance closure problems associated with the ec method are not apparent with the eb method and no closure correction is applied the errors involved in the measurements of different energy balance components however can reduce the accuracies of the residual energy computed and attributed to latent heat energy most of the uncertainty in the eb method is associated with estimation of the sensible heat component even so modern highly accurate sensors for monitoring environmental variables and parameters data storage and their real time communication and automated data processing facilities available today can render the eb approach as employed in this study to be a reliable accurate alternative approach with portable instrumentation for quantifying et in crop fields for irrigation water management applications 3 2 corn experiment the eb method developed in this study can be considered fully mechanistic except for the empirical equation used in the computation of to both eqs 6 and 7 used to compute to for cotton and corn crops respectively are crop specific empirical equations the location for the corn crop experiment near stoneville ms receives an average annual rainfall of about 1300 mm of which about 36 452 mm is received during the four months of the corn growth period between april and in july saseendran et al 2016a b during this period in 2016 the location received 433 mm of rainfall characterizing the season as an average rainfall season table 1 the crop was planted on march 23 and it reached physiological maturity on august 2 maximum crop height averaged 1 9 m with an average maximum lai of 5 5 the eto for this season computed from weather data collected on the eb tower was 559 mm and etr was 666 mm we furrow irrigated the crop with 126 mm of water in three irrigation events each irrigation event lasted two days fig 4 daily temperatures varied between 8 7 and 28 1 c in april between 16 2 and 27 8 c in may between 22 5 and 32 7 c in june and between 23 5 and 34 1 c in july harvested grain yield in this season was 10 467 kg ha 1 as explained in the methods h was computed by measuring the canopy air temperature differential and computing ra from eq 5 as in the case of cotton ts in corn also was monitored using an infrared thermometer mounted on the energy balance tower maintained at 1 m above the corn canopy we used eq 7 for computing to from measurements of ts lai and u representing the corn crop canopy chávez et al 2005 as in the case of cotton substantial differences were seen between measured ts and the computed to looking at a typical non rainy day on july 16 2016 during the corn growth season when lai was on average 5 0 and plant height over an average of 1 9 m the computed to remained less than ts i e to ts is negative in fig 5 a during the day hours with a minimum value of 1 2 c at 01 00 pm the computed to went above ts at sunset i e to ts is positive in fig 5a with the maximum value of 1 3 c at 06 30 pm the general pattern in computed to relative to ts was similar on a rainy day july 17 2016 as well fig 5b these differences in to relative to ts computed for corn in the warm and humid climate of stoneville ms are much smaller than similar differences between to and ts computed in the case of cotton in a semi arid climate at bushland tx as presented earlier computed ra in corn at stoneville ms on non rainy day varied between 16 s m 1 at 16 30 and 45 s m 1 at 4 45 am fig 5a on the rainy day on july 17 2016 ra varied 22 s m 1 at 1 45 pm and 298 s m 1 07 45 pm fig 5b the data plotted in fig 6 a represents the computed energy fluxes on the eb tower on the non rainy day on july 16 2016 and those plotted in fig 6b represent similar fluxes on a rainy day on july 17 2016 at stoneville ms the crop was at r5 dent stage average lai was 5 5 and average plant height was about 190 cm during the non rainy day on july 17 rn peaked at 770 w m2 s 1 at 1 25 pm this value is typical for the location and time of the year however this value is higher than that measured in july at bushland tx due to the warmer humid climate of stoneville ms though the day was without rain there were clouds in the sky continuously masking the sun s radiation from reaching the ground surface as detected in the depressions in the rn curve on the next day july 18 2016 the location received 2 6 mm of rainfall and the sky was overcast for part of the day the maximum rn measured remained close to the previous non rainy day at 769 w m2 s 1 at 0 45 pm but when clouds masked the sun in the next hour the recorded rn went down to a minimum of 238 w m2 s 1 at 1 30 pm fig 6b on both days non rainy and rainy days enough water was available for evapotranspiration from rains that occurred in the previous days as such most of the rn received was partitioned towards le rather than h on both days go flux into the soil ve values was higher during the day hours than the night hours the corn crop was planted on march 23 2016 reached physiological maturity r6 stage on august 02 2016 and was harvested three weeks later on august 23 2016 between planting and physiological maturity the crop growth duration was 131 days energy balance data were collected during the whole crop season without a break during the crop period the estimated ete ranged between 1 7 and 7 2 mm d 1 fig 7 a b the lowest value occurred 56 days after planting may 17 2016 due to nearly overcast skies the values of eto and etr computed using climatological data collected at the location with values 1 9 and 2 3 mm respectively did not deviate substantially from the energy balance computed value the highest value of ete occurred 94 days after planting june 24 2016 with clear skies and warm weather no rainfall or cloud with a daytime maximum temperature of 33 3 c the eto and etr computed using weather data for this day were 6 6 and 5 7 mm d 1 respectively both less than the estimated ete notwithstanding there were some days when ete values lower than the computed eto and etr values on an average seasonal basis the ete values were higher than eto and less than etr computed from weather data from an agrometeorological weather station within 2 km from the experiment site the average daily ete eto and etr values during the corn growth period were 4 8 4 2 and 5 1 mm d 1 respectively the root mean squared error rmse between daily eto and etr values versus daily ete values were 1 4 and 1 5 mm respectively the computed weekly total irrigation decisions in this region are taken mostly on a weekly basis values of both eto and etr were correlated with ete with pearson s correlation coefficient r values of 0 81 coefficient of determination r2 0 66 and 0 70 r2 0 61 respectively fig 8 a and b likewise though the daily eto and etr values deviated substantially from ete estimates fig 7b seasonal total values of ete and etr were close to one other fig 7c seasonal cumulative ete eto and etr were 593 561 and 676 mm respectively therefore in the absence of direct measurements of crop et for example lysimeters eddy covariance or energy balance estimates etr computed from climatological data representing the crop conditions can be the best alternative for irrigation management applications where water is typically not the limiting factor 4 conclusions a residual energy balance eb procedure for quantifying daily evapotranspiration et from cropping systems based on measurements of the various components of heat energy balance of a land crop canopy system was developed from components studied previously in the literature in the present eb method estimated et ete is expressed as latent heat flux computed as the residual energy from a crop surface energy balance equation when r n and soil heat flux are measured and sensible heat flux is estimated from measurements of plant surface radiative temperature air temperature relative humidity and wind speed at a constant height above the canopy a flux gradient approach was employed for computation of sensible heat which requires quantification of the aerodynamic resistance to water flux across the 1 m air layer between the sensors and canopy surface the computed aerodynamic resistance was modified for wind conditions and air stability effects details of the eb components are evaluated using 15 min average values of the high resolution data which are illustrated on selected days with and without rain for a cotton field in bushland tx ete compared well with et measured concurrently in a lysimeter the present eb methodology was then used to quantify et for irrigated corn in stoneville ms on a weekly total basis the energy balance computed ete was strongly correlated with reference crop et for alfalfa etr and grass eto computed from weather data at the location the cumulative seasonal values of etr compared better with ete than eto from these results we conclude that the eb procedure presented here using movable instrumentation constitutes a viable alternative method to lysimeters and eddy covariance systems for quantifying et quickly in cropping systems for irrigation water management applications additional testing of the eb method is recommended under a broader range of climatic agronomic and soil conditions case studies on the use of the ete in irrigation scheduling applications are planned to further demonstrate the utility of the present eb method 
11445,accurate quantification of evapotranspiration et consumptive water use from planting through harvest is critical for managing limited water resources for crop irrigation our objective was to develop and apply a land crop surface residual energy balance eb method for quantifying et and to estimate et of corn zea mays l for the first time in the climate of the lower mississippi delta region actual et ete was estimated as the residual term of the energy balance equation from measurements of net solar irradiance r n and computed sensible heat h and ground heat g o fluxes the h flux was computed from measurements of the air and crop canopy temperature differential and modeling the aerodynamic resistance ra to heat and water transport in the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer above the canopy the go flux was estimated by measuring heat flux at 8 cm depth and accounting for heat storage in the soil layer above it the developed eb procedure was tested using simultaneous measurements of eb data and lysimetric et in a cotton gossypium hirsutum l field at bushland texas usa in 2008 the lysimeter measured et compared well with the computed ete under cotton rmse of daily et 1 2 mm and seasonal et within 1 error further we quantified irrigated corn et using eb in a silt loam soil at stoneville mississippi usa in 2016 the computed seasonal values of ete were greater than shortgrass reference et eto by 27 mm and less than alfalfa reference crop et etr by 80 mm the instrumentation used in the eb method can be moved and the estimated et was comparable with lysimeter measured et as such this method provides a cost effective viable alternative for quantifying et which should be broadly tested in other locations and cropping systems keywords evapotranspiration energy balance crop water requirements mississippi delta irrigation 1 introduction the eddy covariance ec and energy balance eb methods provide two scientifically sound methods for indirect but potentially accurate measurements of water fluxes from cropping systems baldochi 2003 gowda et al 2014 parent and anctil 2012 shurpali et al 2013 uddin et al 2013 because of the availability of fast response sensors and data loggers for automated measurement and storage of water and eddy transport data in the plant canopy boundary layer the ec technique is gaining a reputation as the preferred method for quantifying et amiro 2009 even after several physical and instrument corrections are applied to the flux data it has a widely acknowledged energy balance closure error between energy inputs and outputs introducing an amount of doubt in the reliability of the measured et under limited irrigation water management amiro 2009 allen et al 2011 baldochi 2003 foken et al 2006 liu et al 2017 tallec et al 2013 while the search for energy balance closure in the ec technique continues the eb approach in which all the components of energy exchange in the system other than latent heat energy are measured and accounted for in the frictional sub layer immediately above the plant canopy provides an alternative approach for fast measurement and quantification of crop et in field crops in medium size experiments amiro 2009 tanner 1960 in the eb method an energy balance equation is applied to a soil crop land area using remote or tower mounted atmospheric boundary layer sensors and near surface soil sensor measurements of the system variables bhattarai et al 2016 cammalleri et al 2012 in this approach et expressed as latent heat flux le is estimated as the residual term of the energy balance equation when other fluxes in the equation are either measured or calculated typically the sensible heat flux h is quantified assuming an air diffusion flow resistance to heat and water transport across the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer above the plant canopy also known as bulk transfer approach and soil heat flux is measured using buried heat flux plates adjusted to estimate the soil surface heat flux g o allen et al 2007a b heilman and kanemasu 1976 su 2002 many models and methods for estimating land surface et from satellite remote sensing data sebal surface energy balance algorithm for the land model for example make use of the general eb approach brunet et al 1991 bastiaanssen et al 1998 cammalleri et al 2012 mcshane et al 2017 verma et al 1976 developed a resistance energy balance resistance refers to the method for computing sensible heat flux procedure for monitoring et from sorghum sorghum bicolor l and millet panicum melimeurn l cropping systems that compared well with lysimetric measurements heilman and kanemasu 1976 developed an eb based et model that uses the diffusion resistance to heat transport in the energy balance equation they obtained et estimates within 4 and 15 bias on a seasonal basis of lysimetric measurements for soybean glycine max l and sorghum respectively simultaneous measurements of energy flux data with eb and ec approach reported comparable results in estimated et in a boreal forest system amiro 2009 kimball et al 1999 1995 1994 and triggs et al 2004 used the eb approach for comparing free air co2 enrichment effects on et from cotton gossypium hirsutum l sorghum and wheat triticum estivum l crops in these studies in general the values of sensible heat h in the eb procedure were derived from the measurements of the air and crop canopy temperature differential and modeling the aerodynamic resistance ra in vegetated land surfaces plant soil surface temperature should represent the temperature of the apparent source sink of sensible heat flux within in the plant canopy as such it should form the base measurement for quantification of the air and canopy temperature differential blonquist et al 2009 this apparent temperature known as aerodynamic temperature t o is not a directly measurable variable so crop canopy surface radiative temperature t s is commonly measured using an infrared thermometer and used as a surrogate for t o in the computations of h in cropping systems in relatively homogenous surfaces the difference between t s and t o may not be substantial but in heterogeneous crop canopy surfaces the differences can be substantial and this can lead to significant errors in the estimation of h which in turn leads to unreliable le estimates using the eb method chávez et al 2010 2005 the variable t o is defined as the temperature at the zero plane displacement height d the level to which the ground surface must be raised for the wind profile to follow a logarithmic shape plus the surface roughness length height at which wind velocity becomes zero for sensible heat transfer z h i e d z h thus t o results from the interactions of t s with the complex canopy characteristics linked to its architecture as such no known physical relationships exist between the two that can be used for predicting the value of one from the other in this context empirical relationships were derived and used in the literature for computing the value of t o from plant canopy and environmental variables in energy balance studies chávez et al 2005 for computations of t o in this study we used the equation developed by chávez et al 2010 for corn and chávez et al 2005 for cotton crops such empirical relationships linking crop specific characteristics with environmental variables were applied for simulating crop processes in cropping system models across the globe examples include the ceres rice model ritchie 1998 apsim model robertson and carberry 1998 cropsyst model stöckle et al 2003 and in modeling ecosystems norby et al 2016 rogers 2014 intensive ground based continuous monitoring of all the eb components in a cropped field are required for quantifying et based on the eb approach brown and rosenberg 1973 amiro 2009 as such application of this technology for quantifying et in cropping systems remained sporadic possibly due to the difficulties in making these continuous measurements and their storage and transmission for developing algorithms for computing resistances customized to those measurements with the advent of the modern fast response sensors data loggers and wireless communication system this is no longer considered a hindrance in adopting this technology in field research recently corn growers in the mississippi ms delta region planted an estimated 750 000 acres 303 500 ha of corn and produced about 134 bushels per acre 5400 kg ha 1 grain yield and 97 82 million bushels 6 140 161 mg in 2010 mississippi state university extension service http msucares com crops soybeans index html the long term average annual rainfall received over the mississippi delta region was approximately 1300 mm with about 30 received during the core crop growing periods from april to august saseendran et al 2016a the crop growing season rainfall is also characterized by large inter and intra seasonal variabilities in their amounts and temporal distributions to stabilize returns from crops raised in the region farmers often provide supplementary irrigations drawing water from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer in the absence of reliable information on the water needs of the crops farmers often provide arbitrary irrigations agricultural water use from this aquifer has been reported to far exceed its long term recharge rates powers 2007 global warming associated with increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere was also reported to increase pressure on irrigation water requirements in the region saseendran et al 2016b accurate timely quantification of water requirements or et of major crops cotton corn soybeans and rice grown in the region is essential for scheduling irrigations for optimizing water use efficiency wue in these cropping systems and to match irrigation withdrawals with the recharge rates of the aquifer in these contexts our objectives were to provide a synthesis of components in the eb approach and 1 develop a state of the science algorithm for computation of et based on the eb approach 2 test the et quantified using this algorithm with cotton et measured using a large scale field lysimeter at bushland tx usa and 3 use the eb algorithm to quantify et in corn at stoneville ms usa for the first time in the history of ms delta and compare it with grass and alfalfa reference crop et computed from climatological data for the location 2 methodology 2 1 the energy balance eb approach for estimating evapotranspiration et an energy balance equation for a crop soil surface can be written as 1 r n l e g 0 h δ s a i r δ s b m δ s p h where r n is the net radiation positive downward le is the latent heat flux positive upward go is the soil heat flux positive downward h is the sensible heat flux positive upward sbm is the energy stored in the biomass sair is the energy stored in the air layer and sph is the energy used in photosynthesis where δ denotes the change per unit time s units are wm 2 for energy flux and j m 2 for energy storage based upon previous work meyers and hollinger 2004 and screening calculations we assume that in summer crops 3 4 months duration like corn and cotton sair sbm and sph are negligible compared with other terms in eq 1 meyers and hollinger 2004 estimated the solar energy stored in the carbohydrate bonds from photosynthesis in the biomass and in the soil under corn when these processes were considered independently each component was found to be insignificant 5 meyers and hollinger 2004 however when these losses were combined the total loss comprised 8 14 of the net solar energy energy stored in the soil and plant canopy accounted for majority of this change in energy storage in the present study however heat storage changes in the soil water and minerals were included in eq 3 we did not compute the storage changes in crop biomass based on observations from past studies leuning et al 2012 and anderson and wang 2014 reported no net energy gain or loss due to heat storage changes in the biomass because on a daily basis energy stored in the plant biomass in the morning is returned to the air in the afternoon and evening hours in this study though we initially computed energy fluxes on a half hour interval we accumulated those fluxes for the whole day to calculate daily et at the end of the day cancelling out the gains of energy with its losses the et is calculated from eq 1 by dividing le by the latent heat of vaporization of water λ 2 501 mj kg 1 2 e t r n g 0 h λ we employed the resistance to the turbulent exchange of energy and matter between different layers of the atmosphere and the ground surface to compute et using eq 2 foken 2008 the crop surface is considered a big leaf and energy latent heat of water vapor is transferred across an atmospheric layer against a turbulent resistance this process is analogous to ohm s law for current flow in electrical conductors energy flow across the turbulent boundary layer takes place analogous to the fick s law net flux of energy is proportional to its concentration gradient 2 1 1 estimation of ground heat flux go the heat flux at the ground surface go w m 2 is estimated using the following equation kimball et al 1999 3 g 0 g 8 c s δ z δ t δ t where g 8 the soil heat flux at 8 cm depth δz

location by assigning fixed resistances for the reference crop surfaces 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the eb method for quantifying et in the bushland experiment during the cotton growing season may to september in 2008 the mean daily minimum temperature varied between 9 3 c in may to 17 4 c in july and maximum temperatures between 26 5 c in september to 33 4 c in june table 1 fig 1 a cotton grown in this region on average requires about 670 mm of water to meet its et demand chávez et al 2009 water received from rains during the 2008 season was 325 mm measured monthly total rainfall varied between 37 mm in may to 138 mm in august irrigation applied during the 2008 crop season was 284 mm with monthly total applications varying between 31 mm in may to 103 mm in july monthly total lysimeter measured et fluctuated between 72 mm in may to 23 9 mm in july totaling to 805 mm during the four months on average the location receives about 560 mm of rainfall in a year in the bushland experiment substantial differences were noticed between the measured ts and computed to for instance during the daytime on a non rainy day july 7 2008 the computed to remained less than ts to ts is negative in fig 2 a this difference peaked at 4 62 c at 1 25 pm however during the nighttime the to values were higher than ts to ts is positive where the highest difference of 6 56 c occurred at 3 25 am on july 9 2008 a rainy day with contrasting weather conditions to remained above ts throughout the day with the temperature difference ranging from 2 6 to 10 4 c fig 2b chávez et al 2010 reported differences between to and ts ranging from 2 c to 3 c for uniform canopy covers and from 10 c to 15 c for partial surface vegetation cover as explained in the methodology section ra decreases with solar radiation and solar heating induced wind speed increases in the atmosphere during the daytime as such as expected the computed ra decreased at sunrise and increased at sunset mainly due to increased wind speed and more unstable air brought by the increased heating associated with increased solar radiation fig 2a and b the maximum computed ra on a non rainy day was 45 1 s m 1 during the night time and 15 2 s m 1 during the day time fig 2a the rn is the primary input energy term in the energy balance equation used for quantification of et using the eb procedure thus the accuracy of the estimated et depends on accurate measurements of rn eq 2 the rn data plotted in fig 3 a represents a non rainy day on july 7 2008 and those plotted in fig 3b represent a rainy day two days later on july 9 2008 the cotton crop was at r4 stage average lai was 3 5 and average h was 65 cm during the non rainy day on july 7 the maximum value of rn 637 w m2 s 1 was measured at 1 00 pm local time this value is realistic for the location and time of the year illustrating the high accuracy of the energy inputs into the system on july 9 the location received 21 mm of rainfall and the sky was overcast most of the day thus r n remained below 300 w m2 s 1 and when the sun reappeared after the clouds dissipated in the sky around 2 15 pm the measured r n went up to 652 w m2 s 1 fig 3b on the non rainy day with less water available for et compared to that of the rainy day more of the rn received was partitioned towards h than le and on the rainy day with more water available for et the situation reversed more of the rn was partitioned towards le than h on the non rainy day on july 7 2008 with more rn fig 3a and b go fluxes into the soil were also higher in magnitude during the day hours compared to those on the rainy day on the rainy day when the r n went up during a brief cloud free period around 02 15 pm the computed go became more positive fig 3b the magnitude of the components of the energy balance equation 2 during these two contrasting weather periods non rainy vs rainy day are representative of the measurements during the whole cotton growth season adequate responses of the sensors with changing weather both diurnal and across days give confidence in the accuracy of the sensors used in monitoring the energy balance components in the field adequate responses in the computed go h and le across changing weather conditions a rainy versus a non rainy day illustrated the correctness of the equations implemented in the methods developed for quantifying the components of the crop surface energy balance equation though the cotton crop in the experiment was planted on may 21 2008 and harvested on december 14 2008 measurements of energy balance data could be conducted only from june 7 to august 20 2008 daily ete computed using the eb method during this period matched and correlated well with the lysimeter measured etl with an r2 coefficient of determination computed as the squared value of the pearson s correlation coefficient r value of 0 86 the total ete computed during this period was 426 mm versus a measured etl value of 433 mm in other words the difference between etl and ete during this 105 day period was only 6 5 mm the root mean squared error in rmse daily etl relative to ete was 1 3 mm from these results we propose that the energy balance procedure developed above using eq 6 for computing t 0 is capable of quantifying et comparable to direct measurements of et using large scale field lysimeters hence the eb method for indirectly computing et from measurements of energy balance components in the cropping system has the potential to provide a viable alternative to more directly measuring et as a change in mass in large scale field lysimeters though simple in concept and science lysimeters are expensive and difficult to install and maintain for long term data collection the energy balance closure problems associated with the ec method are not apparent with the eb method and no closure correction is applied the errors involved in the measurements of different energy balance components however can reduce the accuracies of the residual energy computed and attributed to latent heat energy most of the uncertainty in the eb method is associated with estimation of the sensible heat component even so modern highly accurate sensors for monitoring environmental variables and parameters data storage and their real time communication and automated data processing facilities available today can render the eb approach as employed in this study to be a reliable accurate alternative approach with portable instrumentation for quantifying et in crop fields for irrigation water management applications 3 2 corn experiment the eb method developed in this study can be considered fully mechanistic except for the empirical equation used in the computation of to both eqs 6 and 7 used to compute to for cotton and corn crops respectively are crop specific empirical equations the location for the corn crop experiment near stoneville ms receives an average annual rainfall of about 1300 mm of which about 36 452 mm is received during the four months of the corn growth period between april and in july saseendran et al 2016a b during this period in 2016 the location received 433 mm of rainfall characterizing the season as an average rainfall season table 1 the crop was planted on march 23 and it reached physiological maturity on august 2 maximum crop height averaged 1 9 m with an average maximum lai of 5 5 the eto for this season computed from weather data collected on the eb tower was 559 mm and etr was 666 mm we furrow irrigated the crop with 126 mm of water in three irrigation events each irrigation event lasted two days fig 4 daily temperatures varied between 8 7 and 28 1 c in april between 16 2 and 27 8 c in may between 22 5 and 32 7 c in june and between 23 5 and 34 1 c in july harvested grain yield in this season was 10 467 kg ha 1 as explained in the methods h was computed by measuring the canopy air temperature differential and computing ra from eq 5 as in the case of cotton ts in corn also was monitored using an infrared thermometer mounted on the energy balance tower maintained at 1 m above the corn canopy we used eq 7 for computing to from measurements of ts lai and u representing the corn crop canopy chávez et al 2005 as in the case of cotton substantial differences were seen between measured ts and the computed to looking at a typical non rainy day on july 16 2016 during the corn growth season when lai was on average 5 0 and plant height over an average of 1 9 m the computed to remained less than ts i e to ts is negative in fig 5 a during the day hours with a minimum value of 1 2 c at 01 00 pm the computed to went above ts at sunset i e to ts is positive in fig 5a with the maximum value of 1 3 c at 06 30 pm the general pattern in computed to relative to ts was similar on a rainy day july 17 2016 as well fig 5b these differences in to relative to ts computed for corn in the warm and humid climate of stoneville ms are much smaller than similar differences between to and ts computed in the case of cotton in a semi arid climate at bushland tx as presented earlier computed ra in corn at stoneville ms on non rainy day varied between 16 s m 1 at 16 30 and 45 s m 1 at 4 45 am fig 5a on the rainy day on july 17 2016 ra varied 22 s m 1 at 1 45 pm and 298 s m 1 07 45 pm fig 5b the data plotted in fig 6 a represents the computed energy fluxes on the eb tower on the non rainy day on july 16 2016 and those plotted in fig 6b represent similar fluxes on a rainy day on july 17 2016 at stoneville ms the crop was at r5 dent stage average lai was 5 5 and average plant height was about 190 cm during the non rainy day on july 17 rn peaked at 770 w m2 s 1 at 1 25 pm this value is typical for the location and time of the year however this value is higher than that measured in july at bushland tx due to the warmer humid climate of stoneville ms though the day was without rain there were clouds in the sky continuously masking the sun s radiation from reaching the ground surface as detected in the depressions in the rn curve on the next day july 18 2016 the location received 2 6 mm of rainfall and the sky was overcast for part of the day the maximum rn measured remained close to the previous non rainy day at 769 w m2 s 1 at 0 45 pm but when clouds masked the sun in the next hour the recorded rn went down to a minimum of 238 w m2 s 1 at 1 30 pm fig 6b on both days non rainy and rainy days enough water was available for evapotranspiration from rains that occurred in the previous days as such most of the rn received was partitioned towards le rather than h on both days go flux into the soil ve values was higher during the day hours than the night hours the corn crop was planted on march 23 2016 reached physiological maturity r6 stage on august 02 2016 and was harvested three weeks later on august 23 2016 between planting and physiological maturity the crop growth duration was 131 days energy balance data were collected during the whole crop season without a break during the crop period the estimated ete ranged between 1 7 and 7 2 mm d 1 fig 7 a b the lowest value occurred 56 days after planting may 17 2016 due to nearly overcast skies the values of eto and etr computed using climatological data collected at the location with values 1 9 and 2 3 mm respectively did not deviate substantially from the energy balance computed value the highest value of ete occurred 94 days after planting june 24 2016 with clear skies and warm weather no rainfall or cloud with a daytime maximum temperature of 33 3 c the eto and etr computed using weather data for this day were 6 6 and 5 7 mm d 1 respectively both less than the estimated ete notwithstanding there were some days when ete values lower than the computed eto and etr values on an average seasonal basis the ete values were higher than eto and less than etr computed from weather data from an agrometeorological weather station within 2 km from the experiment site the average daily ete eto and etr values during the corn growth period were 4 8 4 2 and 5 1 mm d 1 respectively the root mean squared error rmse between daily eto and etr values versus daily ete values were 1 4 and 1 5 mm respectively the computed weekly total irrigation decisions in this region are taken mostly on a weekly basis values of both eto and etr were correlated with ete with pearson s correlation coefficient r values of 0 81 coefficient of determination r2 0 66 and 0 70 r2 0 61 respectively fig 8 a and b likewise though the daily eto and etr values deviated substantially from ete estimates fig 7b seasonal total values of ete and etr were close to one other fig 7c seasonal cumulative ete eto and etr were 593 561 and 676 mm respectively therefore in the absence of direct measurements of crop et for example lysimeters eddy covariance or energy balance estimates etr computed from climatological data representing the crop conditions can be the best alternative for irrigation management applications where water is typically not the limiting factor 4 conclusions a residual energy balance eb procedure for quantifying daily evapotranspiration et from cropping systems based on measurements of the various components of heat energy balance of a land crop canopy system was developed from components studied previously in the literature in the present eb method estimated et ete is expressed as latent heat flux computed as the residual energy from a crop surface energy balance equation when r n and soil heat flux are measured and sensible heat flux is estimated from measurements of plant surface radiative temperature air temperature relative humidity and wind speed at a constant height above the canopy a flux gradient approach was employed for computation of sensible heat which requires quantification of the aerodynamic resistance to water flux across the 1 m air layer between the sensors and canopy surface the computed aerodynamic resistance was modified for wind conditions and air stability effects details of the eb components are evaluated using 15 min average values of the high resolution data which are illustrated on selected days with and without rain for a cotton field in bushland tx ete compared well with et measured concurrently in a lysimeter the present eb methodology was then used to quantify et for irrigated corn in stoneville ms on a weekly total basis the energy balance computed ete was strongly correlated with reference crop et for alfalfa etr and grass eto computed from weather data at the location the cumulative seasonal values of etr compared better with ete than eto from these results we conclude that the eb procedure presented here using movable instrumentation constitutes a viable alternative method to lysimeters and eddy covariance systems for quantifying et quickly in cropping systems for irrigation water management applications additional testing of the eb method is recommended under a broader range of climatic agronomic and soil conditions case studies on the use of the ete in irrigation scheduling applications are planned to further demonstrate the utility of the present eb method 
11446,under the zero slope conditions of surface drip irrigation the emitter discharge along the lateral is also decreased for non compensating emitters however in subsurface drip irrigation the lateral emitter is buried in the soil and the pressure of the emitter outlets is affected by soil physical properties because of the spatial variability of soil physical properties the emitter discharge along the lateral is complex the traditional discharge equation could not show the influence of soil properties on emitter discharge a new emitter discharge formula is established that has soil initial water content soil bulk density mass fractal dimension and head pressure as factors and a nonlinear mathematical model of lateral hydraulics based on the emitter discharge formula is created experiments were then conducted to verify the model compare the heping emitter with an inside diameter of 12 mm and outside diameter of 13 mm and plassim emitter with an inside diameter of 14 mm and outside diameter of 15 2 mm and assess the relative contribution of various factors to emitter discharge the results of the experiments indicate that ① the emitter discharge along the lateral head in the direction of flow followed a decline law in homogeneous soil and decreased in a fluctuating manner in heterogeneous soil ② the larger standard deviation of soil initial water content bulk density mass fractal dimension when each factor remained the same the more disperse the emitter discharge along lateral keywords lateral hydraulic performance subsurface drip irrigation soil spatial variability emitter discharge 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi has many advantages compared with surface irrigation the main advantages of sdi are related to water savings because water is applied directly to the crop s root zone s not only reduces soil water evaporation losses jordan et al 2014 but also reduces water use mansour et al 2010 reduces pollution song et al 2006 increases farmland and irrigation efficiency crookston and tullis 2013 and enhances productivity and product quality a further advantage of sdi is more efficient fertilization zhang et al 2011 as a result of improved water application uniformity thus sdi has become a common method for the irrigation of field crops jordan et al 2014 orchards pisciotta et al 2018 landscaping zhang et al 2016 and greenhouse vegetables bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 from the 1990s to the start of this decade the influence of irrigation network parameters was studied in general the design of irrigation systems is based on the assigned uniformity of flow rates it must consider the flow regime the inside diameter pipe slope pipe length the inlet discharge and the pressure head at the inlet and out terminal of the lateral khemaies et al 2013 previous continuous uniform outlet discharge approaches for the hydraulic analysis of irrigation laterals are generally valid for large infinite number of outlets however for a finite number of outlets these approaches may lead to errors in hydraulic computation valiantzas 2002 presented a new continuous uniform outflow approach that takes into account the effect of the number of outlets on the lateral hydraulics which the effect of ground slope and velocity head on hydraulic computation is considered khemaies et al 2013 provided an analytical method to design evenly sloping pressurized nontapered multiple outlet pipes the approach was derived from the solution of analytical nonlinear differential equations holzapfel et al 2014 developed a classic nonlinear optimization model for the design and management of drip irrigation systems that takes into account lateral diameter lateral length number of lateral emitters number of laterals total number of subunits irrigation time this approach was better applied to heterogeneous soil however the hydraulic performance of laterals is not only impacted by pipe material network parameters inlet pressure pipeline diameter slope flow regime and emitter spacing but also by soil physical properties warrick and shani 1996 and is thus a complex issue lazarovitch et al 2006 suggest that the pressure head of the soil water adjacent to the source outlet increases to become positive when the subsurface discharge rate is higher than the soil infiltration capacity this is because a buildup of pressure in the soil restricts water transmission away from the dripper hu and cheng 2014 the effects of positive water pressure created by soil conditions influence the performance of sdi systems the obvious effect is such that emitter discharge ed decrease in soils with low infiltration shani et al 1996 because of the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties there will be variability of dripper discharge lazarovitch et al 2006 which will subsequently cause the following first due to the soil physical properties follow a normal distribution in nature hua and nianpeng 2016 each point in the field has different physical properties siwc sbd and mfd and there has a different effects on each emitter discharge when the designer often deal with the irrigation systems that took the physical properties as homogeneous soil as a result there will be a great error between measured value and the calculated value of ed second there will be spatial variability of water application in the field i e localized over or under irrigation yıldırım 2014 third influenced by irrigation uniformity there will be strong spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties with corresponding reductions of sdi uniformity ren et al 2017 in short the combination of soil and the drip system hydraulic properties affect the local discharge rather than just the properties of the drip system researchers usually ignore the impact of soil physical properties and their spatial variability on ed to simplify calculations lamm et al 2017 thus the error between measured and calculated values can be considerable to address this knowledge gap the hydraulic performance of laterals for sdi based on the spatial variability of soil physical characteristics will be addressed by this paper the specific objectives of this paper are to 1 design a method to measure the ed of a lateral 2 establish a new nonlinear hydraulic mathematical model of flow through a lateral taking into account inlet pressure head end flow in the

labyrinth emitters were used heping emitter produced by shaanxi peace technology industrial co ltd in china and plassim emitter produced by plassim technical plastics works for agr ind bldg ltd in israeli heping emitter with an inside diameter of 12 mm and an outside diameter of 13 mm and plassim emitter with an inside diameter of 14 mm and an outside diameter of 15 2 mm to eliminate the influence of manufacturing deviations on ed we chose 30 out of 300 emitters under a given pressure to ensure that the discharge of each emitter was as similar as possible the soil with different siwc sbd and mfd was packed into plastic buckets with diameters of 50 cm and heights of 60 cm for each group there were 15 soil boxes and 15 corresponding emitters the soil boxes were linked with three way pipes and the emitter spacing was 0 8 m 2 3 1 test experiment the test experiments were carried out based on the scheme in table 2 and the corresponding emitter types of test experiments for ep1 and wp2 were heping and plassim respectively it is interesting to note that the flow direction of laterals was from emitter 1 to emitter 15 for ep1 and ep2 the soil parameters for emitters 1 4 7 10 and 13 were the same as were the soil parameters for emitters 2 5 8 11 and 14 and also the parameters of emitters 3 6 9 12 and 15 tables 2 and 3 the inlet pressure head h 0 terminal pressure head h e and

table 4 the unit of θ γ and d are g cm 3 and dimensionless in tables 2 and 5 2 3 2 validation experiment the validation experiments were carried out based on the scheme given in table 5 the caveat is that the validation experiments have the same soil physical parameters for ep3 and ep4 but different emitter model which were heping and plassim respectively and the flow direction of laterals was

of the emitter h 0 working head at the emitter m and x ed exponent and range from 0 to 1 warrick and shani 1996 hypothesized that the ed rate decrease was caused by the back pressure therefore if an overpressure develops at the emitter discharge point the hydraulic gradient between the emitter interior and the soil would decrease and q would decrease according to gil et al 2008 3 q k h 0 h s x where h s is back pressure develops at the discharge point of the emitter philip 1992 developed an analytical expression to determine the pressure at the discharge point in a permanent flow regime shani et al 1996 tested the applicability of this expression under variable sdi conditions the expression relates the soil cavity pressure h s to the soil hydraulic properties and the emitter flow

defined as 5 q k γ α θ β d ω h x where h pressure head m γ sbd g cm 3 θ siwc cm3 cm 3 d mfd k ed experience coefficient x flow exponent α β ω experience exponent related to sbd siwc and mfd the mfd of soil reflects properties such as clay content the greater the mfd the higher the clay content pieri et al 2006 the mfd can be calculated from the following equation tyler and wheatcraft 1992 6 m r r i

gitlin 1975 10 h f h f u h f s christiansen 1941 related the frictional head loss in a sprinkler lateral with a flow q distributed by n evenly spaced outlets with those corresponding to the same lateral of length l and internal diameter d discharging the whole flow q at the downstream end of the lateral as follows 11 h f u f q m d b juana et al 2002 assumed a constant equivalent length l e for each evenly spaced emitter pumo and provenzano 2004 noted that local losses are usually evaluated as a fraction of kinetic head flow and to take into account singular losses h fs the head loss h f

insertions along laterals juana et al 2002 suggested that the error in f s would vary from 3 to 6 while that for l e would vary from 6 to 12 therefore in this paper a value of f s 1 1 is used for the

simulate the ed distribution along laterals in natural conditions the siwc sbd and mfd were generated using a normal gauss distribution where θ normrnd 0 12 0 005 1100 γ normrnd 1 35 0 003 1100 d normrnd 2 566 0 06 1100 and keeping the other parameters constant the ed of the lateral distribution are shown in fig 6d the dashed in fig 4 a and b show that the ed along laterals decreased with a fluctuating tendency this is a result of the differences in soil physical properties and illustrates that soil heterogeneity will lead to variability in ed as shown the solid lines in fig 4 a and b the discharge from emitters 1 4 7 10 and 13 decreased along the lateral the discharge from emitters 2 5 8 11 and 14 and from emitters 3 6 9 12 and 15 followed a similar pattern and moreover from fig 5 a and b it appears that whether heping emitters or plassim emitters the measured values of ed agree well with the calculated value and the ed along the lateral presented an overall decreasing trend which displayed that ed along the lateral decreased in a fluctuating manner in heterogeneous soil the explanation for these similarities is that each set of emitters has the same soil parameters in other words the soil physical parameters corresponding emitter connected by solid is homogenized soil the ed consists of multiplying two parts according to eq 5 one is affect by soil properties γ α θ β d ω another is influenced by pressure head h x because of the homogenized soil so γ i α θ i β d i ω γ i 3 α θ i 3 β d i 3 ω and then the size of ed merely depends on the pressure head and since the head loss the emitter pressure head declined in the lateral direction h i x h i 3 x subsequently it can extrapolate q i q i 3 therefore the ed along laterals decreased with a fluctuating tendency in heterogeneous soil and unidirectional decreased along the lateral in homogenized soil for the validation experiment from the data in table 7 it can be seen that the maximum minimum and mean relative error for measured and calculated values of ed are 6 61 1 29 and 3 91 for heping emitter and 6 95 2 88 and 4 95 for plassim emitter respectively this demonstrates that the nonlinear hydraulic mathematical model has a high calculation accuracy and also demonstrates good universal applicability because the model is applicable to different soil types fig 6a b and c show that ed along the lateral decreased with fluctuation because of the spatial variability of siwc sbd and mfd those figures also show that the larger of siwc sbd and mfd when each factor remained the same the more disperse the emitter discharge along lateral as shown in fig 6 d the ed along laterals decreased with a fluctuating tendency under the interaction of siwc sbd and mdf but compared with the influence of siwc and mdf the fluctuation is smaller meanwhile the more obvious the trend that ed unidirectional decreased along the lateral it may be that the effect of soil physical characteristics on ed cancel each other out which the change of direction of factors caused by randomness 4 discussions the ed along the lateral decrease with fluctuation in heterogeneous soil we think it can be interpreted from two aspects the first is energy caused by frictional losses and local head loss along the lateral because of head loss emitter pressure along the lateral decreased along the flow direction for zero slope because emitter discharge was affected only by pressure without the influence of soil physical properties the lower the pressure the greater that discharge the second aspect is randomness caused by soil spatial variation owing to heterogeneity in the soil physical property spatial distribution randomness is also reflected in the emitter discharge along the lateral soil hydraulic properties can impact the discharge rate of sdi it is due to the positive water pressure jnad et al 2001 developed in the soil around dropper lazarovitch et al 2006 took the saturated hydraulic conductivity as the soil physics parameter and generated the random saturated hydraulic conductivity to describe the effect of variations of soil hydraulic properties by gaussian function this approach was better simulating the ed distribution in heterogeneous soil however this approach requires that the soil hydraulic conductivity must be in the saturated case in addition the approach is not well reflecting the influence of head loss on discharge hence such an approach would not be suitable in soil with low permeability the advantage of this approach in this article which take the siwc sbd and mfd as the soil physics parameters is that first of all those factors can be better reflect the soil hydraulic characteristics whether the soil is saturated or unsaturated second the calculated of ed is more closer to the actual value due to this approach consider the effect of head loss and the soil spatial variation last it can quantitatively describe the effect of each factors on hydraulic performance of lateral 5 conclusion soil physical properties and their variability can impact the lateral hydraulic performance of sdi irrespective of whether the discharge was from a heping emitter or a plassim emitter in heterogeneous soil ed along the lateral decreased with fluctuation because of the spatial variability of siwc sbd and mfd the larger of siwc sbd and mfd when each factor remained the same the more disperse the ed along lateral on the one hand this reflects the law of energy decrease caused by head losses on the other hand this reflects the randomness of

11446,under the zero slope conditions of surface drip irrigation the emitter discharge along the lateral is also decreased for non compensating emitters however in subsurface drip irrigation the lateral emitter is buried in the soil and the pressure of the emitter outlets is affected by soil physical properties because of the spatial variability of soil physical properties the emitter discharge along the lateral is complex the traditional discharge equation could not show the influence of soil properties on emitter discharge a new emitter discharge formula is established that has soil initial water content soil bulk density mass fractal dimension and head pressure as factors and a nonlinear mathematical model of lateral hydraulics based on the emitter discharge formula is created experiments were then conducted to verify the model compare the heping emitter with an inside diameter of 12 mm and outside diameter of 13 mm and plassim emitter with an inside diameter of 14 mm and outside diameter of 15 2 mm and assess the relative contribution of various factors to emitter discharge the results of the experiments indicate that ① the emitter discharge along the lateral head in the direction of flow followed a decline law in homogeneous soil and decreased in a fluctuating manner in heterogeneous soil ② the larger standard deviation of soil initial water content bulk density mass fractal dimension when each factor remained the same the more disperse the emitter discharge along lateral keywords lateral hydraulic performance subsurface drip irrigation soil spatial variability emitter discharge 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi has many advantages compared with surface irrigation the main advantages of sdi are related to water savings because water is applied directly to the crop s root zone s not only reduces soil water evaporation losses jordan et al 2014 but also reduces water use mansour et al 2010 reduces pollution song et al 2006 increases farmland and irrigation efficiency crookston and tullis 2013 and enhances productivity and product quality a further advantage of sdi is more efficient fertilization zhang et al 2011 as a result of improved water application uniformity thus sdi has become a common method for the irrigation of field crops jordan et al 2014 orchards pisciotta et al 2018 landscaping zhang et al 2016 and greenhouse vegetables bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 from the 1990s to the start of this decade the influence of irrigation network parameters was studied in general the design of irrigation systems is based on the assigned uniformity of flow rates it must consider the flow regime the inside diameter pipe slope pipe length the inlet discharge and the pressure head at the inlet and out terminal of the lateral khemaies et al 2013 previous continuous uniform outlet discharge approaches for the hydraulic analysis of irrigation laterals are generally valid for large infinite number of outlets however for a finite number of outlets these approaches may lead to errors in hydraulic computation valiantzas 2002 presented a new continuous uniform outflow approach that takes into account the effect of the number of outlets on the lateral hydraulics which the effect of ground slope and velocity head on hydraulic computation is considered khemaies et al 2013 provided an analytical method to design evenly sloping pressurized nontapered multiple outlet pipes the approach was derived from the solution of analytical nonlinear differential equations holzapfel et al 2014 developed a classic nonlinear optimization model for the design and management of drip irrigation systems that takes into account lateral diameter lateral length number of lateral emitters number of laterals total number of subunits irrigation time this approach was better applied to heterogeneous soil however the hydraulic performance of laterals is not only impacted by pipe material network parameters inlet pressure pipeline diameter slope flow regime and emitter spacing but also by soil physical properties warrick and shani 1996 and is thus a complex issue lazarovitch et al 2006 suggest that the pressure head of the soil water adjacent to the source outlet increases to become positive when the subsurface discharge rate is higher than the soil infiltration capacity this is because a buildup of pressure in the soil restricts water transmission away from the dripper hu and cheng 2014 the effects of positive water pressure created by soil conditions influence the performance of sdi systems the obvious effect is such that emitter discharge ed decrease in soils with low infiltration shani et al 1996 because of the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties there will be variability of dripper discharge lazarovitch et al 2006 which will subsequently cause the following first due to the soil physical properties follow a normal distribution in nature hua and nianpeng 2016 each point in the field has different physical properties siwc sbd and mfd and there has a different effects on each emitter discharge when the designer often deal with the irrigation systems that took the physical properties as homogeneous soil as a result there will be a great error between measured value and the calculated value of ed second there will be spatial variability of water application in the field i e localized over or under irrigation yıldırım 2014 third influenced by irrigation uniformity there will be strong spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties with corresponding reductions of sdi uniformity ren et al 2017 in short the combination of soil and the drip system hydraulic properties affect the local discharge rather than just the properties of the drip system researchers usually ignore the impact of soil physical properties and their spatial variability on ed to simplify calculations lamm et al 2017 thus the error between measured and calculated values can be considerable to address this knowledge gap the hydraulic performance of laterals for sdi based on the spatial variability of soil physical characteristics will be addressed by this paper the specific objectives of this paper are to 1 design a method to measure the ed of a lateral 2 establish a new nonlinear hydraulic mathematical model of flow through a lateral taking into account inlet pressure head end flow in the lateral number of emitters emitter spacing lateral slope head losses lateral diameter and the soil parameters soil bulk density sbd soil initial water content siwc and mass fractal dimension mfd and 3

israeli heping emitter with an inside diameter of 12 mm and an outside diameter of 13 mm and plassim emitter with an inside diameter of 14 mm and an outside diameter of 15 2 mm to eliminate the influence of manufacturing deviations on ed we chose 30 out of 300 emitters under a given pressure to ensure that the discharge of each emitter was as similar as possible the soil with different siwc sbd and mfd was packed into plastic buckets with diameters of 50 cm and heights of 60 cm for each group there were 15 soil boxes and 15 corresponding emitters the soil boxes were linked with three way pipes and the emitter spacing was 0 8 m 2 3 1 test experiment the test experiments were carried out based on the scheme in table 2 and the corresponding emitter types of test experiments for ep1 and

table 4 the unit of θ γ and d are g cm 3 and dimensionless in tables 2 and 5 2 3 2 validation experiment the validation experiments were carried out based on the scheme given in table 5 the caveat is that the validation experiments have the same soil physical parameters for ep3 and ep4 but different emitter model which were heping and plassim respectively and the flow direction of laterals was

of the emitter h 0 working head at the emitter m and x ed exponent and range from 0 to 1 warrick and shani 1996 hypothesized that the ed rate decrease was caused by the back pressure therefore if an overpressure develops at the emitter discharge point the hydraulic gradient between the emitter interior and the soil would decrease and q would decrease according to gil et al 2008 3 q k h 0 h s x where h s is back pressure develops at the discharge point of the emitter philip 1992 developed an analytical expression to determine the pressure at the discharge point in a permanent flow regime shani et al 1996 tested the applicability of this expression under variable sdi conditions the expression relates the soil cavity pressure h s to the soil hydraulic properties and the emitter flow

gitlin 1975 10 h f h f u h f s christiansen 1941 related the frictional head loss in a sprinkler lateral with a flow q distributed by n evenly spaced outlets with those corresponding to the same lateral of length l and internal diameter d discharging the whole flow q at the downstream end of the lateral as follows 11 h f u f q m d b juana et al 2002 assumed a constant equivalent length l e for each evenly spaced emitter pumo and provenzano 2004 noted that local losses are usually evaluated as a fraction of kinetic head flow and to take into account singular losses h fs the head loss h f

simulate the ed distribution along laterals in natural conditions the siwc sbd and mfd were generated using a normal gauss distribution where θ normrnd 0 12 0 005 1100 γ normrnd 1 35 0 003 1100 d normrnd 2 566 0 06 1100 and keeping the other parameters constant the ed of the lateral distribution are shown in fig 6d the dashed in fig 4 a and b show that the ed along laterals decreased with a fluctuating tendency this is a result of the differences in soil physical properties and illustrates that soil heterogeneity will lead to variability in ed as shown the solid lines in fig 4 a and b the discharge from emitters 1 4 7 10 and 13 decreased along the lateral the discharge from emitters 2 5 8 11 and 14 and from emitters 3 6 9 12 and 15 followed a similar pattern and moreover from fig 5 a and b it appears that whether heping emitters or plassim emitters the measured values of ed agree well with the calculated value and the ed along the lateral presented an overall decreasing trend which displayed that ed along the lateral decreased in a fluctuating manner in heterogeneous soil the explanation for these similarities is that each set of emitters has the same soil parameters in other words the soil physical parameters corresponding emitter connected by solid is homogenized soil the ed consists of multiplying two parts according to eq 5 one is affect by soil properties γ α θ β d ω another is influenced by pressure head h x because of the homogenized soil so γ i α θ i β d i ω γ i 3 α θ i 3 β d i 3 ω and then the size of ed merely depends on the pressure head and since the head loss the emitter pressure head declined in the lateral direction h i x h i 3 x subsequently it can extrapolate q i q i 3 therefore the ed along laterals decreased with a fluctuating tendency in heterogeneous soil and unidirectional decreased along the lateral in homogenized soil for the validation experiment from the data in table 7 it can be seen that the maximum minimum and mean relative error for measured and calculated values of ed are 6 61 1 29 and 3 91 for heping emitter and 6 95 2 88 and 4 95 for plassim emitter respectively this demonstrates that the nonlinear hydraulic mathematical model has a high calculation accuracy and also demonstrates good universal applicability because the model is applicable to different soil types fig 6a b and c show that ed along the lateral decreased with fluctuation because of the spatial variability of siwc sbd and mfd those figures also show that the larger of siwc sbd and mfd when each factor remained the same the more disperse the emitter discharge along lateral as shown in fig 6 d the ed along laterals decreased with a fluctuating tendency under the interaction of siwc sbd and mdf but compared with the influence of siwc and mdf the fluctuation is smaller meanwhile the more obvious the trend that ed unidirectional decreased along the lateral it may be that the effect of soil physical characteristics on ed cancel each other out which the change of direction of factors caused by randomness 4 discussions the ed along the lateral decrease with fluctuation in heterogeneous soil we think it can be interpreted from two aspects the first is energy caused by frictional losses and local head loss along the lateral because of head loss emitter pressure along the lateral decreased along the flow direction for zero slope because emitter discharge was affected only by pressure without the influence of soil physical properties the lower the pressure the greater that discharge the second aspect is randomness caused by soil spatial variation owing to heterogeneity in the soil physical property spatial distribution randomness is also reflected in the emitter discharge along the lateral soil hydraulic properties can impact the discharge rate of sdi it is due to the positive water pressure jnad et al 2001 developed in the soil around dropper lazarovitch et al 2006 took the saturated hydraulic conductivity as the soil physics parameter and generated the random saturated hydraulic conductivity to describe the effect of variations of soil hydraulic properties by gaussian function this approach was better simulating the ed distribution in heterogeneous soil however this approach requires that the soil hydraulic conductivity must be in the saturated case in addition the approach is not well reflecting the influence of head loss on discharge hence such an approach would not be suitable in soil with low permeability the advantage of this approach in this article which take the siwc sbd and mfd as the soil physics parameters is that first of all those factors can be better reflect the soil hydraulic characteristics whether the soil is saturated or unsaturated second the calculated of ed is more closer to the actual value due to this approach consider the effect of head loss and the soil spatial variation last it can quantitatively describe the effect of each factors on hydraulic performance of lateral 5 conclusion soil physical properties and their variability can impact the lateral hydraulic performance of sdi irrespective of whether the discharge was from a heping emitter or a plassim emitter in heterogeneous soil ed along the lateral decreased with fluctuation because of the spatial variability of siwc sbd and mfd the larger of siwc sbd and mfd when each factor remained the same the more disperse the ed along lateral on the one hand this reflects the law of energy decrease caused by head losses on the other hand this reflects the randomness of effects caused by heterogeneous soil this study achieved the following ① a new ed formula was established that take siwc sbd mfd and head pressure into account ② a nonlinear mathematical model of lateral hydraulics was established that takes into account inlet pressure head end flow of lateral emitter number emitter spacing lateral slope head losses inner diameter of lateral and soil physics

11447,soil degradation and declining tree performance following long term irrigation with treated wastewater tww have been reported recently in orchards grown on clay soils in an attempt to reverse this situation our research objectives were to quantify the effects of replacing tww irrigation with fresh water fw on water uptake water and mineral status growth and yield of citrus trees in relation to soil physical and chemical properties a field experiment was carried out in a commercial grapefruit orchard in a clay soil with a history of tww irrigation changing irrigation water

water uptake were all significantly and favorably affected by replacing tww with fw although fruit yield increased by replacing tww with fw irrigation it was not significantly associated with any single or group of the studied soil attributes however in a stepwise regression analysis a correlation was established between fruit yield and leaf cl and soil as our findings indicate that the negative effects of irrigation with tww are i through damage to soil structure leading to reduced water uptake and ii via accumulation of na and cl in roots and leaves of grapefruits to toxic levels

in clay soils lado et al 2012 this increases the osmotic potential of the tww the soil water potential and the osmotic gradient between the soil solution and the plant reducing water uptake by plants and root activity assouline et al 2015 the main toxic effects stem from high concentrations of the most common ions na and cl and from some trace ions like b ben hur 2004 for many years b was a major threat to citrus orchards irrigated with tww in israel but in the past decade new regulations have led to a large reduction in the median b concentration in tww from 0 4 to 0 17 mg l 1 tarchitzky et

effect of the presence of dissolved organic matter in the tww was equivalent to an increase in sar of two to three units suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 several studies further suggested that long term

soil tree response to irrigation with fw following long term irrigation with tww except for an observation that reported positive influences of replacing tww with fw in citrus orchards azenkot et al 2005 we hypothesized that damage to the soil tree system following long term tww irrigation is reversible and the questions are to what extent and how fast the soil tree system will recover following replacement of tww with fw we propose to test our hypothesis in the same orchard where a preliminary study compared soil properties in irrigated rows with those in the unirrigated area between rows

fw irrigation treatment are listed in table 1 the clay size particle fraction was high 690 g kg 1 whereas the sand fraction was much lower 160 g kg 1 the carbonate content was considerable about 10 leading to ph above 7 0 and probably a high buffer capacity for ph the cec was high in agreement with the clay content esp was high probably due to the long term irrigation with tww containing relatively high sar the orchard had a history of irrigation with treated wastewater from 1986 until 1991 followed by 10 years of experiments with two water sources fw and tww lado et al 2012 which led to significant yield decline and severe damage of trees including mortality of a few trees from 2001 to 2004 different management treatments or remediation of the orchard were examined azenkot et al 2005 the trees were uprooted and rain fed annual crops were grown during the next 4 years and then the current orchard was planted in 2007 and irrigated with tww each tree row was irrigated with a set

statistical design and analysis the experimental design was randomized blocks analyses of variance anova were carried out with jmp 12 0 software sas institute and anova was used to obtain an f value for significance in two or three way linear models with water quality block and year and their interactions mean separations were performed on the basis of the tukey kramer honestly significant difference hsd test at p 05 a standardized principal component and classification analysis pcca statistica statsoft inc 2004 dell usa was used to identify possible relationships between our tested soil indices and the tree parameters the pcca searches for linear combinations of variables and identifies a group of principal components pcs that account for maximum variance shared by the variables of the data set under study jolliffe 2002 a decision whether a pc is worth considering for further analysis depends on the level of the eigenvalue associated with it we examined only pcs with an eigenvalue 1 0 as proposed by brejda et al 2000 further classification of the tested variables is carried out by using factor loadings the factor loadings are equivalent to the correlations between the variables and the components since the current analysis is based on the correlation matrix within a given pc presence of variables having a factor loading close to ǀ1ǀ suggests that these variables share a large proportion of the variance represented by the pc and hence the existence of some relationships among them only variables associated with a factor loading having an absolute value 0 8 were considered for further analysis of their relations the stepwise regression procedure of jmp 12 0 was used to obtain the best linear equation for the quantitative effects of the measured

water quality the most significant water quality parameters for tww and fw are shown in table 1 differences between the two irrigation water sources were significant during the whole experiment high values of organic matter cod and bod and total suspended solids tss were found in the secondary tww salinity was higher in the tww ec 2 3 than in fw ec 1 1 ds m 1 the main ions that contributed to the higher ec in tww were cl and na whereas the differences in ca and mg were smaller and inconsistent table 1 the higher na concentration in tww relative to fw without a parallel increase in ca and mg elevated the sar level from a mean value of 3 4 in the fw to about 6 8 in tww in addition tww had high concentrations of the major nutrients n mainly as nh4 and some as organic nitrogen p and k and similar to the fw after injection of liquid fertilizers the overall quantity of n p and k supplied with the tww met the citrus fertilization requirements boron concentrations were similar in both types of water and it s concentration was well below 0 4 mg l 1 the threshold value for b toxicity for citrus grieve et al 2012 mass 1990 heavy metal concentrations were below thresholds in both sources of water not shown 3 2 soil chemical and physical properties the effects of the irrigation water type on ec ph cl cations na ca and mg and the sar in the solution of the soil profile are presented in fig 2 and table 3 the ph cl and na were higher in the top layers of the tww than in the fw treatment and the differences between tww and fw increased from the end of the first year 2013 to the end of the second year 2014 and decreased with depth ec ca and mg of the soil solution did not differ significantly between treatments a trend of lower values of ca and mg concentrations in the tww at 30 cm was found at the end of the second year of irrigation consequently the sar in tww was significantly higher in fw from the upper soil down to 120 cm the sar in tww and fw was in the range of 4 5 5 0 and 2 8 4 5 respectively ec and concentrations of cl ca and mg decreased from the upper layer downward to 120 150 cm depth whereas the trend in na concentration was in the opposite direction accumulation of salts in the upper soil is result of selective uptake of ions by the trees and the opposite distribution of na is due to the higher preference of the cation exchange complex to ca mg and k over na in the second year of the experiment the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and inorganic carbon ic in the top layers for tww were significantly higher than those for fw b concentrations in the soil profile were relatively high despite the fact that b concentration in both water types was very low 0 1 mg l 1 the high b concentration in the soil is probably residual from a prior period when tww contained more b i e 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 b in the first year was similar in the two treatments and a reduction was found in the second year the gap between the first and second year was larger in the fw than the tww probably due to displacement of sorbed b by higher concentrations of bicarbonates and orthophosphate in the tww however in both water treatments the available b values were very close to each other and well above critical toxicity levels of 0 4 mg l 1 for citrus grieve et al 2012 mass 1990 two other soil properties esp and as known to be affected by esp were measured only at the end of the irrigation season of the second year 2014 the mean esp of the top 0 60 cm depth was much higher for tww than fw fig 3 table 3 while the as at this soil depth was higher for fw fig 4 table 3 the largest difference in the esp between tww and fw was at 30 60 cm a similar observation was noted by levy et al 2014a as at 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm decreased with shaking time as expected in all the measured depths and through the process of shaking higher as values were obtained from the soil irrigated with fw than with tww fig 4 table 3 3 3 elemental contents in leaves and roots during the experimental period concentrations of macro and micro nutrients n p k ca mg fe and mn in the leaves were measured in all treatments and found to be sufficient with no significant effect of water quality table a1 appendix in supplementary material whereas fw significantly reduced na and cl in leaves and roots relative to tww irrigation fig 5 and table a1 appendix in supplementary material leaf and root b concentrations were not affected by water quality in agreement with the low b concentrations in both tww and fw in general leaf b was relatively high but below the critical value of 200 mg kg 1 for b toxicity in citrus storey and walker 1998 3 4 stem water potential and water uptake sap flow and mid day stem water potential ψstem were monitored from the beginning of the experiments fig 6 both were generally higher for fw than tww significant differences in sap flow were observed after four months of irrigation with small differences between treatments in winter rainfall season without irrigation and larger differences in summer dry season with irrigation fig 6a similar effects of irrigation with fw versus tww on mid day stem water potential ψstem were observed fig 6b and the effects of season on ψstem were similar to those for sap flow 3 5 plant vegetative growth every year shoot and root length increased with time from the beginning to the end of the irrigation season and this increase was significantly higher for fw than tww fig 7 in general leaf area and trunk diameter for fw were higher than for tww fig 8 a although differences in trunk diameter growth were not significant fig 8b a significant increase in leaf area of 22 for fw was found in the second growing season fig 8a 3 6 yield and fruit quality several yield parameters fruit set fruit diameter crop load fruit weight and yield measured during harvest in the fall after three irrigation periods are presented in table 4 overall fruit yield was higher for fw than tww table 4 and fig 9 treatment effects on fruit yield were not significant in the first two years although fruit diameter and fruit weight were significantly affected table 4 and a significant effect on fruit yield was obtained from the third year onwards fig 9 fruit quality parameters like total soluble solids titrateable acid content and maturity index mi were not affected by water quality but peel thickness pt was in all three growing seasons table a2 appendix in supplementary material 4 discussion the results show that irrigation with tww influenced the whole citrus orchard system from the soil through the root system trunk leaf growth and up to fruit yield use of the whole system approach allows comprehensive insight of the properties of tww that negatively influence citrus trees physiology and yield directly and indirectly as well as tww effects on soil properties we found negative responses of vegetative growth and fruit yield of citrus trees grown in clay soil in response to irrigation with tww table 4 and fig 9 the negative effects of tww irrigation in clay soil are in agreement with our hypothesis as well as previous studies that reported reductions of fruit yield and quality of various orchard indices in response to irrigation with tww in clayey soils and decline and economic losses in commercial orchards related to tww irrigation assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 azenkot et al 2005 pedrero et al 2010 2013 the fruit yield reduction in clayey soils was mainly due to a significant decrease in fruit set and a minor decrease in the fruit number as found for saline tww irrigated lemons garcı a sánchez et al 2002 although a decline in fresh fruit weight was also found table 4 higher fruit yields for fw after three irrigation seasons followed significant early influences on sap flow stem water potential and vegetative growth figs 6 8 tww significantly reduced leaf area shoot and root growth rates on heavy clay soil figs 6 and 7 although other studies showed negative effects of irrigation with tww on canopy growth morgan et al 2008 no previous studies reported the influence of tww on root growth except our earlier report paudel et al 2016b the finding that ψstem was lower for tww is similar to previous studies gibberd et al 2003 paranychianakis et al 2004 walker et al 2001 we previously reported lower leaf gas exchange and higher photorespiration for tww in a clay soil paudel et al 2016a the effects of water quality on plant water uptake and status could be a result of impaired water transport and availabilty negative effects on soil physical properties could cause problems for sap flow in trees growing in different soils li et al 2006 several studies have shown that irrigation with tww can damage soil structure and reduce porosity and hydraulic conductivity mainly because of higher sar in the tww compared with fw assouline and narkis 2013 bardhan et al 2016 levy et al 1999 levy and assouline 2010 schacht and marschner 2015 thus reduced plant performance and yield could be related to soil degradation assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 in our study the sar was determined in a relatively high water to soil ratio 5 1 hence its values 4 9 and 3 5 meq l 1 5 for tww and fw respectively were lower than those expected from the conventional water paste method the ece can be estimated using the function suggested by slavich and petterson 1993 1 ece ec1 5 2 46 3 03 θsg for a clay soil the factor is 6 25 and the calculated ece values in the field based on table 3 were 5 0 and 7 5 ds m 1 for the fw and tww respectively indeed the esp of the tww irrigated clay soil reached a high value of 7 0 fig 3 this high esp was probably the main reason for the lower as in the field tww irrigated soil fig 4 the higher sar and esp and the lower as in the field samples for tww soil table 3 figs 3 and 4 suggest higher sensitivity of the tww soil to clay swelling poor structural stability and reduced hydraulic conductivity bardhan et al 2016 bhardwaj et al 2007 however it has also been proposed that the degradation in soil phsical and hydraulic properties following irrigation with tww can also be associated with the dissoved organic matter dom added to the soil by tww which can alter the characteristics of the soil dom and consequently negatively affect soil hc levy et al 2014b recently suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 also suggetsed that the presence of dom in tww is equivalent to an increase of two to three units in soil solution sar degradation of soil physical and hydraulic properties following irrigation with tww may lead to reduced water uptake and lower plant water potential especially in a clay soil assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 schacht and marschner 2015 nevertheless other findings support alternative mechanisms that could explain the reduction in tree performance and yield i e lower soil water potential and specific toxicity of na and cl water quality can affect soil water potential directly via salt load paranychianakis et al 2004 nicolás et al 2016 pérez pastor et al 2014 and indirectly by inefficent salt leaching out of the rizosphere caused by soil structural damage reduction of as and hydraulic conductivity bhardwaj et al 2007 russo et al 2015 in our study salt accumulation in the soil was well above the optimum threshold of ece 1 4 ds m 1 proposed for citrus maas 1993 raveh 2012 where ece is the ec measured in the saturated soil extract in fact ayers and westcot 1985 indicated that ece values higher than 1 5 ds m 1 might lead to grapefruit yield losses of up to 25 previous studies reported that in regions with 500 mm of annual rainfall the precipitation is sufficient to prevent long term salt accumulation in the root zone of orchards or field crops irrigated with secondary tww in a sandy soil but this process was less effective in a clay soil ben hur 2004 lado et al 2012 the high concentrations of na and cl in the solution of the soils irrigated with tww could exceed toxic levels induce toxic stress in the trees and in turn could result in impaired plant growth and yield pedrero et al 2013 the concentrations of na and cl observed in the tww exceeded the thresholds for detrimental effects in citrus na 115 mg l 1 bernstein et al 1956 cl 238 mg l 1 ayers and westcot 1985 whereas b was much lower than the threshold value b 0 4 mg l 1 grieve et al 2012 high concentrations of salts may induce nutrient deficiency through ion uptake competition however in the present research the concentrations of all nutrients in the leaves were within the optimum ranges recommended by the israeli field service and legaz et al 1995 on the other hand na concentrations in the roots and leaves and cl concentrations in the roots were significantly higher in the tww irrigated trees in general leaf cl concentrations were much lower than the critical level for citrus 7 mg g 1 whereas the highest leaf na concentrations under the tww treatment were above the critical level for citrus 2 3 mg g 1 raveh 2012 storey and walker 1998 na concentrations in plant organs root and leaf were significantly correlated with those in the soil solution result not shown in citrus trees it is known that salinity alters leaf mineral composition but until now experiments with tww irrigation in citrus have not reported leaf na toxicity pedrero et al 2013 the high concentration of na in the roots might be related to the morphological alteration of the roots and their reduced hydraulic conductivity reported previously paudel et al 2016a boron concentrations in the tww in this study were not higher than in the fw due to israeli legislation from 1999 banning b in detergents tarchitzky et al 2004 reported that the mdian b concentration in treated tww as reported by the ministry of agriculture and rural development decreased from 0 41 to 0 17 mg l 1 between the years 2000 and 2004 therefore in this study b in the trees was residual from long term irrigation with tww containing high b concentrations of 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 azenkot et al 2005 lado et al 2012 prior to the legislation the high concentration of b in our clayey soil is due to the high b adsorption capacity and strong affinity to the clayey soil lado et al 2012 yermiyahu et al 2010 and very slow process of b leaching yermiyahu et al 2010 consequently although in the current experiments the tww had very low concentrations of b those in the leaves were above the threshold of 100 mg kg 1 legaz et al 1995 independent of the irrigation treatment pcca analysis was conducted to quantify the effects and interactions of the treatments on soil and tree variables four pc s with eigenvalues 1 were identified which cumulatively explained 85 of the total variance in the data set with the first pc pc1 explaining a high proportion 55 2 because factor loadings of pc3 and pc4 were all below 0 8 only those for pc1 and pc2 are presented table 5 examination of the high loadings 0 8 under pc1 revealed a clear inverse association between as and sar as well as between as sar and a few tree parameters shoot and root growth and na and cl concentrations in leaves and roots as was directly associated with shoot and root length and inversely with na and cl in leaves and roots table 5 the opposite applies to sar for pc2 only ec had a loading 0 8 table 5 suggesting that pc2 is associated primarily soil solution salinity the pcca analysis table 5 highlighted the close association between soil and tree parameters root and shoot growth were directly related to as which indicates that as could serve as an index for favorable soil conditions accumulation of na and cl in the roots and the leaves was directly associated with soil solution sodicity which indicates a relative abandance of na relative to ca and mg the inverse relation between sar and as has been demonstrated in previous studies e g bhardwaj et al 2007 the direct association between soil sar and leaf and root na probably results from increased na uptake with increasing na in the solution and the effect of major competing ions ca and mg romero aranda et al 1998 concentration of cl in the tree parts leaves and roots was associated with soil solution sar and as but not with cl concentration in the soil solution these findings indicate that soil physical factors controlled cl uptake probably through combined uptake of na with cl or through the effect of physical factors on the leaching of cl no attributes studied were closely associated with fruit yield even though it was increased by fw apparently more time would be needed for those associations to emerge in order to quantify the relationships between tree variables and soil factors we conducted stepwise regressions for root growth shoot growth sap flow and fruit yield results showed that sar explained 79 8 of the variance p 0 01 in root growth and as increased r2 to 83 6 p 18 the obtained equation is 2 rootg 0 185 sar 0 01 as 1 23 for shoot growth as explained 50 8 p 0 01 the obtained equation is 3 shootg 0 313 as 20 34 for sap flow the stepwise model included 3 soil variables according to the order soil cl sar and esp explaining 26 9 45 9 and 57 1 respectively the p values were 0 044 0 069 and 0 185 respectively the obtained equation is 4 sapflow 0 019 cl 2 209 sar 0 62 esp 48 6 stepwise regression for fruit yield as a function of soil variables gave low r2 below 30 and low significance for the soil variables however when the concentrations of na and cl in the leaves and roots were added a model with two variables was obtained 5 yield 1 223 as 29 687 leafcl 221 8 the first parameter leaf cl explained 27 9 of the variability and with the second parameter as the model explained 48 4 of the variability with p values of 0 019 and 0 092 respectively this equation indicates that at least part of the positive effect of replacing irrigation with tww to fw on grapefruit yield is due to reduction of cl concentration in the leaves in support of the second mechanism described above we are not familiar with previous studies of remediation of tww damage by transition to fw it might be expected that high esp of the clay would prevent recovery of soil aggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity russo et al s 2015 simulations predicted that replacement of tww with fw would reverse the negative effects of tww irrigation on tree transpiration the current study together with our previous publications paudel et al 2016a 2016b confirm the hypothesis and simulation predictions that replacing long term 15 years tww irrigation with fw leads to recovery of most of soil and plant parameters 5 conclusions treated wastewater is a valuable source for irrigation in semi arid and arid regions providing water and some nutrients n p k to crops however long term tww irrigation in clay soil may have negative effects on trees performance and yield the current study showed that the main negative effects of continuous irrigation of a clay soil with tww in comparison to fw on the tree performance were associated with increased soil sodicity sar and esp and deterioration of soil structural stability as reflected by lower as values these findings support the hypothesis that the negative effect of irrigation with tww is through damage to soil structure leading to reduced water uptake an additional negative impact of irrigation with tww is the accumulation of na and cl in roots and leaves of grapefruits to toxic levels however several physiological parameters i e ψstem sap flow leaf area root and shoot length growth and fruit yield showed that replacing tww with fw after many years of irrigation with tww can reverse the negative effects on the trees our findings indicate that the positive effects of alternating poor quality water tww with water of high quality fw occur in a relatively short time span i e several months to two years thus promoting the viability of this management practice acknowledgement the authors wish to thank victor lukyanov amit k jaiswal dina goldstein and raneen shawhana for technical assistance and

11447,soil degradation and declining tree performance following long term irrigation with treated wastewater tww have been reported recently in orchards grown on clay soils in an attempt to reverse this situation our research objectives were to quantify the effects of replacing tww irrigation with fresh water fw on water uptake water and mineral status growth and yield of citrus trees in relation to soil physical and chemical properties a field experiment was carried out in a commercial grapefruit orchard in a clay soil with a history of tww irrigation changing irrigation water quality from tww to fw significantly decreased soil solution electrical conductivity ec na and cl concentration sodium adsorption ratio sar exchangeable sodium percentage esp and improved aggregate stability as of the soil the concentrations of na and cl in leaves and roots were lower in fw irrigated trees than in tww irrigated ones fruit yield shoot and root growth leaf area water status and water uptake were all significantly and favorably affected by replacing tww with fw although fruit yield increased by replacing tww with fw irrigation it was not significantly associated with any single or group of the studied soil attributes however in a stepwise regression analysis a correlation was established between fruit yield and leaf cl and soil as our findings indicate that the negative effects of irrigation with tww are i through damage to soil structure leading to reduced water uptake and ii via accumulation of na and cl in roots and leaves of grapefruits to toxic levels the positive effects of alternating poor quality water tww with water of high quality fw occur in a relatively short time span i e several months to two years thus promoting the viability of this

attractive option for expanding agriculture when fresh water is scarce and or limited eg in arid and semi arid regions dobrowolski et al 2008 irrigation with tww also contributes nutrients that partially replace fertilization fares and alva 1999 hadas and kislev 2010 many publications reported that irrigation with tww had no detrimental effects on tree growth and productivity bielorai et al 1978 reboll et al 2000 parsons et al 2001 morgan et al 2008 however recent studies reported damage to plantations and gradual yield decreases up to about 75 noshadi et al 2013b and recommended investigation prior to the further application of tww in orchards noshadi et al 2013b assouline et al 2015 yang et al 2010 pedrero et al 2013 the main causes proposed for the negative effects of tww on soil and crops are i osmotic effects on the water potential of the soil and plants carden et al 2003 ii toxic effects when ions eg na sodium cl chloride and boron b reach threshold levels aucejo et al 1995 noshadi et al 2013a and iii deterioration of the soil physical and hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity and aggregate stability due to high sodium adsorption ratio sar and

in clay soils lado et al 2012 this increases the osmotic potential of the tww the soil water potential and the osmotic gradient between the soil solution and the plant reducing water uptake by plants and root activity assouline et al 2015 the main toxic effects stem from high concentrations of the most common ions na and cl and from some trace ions like b ben hur 2004 for many years b was a major threat to citrus orchards irrigated with tww in israel but in the past decade new regulations have led to a large reduction in the median b concentration in tww from 0 4 to 0 17 mg l 1 tarchitzky et al 2004 the effects of salinity and high sar on the physical properties of the soil are amplified in fine textured soils due to the adsorption of na to clay minerals leading to clay swelling particle dispersion altered soil structure water retention and clogging of water conducting pores levy and assouline 2010 assouline et al 2015 recently it was suggested that during irrigation with tww the effect of the presence of dissolved organic matter in the tww was equivalent to an increase in sar of two to three units suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 several studies further suggested that long term irrigation with tww affected structural porosity by modification of the composition of the dissolved organic matter bardhan et al 2016 and or by clogging of soil pores by dispersed organic particles levy et al 1999 these processes may reduce the hydraulic conductivity assouline and narkis 2013 lado et al 2012 assouline et al 2015 schacht and marschner 2015 suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 aeration

using tww for citrus orchard irrigation few studies focused on the effects of winter rainfall on soil recovery assouline and narkis 2013 bhardwaj et al 2007 we are not aware of previous studies of soil tree response to irrigation with fw following long term irrigation with tww except for an observation that reported positive influences of replacing tww with fw in citrus orchards azenkot et al 2005 we hypothesized that damage to the soil tree system following long term tww irrigation is reversible and the questions are to what extent and how fast the soil tree system will recover following replacement of tww with fw we propose to test our hypothesis in the same orchard where a preliminary study compared soil properties in irrigated rows with those in the unirrigated area between rows bardhan et al 2016 they reported a significant reduction in the saturated and unsaturated at low metric water potential hydraulic conductivity of the tww irrigated soil the research objectives were to quantify the effects of replacing tww irrigation with fw on water uptake plant water and mineral status growth and yield of citrus trees in relation to soil physical and chemical properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site plant material and design a field study was conducted in a commercial fruit bearing orchard of ruby red grapefruit citrus paradisi macf on c volcameriana rootstock planted at 5 4 m spacing at kibbutz mizra in the izra el valley israel 32 40 n 35 37 e 83 m asl climate is typical mediterranean with a long dry season requiring irrigation and a rainy period with mean precipitation of 570 mm in the winter november march fig 1 soil was clay chromic haploxerert soil properties determined at the beginning of the experiment in 2012 before starting the fw irrigation treatment are listed in table 1 the clay size particle fraction was high 690 g kg 1 whereas the sand fraction was much lower 160 g kg 1 the carbonate content was considerable about 10 leading to ph above 7 0 and probably a high buffer capacity for ph the cec was high in agreement with the clay content esp was high probably due to the long term irrigation with tww containing relatively high sar the orchard had a history of irrigation with treated wastewater from 1986 until 1991 followed by 10 years of experiments with two water sources fw and tww lado et al 2012 which led to significant yield decline and severe damage of trees including mortality of a few trees from 2001 to 2004 different management treatments or remediation of the orchard were examined azenkot et al 2005 the trees were uprooted and rain fed annual crops were grown during the next 4 years and then the current orchard was planted in 2007 and irrigated with tww each tree row was irrigated with a set of two drip line laterals located along both sides of the trees 0 5 m apart each lateral consisted of a set of drippers with emitter discharge of 1 6 l h 1 amnon drip naan dan jain israel 0 5 m apart the experimental orchard was divided into six blocks each with one plot for each treatment in a random arrangement each plot was 3 rows of 5 trees the central 3 trees in the median row were monitored

statistical design and analysis the experimental design was randomized blocks analyses of variance anova were carried out with jmp 12 0 software sas institute and anova was used to obtain an f value for significance in two or three way linear models with water quality block and year and their interactions mean separations were performed on the basis of the tukey kramer honestly significant difference hsd test at p 05 a standardized principal component and classification analysis pcca statistica statsoft inc 2004 dell usa was used to identify possible relationships between our tested soil indices and the tree parameters the pcca searches for linear combinations of variables and identifies a group of principal components pcs that account for maximum variance shared by the variables of the data set under study jolliffe 2002 a decision whether a pc is worth considering for further analysis depends on the level of the eigenvalue associated with it we examined only pcs with an eigenvalue 1 0 as proposed by brejda et al 2000 further classification of the tested variables is carried out by using factor loadings the factor loadings are equivalent to the correlations between the variables and the components since the current analysis is based on the correlation matrix within a given pc presence of variables having a factor loading close to ǀ1ǀ suggests that these variables share a large proportion of the variance represented by the pc and hence the existence of some relationships among them only variables associated with a factor loading having an absolute value 0 8 were considered for further analysis of their relations the stepwise regression procedure of jmp 12 0 was used to obtain the best linear equation for the quantitative effects of the measured

water quality the most significant water quality parameters for tww and fw are shown in table 1 differences between the two irrigation water sources were significant during the whole experiment high values of organic matter cod and bod and total suspended solids tss were found in the secondary tww salinity was higher in the tww ec 2 3 than in fw ec 1 1 ds m 1 the main ions that contributed to the higher ec in tww were cl and na whereas the differences in ca and mg were smaller and inconsistent table 1 the higher na concentration in tww relative to fw without a parallel increase in ca and mg elevated the sar level from a mean value of 3 4 in the fw to about 6 8 in tww in addition tww had high concentrations of the major nutrients n mainly as nh4 and some as organic nitrogen p and k and similar to the fw after injection of liquid fertilizers the overall quantity of n p and k supplied with the tww met the citrus fertilization requirements boron concentrations were similar in both types of water and it s concentration was well below 0 4 mg l 1 the threshold value for b toxicity for citrus grieve et al 2012 mass 1990 heavy metal concentrations were below thresholds in both sources of water not shown 3 2 soil chemical and physical properties the effects of the irrigation water type on ec ph cl cations na ca and mg and the sar in the solution of the soil profile are presented in fig 2 and table 3 the ph cl and na were higher in the top layers of the tww than in the fw treatment and the differences between tww and fw increased from the end of the first year 2013 to the end of the second year 2014 and decreased with depth ec ca and mg of the soil solution did not differ significantly between treatments a trend of lower values of ca and mg concentrations in the tww at 30 cm was found at the end of the second year of irrigation consequently the sar in tww was significantly higher in fw from the upper soil down to 120 cm the sar in tww and fw was in the range of 4 5 5 0 and 2 8 4 5 respectively ec and concentrations of cl ca and mg decreased from the upper layer downward to 120 150 cm depth whereas the trend in na concentration was in the opposite direction accumulation of salts in the upper soil is result of selective uptake of ions by the trees and the opposite distribution of na is due to the higher preference of the cation exchange complex to ca mg and k over na in the second year of the experiment the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and inorganic carbon ic in the top layers for tww were significantly higher than those for fw b concentrations in the soil profile were relatively high despite the fact that b concentration in both water types was very low 0 1 mg l 1 the high b concentration in the soil is probably residual from a prior period when tww contained more b i e 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 b in the first year was similar in the two treatments and a reduction was found in the second year the gap between the first and second year was larger in the fw than the tww probably due to displacement of sorbed b by higher concentrations of bicarbonates and orthophosphate in the tww however in both water treatments the available b values were very close to each other and well above critical toxicity levels of 0 4 mg l 1 for citrus grieve et al 2012 mass 1990 two other soil properties esp and as known to be affected by esp were measured only at the end of the irrigation season of the second year 2014 the mean esp of the top 0 60 cm depth was much higher for tww than fw fig 3 table 3 while the as at this soil depth was higher for fw fig 4 table 3 the largest difference in the esp between tww and fw was at 30 60 cm a similar observation was noted by levy et al 2014a as at 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm decreased with shaking time as expected in all the measured depths and through the process of shaking higher as values were obtained from the soil irrigated with fw than with tww fig 4 table 3 3 3 elemental contents in leaves and roots during the experimental period concentrations of macro and micro nutrients n p k ca mg fe and mn in the leaves were measured in all treatments and found to be sufficient with no significant effect of water quality table a1 appendix in supplementary material whereas fw significantly reduced na and cl in leaves and roots relative to tww irrigation fig 5 and table a1 appendix in supplementary material leaf and root b concentrations were not affected by water quality in agreement with the low b concentrations in both tww and fw in general leaf b was relatively high but below the critical value of 200 mg kg 1 for b toxicity in citrus storey and walker 1998 3 4 stem water potential and water uptake sap flow and mid day stem water potential ψstem were monitored from the beginning of the experiments fig 6 both were generally higher for fw than tww significant differences in sap flow were observed after four months of irrigation with small differences between treatments in winter rainfall season without irrigation and larger differences in summer dry season with irrigation fig 6a similar effects of irrigation with fw versus tww on mid day stem water potential ψstem were observed fig 6b and the effects of season on ψstem were similar to those for sap flow 3 5 plant vegetative growth every year shoot and root length increased with time from the beginning to the end of the irrigation season and this increase was significantly higher for fw than tww fig 7 in general leaf area and trunk diameter for fw were higher than for tww fig 8 a although differences in trunk diameter growth were not significant fig 8b a significant increase in leaf area of 22 for fw was found in the second growing season fig 8a 3 6 yield and fruit quality several yield parameters fruit set fruit diameter crop load fruit weight and yield measured during harvest in the fall after three irrigation periods are presented in table 4 overall fruit yield was higher for fw than tww table 4 and fig 9 treatment effects on fruit yield were not significant in the first two years although fruit diameter and fruit weight were significantly affected table 4 and a significant effect on fruit yield was obtained from the third year onwards fig 9 fruit quality parameters like total soluble solids titrateable acid content and maturity index mi were not affected by water quality but peel thickness pt was in all three growing seasons table a2 appendix in supplementary material 4 discussion the results show that irrigation with tww influenced the whole citrus orchard system from the soil through the root system trunk leaf growth and up to fruit yield use of the whole system approach allows comprehensive insight of the properties of tww that negatively influence citrus trees physiology and yield directly and indirectly as well as tww effects on soil properties we found negative responses of vegetative growth and fruit yield of citrus trees grown in clay soil in response to irrigation with tww table 4 and fig 9 the negative effects of tww irrigation in clay soil are in agreement with our hypothesis as well as previous studies that reported reductions of fruit yield and quality of various orchard indices in response to irrigation with tww in clayey soils and decline and economic losses in commercial orchards related to tww irrigation assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 azenkot et al 2005 pedrero et al 2010 2013 the fruit yield reduction in clayey soils was mainly due to a significant decrease in fruit set and a minor decrease in the fruit number as found for saline tww irrigated lemons garcı a sánchez et al 2002 although a decline in fresh fruit weight was also found table 4 higher fruit yields for fw after three irrigation seasons followed significant early influences on sap flow stem water potential and vegetative growth figs 6 8 tww significantly reduced leaf area shoot and root growth rates on heavy clay soil figs 6 and 7 although other studies showed negative effects of irrigation with tww on canopy growth morgan et al 2008 no previous studies reported the influence of tww on root growth except our earlier report paudel et al 2016b the finding that ψstem was lower for tww is similar to previous studies gibberd et al 2003 paranychianakis et al 2004 walker et al 2001 we previously reported lower leaf gas exchange and higher photorespiration for tww in a clay soil paudel et al 2016a the effects of water quality on plant water uptake and status could be a result of impaired water transport and availabilty negative effects on soil physical properties could cause problems for sap flow in trees growing in different soils li et al 2006 several studies have shown that irrigation with tww can damage soil structure and reduce porosity and hydraulic conductivity mainly because of higher sar in the tww compared with fw assouline and narkis 2013 bardhan et al 2016 levy et al 1999 levy and assouline 2010 schacht and marschner 2015 thus reduced plant performance and yield could be related to soil degradation assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 in our study the sar was determined in a relatively high water to soil ratio 5 1 hence its values 4 9 and 3 5 meq l 1 5 for tww and fw respectively were lower than those expected from the conventional water paste method the ece can be estimated using the function suggested by slavich and petterson 1993 1 ece ec1 5 2 46 3 03 θsg for a clay soil the factor is 6 25 and the calculated ece values in the field based on table 3 were 5 0 and 7 5 ds m 1 for the fw and tww respectively indeed the esp of the tww irrigated clay soil reached a high value of 7 0 fig 3 this high esp was probably the main reason for the lower as in the field tww irrigated soil fig 4 the higher sar and esp and the lower as in the field samples for tww soil table 3 figs 3 and 4 suggest higher sensitivity of the tww soil to clay swelling poor structural stability and reduced hydraulic conductivity bardhan et al 2016 bhardwaj et al 2007 however it has also been proposed that the degradation in soil phsical and hydraulic properties following irrigation with tww can also be associated with the dissoved organic matter dom added to the soil by tww which can alter the characteristics of the soil dom and consequently negatively affect soil hc levy et al 2014b recently suarez and gonzalez rubio 2017 also suggetsed that the presence of dom in tww is equivalent to an increase of two to three units in soil solution sar degradation of soil physical and hydraulic properties following irrigation with tww may lead to reduced water uptake and lower plant water potential especially in a clay soil assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2015 schacht and marschner 2015 nevertheless other findings support alternative mechanisms that could explain the reduction in tree performance and yield i e lower soil water potential and specific toxicity of na and cl water quality can affect soil water potential directly via salt load paranychianakis et al 2004 nicolás et al 2016 pérez pastor et al 2014 and indirectly by inefficent salt leaching out of the rizosphere caused by soil structural damage reduction of as and hydraulic conductivity bhardwaj et al 2007 russo et al 2015 in our study salt accumulation in the soil was well above the optimum threshold of ece 1 4 ds m 1 proposed for citrus maas 1993 raveh 2012 where ece is the ec measured in the saturated soil extract in fact ayers and westcot 1985 indicated that ece values higher than 1 5 ds m 1 might lead to grapefruit yield losses of up to 25 previous studies reported that in regions with 500 mm of annual rainfall the precipitation is sufficient to prevent long term salt accumulation in the root zone of orchards or field crops irrigated with secondary tww in a sandy soil but this process was less effective in a clay soil ben hur 2004 lado et al 2012 the high concentrations of na and cl in the solution of the soils irrigated with tww could exceed toxic levels induce toxic stress in the trees and in turn could result in impaired plant growth and yield pedrero et al 2013 the concentrations of na and cl observed in the tww exceeded the thresholds for detrimental effects in citrus na 115 mg l 1 bernstein et al 1956 cl 238 mg l 1 ayers and westcot 1985 whereas b was much lower than the threshold value b 0 4 mg l 1 grieve et al 2012 high concentrations of salts may induce nutrient deficiency through ion uptake competition however in the present research the concentrations of all nutrients in the leaves were within the optimum ranges recommended by the israeli field service and legaz et al 1995 on the other hand na concentrations in the roots and leaves and cl concentrations in the roots were significantly higher in the tww irrigated trees in general leaf cl concentrations were much lower than the critical level for citrus 7 mg g 1 whereas the highest leaf na concentrations under the tww treatment were above the critical level for citrus 2 3 mg g 1 raveh 2012 storey and walker 1998 na concentrations in plant organs root and leaf were significantly correlated with those in the soil solution result not shown in citrus trees it is known that salinity alters leaf mineral composition but until now experiments with tww irrigation in citrus have not reported leaf na toxicity pedrero et al 2013 the high concentration of na in the roots might be related to the morphological alteration of the roots and their reduced hydraulic conductivity reported previously paudel et al 2016a boron concentrations in the tww in this study were not higher than in the fw due to israeli legislation from 1999 banning b in detergents tarchitzky et al 2004 reported that the mdian b concentration in treated tww as reported by the ministry of agriculture and rural development decreased from 0 41 to 0 17 mg l 1 between the years 2000 and 2004 therefore in this study b in the trees was residual from long term irrigation with tww containing high b concentrations of 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 azenkot et al 2005 lado et al 2012 prior to the legislation the high concentration of b in our clayey soil is due to the high b adsorption capacity and strong affinity to the clayey soil lado et al 2012 yermiyahu et al 2010 and very slow process of b leaching yermiyahu et al 2010 consequently although in the current experiments the tww had very low concentrations of b those in the leaves were above the threshold of 100 mg kg 1 legaz et al 1995 independent of the irrigation treatment pcca analysis was conducted to quantify the effects and interactions of the treatments on soil and tree variables four pc s with eigenvalues 1 were identified which cumulatively explained 85 of the total variance in the data set with the first pc pc1 explaining a high proportion 55 2 because factor loadings of pc3 and pc4 were all below 0 8 only those for pc1 and pc2 are presented table 5 examination of the high loadings 0 8 under pc1 revealed a clear inverse association between as and sar as well as between as sar and a few tree parameters shoot and root growth and na and cl concentrations in leaves and roots as was directly associated with shoot and root length and inversely with na and cl in leaves and roots table 5 the opposite applies to sar for pc2 only ec had a loading 0 8 table 5 suggesting that pc2 is associated primarily soil solution salinity the pcca analysis table 5 highlighted the close association between soil and tree parameters root and shoot growth were directly related to as which indicates that as could serve as an index for favorable soil conditions accumulation of na and cl in the roots and the leaves was directly associated with soil solution sodicity which indicates a relative abandance of na relative to ca and mg the inverse relation between sar and as has been demonstrated in previous studies e g bhardwaj et al 2007 the direct association between soil sar and leaf and root na probably results from increased na uptake with increasing na in the solution and the effect of major competing ions ca and mg romero aranda et al 1998 concentration of cl in the tree parts leaves and roots was associated with soil solution sar and as but not with cl concentration in the soil solution these findings indicate that soil physical factors controlled cl uptake probably through combined uptake of na with cl or through the effect of physical factors on the leaching of cl no attributes studied were closely associated with fruit yield even though it was increased by fw apparently more time would be needed for those associations to emerge in order to quantify the relationships between tree variables and soil factors we conducted stepwise regressions for root growth shoot growth sap flow and fruit yield results showed that sar explained 79 8 of the variance p 0 01 in root growth and as increased r2 to 83 6 p 18 the obtained equation is 2 rootg 0 185 sar 0 01 as 1 23 for shoot growth as explained 50 8 p 0 01 the obtained equation is 3 shootg 0 313 as 20 34 for sap flow the stepwise model included 3 soil variables according to the order soil cl sar and esp explaining 26 9 45 9 and 57 1 respectively the p values were 0 044 0 069 and 0 185 respectively the obtained equation is 4 sapflow 0 019 cl 2 209 sar 0 62 esp 48 6 stepwise regression for fruit yield as a function of soil variables gave low r2 below 30 and low significance for the soil variables however when the concentrations of na and cl in the leaves and roots were added a model with two variables was obtained 5 yield 1 223 as 29 687 leafcl 221 8 the first parameter leaf cl explained 27 9 of the variability and with the second parameter as the model explained 48 4 of the variability with p values of 0 019 and 0 092 respectively this equation indicates that at least part of the positive effect of replacing irrigation with tww to fw on grapefruit yield is due to reduction of cl concentration in the leaves in support of the second mechanism described above we are not familiar with previous studies of remediation of tww damage by transition to fw it might be expected that high esp of the clay would prevent recovery of soil aggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity russo et al s 2015 simulations predicted that replacement of tww with fw would reverse the negative effects of tww irrigation on tree transpiration the current study together with our previous publications paudel et al 2016a 2016b confirm the hypothesis and simulation predictions that replacing long term 15 years tww irrigation with fw leads to recovery of most of soil and plant parameters 5 conclusions treated wastewater is a valuable source for irrigation in semi arid and arid regions providing water and some nutrients n p k to crops however long term tww irrigation in clay soil may have negative effects on trees performance and yield the current study showed that the main negative effects of continuous irrigation of a clay soil with tww in comparison to fw on the tree performance were associated with increased soil sodicity sar and esp and deterioration of soil structural stability as reflected by lower as values these findings support the hypothesis that the negative effect of irrigation with tww is through damage to soil structure leading to reduced water uptake an additional negative impact of irrigation with tww is the accumulation of na and cl in roots and leaves of grapefruits to toxic levels however several physiological parameters i e ψstem sap flow leaf area root and shoot length growth and fruit yield showed that replacing tww with fw after many years of irrigation with tww can reverse the negative effects on the trees our findings indicate that the positive effects of alternating poor quality water tww with water of high quality fw occur in a relatively short time span i e several months to two years thus promoting the viability of this management practice acknowledgement the authors wish to thank victor lukyanov amit k jaiswal dina goldstein and raneen shawhana for technical assistance and

11448,we sought to study the effects of the ridge furrow rf rainwater collecting technique on winter wheat seed filling with limited irrigation under simulated rainfall concentrations and its correlation with hormonal changes the rf system was compared to traditional flat planting tf with two limited irrigation levels 150 75 mm under three simulated precipitation concentrations 1 275 2 200 3 125 mm during 2015 2017 experimental years the results indicated that the rf150 treatment with 125 mm rainfall a significantly improved seed filling rate was observed in the basal and upper seeds the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation also significantly improved the single seed weight and seed filling rate in the basal and upper seeds in contrast the rf system with 275 mm precipitation showed no significant influence on the seed filling rates and seed weight of basal and upper seeds under either limited irrigation level the rf system at 125 and 200 mm simulated rainfall level exhibited increased iaa indole 3 acetic acid and z zeatin zr zeatin riboside contents the rf system under 150 mm limited irrigation showed decreased aba abscisic acid and gibberellic acid gas in the basal and upper seeds the rf system with 275 mm precipitation had no significant influence on the iaa z zr aba and ga contents in the basal and upper seeds under either limited irrigation levels the iaa z zr aba and gas in the seeds s were positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rate and the maximum seed weight our results demonstrate that the rf2150 treatment significantly improved the soil water contents and soil respiration rate thereby regulating the wheat seed filling rate and creating hormonal changes these fluctuations significantly affected the agronomic properties of winter wheat production in semi arid regions keywords limited irrigation rainfall seed filling process hormone wheat yield planting patterns 1 introduction winter wheat yield in rain fed areas of china is highly dependent on precipitation although it is erratic and insufficient in these regions nagaz et al 2012 the majority of rainfall occurs during the monsoon season with 68 of the yearly precipitation falling from june to september in semi arid regions of china wang et al 2015 the monsoon spells do not overlap with the wheat growing season and water scarcity is often a limitation to growth li and gong 2002 furthermore the annual evaporation in rain fed areas of china is more than 830 mm resulting in severe drought conditions throughout the winter wheat growing period zhang et al 2011 in order to deal with inadequate water resources and to increase wheat production in these areas it has been important to develop water saving agricultural techniques to maximize utilization of the erratically available rainwater and increase soil moisture content ren et al 2016 previous studies have suggested that ridge covering materials including plastic mulch and biodegradable mulch are able to conserve rainwater decrease evaporation and improve soil moisture content and soil respiration rate in turn enhancing winter wheat water usage efficiency wue martinez et al 2011 overall it is difficult to improve plant growth in semi arid areas of china due to water shortages li et al 2016 currently the ridge furrow precipitation harvesting rf technique has been implemented in rain fed areas of china to solve water shortage issues jia et al 2006 the rf technique includes ridges and furrows where the ridges are covered with a plastic film for use as a precipitation collecting zone and the furrow is used as the sowing zone hu et al 2014 the rf technique significantly improves soil water storage by saving water during light intensity precipitation and preserving surface runoff during high intensity rainfall li et al 2001 the rf technique decreases soil temperature as well as prolongs the duration of water availability for the winter wheat growing season li et al 2016 deng et al 2006 reported that the rf system improves water content by 11 15 in the 200 cm soil layer depth and increases grain yield 75 under precipitation of 230 340 mm compared to traditional flat tf cultivation however the biological yield water use efficiency and seed yield of corn were not significantly enhanced when rainfall was more than 440 mm water shortage during the winter wheat crop s flowering and seed filling stage can cause significant grain yield decreases these decreases are mainly due to oxidative damage as a result reducing seed set and sink capacity of the plant it has been shown that the rf planting model can offset this damage by preventing water shortage xie et al 2008 kang et al 2002 however during the flowering and seed filling stages water deficiency is often unavoidable guo et al 2014 limited irrigation li coupled with the rf system may offer a solution for supplying water during critical growth stages significantly increasing grain yield and soil respiration rate ali and thei 2004 tang et al 2011 it is important to note that an unnecessary supply of irrigation water can lead to high rates of evapotranspiration and biomass accumulation and does not significantly increase grain yield geerts et al 2008 it has been shown that the soil respiration rate improves with increasing irrigation but over irrigation will suppress the soil respiration rate wang et al 2009 the rf technique with varied precipitation conditions and limited irrigation that affects the biochemical mechanism and winter wheat production has not been clarified the potential yield of winter wheat can be divided into three main units spike plant 1 seed weight and seeds spike 1 in current semi arid regions the maximum yield and seed filling development in winter wheat have been affected by fluctuating rainfall and the yield potential outputs have become unpredictable ali et al 2016 it is important to understand how the rf system influences wheat seed filling and the primary biochemical mechanisms during this developmental stage when various rainfall amounts and limited irrigation are applied winter wheat seed filling is controlled by several factors including plant hormones that have been shown to have a significant role in modifying seed filling progress yang et al 2006 higher abscisic acid aba content in winter wheat seeds is linked with maximum seed filling rate yang et al 2006 the zeatin zeatin riboside z zr phytohormones of the cytokinin family contents in developing winter wheat seeds temporarily enhance fertilization during kernel setting and endosperm cell division morris et al 1993 the gas content in rice seeds is also associated with the early seed filling stage gao et al 2000 and the maximum and mean seed filling rate were positively associated with gas concentrations in rice seeds yang et al 2001 additionally the iaa content in basal seeds has been found to be higher than that of upper seeds during the early seed filling stage of rice wu et al 2008 these studies have shown that plant hormonal changes significantly affect the seed filling process of rice crops however the hormonal variation between spike seed positions and the correlation between seed filling and hormonal changes induced by the rf system remains unclear in the present study various simulated rainfall and limited irrigation levels under different planting patterns were used during the winter wheat growth stage and the hormonal changes in the grains during grain filling were measured the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the effect of rf technique under simulated precipitation and limited irrigation on grain filling of winter wheat and the soil water content and to determine how the changes in endogenous hormones in the developing grains of winter wheat under rf technique are related to the grain filling process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site

the amount of rainwater measured under field conditions was reasonably similar to natural rainfall amounts 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 soil water content and temperature the soil water content swc and temperature were monitored at the flowering stage seed filling stage and maturity stage over 2016 17 moisture content of the 0 200 cm soil layers depth at 20 cm intervals was recorded using a

difference test lsd at p 0 05 the variation in seed filling and hormone levels between the two study years was not significant so comparisons pooling the data from 2016 to 17 were used to determine differences among the hormone levels and seed filling 3 results 3 1 yield and yield component the grain yield of winter wheat significantly varied under simulated precipitation with limited irrigation and different planting patterns during the 2015 17 years table 2 the grain yield significantly increased with precipitation and limited irrigations levels but there was no significant variation when the rainfall was exceeding 200 mm under both planting models the rf technique under limited irrigation with precipitation concentrations produced greater grain yield than that of the tf treatment additionally the rf system produced 15 higher 0 79 t ha 1 grain yield than that of tf system similarly the rf technique with limited irrigation and the simulated rainfall conditions also significantly influenced the winter wheat yield components the rf technique with increasing rainfall and limited irrigation levels showed significantly increased seed spike 1 yield spike 1 g spikelet s spike 1 and 1000 seed weight g compared to the tf treatment table 2 at the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments seed spike 1 yield spike 1 g spikelet s spike 1 and 1000 seed weight g were significantly higher than that of tf1150 and tf2150 treatments however there was no significant variation observed between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments for the seed spike 1 yield spike 1 g spikelet s spike 1 and 1000 seed weight g 3 2 seed filling the rf system significantly differed in the maximum and mean seed filling rates and the maximum seed weights of the basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf planting when the simulated precipitation levels increased from 125 to 200 mm under limited irrigation and different planting models a significant increase in the maximum and mean seed filling rates as well as the maximum seed weights for the basal and upper seeds occurred however when the precipitation improved from 200 to 275 mm there was no significant variation recorded in single seed weights or in seed filling rates under the different planting models figs 1 and 2 table 3 the rf150 treatment with 125 mm simulated rainfall a significantly improvement in the basal and upper seed filling rates was measured in addition the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation also significantly improved the single seed weights and seed filling rates of the basal and upper seeds in contrast at the 275 mm precipitation the effect of rf system had no significant on the single seed weights and seed filling rates of the basal and upper seeds under limited irrigation levels the seed filling rate was significantly enhanced at the early flowering stage and subsequently reduced the seed filling rate was significantly higher in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds fig 2 the rf150 treatment with 200 mm or 275 mm rainfall levels the seed filling rate was significantly higher in the basal and upper seeds than that of the tf150 treatment at 3 18 days after flowering the rf150 treatment with 200 mm or 275 mm rainfall levels the seed filling rate was maximized at 15 days after flowering for the basal seeds the tf150 treatment with 200 mm or 275 mm rainfall levels the seed filling rate reached was maximized at 18 days after flowering for the upper seeds 3 3 hormonal changes 3 3 1 iaa and z zr contents the iaa and z zr contents in the seeds at the early seed filling stage rapidly increased to their maximum levels at 12 days after flowering for the basal seeds and 15 days after flowering for the upper seeds the iaa and z zr contents then decreased for the remainder of the sampling times the iaa and z zr contents were significantly greater in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds from 3 to 15 days after flowering figs 3 and 4 the rf system with different limited irrigation levels had significant effects on the iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds under precipitation conditions compared to the tf treatment the rf150 treatment at the 125 mm rainfall showed significantly improved iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds than that of tf150 treatment respectively the iaa and z zr contents under the rf system were significantly higher in the basal and upper seeds than those of the tf planting system at 3 15 days after flowering the iaa and z zr contents in the basal seeds under the rf150 treatment with a 200 mm rainfall level achieved were maximized at 12 days after flowering the iaa and z zr contents in the upper seeds under the tf150 treatment with a 200 mm rainfall level achieved was maximized at 15 days after flowering at the 200 mm simulated rainfall condition the rf150 treatment significantly improved the iaa and z zr contents in both the basal and upper seeds while the tf planting pattern did not in contrast at the 275 mm precipitation either the rf system or the tf system had a significant influence on the iaa and z zr contents of basal and upper seeds under any limited irrigation level the basal and upper seed iaa and z zr contents under the rf150 treatment with a 200 mm rainfall level were significantly higher than that of the 125 or 275 mm simulated rainfall levels at 3 15 days after flowering 3 3 2 aba content the aba content at the early seed filling stage in the basal and upper seeds was maximized at 15 days after flowering for the basal seeds and 18 days after flowering for the upper seeds these levels decreased steadily after their respective peaks fig 5 in addition the aba was significantly higher in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds the rf system with different limited irrigation levels had a significant effect on the aba in the basal and upper seeds with rainfall conditions compared to the tf system the rf150 treatment at the 125 mm simulated precipitation showed a significant improvement in the aba in the basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf150 treatment the aba in the basal and upper seeds under the rf system was significantly higher than that of the tf planting pattern at 3 18 days after flowering in addition at the 200 mm simulated rainfall level the rf150 treatment also significantly improved the aba in the basal and upper seeds while the tf planting pattern had no significant effect on aba in the basal and upper seeds in contrast at the 275 mm precipitation either the rf system or the tf system had a significant effect on the aba content of basal or upper seeds under limited irrigation levels the difference between the rf and tf planting patterns under the 275 mm rainfall level did not have a significant effect on aba in the basal or upper seeds 3 3 3 ga content the gas in the basal and upper seeds declined slowly during the early seed filling of the winter wheat crop fig 6 the gas was significantly lower in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds during the same days after flowering the tf75 treatment with a 125 mm simulated precipitation had a significant influence on the ga content in the basal and upper seeds compared to that of the rf150 treatment the gas content under the rf system was significantly lower in both basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf planting pattern at 3 18 days after flowering at the 200 mm simulated precipitation level the tf75 treatment also significantly affected the gas in the basal and upper seeds while the rf system had no significant influence on the ga content the difference between the rf and tf planting patterns under the 275 mm rainfall level did not have a significant influence on ga content in the basal and upper seeds 3 4 soil water content and soil temperature the rf system retained an incremental increase in the swc among soil layers at the depth of 0 200 cm compared to the tf planting there were no considerable differences in the soil moisture between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatment at a depth of 0 200 cm during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 7 the swc at the flowering and seed filling stages at depths of 0 60 cm increased while at depths of 60 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting patterns furthermore the swc increased under both planting models as the precipitation and limited irrigation levels increased however at the maturity stage the swc under the rf technique increased compared to tf treatment at depths of 0 80 cm this demonstrated that the rf system the wheat crops took up less water from deeper soil layers compared to the crops in the tf planting treatment the tf planting had higher soil temperatures compared to the rf technique under different precipitation and limited irrigation levels during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 8 the tf375 treatment the soil temperature was higher than that of the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments after the seed filling stage in addition the soil temperatures under the rf1150 rf2150 and tf1150 treatments were lower than that of the tf2150 and tf3150 treatments at the flowering seed filling and maturity stages 3 5 soil respiration rate the rf technique with simulated precipitation had a significant effect on the soil respiration rate under limited irrigation conditions at the three main growth stages during both years table 4 the soil respiration rate under the rf system with the 275 mm or 200 mm precipitation levels was not significantly different at the jointing flowering and seed filling stages the mean of the two year data indicated that at the jointing flowering and seed filling stages the soil respiration rate under the rf1150 treatment was greater by 10 6 40 1 and 34 9 compared to the tf1150 respectively the soil respiration under the rf2150 treatment at the jointing flowering and seed filling stages was greater by 7 5 23 0 and 34 3 compared to the tf2150 treatment respectively during the various wheat growth stages in the 2015 2017 seasons the soil respiration rate was not significantly different between the rf150 treatment with 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall levels 3 6 correlation coefficients of peak hormone contents and seed filling the correlation coefficients indicated significant variation in the peak hormone contents in seeds and seed filling rate in different spike positions on the wheat plants table 5 the iaa z zr aba and ga contents in the basal and upper seeds significantly positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates and the maximum seed weight respectively for the basal seeds the gas was significantly and positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates as well as the maximum seed weight 4 discussion 4 1 effects of planting patterns limited irrigation and simulated rainfall on grain yield dry land farming systems of northern china are dependent on seasonal precipitation volume and distribution for agricultural productivity ren et al 2008 however consistent water deficits are a key factor shown to decrease winter wheat production tang et al 2011 previous studies have recommended the use of the rf planting system as this practice has significantly improved soil moisture content by retaining rainwater from light precipitation events and reducing evaporation in turn increasing agricultural productivity zhang et al 2011 the present study has confirmed that seed yield significantly increases with an increase in precipitation and irrigations levels importantly there was no significant variation in seed yield when the precipitation was above 200 mm under both the rf or tf planting patterns the rf system under limited irrigation with varied simulated precipitation volumes produced greater grain yields compared to that of the tf system the mean of the two year data indicated that the rf technique improved soil moisture and soil respiration rate and reduced soil temperature as a result of these changes the rf system produced 15 higher 0 79 t ha 1 grain yield than that of tf treatment the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments seed spike 1 yield spike 1 g spikelets spike 1 and 1000 seed weight g were significantly increased compared to that of the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments our results are similar to previous research regarding winter wheat grown under the rf system with deficit irrigation these studies also showed that these conditions increase soil water content and reduce soil evaporation altering rainwater usage from soil evaporation to crop transpiration and significantly improving grain yield li and gong 2002 fang et al 2006 the potential yield of wheat can be divided into three main components number of spike plant 1 seeds spike 1 and seed weight seed filling rate regulated by seed weight is an essential yield component of winter wheat liu et al 2004 an earlier study has shown that winter wheat seed weight is significantly affected under simulated rainfall conditions zhang et al 2009 furthermore wheat and rice seeds can be separated into basal and upper seeds according to the degree of seed filling the rice cultivar super does not ascertain high potential yield due to poor seed filling in the upper seeds yang and zhang 2010 our results also indicated that the rf technique considerably affected the maximum and mean seed filling rates and the maximum seed weights of the basal and upper seeds compared to that in tf planting when precipitation levels increased from 125 to 200 mm under limited irrigation and different planting models a significant increase in the maximum and mean seed filling rates and the maximum seed weights for basal and upper seeds was observed however when precipitation improved from 200 to 275 mm there was no significant variation recorded in single seed weights and seed filling rates under different planting models figs 1 and 2 table 3 the rf150 treatment with 125 mm of simulated rainfall significantly improved the basal and upper seed filling rates in addition the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation also significantly improved the single seed weight and seed filling rates of basal and upper seeds in contrast the rf system with 275 mm precipitation did not have a significant influence on the single seed weight and seed filling rate of the basal and upper seeds under any irrigation levels the rf150 treatment with 200 mm or 275 mm rainfall levels significantly improved the seed filling rate in the basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf150 treatment at 3 18 days after flowering a previous study suggested that soil moisture may have different effects on filling rates in superior and inferior grains xu et al 2007 xu et al 2007 suggested that non flooded plastic mulching cultivation significantly decreases the grain filling rate and grain weight of inferior rice grains compared to traditional flooding cultivation however this cultivation method has no such effect on superior rice grains indicating that the inferior grains are more sensitive to soil moisture furthermore the effects of the rf system on the basal and upper seed filling stages were positively correlated with iaa z zr and aba contents this finding also corresponded to our work an earlier study indicated that the rf system can improve soil moisture content as a result of enhanced seed filling rate in upper seeds signifying that the upper seeds are highly sensitive to drought stresses liu et al 2010 4 2 soil moisture soil temperature and soil respiration rate the rf system with plastic mulch has been shown to reduce rainfall water losses reduces evaporation and improves soil moisture content zhao et al 2014 we found that the rf technique can considerably increase the swc among soil layers at depths of 0 200 cm compared to tf planting at the flowering and seed filling stage the swc between 0 and 60 cm increased while from 60 to 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting patterns at the maturity stage the swc increased under the rf technique compared to tf at soil depths of 0 80 cm showing that the rf system results in less water uptake from deeper soil layers compared to that of tf planting a study by wang et al 2015 showed that the rf technique with 340 mm of simulated rainfall can retain more rainwater in the soil than tf planting practices thereby reducing soil temperature another reason that soil temperatures are reduced when utilizing the rf system is better usage of light rains hu et al 2014 greater rainfall conservation in soils was a key reason why the soil moisture was higher under rf cultivation than in tf planting chen et al 2013 previous research has confirmed that the rf technique can decrease soil temperature li et al 2013 and increase soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby increasing grain yield we also found that the tf system resulted in higher soil temperatures compared to the rf technique under with all precipitation and irrigation levels during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 8 additionally the soil temperature was higher under the tf375 treatment than that of the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments at the seed filling stage an earlier study also revealed that rf cultivation can decrease soil temperature and improve soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby significantly increasing winter wheat yields duan et al 2006 during wet growing seasons heavy rainfalls can reduce the soil respiration rate by 29 demonstrating that soil moisture and temperature collectively affect soil respiration rate chen et al 2013 our result confirmed that the soil respiration rate was not significantly affected under the rf system with 275 mm or 200 mm precipitation levels during different growth stages of winter wheat crop the mean of the two year data showed that at the jointing flowering and seed filling stages the soil respiration rate under the rf2150 treatment was greater by 7 5 23 0 and 34 3 than that of tf2150 treatment respectively the soil respiration rate was not significantly different under the rf150 treatment between the 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall levels pan et al 2003 also confirmed that the soil respiration rate was significantly enhanced with increasing amounts of deficit irrigation but that over irrigation significantly reduces the soil respiration rate 4 3 relationship between winter wheat seed filling and hormone changes cytokinins ctks play a significant role in regulating seed filling in winter wheat crops zhang et al 2009 high ctk levels in wheat spike tissues are markedly associated with grain improvement yang et al 2002 it has been reported the high ctk levels in rice spikelets are significantly correlated with seed endosperm and are necessary for cell division during the early seed filling stage yang et al 2000 the combination of ctks and iaa play a significant role in regulating the early seed filling phase forcing cells to both expand and divide xu et al 2007 the present research endeavour showed a significant correlation between seed iaa and z zr contents among the maximum and mean seed filling rates and maximum seed weight table 5 showing that iaa and z zr contents are involved in regulating winter wheat seed filling the seed iaa and z zr contents during the early seed filling stage rapidly increased and the highest iaa and z zr contents were observed at 12 days after flowering for the basal seeds and 15 days after flowering for the upper seeds followed by a drop off in phytohormone levels the iaa and z zr contents were significantly greater in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds during 3 15 days after flowering figs 3 and 4 the rf150 treatment with 125 mm simulated precipitation presented significantly higher iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds compared to the tf150 treatment at the same precipitation level respectively the rf system displayed iaa and z zr contents significantly higher in the basal and upper seeds compared to the seed levels in the tf planting pattern at 3 15 days after flowering at the 200 mm simulated rainfall condition the rf150 treatment also showed significantly higher iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds while the tf planting pattern had no significant effect on the phytohormone levels in the basal and upper seeds in contrast at the 275 mm precipitation treatment both the rf and tf planting patterns showed no significant influence on iaa and z zr contents in basal and upper seeds under either irrigation level the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation presented significantly higher iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds than that of the rf150 treatment with 125 or 275 mm simulated rainfall levels at 3 15 days after flowering a study by xu et al 2007 showed that ctks control endosperm cell division in developing rice seeds while another report explained that auxin also regulates cell growth and division singh and gerung 1982 high iaa levels in a sink organ can lead to improved ctks levels in seeds davies 1987 these previous findings as well as the findings in this research indicate that iaa and z zr contents may control early seed filling in winter wheat crops furthermore aba also plays a significant role in regulating the seed filling process in winter wheat crops yang et al 2006 discovered that aba is associated with the seed filling rate in winter wheat basal seeds here the aba in the basal and upper seeds was also significantly improved during the early seed filling stage and aba levels were maximized at 15 days after flowering in basal seeds and 18 days after flowering in upper seeds fig 5 in addition aba was significantly higher in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds the difference between the aba content in the rf and tf planting patterns under the 275 mm rainfall level did not show a significant different in the basal and upper seeds our correlation analysis showed that the aba content in seeds was significantly and positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates and maximum seed weight the same trend was also found for the basal and upper seeds similarly this result was consistent with an earlier study yang et al 2006 gas is also engaged in regulating the seed filling process and seed development kurogochi et al 1979 confirmed that the highest gas contents in pea liquid endosperm occur during the pod elongation stage additionally relatively high levels of ga1 4 19 are present in the large spike of rice just prior to and during the flowering stage suzuki et al 1981 in the present study ga content was significantly lower in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds during the same days after flowering in winter wheat the ga content under the rf system was significantly lower in both basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf planting pattern at 3 18 days after flowering however seed ga levels were positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates and maximum seed weight these results suggest that ga may be involved in the regulation of wheat grain filling but may not be a determining factor for this process in wheat these results indicate that a hormonal balance rather than individual hormone content regulates the wheat grain filling process our results showed that the rf2150 treatment significantly improved the soil respiration rate and soil water content thereby regulating hormone levels and seed filling rates and ultimately improving winter wheat production in semi arid environments 5 conclusion this research suggested that under the rf system winter wheat seed filling and hormonal changes are significantly associated with limited irrigation levels and varied precipitation concentrations under the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation significantly improved single seed weight and seed filling rate was observed in basal and upper seeds in contrast the rf system with 275 mm precipitation had no considerable effect on the seed filling rate and seed weight of basal and upper seeds under any limited irrigation level the rf system with 125 or 200 mm simulated precipitation level considerably improved the phytohormones z zr and iaa contents and while at 150 mm limited irrigation the aba and ga contents were reduced in the basal and upper seeds in contrast the rf system with 275 mm rainfall had no effect on z zr iaa aba or gas contents in basal and upper seeds under any limited irrigation level the rf system with either limited irrigation level under any simulated rainfall condition affected hormonal changes therefore regulating the seed filling process we demonstrated that the rf2150 treatment significantly improved the moisture content and soil respiration rate thereby regulating the winter wheat seed filling rate and creating hormonal changes these fluctuations significantly affected the agronomic properties of winter wheat production

11448,we sought to study the effects of the ridge furrow rf rainwater collecting technique on winter wheat seed filling with limited irrigation under simulated rainfall concentrations and its correlation with hormonal changes the rf system was compared to traditional flat planting tf with two limited irrigation levels 150 75 mm under three simulated precipitation concentrations 1 275 2 200 3 125 mm during 2015 2017 experimental years the results indicated that the rf150 treatment with 125 mm rainfall a significantly improved seed filling rate was observed in the basal and upper seeds the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation also significantly improved the single seed weight and seed filling rate in the basal and upper seeds in contrast the rf system with 275 mm precipitation showed no significant influence on the seed filling rates and seed weight of basal and upper seeds under either limited irrigation level the rf system at 125 and 200 mm simulated rainfall level exhibited increased iaa indole 3 acetic acid and z zeatin zr zeatin riboside contents the rf system under 150 mm limited irrigation showed decreased aba abscisic acid and gibberellic acid gas in the basal and upper seeds the rf system with 275 mm precipitation had no significant influence on the iaa z zr aba and ga contents in the basal and upper seeds under either limited irrigation levels the iaa z zr aba and gas in the seeds s were positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rate and the maximum seed weight our results demonstrate that the rf2150 treatment significantly improved the soil water contents and soil respiration rate thereby regulating the wheat seed filling rate and creating hormonal changes these fluctuations significantly affected the agronomic properties of winter wheat production in semi arid regions keywords limited irrigation rainfall seed filling process hormone wheat yield planting patterns 1 introduction winter wheat yield in rain fed areas of china is highly dependent on precipitation although it is erratic and insufficient in these regions nagaz et al 2012 the majority of rainfall occurs during the monsoon season with 68 of the yearly precipitation falling from june to september in semi arid regions of china wang et al 2015 the monsoon spells do not overlap with the wheat growing season and water scarcity is often a limitation to growth li and gong 2002 furthermore the annual evaporation in rain fed areas of china is more than 830 mm resulting in severe drought conditions throughout the winter wheat growing period zhang et al 2011 in order to deal with inadequate water resources and to increase wheat production in these areas it has been important to develop water saving agricultural techniques to maximize utilization of the erratically available rainwater and increase soil moisture content ren et al 2016 previous studies have suggested that ridge covering materials including plastic mulch and biodegradable mulch are able to conserve rainwater decrease evaporation and improve soil moisture content and soil respiration rate in turn enhancing winter wheat water usage efficiency wue martinez et al 2011 overall it is difficult to improve plant growth in semi arid areas of china due to water shortages li et al 2016 currently the ridge furrow precipitation harvesting rf technique has been implemented in rain fed areas of china to solve water shortage issues jia et al 2006 the rf technique includes ridges and furrows where the ridges are covered with a plastic film for use as a precipitation collecting zone and the furrow is used as the sowing zone hu et al 2014 the rf technique significantly improves soil water storage by saving water during light intensity precipitation and preserving surface runoff during high intensity rainfall li et al 2001 the rf technique decreases soil temperature as well as prolongs the duration of water availability for the winter wheat growing season li et al 2016 deng et al 2006 reported that the rf system improves water content by 11 15 in the 200 cm soil layer depth and increases grain yield 75 under precipitation of 230 340 mm compared to traditional flat tf cultivation however the biological yield water use efficiency and seed yield of corn were not significantly enhanced when rainfall was more than 440 mm water shortage during the winter wheat crop s flowering and seed filling stage can cause significant grain yield decreases these decreases are mainly due to oxidative damage as a result reducing seed set and sink capacity of the plant it has been shown that the rf planting model can offset this damage by preventing water shortage xie et al 2008 kang et al 2002 however during the flowering and seed filling stages water deficiency is often unavoidable guo et al 2014 limited irrigation li coupled with the rf system may offer a solution for supplying water during critical growth stages significantly increasing grain yield and soil respiration rate ali and thei 2004 tang et al 2011 it is important to note that an unnecessary supply of irrigation water can lead to high rates of evapotranspiration and biomass accumulation and does not significantly increase grain yield geerts et al 2008 it has been shown that the soil respiration rate improves with increasing irrigation but over irrigation will suppress the soil respiration rate wang et al 2009 the rf technique with varied precipitation conditions and limited irrigation that affects the biochemical mechanism and winter wheat production has not been clarified the potential yield of winter wheat can be divided into three main units spike plant 1 seed weight and seeds spike 1 in current semi arid regions the maximum yield and seed filling development in winter wheat have been affected by fluctuating rainfall and the yield potential outputs have become unpredictable ali et al 2016 it is important to understand how the rf system influences wheat seed filling and the primary biochemical mechanisms during this developmental stage when various rainfall amounts and limited irrigation are applied winter wheat seed filling is controlled by several factors including plant hormones that have been shown to have a significant role in modifying seed filling progress yang et al 2006 higher abscisic acid aba content in winter wheat seeds is linked with maximum seed filling rate yang et al 2006 the zeatin zeatin riboside z zr phytohormones of the cytokinin family contents in developing winter wheat seeds temporarily enhance fertilization during kernel setting and endosperm cell division morris et al 1993 the gas content in rice seeds is also associated with the early seed filling stage gao et al 2000 and the maximum and mean seed filling rate were positively associated with gas concentrations in rice seeds yang et al 2001 additionally the iaa content in basal seeds has been found to be higher than that of upper seeds during the early seed filling stage of rice wu et al 2008 these studies have shown that plant hormonal changes significantly affect the seed filling process of rice crops however the hormonal variation between spike seed positions and the correlation between seed filling and hormonal changes induced by the rf system remains unclear in the present study various simulated rainfall and limited irrigation levels under different planting patterns were used during the winter wheat growth stage and the hormonal changes in the grains during grain filling were measured the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the effect of rf technique under simulated precipitation and limited irrigation on grain filling of winter wheat and the soil water content and to determine how the changes in endogenous hormones in the developing grains of winter wheat under rf technique are related to the grain filling process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site

and on may 27 in 2017 whole of the nitrogen urea and phosphorus diammonium phosphate were applied at the time of planting at the rates of 225 and 75 kg ha 1 respectively the levels of simulated rainfall were determined based on the distribution of rainfall in the semi arid regions of northern china over the past 48 years years period 1966 2014 three total amounts of simulated rainfall 125 200 and 275 mm corresponding to light 1 moderate 2 and heavy 3 simulated rain levels were applied as described in a previous study liu et al 2013 ali et al 2017 in this study a precipitation simulator was used to provide the crop water and no natural rainfall was allowed during wheat growing season a complete detail of the rainfall conditions can be seen in table 1 in this rainfall simulator study the amount of rainwater measured under field conditions was reasonably similar to natural rainfall amounts 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 soil water content and temperature the soil water content swc and temperature were monitored at the flowering stage seed filling stage and maturity stage over 2016 17 moisture content of the 0 200 cm soil layers depth at 20 cm intervals was recorded using a

difference test lsd at p 0 05 the variation in seed filling and hormone levels between the two study years was not significant so comparisons pooling the data from 2016 to 17 were used to determine differences among the hormone levels and seed filling 3 results 3 1 yield and yield component the grain yield of winter wheat significantly varied under simulated precipitation with limited irrigation and different planting patterns during the 2015 17 years table 2 the grain yield significantly increased with precipitation and limited irrigations levels but there was no significant variation when the rainfall was exceeding 200 mm under both planting models the rf technique under limited irrigation with precipitation concentrations produced greater grain yield than that of the tf treatment additionally the rf system produced 15 higher 0 79 t ha 1 grain yield than that of tf system similarly the rf technique with limited irrigation and the simulated rainfall conditions also significantly influenced the winter wheat yield components the rf technique with increasing rainfall and limited irrigation levels showed significantly increased seed spike 1 yield spike 1 g spikelet s spike 1 and 1000 seed weight g compared to the tf treatment table 2 at the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments seed spike 1 yield spike 1 g spikelet s spike 1 and 1000 seed weight g were significantly higher than that of tf1150 and tf2150 treatments however there was no significant variation observed between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments for the seed spike 1 yield spike 1 g spikelet s spike 1 and 1000 seed weight g 3 2 seed filling the rf system significantly differed in the maximum and mean seed filling rates and the maximum seed weights of the basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf planting when the simulated precipitation levels increased from 125 to 200 mm under limited irrigation and different planting models a significant increase in the maximum and mean seed filling rates as well as the maximum seed weights for the basal and upper seeds occurred however when the precipitation improved from 200 to 275 mm there was no significant variation recorded in single seed weights or in seed filling rates under the different planting models figs 1 and 2 table 3 the rf150 treatment with 125 mm simulated rainfall a significantly improvement in the basal and upper seed filling rates was measured in addition the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation also significantly improved the single seed weights and seed filling rates of the basal and upper seeds in contrast at the 275 mm precipitation the effect of rf system had no significant on the single seed weights and seed filling rates of the basal and upper seeds under limited irrigation levels the seed filling rate was significantly enhanced at the early flowering stage and subsequently reduced the seed filling rate was significantly higher in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds fig 2 the rf150 treatment with 200 mm or 275 mm rainfall levels the seed filling rate was significantly higher in the basal and upper seeds than that of the tf150 treatment at 3 18 days after flowering the rf150 treatment with 200 mm or 275 mm rainfall levels the seed filling rate was maximized at 15 days after flowering for the basal seeds the tf150 treatment with 200 mm or 275 mm rainfall levels the seed filling rate reached was maximized at 18 days after flowering for the upper seeds 3 3 hormonal changes 3 3 1 iaa and z zr contents the iaa and z zr contents in the seeds at the early seed filling stage rapidly increased to their maximum levels at 12 days after flowering for the basal seeds and 15 days after flowering for the upper seeds the iaa and z zr contents then decreased for the remainder of the sampling times the iaa and z zr contents were significantly greater in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds from 3 to 15 days after flowering figs 3 and 4 the rf system with different limited irrigation levels had significant effects on the iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds under precipitation conditions compared to the tf treatment the rf150 treatment at the 125 mm rainfall showed significantly improved iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds than that of tf150 treatment respectively the iaa and z zr contents under the rf system were significantly higher in the basal and upper seeds than those of the tf planting system at 3 15 days after flowering the iaa and z zr contents in the basal seeds under the rf150 treatment with a 200 mm rainfall level achieved were maximized at 12 days after flowering the iaa and z zr contents in the upper seeds under the tf150 treatment with a 200 mm rainfall level achieved was maximized at 15 days after flowering at the 200 mm simulated rainfall condition the rf150 treatment significantly improved the iaa and z zr contents in both the basal and upper seeds while the tf planting pattern did not in contrast at the 275 mm precipitation either the rf system or the tf system had a significant influence on the iaa and z zr contents of basal and upper seeds under any limited irrigation level the basal and upper seed iaa and z zr contents under the rf150 treatment with a 200 mm rainfall level were significantly higher than that of the 125 or 275 mm simulated rainfall levels at 3 15 days after flowering 3 3 2 aba content the aba content at the early seed filling stage in the basal and upper seeds was maximized at 15 days after flowering for the basal seeds and 18 days after flowering for the upper seeds these levels decreased steadily after their respective peaks fig 5 in addition the aba was significantly higher in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds the rf system with different limited irrigation levels had a significant effect on the aba in the basal and upper seeds with rainfall conditions compared to the tf system the rf150 treatment at the 125 mm simulated precipitation showed a significant improvement in the aba in the basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf150 treatment the aba in the basal and upper seeds under the rf system was significantly higher than that of the tf planting pattern at 3 18 days after flowering in addition at the 200 mm simulated rainfall level the rf150 treatment also significantly improved the aba in the basal and upper seeds while the tf planting pattern had no significant effect on aba in the basal and upper seeds in contrast at the 275 mm precipitation either the rf system or the tf system had a significant effect on the aba content of basal or upper seeds under limited irrigation levels the difference between the rf and tf planting patterns under the 275 mm rainfall level did not have a significant effect on aba in the basal or upper seeds 3 3 3 ga content the gas in the basal and upper seeds declined slowly during the early seed filling of the winter wheat crop fig 6 the gas was significantly lower in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds during the same days after flowering the tf75 treatment with a 125 mm simulated precipitation had a significant influence on the ga content in the basal and upper seeds compared to that of the rf150 treatment the gas content under the rf system was significantly lower in both basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf planting pattern at 3 18 days after flowering at the 200 mm simulated precipitation level the tf75 treatment also significantly affected the gas in the basal and upper seeds while the rf system had no significant influence on the ga content the difference between the rf and tf planting patterns under the 275 mm rainfall level did not have a significant influence on ga content in the basal and upper seeds 3 4 soil water content and soil temperature the rf system retained an incremental increase in the swc among soil layers at the depth of 0 200 cm compared to the tf planting there were no considerable differences in the soil moisture between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatment at a depth of 0 200 cm during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 7 the swc at the flowering and seed filling stages at depths of 0 60 cm increased while at depths of 60 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting patterns furthermore the swc increased under both planting models as the precipitation and limited irrigation levels increased however at the maturity stage the swc under the rf technique increased compared to tf treatment at depths of 0 80 cm this demonstrated that the rf system the wheat crops took up less water from deeper soil layers compared to the crops in the tf planting treatment the tf planting had higher soil temperatures compared to the rf technique under different precipitation and limited irrigation levels during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 8 the tf375 treatment the soil temperature was higher than that of the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments after the seed filling stage in addition the soil temperatures under the rf1150 rf2150 and tf1150 treatments were lower than that of the tf2150 and tf3150 treatments at the flowering seed filling and maturity stages 3 5 soil respiration rate the rf technique with simulated precipitation had a significant effect on the soil respiration rate under limited irrigation conditions at the three main growth stages during both years table 4 the soil respiration rate under the rf system with the 275 mm or 200 mm precipitation levels was not significantly different at the jointing flowering and seed filling stages the mean of the two year data indicated that at the jointing flowering and seed filling stages the soil respiration rate under the rf1150 treatment was greater by 10 6 40 1 and 34 9 compared to the tf1150 respectively the soil respiration under the rf2150 treatment at the jointing flowering and seed filling stages was greater by 7 5 23 0 and 34 3 compared to the tf2150 treatment respectively during the various wheat growth stages in the 2015 2017 seasons the soil respiration rate was not significantly different between the rf150 treatment with 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall levels 3 6 correlation coefficients of peak hormone contents and seed filling the correlation coefficients indicated significant variation in the peak hormone contents in seeds and seed filling rate in different spike positions on the wheat plants table 5 the iaa z zr aba and ga contents in the basal and upper seeds significantly positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates and the maximum seed weight respectively for the basal seeds the gas was significantly and positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates as well as the maximum seed weight 4 discussion 4 1 effects of planting patterns limited irrigation and simulated rainfall on grain yield dry land farming systems of northern china are dependent on seasonal precipitation volume and distribution for agricultural productivity ren et al 2008 however consistent water deficits are a key factor shown to decrease winter wheat production tang et al 2011 previous studies have recommended the use of the rf planting system as this practice has significantly improved soil moisture content by retaining rainwater from light precipitation events and reducing evaporation in turn increasing agricultural productivity zhang et al 2011 the present study has confirmed that seed yield significantly increases with an increase in precipitation and irrigations levels importantly there was no significant variation in seed yield when the precipitation was above 200 mm under both the rf or tf planting patterns the rf system under limited irrigation with varied simulated precipitation volumes produced greater grain yields compared to that of the tf system the mean of the two year data indicated that the rf technique improved soil moisture and soil respiration rate and reduced soil temperature as a result of these changes the rf system produced 15 higher 0 79 t ha 1 grain yield than that of tf treatment the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments seed spike 1 yield spike 1 g spikelets spike 1 and 1000 seed weight g were significantly increased compared to that of the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments our results are similar to previous research regarding winter wheat grown under the rf system with deficit irrigation these studies also showed that these conditions increase soil water content and reduce soil evaporation altering rainwater usage from soil evaporation to crop transpiration and significantly improving grain yield li and gong 2002 fang et al 2006 the potential yield of wheat can be divided into three main components number of spike plant 1 seeds spike 1 and seed weight seed filling rate regulated by seed weight is an essential yield component of winter wheat liu et al 2004 an earlier study has shown that winter wheat seed weight is significantly affected under simulated rainfall conditions zhang et al 2009 furthermore wheat and rice seeds can be separated into basal and upper seeds according to the degree of seed filling the rice cultivar super does not ascertain high potential yield due to poor seed filling in the upper seeds yang and zhang 2010 our results also indicated that the rf technique considerably affected the maximum and mean seed filling rates and the maximum seed weights of the basal and upper seeds compared to that in tf planting when precipitation levels increased from 125 to 200 mm under limited irrigation and different planting models a significant increase in the maximum and mean seed filling rates and the maximum seed weights for basal and upper seeds was observed however when precipitation improved from 200 to 275 mm there was no significant variation recorded in single seed weights and seed filling rates under different planting models figs 1 and 2 table 3 the rf150 treatment with 125 mm of simulated rainfall significantly improved the basal and upper seed filling rates in addition the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation also significantly improved the single seed weight and seed filling rates of basal and upper seeds in contrast the rf system with 275 mm precipitation did not have a significant influence on the single seed weight and seed filling rate of the basal and upper seeds under any irrigation levels the rf150 treatment with 200 mm or 275 mm rainfall levels significantly improved the seed filling rate in the basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf150 treatment at 3 18 days after flowering a previous study suggested that soil moisture may have different effects on filling rates in superior and inferior grains xu et al 2007 xu et al 2007 suggested that non flooded plastic mulching cultivation significantly decreases the grain filling rate and grain weight of inferior rice grains compared to traditional flooding cultivation however this cultivation method has no such effect on superior rice grains indicating that the inferior grains are more sensitive to soil moisture furthermore the effects of the rf system on the basal and upper seed filling stages were positively correlated with iaa z zr and aba contents this finding also corresponded to our work an earlier study indicated that the rf system can improve soil moisture content as a result of enhanced seed filling rate in upper seeds signifying that the upper seeds are highly sensitive to drought stresses liu et al 2010 4 2 soil moisture soil temperature and soil respiration rate the rf system with plastic mulch has been shown to reduce rainfall water losses reduces evaporation and improves soil moisture content zhao et al 2014 we found that the rf technique can considerably increase the swc among soil layers at depths of 0 200 cm compared to tf planting at the flowering and seed filling stage the swc between 0 and 60 cm increased while from 60 to 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting patterns at the maturity stage the swc increased under the rf technique compared to tf at soil depths of 0 80 cm showing that the rf system results in less water uptake from deeper soil layers compared to that of tf planting a study by wang et al 2015 showed that the rf technique with 340 mm of simulated rainfall can retain more rainwater in the soil than tf planting practices thereby reducing soil temperature another reason that soil temperatures are reduced when utilizing the rf system is better usage of light rains hu et al 2014 greater rainfall conservation in soils was a key reason why the soil moisture was higher under rf cultivation than in tf planting chen et al 2013 previous research has confirmed that the rf technique can decrease soil temperature li et al 2013 and increase soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby increasing grain yield we also found that the tf system resulted in higher soil temperatures compared to the rf technique under with all precipitation and irrigation levels during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 8 additionally the soil temperature was higher under the tf375 treatment than that of the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments at the seed filling stage an earlier study also revealed that rf cultivation can decrease soil temperature and improve soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby significantly increasing winter wheat yields duan et al 2006 during wet growing seasons heavy rainfalls can reduce the soil respiration rate by 29 demonstrating that soil moisture and temperature collectively affect soil respiration rate chen et al 2013 our result confirmed that the soil respiration rate was not significantly affected under the rf system with 275 mm or 200 mm precipitation levels during different growth stages of winter wheat crop the mean of the two year data showed that at the jointing flowering and seed filling stages the soil respiration rate under the rf2150 treatment was greater by 7 5 23 0 and 34 3 than that of tf2150 treatment respectively the soil respiration rate was not significantly different under the rf150 treatment between the 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall levels pan et al 2003 also confirmed that the soil respiration rate was significantly enhanced with increasing amounts of deficit irrigation but that over irrigation significantly reduces the soil respiration rate 4 3 relationship between winter wheat seed filling and hormone changes cytokinins ctks play a significant role in regulating seed filling in winter wheat crops zhang et al 2009 high ctk levels in wheat spike tissues are markedly associated with grain improvement yang et al 2002 it has been reported the high ctk levels in rice spikelets are significantly correlated with seed endosperm and are necessary for cell division during the early seed filling stage yang et al 2000 the combination of ctks and iaa play a significant role in regulating the early seed filling phase forcing cells to both expand and divide xu et al 2007 the present research endeavour showed a significant correlation between seed iaa and z zr contents among the maximum and mean seed filling rates and maximum seed weight table 5 showing that iaa and z zr contents are involved in regulating winter wheat seed filling the seed iaa and z zr contents during the early seed filling stage rapidly increased and the highest iaa and z zr contents were observed at 12 days after flowering for the basal seeds and 15 days after flowering for the upper seeds followed by a drop off in phytohormone levels the iaa and z zr contents were significantly greater in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds during 3 15 days after flowering figs 3 and 4 the rf150 treatment with 125 mm simulated precipitation presented significantly higher iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds compared to the tf150 treatment at the same precipitation level respectively the rf system displayed iaa and z zr contents significantly higher in the basal and upper seeds compared to the seed levels in the tf planting pattern at 3 15 days after flowering at the 200 mm simulated rainfall condition the rf150 treatment also showed significantly higher iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds while the tf planting pattern had no significant effect on the phytohormone levels in the basal and upper seeds in contrast at the 275 mm precipitation treatment both the rf and tf planting patterns showed no significant influence on iaa and z zr contents in basal and upper seeds under either irrigation level the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation presented significantly higher iaa and z zr contents in the basal and upper seeds than that of the rf150 treatment with 125 or 275 mm simulated rainfall levels at 3 15 days after flowering a study by xu et al 2007 showed that ctks control endosperm cell division in developing rice seeds while another report explained that auxin also regulates cell growth and division singh and gerung 1982 high iaa levels in a sink organ can lead to improved ctks levels in seeds davies 1987 these previous findings as well as the findings in this research indicate that iaa and z zr contents may control early seed filling in winter wheat crops furthermore aba also plays a significant role in regulating the seed filling process in winter wheat crops yang et al 2006 discovered that aba is associated with the seed filling rate in winter wheat basal seeds here the aba in the basal and upper seeds was also significantly improved during the early seed filling stage and aba levels were maximized at 15 days after flowering in basal seeds and 18 days after flowering in upper seeds fig 5 in addition aba was significantly higher in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds the difference between the aba content in the rf and tf planting patterns under the 275 mm rainfall level did not show a significant different in the basal and upper seeds our correlation analysis showed that the aba content in seeds was significantly and positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates and maximum seed weight the same trend was also found for the basal and upper seeds similarly this result was consistent with an earlier study yang et al 2006 gas is also engaged in regulating the seed filling process and seed development kurogochi et al 1979 confirmed that the highest gas contents in pea liquid endosperm occur during the pod elongation stage additionally relatively high levels of ga1 4 19 are present in the large spike of rice just prior to and during the flowering stage suzuki et al 1981 in the present study ga content was significantly lower in the basal seeds than that of upper seeds during the same days after flowering in winter wheat the ga content under the rf system was significantly lower in both basal and upper seeds compared to that of the tf planting pattern at 3 18 days after flowering however seed ga levels were positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates and maximum seed weight these results suggest that ga may be involved in the regulation of wheat grain filling but may not be a determining factor for this process in wheat these results indicate that a hormonal balance rather than individual hormone content regulates the wheat grain filling process our results showed that the rf2150 treatment significantly improved the soil respiration rate and soil water content thereby regulating hormone levels and seed filling rates and ultimately improving winter wheat production in semi arid environments 5 conclusion this research suggested that under the rf system winter wheat seed filling and hormonal changes are significantly associated with limited irrigation levels and varied precipitation concentrations under the rf150 treatment with 200 mm precipitation significantly improved single seed weight and seed filling rate was observed in basal and upper seeds in contrast the rf system with 275 mm precipitation had no considerable effect on the seed filling rate and seed weight of basal and upper seeds under any limited irrigation level the rf system with 125 or 200 mm simulated precipitation level considerably improved the phytohormones z zr and iaa contents and while at 150 mm limited irrigation the aba and ga contents were reduced in the basal and upper seeds in contrast the rf system with 275 mm rainfall had no effect on z zr iaa aba or gas contents in basal and upper seeds under any limited irrigation level the rf system with either limited irrigation level under any simulated rainfall condition affected hormonal changes therefore regulating the seed filling process we demonstrated that the rf2150 treatment significantly improved the moisture content and soil respiration rate thereby regulating the winter wheat seed filling rate and creating hormonal changes these fluctuations significantly affected the agronomic properties of winter wheat production

11449,in a time of resource reduction and climate variability water conservation is critical to improve agroecosystem sustainability non ionic surfactants were recently hypothesized as irrigation adjuvants but so far researchers obtained contrasting results the first objective of this work was to evaluate the capillary adsorption properties of organosilicone surfactants by providing two robust tests on standard porous media results showed smaller capillary mobility and higher wetting power superspreading compared to pure water an innovative non ionic surfactant formulation the organosilicone pet polyether modified trisiloxane was then investigated as irrigation adjuvant in a pot trial on lettuce in absence of fertilization overall the system was characterized by an improvement in the processes of resource acquisition i e water and nutrients results indicated higher lettuce leaf area reduced root dry weight and root shoot ratio and a positive main effect on the uptake availability and or use efficiency of p k and some micronutrients the n use efficiency and recovery increased 3 15 with higher n concentration and content against changes in plant weight fresh yield data showed a particularly high irrigation use efficiency 77 60 and the adjuvant productivity variation of lettuce yield due to pet increased by 12 26 our experimental findings can be explained by hypothesizing that pet affected both capillary and adsorption processes during water diffusion along concentration gradients which constitute the main driving force for solutes movement towards the roots a theoretical model is provided to explain how pet improved the thickening and interconnection of conductive adsorbed water film in soil keywords lettuce nitrogen use efficiency soil capillary model non ionic surfactants climate smart agriculture matric potential sustainability 1 introduction globally agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of freshwater used mainly for irrigation fao 2016 fischer et al 2007 however the water withdrawal for irrigation largely exceeds the crop requirements fao 2016 knox et al 2012 in a time in which the demand for water is increasing at a rate twice that of population growth fao 2016 gil and kamanda 2015 agriculture is called to meet the economic and social challenges of increasing food demand and rising competition for scarce resources securing a more efficient use of irrigation water becomes essential to face the reduction in water resources and the extreme weather due to climate change elliott et al 2014 tilman et al 2002 wallace 2000 non ionic surfactants surface active agents have been recently hypothesized as potential adjuvants for improving irrigation efficiency and agroecosystem sustainability baratella et al 2016 chaichi et al 2015 lehrsch et al 2011 surfactants or wetting agents are essentially long chain polymers of varying complexity with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail amphiphilic structure operating at air water or water solid interfaces by lowering the surface tension krogh et al 2003 there are four basic groups of surfactants according to the nature of their hydrophilic group anionic cationic non ionic and amphoteric non ionic surfactants traditionally used as pesticide adjuvants generally possess low potency to both terrestrial and aquatic organisms and are therefore preferred for agricultural applications bonnington 2003 krogh et al 2003 organosilicone surfactants fall within this category under aerobic conditions non ionic surfactants are easily biodegraded by microorganisms and are mineralised slowly in anaerobic conditions and when adsorbed to the soil minerals valoras et al 1976 ying 2006 during adsorption to clays and organic materials surfactants have direct effect on hydraulic soil properties by weakening the cohesive forces and allowing water to easily penetrate and wet the soil kuhnt 1993 wiel shafran et al 2006 therefore their use as adjuvants for irrigation in agronomic production can potentially improve irrigation use efficiency and crop quality by requiring less water capturing rainfall more effectively and reducing the nutrient losses through run off erosion or leaching cooley et al 2009 karagunduz et al 2001 starr et al 2005 previous attempts of surfactants application on water repellent soils as a mean to improve water penetration and preferential flows gave positive results feng et al 2002 müller and deurer 2011 oostindie et al 2008 on the contrary there are no clear findings on the potential improvement of water movements in hydrophilic soil this debate dates back to the 60s and researchers obtained contrasting results karagunduz et al 2015 krogh et al 2003 tumeo 1997 wiel shafran et al 2006 often these studies limited the experiments to a single application of the surfactant and different results might have been achieved by repeated administrations to allow the adsorption of the surfactant in the matrix mobbs et al 2012 feng et al 2002 from the agronomic perspective the addition of wetting agents to irrigation water may ultimately affect the transport and availability of water and nutrients to crops the potential effects of non ionic surfactants on plant uptake and growth have been poorly investigated so far with contrasting results mccauley 1993 evaluated the effect of a non ionic surfactant formulation on soybean glycine max l and found that both yields and irrigation efficiency increased with surfactant application in brumbaugh and peterson 2001 non ionic surfactants increased the growth of corn root inversely wolkowski et al 1985 have reported no effects on plant growth after surfactant application to corn zea mays l soybean wheat triticum aestivum l and potato solanum tuberosum l banks et al 2013 examined corn nutrient uptake in different soils observing no consistent surfactant effects baratella et al 2016 performed a first agronomic trial on lettuce testing a non ionic surfactant formulation 45 fatty acid ester 45 sorbitan sesquioctanoate and 10 propylene glycol as irrigation adjuvant the authors found a dose related contrasting effect of the formulation especially on roots growth with a strong interaction with the mineral n fertilization urea the recent work of chaichi et al 2015 investigated the addition of a non ionic surfactant to irrigation water in corn production under mediterranean climate observing an increase of the irrigation water use efficiency and consequently higher corn yield and dry matter these few studies available about the effects of non ionic surfactants on crop production give evidently contradictory information data are still lacking for assessing the potential of non ionic surfactants to increase water and nutrient use efficiency which would be of significant value in improving the sustainability of vegetable production systems the present study aims to investigate the effects of an innovative non ionic surfactant formulation i e an organosilicone surfactant on irrigation water use efficiency and nutrient uptake of lettuce in absence of fertilization the first objective was to design a rapid and robust laboratory method for assessing the surfactant properties in relation to the capillary adsorption which is of importance for comparative studies of surfactants in consideration of their use in soil from a practical standpoint there is still a lack of a feasible and rapid alternative to the costly direct measurements of soil hydraulic properties i e hydraulic conductivity capillary rise and sorptivity mingorance et al 2007 common drawback of using direct soil measurements for studies on surfactants is that since surfactants behave differently for any given soil types using measures from one type of soil to predict response on another soil is often inappropriate mingorance et al 2007 mobbs et al 2012 in the present study potential changes in the capillary mobility of water in soil induced by surfactants were conceptualized and simulated in laboratory by means of two rapid tests of capillary adsorption on standard porous media the second objective was to investigate the effect of non ionic organosilicone surfactants on the irrigation water use efficiency of crops and understand possible synergistic or antagonistic effects between the application of the surfactant and the nutrient uptake in absence of fertilization to this end a pot trial was carried out on lettuce administering an innovative organosilicone surfactant formulation by irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 organosilicone surfactants properties for evaluating the variation of water capillary movements induced by different organosilicone surfactants we tested four different eco friendly formulations i composition of polyether modified polysiloxanes concentration 75 100 ii composition of polyether modified trisiloxanes 75 100 iii polyether siloxane 50 75 iv composition of poly dimethylsiloxanes 10 25 data on their physicochemical properties are given in table 1 for the agronomic testing we selected and tested one surfactant formulation the polyether modified trisiloxane concentration 75 100 composed by 80 w w of heptamethyl trisiloxane and about 20 w w of polyether mono 2 propenyl ether this non ionic surfactant hereafter called pet belongs to the class of the polyether methyl siloxanes organosilicone polymers containing typically siosi bonds siloxanes data on the different physicochemical properties of pet are given in table 1 other organosilicone classes are volatile methylsiloxanes vms and polydimethylsiloxanes pdms organosilicone surfactants showed higher efficiency hill 2002 and lower environmental persistence and toxicity compared with other non ionic formulations indicating their higher potential for application to crop production bonnington 2003 fendinger et al 1997 stevens et al 2001 stevens 1995 indicated that organosilicone surfactants are rapidly adsorbed onto soil particles and then quickly inactivated by hydrolysis consequently when entering the soil environment these non ionic surfactants are expected to be either adsorbed to the soil or degraded not leaching to the groundwater krogh et al 2003 bonnington 2003 2 2 capillary mobility two rapid and robust tests on standard porous media were performed in the laboratory to assess potential changes in the capillary mobility of water in soil after application of organosilicone surfactants a newly designed capillary mobility test and a capillary rise test theoretical premise is that surfactants alter the capillary movement of water in soil with a magnitude that depends mainly on the fluid properties but that is affected to various extent by the specific physicochemical properties of the soil abu zreig et al 2003 karagunduz et al 2001 tumeo 1997 consequently in evaluating the potential of a specific surfactant it is unlikely that direct measurement of soil hydraulic properties will give reproducible values for comparative purposes mobbs et al 2012 to overcome this drawback we conceptualized at the laboratory scale the variation of water capillary movements induced by surfactant applications in soil in order to attribute them a magnitude irrespective of the soil peculiarities and reproducible with a certain accuracy our conceptual model in this first phase like many common models for water retention and matric potential in porous media relied on a simplified picture of the soil pore space as a bundle of cylindrical capillaries bcc models in which no distinction was made between the various mechanisms affecting water in porous matrices i e capillarity and surface adsorption the variation in water capillary mobility was estimated by a fast and accurate test on silica gel plates merck classical silica 60 tlc plates the sample solutions were organosilicone surfactants listed in table 1 dissolved in deionized water at concentration of 1 ml l 1 stained with 0 5 methylene blue solution the control was deionized water stained with 0 5 methylene blue solution after placing the plate over a graph paper on a flat surface a given volume of each solution was administered by dripping repeatedly with a pipette on a fixed point of the plate in the centre of the graph paper each solution ran a certain horizontal distance from the dripping point namely the distance of capillary adsorption after 60 s the stained outermost edge of the advancing liquid was marked and using the graph paper divisions the radius of the adsorption spot was measured with an accuracy of 0 1 cm and recorded changes in the capillary distance were assessed by measuring the spots radii after administering 100 μl 250 μl and 500 μl of solution in 3 replicates the percentage decrease in capillary mobility d at the ith time is defined as d d c d s 100 d c where dc and ds are the mean radii of the control and the sample spots respectively precision and uncertainty of the method were assessed through repeatability and within laboratory reproducibility tests eurachem 1998 iso 13528 2005 repeatability was evaluated by replicating the test n 3 on 1 ml l 1solutions of 4 different organo modified polysiloxanes n 12 the intra laboratory reproducibility was assessed by replicating the test in different days and with different operators n 24 hanneman 2008 iso 13528 2005 iso jcgm 100 2008 2008 to not account for the difference between samples as a component of the method precision the pooled relative standard deviation prsd was calculated for the decrease in capillary mobility expressed as the radii of the control and the sample spots in mm dc and ds respectively iso jcgm 100 2008 2008 kessel 2002 magnusson et al 2011 uncertainty of these measurements was calculated by multiplying the standard deviation of the mean by student s t factor for the respective degrees of freedom at 95 confidence level t95 11 2 201 and t95 23 2 069 iso jcgm 100 2008 2008 kessel 2002 the variation in capillary rise of the soil surfactant system was estimated by a classic thin layer chromatography tlc on silica gel plates merck classical silica 60 tlc plates testing two concentrations of the organosilicone surfactants at 1 ml l 1 s1 0 and 0 5 ml l 1 s0 5 in deionized water stained with 0 5 methylene blue solution the control was deionized water stained with 0 5 methylene blue solution the height of the mobile phase namely the height of capillary rise capillary height ch was measured after a given time of 8 min 5 s in three replicates per each treatment 2 3 agronomic trial the agronomic testing was carried out by applying pet as the selected surfactant formulation treatments were set up in plastic pots of 1 l capacity the pots were filled with a non fertilized silty loam soil as growing medium in addition to a single layer of expanded clay at the base to improve drainage the silty loam soil silt 47 6 sand 24 4 loam 28 was air dried for 24 h and passed through a 5 mm sieve before lightly packing the pots its main chemical physical properties were determined according to the italian official methods for soil analysis 1999 and presented in table 2 lettuce seedlings lactuca sativa cv iceberg were grown in the same growing medium non fertilized silty loam soil before being transplanted into the pots the plantlets were transplanted 1 plant per pot at about 6 cm high 3 fully expanded leaves and then placed in a climate chamber under 12 12 ld photoperiod and 70 80 relative humidity at 24 c and 18 c light and dark temperature respectively for 24 days lettuce plantlets were irrigated manually with 50 ml of water on alternate days strictly avoiding subirrigation to evaluate the effect of organosilicones as irrigation adjuvants we assessed the lettuce ability to utilize water and soil nutrient sources in relation to the addition of pet to irrigation water to modulate its use for a sustainable crop production we assessed the effectiveness of 2 different pet concentrations spanning the range of probable agronomic doses 0 1 1 0 ml l 1 according to the literature the adjuvant was therefore administered at 1 ml l 1 s1 0 and 0 2 ml l 1 s0 2 in deionized water and in 2 applications in order to i verify eventual phytotoxic effects of the higher dose 1 ml l 1 ii identify a minimum effective dose at which the adjuvant application is still agronomically significant the treatments were control deionized water pet treatment at 0 2 ml l 1 two applications at 0 and 10 days from transplanting and pet treatment at 1 ml l 1 two applications at 0 and 10 days from transplanting the mineral composition of the pet solution is given in table 3 the experiment was arranged in a complete randomized block design in five replicates 1 soil 2 1 untreated surfactant applications 5 replicates the pots were periodically randomly rotated to a different position within the block for the duration of the trial manual weeding was undertaken when required at harvest 24 days from transplanting all the plants were collected and separated into epigeic fraction stems and leaves and ipogeic fraction roots the roots were separated from soil particles by manual washing with deionized water providing adequate time for complete drying at room temperature prior to weighing the following data were collected

plants irrigated with water howell 2003 chaichi et al 2015 to perform the nutrient analysis the epigeic biomass of lettuce was dried at 80 c for 48 h and ground in a wiley mill to pass through a 20 mesh screen the samples were prepared by dry ashing the grounded plant tissue at 400 c for 24 h then by dissolving 1 g of the ash in 1 25 hcl isaac et al 1998 the samples were then analysed by an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrophotometer icp aes iris thermo optek milano italy for the determination of the following macro and micronutrients p k ca mg na fe mn zn cu al b cd cr pb and

coefficient of variations prsd of surfactant solutions ranged from 1 42 to 5 60 for intra day assays and from 3 56 to 5 87 for inter day assays table 5 in both cases the prsd values decreased with increasing pipetting volumes of organosilicone solutions overall the different organosilicone solutions at the agronomic dose of 1 ml l 1 showed a reduction of the capillary adsorption 20 50 p 0 001 hsd tukey with higher adsorption values for polyether polysiloxanes concentration 75 100 and lower values for poly dimethylsiloxanes concentration 10 25 the intra day prsd of the control solution of deionized water varied from 2 02 to 5 92 and inter days prsd varied from 5 58 to 5 87 without a clear trend in relation to the pipetting volumes table 5 the uncertainty of measurements is presented in table 5 results indicate a good accuracy the uncertainty of repeatability was generally higher than the uncertainty of reproducibility due to the subjectivity of the operators the differences in capillary mobility between the control and the samples were always highly significant table 5 overall the variation range reported for repeatability reproducibility and uncertainty of measurements was satisfactory and indicated a good precision of the method regarding the vertical capillary mobility the surfactant solutions showed a decrease of the capillary rise from 1 37 to 4 24 compared to pure water proportionally to the surfactant concentration fig 3 there were significant differences in the height of capillary rise cr between the control cr cnt 8 72 0 07 cm and the surfactant solutions at

parameters of lettuce except for dm and ldw which decreased compared to the control these trends were significant between the treatments and the control for sla ldw and dm p 0 05 whilst there were no relevant differences between the two treatments pet application at 0 2 and 1 0 ml l 1 table 6 the addition of pet to irrigation water caused a reduction of epigeic dm of more than one percentage point

p 0 05 the effect of pet on the ipogeic biomass of lettuce was significant for rd p 0 01 and rs p 0 05 and translated into a decrease of 40 on average hsd tukey table 6 in pet treated lettuce data on lettuce fresh yield indicated significant improvements of both the irrigation water use efficiency iwuef p 0 05 and the adjuvant productivity index ipf p 0 001 table 7 specifically iwuef increased by around 69 p 0 05 and ipf increased 12 26 percentage points with surfactant treatment at 0 2 ml l 1 p 0 05 and 1 0 ml l 1 p 0 001 respectively hsd tukey regarding the nutrient uptake the concentration of p k mg and ca of the aboveground biomass of lettuce was significantly affected by the application of the surfactant table 8 the main effect of pet was a decrease in the elemental concentration for p ca and mg and an increase of k compared to the control in the case of p and mg it is observed a decrease in concentration when pet is administered at the lower dose with a certain recovery as the surfactant dose increases among micronutrients cu and zn concentration significantly decreased in the pet treated lettuce table 8 since the nutrient analysis indicated the elemental concentration of the lettuce biomass expressing solely the amount of nutrient taken up from the soil we further analysed the nutritional data by using bi dimensional vector plots which allowed to investigate the ability of the crop to utilize efficiently the nutrients to grow and give yield fig 4 the vector analysis showed an enhanced nutrient availability and or uptake for p and k fig 4 a and at the higher dose of surfactant application for the micronutrient b we found a better nutrient use efficiency for mg mn and ca fig 4 a and for the micronutrients cu zn ni fig 4 b specifically the concentration and the total content of mg ca and among micronutrients cu declined while plant weight increased indicating a more efficient use of these nutrients in plants irrigated with the surfactant solution the lower dose of pet 0 2 ml l 1 increased the use efficiency also for the micronutrients zn and ni the concentration of mn both pet doses b lower pet dose zn and ni higher pet dose declined while the total content increased with a corresponding increasing of the plant weight in this case the uptake or availability is considered equal between plants irrigated with the surfactant solution and plants irrigated with water alone since the differences in concentration and content were a result of the increased plant weight as special case among micronutrients the application of the higher dose of surfactant 1 0 ml l 1 enhanced strongly the availability and or the uptake of cr fig 4 b the nitrogen content ntot and use efficiency nue for the lettuce whole plant and for the aboveground biomass are reported in table 9 the pet addition to irrigation water did not affect significantly the uptake of n table 9 leading to a weak increase of the nitrogen content both for the lettuce whole plant and the aboveground biomass nonetheless data showed a significant trend towards higher nue values in pet treated lettuce compared to the control table 9 few trials in literature have examined the use efficiency of nitrogen in all its aspects and to this end we determined also the n recovery rec separately for the epigeic and ipogeic biomass of lettuce results reported in fig 5 indicated a positive effect of the surfactant on the ability of lettuce to take up and translocate n from the soil in fact the application of pet increased the recovery of nitrogen in the epigeic biomass from 7 45 of the control to 10 12 and 9 24 of pet treatments at 0 2 and 1 0 ml l 1 respectively p 0 05 in parallel rec values decreased significantly in the root biomass of lettuce from 3 34 of the control to 2 03 p 01 and 1 80 p 0 01 of pet treatments at 0 2 and 1 0 ml l 1 respectively hsd tukey to further investigate these results we plotted the n data of the epigeic biomass against changes in lettuce growth fig 5 this vector analysis clearly showed higher n concentration and content of the pet treated lettuce which was related proportionally to the increase of plant weight 4 discussion 4 1 capillary properties disclosing the properties of a surfactant relative to capillarity and adsorption is fundamental for screening among different formulations in consideration of their use in soil the first objective of the present study was to assess the potential effect of organosilicone surfactants as irrigation adjuvants in relation to the water capillary adsorption by means of two rapid and robust tests on standard porous media a newly designed capillary mobility test and a capillary rise test the capillary mobility method we developed was found to be precise and with a good degree of reproducibility of results table 5 and it can be effectively applied to all surfactants as agricultural adjuvants organosilicones alcohol ethoxylates sorbitans etc results showed that the addition of organosilicones to water caused a reduction of the horizontal capillary mobility compared to pure water table 4 likewise tlc analysis showed a decrease of the capillary rise of surfactant solutions fig 3 we found that the decrease in water capillary mobility was dependent on surfactant type and concentration and in no relation to the volume of solution administered to the porous medium fig 2 this phenomenon was consistent with the surfactant induced decrease of the surface tension which appears to be a linear function of surfactant concentration until micelles begin to form below the critical micelle concentration cmc both the surface tension of water and the contact angle between solid and aqueous phases decrease with increasing surfactant concentration karagunduz et al 2001 when idealizing the water penetration into unsaturated porous media bcc models the capillary driven flow is expressed by the young laplace eq 1 which relates the capillary pressure pc or pressure difference δp air pressure pa minus water pressure pw required for water entry into a characteristic pore radius r to the interfacial tension liquid gas γ and the contact angle liquid solid θ 1 p c δ p p a p w 2 γ c o s θ r where r cosθ is the interfacial radius of curvature meniscus of the gas liquid interface as described by 1 in 3 phases gas liquid solid when water comes in contact with a capillary the adhesive forces liquid solid short range london van der waal s forces that act over a few molecular layers combined with the cohesive force among water molecules at the gas liquid interface creates a capillary pressure pc vacuum between water and air which causes the fluid to enter the pore network this pressure difference produces a concave interfacial curvature at the gas liquid interface with a lower water potential or negative hydrostatic pressure called matric potential μ that when expressed per unit volume of water can be considered equal to the water pressure pc pw μ the surface tension of pure water γ 72 86 mn m 1 at 20 c is inversely related to the temperature t dy dt 0 138 mn m 1 and increases with decreasing liquid pressure allowing capillary pressure to increase for a constant pore radius if we neglect gravitation the rate of capillary adsorption ν in meso and micropores i e the soil capillary water is theoretically given by hagen poiseuille 2 where x distance of adsorption η liquid viscosity 2 v d x d t δ p r 2 8 η x at longer times the capillary wetting process can be described by both the poiseuille and laplace equations by the lucas washburn equation 3 that describes the liquid penetration into a horizontal capillary matthews et al 2008 smith and gillham 1999 3 x r t γ c o s θ 2 η the eq 3 was used by many researchers to describe wetting of porous media even though it does not always apply to water penetration into porous networks matthews et al 2008 the bosanquet eq 4 describes the inertial flow of individual wetting events at short time intervals with advancing wetting of small volume entering a capillary tube equation is simplified as there is no applied external pressure at the entrance of the capillary tube in this equation in contrast to the lucas washburn equation the distance travelled by inertial flow is independent of viscosity but inversely related to the radius of the pore and the fluid density ρ 4 x 2 γ c o s θ r ρ t in simpler words according to the equations above the capillary pressure and the distance of adsorption are linear functions of the surface tension in this simplified model lowering the surface tension of a fluid will always lead to a proportional reduction of its capillary mobility as verified by our laboratory tests some authors hypothesized that this mode of action should theoretically increase the hydraulic conductivity in a soil water system karagunduz et al 2001 moore et al 2010 tumeo 1997 nonetheless direct measurements of soil hydraulic properties often reported a decrease in hydraulic conductivity after the application of non ionic surfactants karagunduz et al 2015 mobbs et al 2012 in literature when using direct measurements both an increase and a decrease in soil water content are reported as the main effect of surfactant application karagunduz et al 2001 oostindie et al 2008 and similarly the capillary rise in soil columns was found either to decrease significantly wiel shafran et al 2006 or to not change at all mobbs et al 2012 in agreement with wiel shafran et al 2006 in our idealized system organosilicones showed to decrease water capillary movements in porous media but also spread readily outward from the dripping point indicating a higher wetting power compared to the pure water fig 7 the condition for water to wet and spread on a surface is that the adhesive forces exceed the cohesive forces within the bulk water we can explain our results considering that surfactant hydrophilic head bonds strongly with water while its tail adsorbs to surfaces such as silica air molecules in pores or in soil clay minerals and hydrophobic organic substances kuhnt 1993 mobbs et al 2012 tumeo 1997 the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces during adsorption of surfactant solutions most likely determined the degree of wetting and the effects on capillarity the adsorption of organosilicones at the liquid solid interface produced a decrease in the surfactant concentration at the wetting front of the advancing film and this surface tension gradient enhanced the movement of water to the wetting front fig 8 rosen and kunjappu 2012 reported this phenomenon as a superspreading or superwetting ability verified for some trisiloxane surfactants similarly the innermost adsorption spot which was formed by dripping on silica plates fig 7 was probably caused by transient drainage and rewetting events behind the leading edge of the wetting front henry and smith 2006 the greater water pressure in the system affected the hydraulic gradient inducing water fluxes within the solute front from the source at higher surfactant concentration lower surface tension higher soil water pressure toward cleaner regions higher surface tension lower soil water pressure fig 8 the rate of water movement should therefore increase with increasing difference in capillary pressures i e linearly with surfactant concentration and not with the volume of solution administered as verified in our experiments the carrying of water energized by surface tension gradients is a phenomenon known as the marangoni effect gibbs marangoni flow a tangential force that arises from a momentum transfer and results in a faster extensive desaturation of the porous medium than expected by standard continuum models of flow and transport the marangoni effect is often associated with temperature gradients that alter the surface tension and concentration gradients due to solute displacement microbial growth and or biosurfactants production henry et al 2002 henry and smith 2006 smith and gillham 1999 transferring these results to the field it is presumable that the application of organosilicones as irrigation adjuvants can cause temporal changes in the diffusional capacity of the circulating solution and in the nutrients pathway proportionally to the strength and concentration of the surfactant as long as we refer to capillary water organosilicones should reduce the upward capillary movements of water in soil preventing evaporation loss and improve the wetting and rewetting of soil superspreading effect similarly to what hypothesized for rhizosphere biosurfactants read et al 2003 the gradient of capillary pressure extending from the point of irrigation into the bulk soil may displace water and therefore nutrients and draw them from smaller soil pores than would otherwise be not accessible to roots 4 2 agronomic performances we performed an agronomic testing on one selected surfactant formulation the pet polyether modified trisiloxane biometric parameters of lettuce yield indicated a positive main effect of pet in terms of leaf area and dry weight and a slight trend for higher aboveground biomass production compared to the control table 6 the application of pet caused a significant increase of sla and a decrease of ldw of lettuce leaves which are key variables related to the physiological processes of biomass production from freshly allocated assimilates hodgson et al 2011 poorter and de jong 1999 the reduction of ldw and the increase of sla constitute per se a notable index of the surfactant positive effects on growth response and quality of lettuce these parameters are in fact function of leaf dry matter and leaf thickness and for this reason are often used as index of schlerophylly in general ldw and sla are very sensitive to plant nitrogen status light climate and several other stresses species in permanently or temporarily resource rich environments tend on average to have a lower ldw and a higher sla than those in resource poor environments similarly high ldw species generally have high values for dm high concentrations of cell walls and secondary compounds and greater leaf and root longevity conservation of acquired resources for review see poorter and de jong 1999 vile et al 2005 in our specific case on the basis of the biometric and nutritional data obtained we can safely interpret the decreasing of ldw and the increasing of sla as the outcome of an improvement in the processes of resource acquisition from soil the use of pet determined a significant decrease in the dm of the aboveground biomass given the negligible variation of the lettuce dry weight this reduction of epigeic dm should be related to the marked increase of the fresh weight observed in the pet treated lettuce results indicated also a slight trend for higher biomass production in pet treated lettuce compared to the untreated control expressed as both fresh and dry weight table 6 regarding the belowground biomass a significant reduction of about 40 was observed for both the root dry weight and the root shoot ratio table 6 our results were in agreement with parr and norman 1964 but in contrast with the observation made by brumbaugh and peterson 2001 in literature few reports of surfactant effects on plants dealt with root development and growth since most works have focused only on aboveground vegetative development although the patterns of biomass allocation to roots can be sometimes contradictory in our specific case the higher proportional distribution of biomass in lettuce leaves than in shoots should directly translate to a higher uptake rate of soil resources i e water and nutrients since this was a non fertilized trial the differential uptake of nutrients from the soil must be referred to the ability of the plant to utilize the soil as a limited nutrient source to grow and give yield the nutrient analysis showed a general trend toward a reduction in the elemental concentration of lettuce epigeic tissue significant for p mg and ca and for cu and zn among micronutrients table 8 with the only exception of k however these differences in the nutrient concentration were proportionally related to the increase of the lettuce biomass after normalization data showed higher uptake availability and or translocation for p k and b in pet treated lettuce compared to the control higher content and concentration fig 4 this result is of particular value since the low availability and restricted transport of p commonly limit plant growth the beneficial effect of surfactants on increasing the availability of phosphorus is further supported by considering that among several mechanisms developed by plants to survive in phosphorus deficient soils there is also the exudation of biosurfactants via root mucigel read et al 2003 in a study on maize lupin and wheat root exudation evaluated the effect of phospholipids naturally found in the mucilage on selected soil properties even at low concentration the authors observed a considerable reduction of the surface tension of soil solution and reported a decrease of the amount of phosphate adsorbed in soil and a simultaneous increase of p concentration in solution by 10 on the other hand the increased assimilation of cr in pet treated lettuce highlights the uptake of unwanted elements from potentially contaminated soils as the possible main drawback baratella et al 2016 the system was characterized by the increase of the nutrient use efficiency for ca cu ni and zn which means a higher production with less nutritional adsorption reduced content and concentration with increase in lettuce growth fig 4 on the other hand the uptake or availability of fe mg and mn can be considered equal between plants irrigated with pet and plants irrigated with water fig 4 these results are partially in line with baratella et al 2016 which however highlighted a dose related detrimental effect of their non ionic formulation in absence of n fertilization regarding nitrogen utilization in our trial the application of pet led to a weak and not significant increase of the n content both for the lettuce whole plant and for the aboveground biomass table 9 however to better highlight any synergistic or antagonistic effect of the surfactant on nitrogen we analysed separately the two main components of the nutrient efficiency the n uptake efficiency rec which is the ability of crops to take up n from the soil and the n use efficiency nue that is the efficiency with which crops use the absorbed n to grow and give yield benincasa et al 2011 despite the absence of fertilization the application of pet led to higher concentration and content of nitrogen against changes in plant weight the nue values of pet treated lettuce increased significantly 5 13 percentage points for the whole plant and 3 15 percentage points for the epigeic biomass table 9 the surfactant gave positive results also on the ability of lettuce to take up n from the soil since the recovery of nitrogen in the epigeic biomass increased by 2 25 on average fig 5 the increased uptake of soil n could be related to the higher relative growth rates and lower dry matter content of leaf tissues in pet treated lettuce tittonell et al 2000 so far relatively little information was available on the effect of surfactants on crops n uptake and use our evidences are in agreement with arriaga et al 2009 which reported an improvement in the apparent n recovery for fertilized potatoes given by the increase in tuber n uptake and in petiole no3 concentrations the authors measured also a consistently lower no3 n concentration in soil and the trend toward a lower soil nh4 n concentration associated with a reduction in leaching and speculated it was the result of an increase in plant n use an alternative hypothesis is given by read et al 2003 which reported that lecithin a phospholipid surfactant of the root mucigel reduced the rate of n mineralisation in soil possibly through a direct effect on the microbial population we couldn t carry out soil analysis at the end of the agronomic trial to shed light on this hypothesis but nonetheless similarly to p and k our results on n may be indicative of a synergistic effect of the surfactant on plant nutrition which as previously reported should be explicated through the enhancing of the availability in soil of these nutrients of their uptake by the root or both fig 6 in this regard the comparative analysis of rec between aboveground and belowground biomass gave us some insight into the probable effect of pet also on nitrogen translocation in fact following the application of pet the recovery of nitrogen increased in the epigeic biomass and in parallel decreased in the root system fig 5 the phenomenon observed suggested the existence of a possible augmenting mechanism also for the nutrient transport via xylematic flow in need of verification by further experimental studies regarding the effect of pet on water uptakes data on lettuce fresh yield showed a particularly high increase of the irrigation use efficiency table 7 the irrigation use efficiency i e the ability of the plant to utilize water to grow increased 77 60 percentage points the adjuvant productivity which express the variation of the lettuce yield due to the application of the surfactant increased 12 26 percentage points with surfactant treatments at 0 2 ml l 1 and 1 0 ml l 1 respectively these findings are consistent with our nutritional data and can be explained considering that the driving forces for solute movement towards the roots are mainly the formation of a depleted zone at the roots interface and the diffusion of water and nutrients towards this zone jungk 1996 in agreement with our results chaichi et al 2015 which investigated the application of a non ionic surfactant on corn under limited irrigation reported the increase of the irrigation water use efficiency based on total dry matter and grain yield by 9 5 and 14 4 respectively additional data showing similar trends were obtained by few recent studies on deficit irrigation strategies implemented with the use of non ionic surfactants to improve water use efficiency in arid and semi arid regions chaichi et al 2017 madsen et al 2016 4 2 1 effect on water and nutrient availability in soil in a soil profile the dominant mechanisms of nutrient transport in soil are diffusion through water films at the micro scale a few pores and convection through water flow at the macro scale from mm to m on the base of our preliminary laboratory tests on standard porous media we hypothesized that the application of pet lowering the surface tension of the soil solution can enhance the transport of solutes especially of immobile elements such as p and k and trace nutrients towards the root surface by affecting water flow and diffusion along the concentration gradient jungk 1996 to improve our mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon we should consider the physics behind the movement of an air water interface in soil the aggregation of particles and irregular mineral surfaces in soil results in angular pore spaces which form a variety of air water and solid water configurations and show a peculiar liquid behaviour during water displacement compared to the bcc model the angular cross sections determine capillary processes while adsorption processes dominate the internal surface areas tuller et al 1999 therefore in unsaturated soils water is held in corners and pits by capillary forces as small liquid bodies and is adsorbed as thin films on solid surfaces by means of various types of long and short range surface forces if the two phases water and air are in mutual equilibrium adsorbed water films can occur when δp 2γ r under these conditions the water retained by capillarity in angularities coexists with adsorbed films at near zero matric potentials soil water distribution is dominated by capillary forces in pores but at lower matric potentials the water retained in angularities become discontinuous and the hydraulic behaviour is controlled for a large extent by the network of interconnected adsorbed films tokunaga 2009 because of the relatively large surface area of soil at low potentials practically all the hydraulic resistance resides within adsorbed films tokunaga 2009 and therefore the interfacial forces are likely to play a larger role in solute transport and biological activity than predicted by the conventional bcc model tuller and or 2001 several models have been developed for describing the hydraulic properties of soil capillary pores and interspersed thin films tokunaga 2011 and references therein tuller et al 1999 and subsequent papers considered both adsorptive and capillary mechanisms using a combination of the conventional young laplace equation for the capillary pressure of water menisci in angular pores and of the disjoining pressure derjaguin 1987 for coexisting thin water films in the approach of tuller et al 1999 the contribution of adsorptive forces i e the thickness h μ of adsorbed films lining soil internal surfaces and the contribution of capillary forces i e the liquid elements with radius of interface curvature r μ are considered separately as functions of the matric potential μ the meniscus radius r μ for the capillary water in unsaturated conditions is given by the young laplace eq 1 the thickness h μ of the thin liquid films adsorbed on the surface of angular pores and confined by the vapor phase is calculated as 5 h μ a s v l 6 π ρ μ 3 where asvl is the hamaker constant it summarizes the interactions between solid surface and gas through a liquid film asvl 6 10 20 j for water on silicate surfaces eq 5 represents the simplest form of liquid adsorption on solid surfaces considering van der waals forces only derjaguin 1987 but the hamaker effective value of 6 0 10 20 j defined by tuller et al 1999 and widely accepted in the literature accounts for both van der waals and ionic electrostatic forces as pointed out by tokunaga 2011 given the eq 5 the average film thickness is predicted to increase with the matric potential μ at relatively wet conditions the so called field capacity μ 10 to 30 j kg 1 the thickness of water film on a smooth mineral surface is about 10 nm or et al 2007 in unsaturated macropores measurements on rough mineral surfaces showed significant surface film flows for near zero matric potentials 0 250 j kg 1 with an average film thicknesses from 2 to 70 μm comparable to local surface roughness tokunaga 2009 according to the model of tuller et al 1999 and or et al 2007 we can calculate the effective film thickness h μ available for water and nutrient transport as the average cross sectional amount of liquid associated with films adsorbed on flat mineral surfaces and films internal to angularities by 6 6 h μ h μ β l 2 l cos α 2 r μ tan α 2 l β tan α 2 in eq 6 h μ is the thickness of the adsorbed film expressed by eq 5 and r μ is the radius of interface curvature given by eq 1 β l and γ are geometric parameters of the surface modelling it is now clear that the interaction of surfactants with the soil structure could affect the soil hydraulic behaviour by multiple possible mechanisms operating simultaneously and with counteracting effects the scaling relations show that lowering the interfacial tension decreases the radius of curvature of liquid elements r μ increases the effective film thickness h μ and causes the existence of adsorbed films under lower magnitude δp or higher magnitude μ conversely the effect of the contact angle decrease θ or increase in wettability leads to higher δp values though with lower magnitude of variation and greatest uncertainty kim et al 2012 from eq 6 as the matric potential increases the r μ and the film thickness h μ increase with counteracting effects on h μ however the increase of matric potential expressed by h μ dominates over meniscus changes in determining the final effect on the effective film thickness the conceptual model proposed here is that according to the eqs 1 and 5 the pet induced reduction of the surface tension led to a combined effect of decreasing the liquid air interfacial radii of curvature and thickening the adsorbed films in simpler words as the radius of curvature associated with capillarity in pores decreased with liquid elements receding deeper into pores because of the reduction of the capillary pressure the thickness and the connectivity of the water films adsorbed on all planar surfaces i e the effective film thickness h μ expressed by eq 6 increased the primary conceptual steps of our model are illustrated in fig 9 the μ dependent thickness of these thin nanometer to micrometer conductive water films strongly affected water and chemical transport in soil at medium and low saturations over many orders of magnitude in length scale the augmentative effect of pet on h μ was further enhanced by the peculiar superspreading ability of trisiloxanes which showed a greater adsorption at the liquid solid interface of the wetting front especially on hydrophobic areas over soil particle surfaces fig 7 and contributed to extend and improve the network of interconnected adsorbed films tokunaga 2009 then the surfactant induced capillary pressure gradient towards the wetting front increased the infiltration of water i e the wettability and the drainage and rewetting events in the immediate vicinity of the roots allowed a faster continuous replenishment of nutrients in the depletion zone silber et al 2003 4 2 2 effect on root uptake the improvement of the root uptake can be explained assuming that pet behaved on the surface area of the root hairs similarly to what already verified in studying non ionic surfactants penetration at the foliar and cuticular level fernández and eichert 2009 and references therein specifically organosilicones are generally reported to promote stomatal infiltration by significantly lowering the surface tension but there is also evidence that they can also affect the diffusion of substances through the plasma membrane and the cuticle it is now recognized that non ionic surfactants and biosurfactants can form channels through lipid membranes schlieper and de robertis 1977 and cause a more efficient uptake of chemicals than allowed by the facilitated stomatal diffusion read et al 2003 fernández and eichert 2009 one possible explanation is that non ionic surfactants exert a concentration dependent effect on cell permeability increasing water diffusion and ion flow through the membrane lipid bilayer and consequently acting as absorption enhancers in this regard the identification of the optimal surfactant concentration together with the choice of the formulation are of paramount importance in our opinion to obtain nutrient solutions capable of enhancing ion transport while causing no side effects baratella et al 2016 in fact non ionic surfactants similarly to anionic and cationic surfactants form molecular aggregates or micelles when the concentration exceeds a critical level in aqueous solutions cmc critical micelle concentration so that their characteristic properties are markedly changed krogh et al 2003 first found in 1970 on beet tissues haapala 1970 and then widely confirmed in the literature the micelles of a surfactant above the cmc can complex with the globular lipoprotein units of the outermost plasma layer of plant cells and solubilize the plasmalemma with leakage of ions and sugars conversely at concentrations lower than the cmc there was an enhanced retention of solutes in vegetable tissue haapala 1970 fernández and eichert 2009 failure to consider these factors may have led to the many inconsistencies currently found in the literature when studying the agronomic efficacy of these kind of adjuvants 5 conclusion the pets seem to represent an advantageous agronomic innovation for irrigation in order to reduce water and nutritional inputs at the same time guaranteeing adequate crop production and quality when entering the soil environment at safe agronomic doses organosilicones are expected to be adsorbed in the first centimetres of the soil thickness not leaching to the groundwater and to cause temporal changes in the diffusional capacity of soil water and nutrient proportionally to their strength and concentration decreasing the capillary water movements pets would reduce both water evaporation loss upwards movements facilitate the wetting and rewetting of soil superspreading effect improving the water use efficiency and finally crops nutrient availability according to the theoretical model provided the administration of pet as irrigation adjuvant reducing the interfacial tension decreased the radius of curvature of liquid elements in soil pores at the same time increasing the matric potential pet increased the thickness of the network of adsorbed liquid films i e the effective film thickness h μ furthermore for a given pore space geometry adsorbed films occurred under lower magnitude δp or at less negative chemical potentials i e in more wet conditions because of the relatively large surface area of soil the contribution of liquid films dominates interfacial forces and can strongly affect water and chemical transport in soil at medium and low saturations over many orders of magnitude in length scale tokunaga 2009 therefore the formation of thicker adsorbed water films which were determined primarily by the increase of the matric potential supported larger water diffusion rates and likely played a primary role in nutrient transport we can reasonably infer that the augmentative effect of pet on h μ was further enhanced by the peculiar superspreading or superwetting ability of trisiloxanes which improved the connectivity of water films along the gradient of capillary pressure from the point of irrigation into the depletion zone also drawing water and therefore nutrients from smaller soil pores than would otherwise be not accessible to roots overall our experiments provide a first evidence that organosilicones as irrigation adjuvant can significantly affect the chemical and physical environment of the rhizosphere and the ecophysiology of crops modifying solutes availability and hydraulic conductivity and improving the uptake and use efficiency of water and nutrients organosilicone surfactants could therefore represent a valid agronomic innovation to reduce inputs and improve the sustainability of vegetable production systems 
11449,in a time of resource reduction and climate variability water conservation is critical to improve agroecosystem sustainability non ionic surfactants were recently hypothesized as irrigation adjuvants but so far researchers obtained contrasting results the first objective of this work was to evaluate the capillary adsorption properties of organosilicone surfactants by providing two robust tests on standard porous media results showed smaller capillary mobility and higher wetting power superspreading compared to pure water an innovative non ionic surfactant formulation the organosilicone pet polyether modified trisiloxane was then investigated as irrigation adjuvant in a pot trial on lettuce in absence of fertilization overall the system was characterized by an improvement in the processes of resource acquisition i e water and nutrients results indicated higher lettuce leaf area reduced root dry weight and root shoot ratio and a positive main effect on the uptake availability and or use efficiency of p k and some micronutrients the n use efficiency and recovery increased 3 15 with higher n concentration and content against changes in plant weight fresh yield data showed a particularly high irrigation use efficiency 77 60 and the adjuvant productivity variation of lettuce yield due to pet increased by 12 26 our experimental findings can be explained by hypothesizing that pet affected both capillary and adsorption processes during water diffusion along concentration gradients which constitute the main driving force for solutes movement towards the roots a theoretical model is provided to explain how pet improved the thickening and interconnection of conductive adsorbed water film in soil keywords lettuce nitrogen use efficiency soil capillary model non ionic surfactants climate smart agriculture matric potential sustainability 1 introduction globally agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of freshwater used mainly for irrigation fao 2016 fischer et al 2007 however the water withdrawal for irrigation largely exceeds the crop requirements fao 2016 knox et al 2012 in a time in which the demand for water is increasing at a rate twice that of population growth fao 2016 gil and kamanda 2015 agriculture is called to meet the economic and social challenges of increasing food demand and rising competition for scarce resources securing a more efficient use of irrigation water becomes essential to face the reduction in water resources and the extreme weather due to climate change elliott et al 2014 tilman et al 2002 wallace 2000 non ionic surfactants surface active agents have been recently hypothesized as potential adjuvants for improving irrigation efficiency and agroecosystem sustainability baratella et al 2016 chaichi et al 2015 lehrsch et al 2011 surfactants or wetting agents are essentially long chain polymers of varying complexity with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail amphiphilic structure operating at air water or water solid interfaces by lowering the surface tension krogh et al 2003 there are four basic groups of surfactants according to the nature of their hydrophilic group anionic cationic non ionic and amphoteric non ionic surfactants traditionally used as pesticide adjuvants generally possess low potency to both terrestrial and aquatic organisms and are therefore preferred for agricultural applications bonnington 2003 krogh et al 2003 organosilicone surfactants fall within this category under aerobic conditions non ionic surfactants are easily biodegraded by microorganisms and are mineralised slowly in anaerobic conditions and when adsorbed to the soil minerals valoras et al 1976 ying 2006 during adsorption to clays and organic materials surfactants have direct effect on hydraulic soil properties by weakening the cohesive forces and allowing water to easily penetrate and wet the soil kuhnt 1993 wiel shafran et al 2006 therefore their use as adjuvants for irrigation in agronomic production can potentially improve irrigation use efficiency and crop quality by requiring less water capturing rainfall more effectively and reducing the nutrient losses through run off erosion or leaching cooley et al 2009 karagunduz et al 2001 starr et al 2005 previous attempts of surfactants application on water repellent soils as a mean to improve water penetration and preferential flows gave positive results feng et al 2002 müller and deurer 2011 oostindie et al 2008 on the contrary there are no clear findings on the potential improvement of water movements in hydrophilic soil this debate dates back to the 60s and researchers obtained contrasting results karagunduz et al 2015 krogh et al 2003 tumeo 1997 wiel shafran et al 2006 often these studies limited the experiments to a single application of the surfactant and different results might have been achieved by repeated administrations to allow the adsorption of the surfactant in the matrix mobbs et al 2012 feng et al 2002 from the agronomic perspective the addition of wetting agents to irrigation water may ultimately affect the transport and availability of water and nutrients to crops the potential effects of non ionic surfactants on plant uptake and growth have been poorly investigated so far with contrasting results mccauley 1993 evaluated the effect of a non ionic surfactant formulation on soybean glycine max l and found that both yields and irrigation efficiency increased with surfactant application in brumbaugh and peterson 2001 non ionic surfactants increased the growth of corn root inversely wolkowski et al 1985 have reported no effects on plant growth after surfactant application to corn zea mays l soybean wheat triticum aestivum l and potato solanum tuberosum l banks et al 2013 examined corn nutrient uptake in different soils observing no consistent surfactant effects baratella et al 2016 performed a first agronomic trial on lettuce testing a non ionic surfactant formulation 45 fatty acid ester 45 sorbitan sesquioctanoate and 10 propylene glycol as irrigation adjuvant the authors found a dose related contrasting effect of the formulation especially on roots growth with a strong interaction with the mineral n fertilization urea the recent work of chaichi et al 2015 investigated the addition of a non ionic surfactant to irrigation water in corn production under mediterranean climate observing an increase of the irrigation water use efficiency and consequently higher corn yield and dry matter these few studies available about the effects of non ionic surfactants on crop production give evidently contradictory information data are still lacking for assessing the potential of non ionic surfactants to increase water and nutrient use efficiency which would be of significant value in improving the sustainability of vegetable production systems the present study aims to investigate the effects of an innovative non ionic surfactant formulation i e an organosilicone surfactant on irrigation water use efficiency and nutrient uptake of lettuce in absence of fertilization the first objective was to design a rapid and robust laboratory method for assessing the surfactant properties in relation to the capillary adsorption which is of importance for comparative studies of surfactants in consideration of their use in soil from a practical standpoint there is still a lack of a feasible and rapid alternative to the costly direct measurements of soil hydraulic properties i e hydraulic conductivity capillary rise and sorptivity mingorance et al 2007 common drawback of using direct soil measurements for studies on surfactants is that since surfactants behave differently for any given soil types using measures from one type of soil to predict response on another soil is often inappropriate mingorance et al 2007 mobbs et al 2012 in the present study potential changes in the capillary mobility of water in soil induced by surfactants were conceptualized and simulated in laboratory by means of two rapid tests of capillary adsorption on standard porous media the second objective was to investigate the effect of non ionic organosilicone surfactants on the irrigation water use efficiency of crops and understand possible synergistic or antagonistic effects between the application of the surfactant and the nutrient uptake in absence of fertilization to this end a pot trial was carried out on lettuce administering an innovative organosilicone surfactant formulation by irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 organosilicone surfactants properties for evaluating the variation of water capillary movements induced by different organosilicone surfactants we tested four different eco friendly formulations i composition of polyether modified polysiloxanes concentration 75 100 ii composition of polyether modified trisiloxanes 75 100 iii polyether siloxane 50 75 iv composition of poly dimethylsiloxanes 10 25 data on their physicochemical properties are given in table 1 for the agronomic testing we selected and tested one surfactant formulation the polyether modified trisiloxane concentration 75 100 composed by 80 w w of heptamethyl trisiloxane and about 20 w w of polyether mono 2 propenyl ether this non ionic surfactant hereafter called pet belongs to the class of the polyether methyl siloxanes organosilicone polymers containing typically siosi bonds siloxanes data on the different physicochemical properties of pet are given in table 1 other organosilicone classes are volatile methylsiloxanes vms and polydimethylsiloxanes pdms organosilicone surfactants showed higher efficiency hill 2002 and lower environmental persistence and toxicity compared with other non ionic formulations indicating their higher potential for application to crop production bonnington 2003 fendinger et al 1997 stevens et al 2001 stevens 1995 indicated that organosilicone surfactants are rapidly adsorbed onto soil particles and then quickly inactivated by hydrolysis consequently when entering the soil environment these non ionic surfactants are expected to be either adsorbed to the soil or degraded not leaching to the groundwater krogh et al 2003 bonnington 2003 2 2 capillary mobility two rapid and robust tests on standard porous media were performed in the laboratory to assess potential changes in the capillary mobility of water in soil after application of organosilicone surfactants a newly designed capillary mobility test and a capillary rise test theoretical premise is that surfactants alter the capillary movement of water in soil with a magnitude that depends mainly on the fluid properties but that is affected to various extent by the specific physicochemical properties of the soil abu zreig et al 2003 karagunduz et al 2001 tumeo 1997 consequently in evaluating the potential of a specific surfactant it is unlikely that direct measurement of soil hydraulic properties will give reproducible values for comparative purposes mobbs et al 2012 to overcome this drawback we conceptualized at the laboratory scale the variation of water capillary movements induced by surfactant applications in soil in order to attribute them a magnitude irrespective of the soil peculiarities and reproducible with a certain accuracy our conceptual model in this first phase like many common models for water retention and matric potential in porous media relied on a simplified picture of the soil pore space as a bundle of cylindrical capillaries bcc models in which no distinction was made between the various mechanisms affecting water in porous matrices i e capillarity and surface adsorption the variation in water capillary mobility was estimated by a fast and accurate test on silica gel plates merck classical silica 60 tlc plates the sample solutions were organosilicone surfactants listed in table 1 dissolved in deionized water at concentration of 1 ml l 1 stained with 0 5 methylene blue solution the control was deionized water stained with 0 5 methylene blue solution after placing the plate over a graph paper on a flat surface a given volume of each solution was administered by dripping repeatedly with a pipette on a fixed point of the plate in the centre of the graph paper each solution ran a certain horizontal distance from the dripping point namely the distance of capillary adsorption after 60 s the stained outermost edge of the advancing liquid was marked and using the graph paper divisions the radius of the adsorption spot was measured with an accuracy of 0 1 cm and recorded changes in the capillary distance were assessed by measuring the spots radii after administering 100 μl 250 μl and 500 μl of solution in 3 replicates the percentage decrease in capillary mobility d at the ith time is defined as d d c d s 100 d c where dc and ds are the mean radii of the control and the sample spots respectively precision and uncertainty of the method were assessed through repeatability and within laboratory reproducibility tests eurachem 1998 iso 13528 2005 repeatability was evaluated by replicating the test n 3 on 1 ml l

iso 13528 2005 iso jcgm 100 2008 2008 to not account for the difference between samples as a component of the method precision the pooled relative standard deviation prsd was calculated for the decrease in capillary mobility expressed as the radii of the control and the sample spots in mm dc and ds respectively iso jcgm 100 2008 2008 kessel 2002 magnusson et al 2011 uncertainty of these

temperature respectively for 24 days lettuce plantlets were irrigated manually with 50 ml of water on alternate days strictly avoiding subirrigation to evaluate the effect of organosilicones as irrigation adjuvants we assessed the lettuce ability to utilize water and soil nutrient sources in relation to the addition of pet to irrigation water to modulate its use for a sustainable crop production we assessed the effectiveness of 2 different pet concentrations spanning the range of probable agronomic doses 0 1 1 0 ml l 1 according to the literature the adjuvant was therefore administered at 1 ml l 1 s1 0 and 0 2 ml l 1 s0 2 in deionized water and in 2 applications in order to i verify eventual phytotoxic effects of the higher dose 1 ml l 1 ii identify a minimum effective

deionized water varied from 2 02 to 5 92 and inter days prsd varied from 5 58 to 5 87 without a clear trend in relation to the pipetting volumes table 5 the uncertainty of measurements is presented in table 5 results indicate a good accuracy the uncertainty of repeatability was generally higher than the uncertainty of reproducibility due to the subjectivity of the operators the differences in capillary mobility between the control and the samples were always highly significant table 5 overall the variation range reported for repeatability reproducibility and uncertainty of measurements was satisfactory and indicated a good precision of the method regarding the vertical capillary mobility the surfactant solutions showed a decrease of the capillary rise from 1 37 to 4 24 compared to pure water proportionally to the surfactant concentration fig 3 there were significant differences in the height of capillary rise cr between the control cr cnt 8 72 0 07 cm and the surfactant solutions at

parameters of lettuce except for dm and ldw which decreased compared to the control these trends were significant between the treatments and the control for sla ldw and dm p 0 05 whilst there were no relevant differences between the two treatments pet application at 0 2 and 1 0 ml l 1 table 6 the addition of pet to irrigation water caused a reduction of epigeic dm of more than one percentage point

p 0 05 the effect of pet on the ipogeic biomass of lettuce was significant for rd p 0 01 and rs p 0 05 and translated into a decrease of 40 on average hsd tukey table 6 in pet treated lettuce data on lettuce fresh yield indicated significant improvements of both the irrigation water use efficiency iwuef p 0 05 and the adjuvant productivity index ipf p 0 001 table 7 specifically iwuef increased by around 69 p 0 05 and ipf increased 12 26 percentage points with surfactant treatment at 0 2 ml l 1 p 0 05 and 1 0 ml l 1 p 0 001 respectively hsd tukey regarding the nutrient uptake the concentration of p k mg and ca of the aboveground biomass of lettuce was significantly affected by the application of the surfactant table 8 the main effect of pet was a decrease in the elemental concentration for p ca and mg and an increase of k compared to the control in the case of p and mg it is observed a decrease in concentration when pet is administered at the lower dose with a certain recovery as the surfactant dose increases among micronutrients cu and zn concentration significantly decreased in the pet treated lettuce table 8 since the nutrient analysis indicated the elemental concentration of the lettuce biomass expressing solely the amount of nutrient taken up from the soil we further analysed the nutritional data by using bi dimensional vector plots which allowed to investigate the ability of the crop to utilize efficiently the nutrients to grow and give yield fig 4 the vector analysis showed an enhanced nutrient availability and or uptake for p and k fig 4 a and at the higher dose of surfactant application for the micronutrient b we found a better nutrient use efficiency for mg mn and ca fig 4 a and for the micronutrients cu zn ni fig 4 b specifically the concentration and the total content of mg ca and among micronutrients cu declined while plant weight increased indicating a more efficient use of these nutrients in plants irrigated with the surfactant solution the lower dose of pet 0 2 ml l 1 increased the use efficiency also for the micronutrients zn and ni the concentration of mn both pet doses b lower pet dose zn and ni higher pet dose declined while the total content increased with a corresponding increasing of the plant weight in this case the uptake or availability is considered equal between plants irrigated with the surfactant solution and plants irrigated with water alone since the differences in concentration and content were a result of the increased plant weight as special case among micronutrients the application of the higher dose of surfactant 1 0 ml l 1 enhanced strongly the availability and or the uptake of cr fig 4 b the nitrogen content ntot and use efficiency nue for the lettuce whole plant and for the aboveground biomass are reported in table 9 the pet addition to irrigation water did not affect significantly the uptake of n table 9 leading to a weak increase of the nitrogen content both for the lettuce whole plant and the aboveground biomass nonetheless data showed a significant trend towards higher nue values in pet treated lettuce compared to the control table 9 few trials in literature have examined the use efficiency of nitrogen in all its aspects and to this end we determined also the n recovery rec separately for the epigeic and ipogeic biomass of lettuce results reported in fig 5 indicated a positive effect of the surfactant on the ability of lettuce to take up and translocate n from the soil in fact the application of pet increased the recovery of nitrogen in the epigeic biomass from 7 45 of the control to 10 12 and 9 24 of pet treatments at 0 2 and 1 0 ml l 1 respectively p 0 05 in parallel rec values decreased significantly in the root biomass of lettuce from 3 34 of the control to 2 03 p 01 and 1 80 p 0 01 of pet treatments at 0 2 and 1 0 ml l 1 respectively hsd tukey to further investigate these results we plotted the n data of the epigeic biomass against changes in lettuce growth fig 5 this vector analysis clearly showed higher n concentration and content of the pet treated lettuce which was related proportionally to the increase of plant weight 4 discussion 4 1 capillary properties disclosing the properties of a surfactant relative to capillarity and adsorption is fundamental for screening among different formulations in consideration of their use in soil the first objective of the present study was to assess the potential effect of organosilicone surfactants as irrigation adjuvants in relation to the water capillary adsorption by means of two rapid and robust tests on standard porous media a newly designed capillary mobility test and a capillary rise test the capillary mobility method we developed was found to be precise and with a good degree of reproducibility of results table 5 and it can be effectively applied to all surfactants as agricultural adjuvants organosilicones alcohol ethoxylates sorbitans etc results showed that the addition of organosilicones to water caused a reduction of the horizontal capillary mobility compared to pure water table 4 likewise tlc analysis showed a decrease of the capillary rise of surfactant solutions fig 3 we found that the decrease in water capillary mobility was dependent on surfactant type and concentration and in no relation to the volume of solution administered to the porous medium fig 2 this phenomenon was consistent with the surfactant induced decrease of the surface tension which appears to be a linear function of surfactant concentration until micelles begin to form below the critical micelle concentration cmc both the surface tension of water and the contact angle between solid and aqueous phases decrease with increasing surfactant concentration karagunduz et al 2001 when idealizing the water penetration into unsaturated porous media bcc models the capillary driven flow is expressed by the young laplace eq 1 which relates the capillary pressure pc or pressure difference δp air pressure pa minus water pressure pw required for water entry into a characteristic pore radius r to the interfacial tension liquid gas γ and the contact angle liquid solid θ 1 p c δ p p a p w 2 γ c o s θ r where r cosθ is the interfacial radius of curvature meniscus of the gas liquid interface as described by 1 in 3 phases gas liquid solid when water comes in contact with a capillary the adhesive forces liquid solid short range london van der waal s forces that act over a few molecular layers combined with the cohesive force among water molecules at the gas liquid interface creates a capillary pressure pc vacuum between water and air which causes the fluid to enter the pore network this pressure difference produces a concave interfacial curvature at the gas liquid interface with a lower water potential or negative hydrostatic pressure called matric potential μ that when expressed per unit volume of water can be considered equal to the water pressure pc pw μ the surface tension of pure water γ 72 86 mn m 1 at 20 c is inversely related to the temperature t dy dt 0 138 mn m 1 and increases with decreasing liquid pressure allowing capillary pressure to increase for a constant pore radius if we neglect gravitation the rate of capillary adsorption ν in meso and micropores i e the soil capillary water is theoretically given by hagen poiseuille 2 where x distance of adsorption η liquid viscosity 2 v d x d t δ p r 2 8 η x at longer times the capillary wetting process can be described by both the poiseuille and laplace equations by the lucas washburn equation 3 that describes the liquid penetration into a horizontal capillary matthews et al 2008 smith and gillham 1999 3 x r t γ c o s θ 2 η the eq 3 was used by many researchers to describe wetting of porous media even though it does not always apply to water penetration into porous networks matthews et al 2008 the bosanquet eq 4 describes the inertial flow of individual wetting events at short time intervals with advancing wetting of small volume entering a capillary tube equation is simplified as there is no applied external pressure at the entrance of the capillary tube in this equation in contrast to the lucas washburn equation the distance travelled by inertial flow is independent of viscosity but inversely related to the radius of the pore and the fluid density ρ 4 x 2 γ c o s θ r ρ t in simpler words according to the equations above the capillary pressure and the distance of adsorption are linear functions of the surface tension in this simplified model lowering the surface tension of a fluid will always lead to a proportional reduction of its capillary mobility as verified by our laboratory tests some authors hypothesized that this mode of action should theoretically increase the hydraulic conductivity in a soil water system karagunduz et al 2001 moore et al 2010 tumeo 1997 nonetheless direct measurements of soil hydraulic properties often reported a decrease in hydraulic conductivity after the application of non ionic surfactants karagunduz et al 2015 mobbs et al 2012 in literature when using direct measurements both an increase and a decrease in soil water content are reported as the main effect of surfactant application karagunduz et al 2001 oostindie et al 2008 and similarly the capillary rise in soil columns was found either to decrease significantly wiel shafran et al 2006 or to not change at all mobbs et al 2012 in agreement with wiel shafran et al 2006 in our idealized system organosilicones showed to decrease water capillary movements in porous media but also spread readily outward from the dripping point indicating a higher wetting power compared to the pure water fig 7 the condition for water to wet and spread on a surface is that the adhesive forces exceed the cohesive forces within the bulk water we can explain our results considering that surfactant hydrophilic head bonds strongly with water while its tail adsorbs to surfaces such as silica air molecules in pores or in soil clay minerals and hydrophobic organic substances kuhnt 1993 mobbs et al 2012 tumeo 1997 the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces during adsorption of surfactant solutions most likely determined the degree of wetting and the effects on capillarity the adsorption of organosilicones at the liquid solid interface produced a decrease in the surfactant concentration at the wetting front of the advancing film and this surface tension gradient enhanced the movement of water to the wetting front fig 8 rosen and kunjappu 2012 reported this phenomenon as a superspreading or superwetting ability verified for some trisiloxane surfactants similarly the innermost adsorption spot which was formed by dripping on silica plates fig 7 was probably caused by transient drainage and rewetting events behind the leading edge of the wetting front henry and smith 2006 the greater water pressure in the system affected the hydraulic gradient inducing water fluxes within the solute front from the source at higher surfactant concentration lower surface tension higher soil water pressure toward cleaner regions higher surface tension lower soil water pressure fig 8 the rate of water movement should therefore increase with increasing difference in capillary pressures i e linearly with surfactant concentration and not with the volume of solution administered as verified in our experiments the carrying of water energized by surface tension gradients is a phenomenon known as the marangoni effect gibbs marangoni flow a tangential force that arises from a momentum transfer and results in a faster extensive desaturation of the porous medium than expected by standard continuum models of flow and transport the marangoni effect is often associated with temperature gradients that alter the surface tension and concentration gradients due to solute displacement microbial growth and or biosurfactants production henry et al 2002 henry and smith 2006 smith and gillham 1999 transferring these results to the field it is presumable that the application of organosilicones as irrigation adjuvants can cause temporal changes in the diffusional capacity of the circulating solution and in the nutrients pathway proportionally to the strength and concentration of the surfactant as long as we refer to capillary water organosilicones should reduce the upward capillary movements of water in soil preventing evaporation loss and improve the wetting and rewetting of soil superspreading effect similarly to what hypothesized for rhizosphere biosurfactants read et al 2003 the gradient of capillary pressure extending from the point of irrigation into the bulk soil may displace water and therefore nutrients and draw them from smaller soil pores than would otherwise be not accessible to roots 4 2 agronomic performances we performed an agronomic testing on one selected surfactant formulation the pet polyether modified trisiloxane biometric parameters of lettuce yield indicated a positive main effect of pet in terms of leaf area and dry weight and a slight trend for higher aboveground biomass production compared to the control table 6 the application of pet caused a significant increase of sla and a decrease of ldw of lettuce leaves which are key variables related to the physiological processes of biomass production from freshly allocated assimilates hodgson et al 2011 poorter and de jong 1999 the reduction of ldw and the increase of sla constitute per se a notable index of the surfactant positive effects on growth response and quality of lettuce these parameters are in fact function of leaf dry matter and leaf thickness and for this reason are often used as index of schlerophylly in general ldw and sla are very sensitive to plant nitrogen status light climate and several other stresses species in permanently or temporarily resource rich environments tend on average to have a lower ldw and a higher sla than those in resource poor environments similarly high ldw species generally have high values for dm high concentrations of cell walls and secondary compounds and greater leaf and root longevity conservation of acquired resources for review see poorter and de jong 1999 vile et al 2005 in our specific case on the basis of the biometric and nutritional data obtained we can safely interpret the decreasing of ldw and the increasing of sla as the outcome of an improvement in the processes of resource acquisition from soil the use of pet determined a significant decrease in the dm of the aboveground biomass given the negligible variation of the lettuce dry weight this reduction of epigeic dm should be related to the marked increase of the fresh weight observed in the pet treated lettuce results indicated also a slight trend for higher biomass production in pet treated lettuce compared to the untreated control expressed as both fresh and dry weight table 6 regarding the belowground biomass a significant reduction of about 40 was observed for both the root dry weight and the root shoot ratio table 6 our results were in agreement with parr and norman 1964 but in contrast with the observation made by brumbaugh and peterson 2001 in literature few reports of surfactant effects on plants dealt with root development and growth since most works have focused only on aboveground vegetative development although the patterns of biomass allocation to roots can be sometimes contradictory in our specific case the higher proportional distribution of biomass in lettuce leaves than in shoots should directly translate to a higher uptake rate of soil resources i e water and nutrients since this was a non fertilized trial the differential uptake of nutrients from the soil must be referred to the ability of the plant to utilize the soil as a limited nutrient source to grow and give yield the nutrient analysis showed a general trend toward a reduction in the elemental concentration of lettuce epigeic tissue significant for p mg and ca and for cu and zn among micronutrients table 8 with the only exception of k however these differences in the nutrient concentration were proportionally related to the increase of the lettuce biomass after normalization data showed higher uptake availability and or translocation for p k and b in pet treated lettuce compared to the control higher content and concentration fig 4 this result is of particular value since the low availability and restricted transport of p commonly limit plant growth the beneficial effect of surfactants on increasing the availability of phosphorus is further supported by considering that among several mechanisms developed by plants to survive in phosphorus deficient soils there is also the exudation of biosurfactants via root mucigel read et al 2003 in a study on maize lupin and wheat root exudation evaluated the effect of phospholipids naturally found in the mucilage on selected soil properties even at low concentration the authors observed a considerable reduction of the surface tension of soil solution and reported a decrease of the amount of phosphate adsorbed in soil and a simultaneous increase of p concentration in solution by 10 on the other hand the increased assimilation of cr in pet treated lettuce highlights the uptake of unwanted elements from potentially contaminated soils as the possible main drawback baratella et al 2016 the system was characterized by the increase of the nutrient use efficiency for ca cu ni and zn which means a higher production with less nutritional adsorption reduced content and concentration with increase in lettuce growth fig 4 on the other hand the uptake or availability of fe mg and mn can be considered equal between plants irrigated with pet and plants irrigated with water fig 4 these results are partially in line with baratella et al 2016 which however highlighted a dose related detrimental effect of their non ionic formulation in absence of n fertilization regarding nitrogen utilization in our trial the application of pet led to a weak and not significant increase of the n content both for the lettuce whole plant and for the aboveground biomass table 9 however to better highlight any synergistic or antagonistic effect of the surfactant on nitrogen we analysed separately the two main components of the nutrient efficiency the n uptake efficiency rec which is the ability of crops to take up n from the soil and the n use efficiency nue that is the efficiency with which crops use the absorbed n to grow and give yield benincasa et al 2011 despite the absence of fertilization the application of pet led to higher concentration and content of nitrogen against changes in plant weight the nue values of pet treated lettuce increased significantly 5 13 percentage points for the whole plant and 3 15 percentage points for the epigeic biomass table 9 the surfactant gave positive results also on the ability of lettuce to take up n from the soil since the recovery of nitrogen in the epigeic biomass increased by 2 25 on average fig 5 the increased uptake of soil n could be related to the higher relative growth rates and lower dry matter content of leaf tissues in pet treated lettuce tittonell et al 2000 so far relatively little information was available on the effect of surfactants on crops n uptake and use our evidences are in agreement with arriaga et al 2009 which reported an improvement in the apparent n recovery for fertilized potatoes given by the increase in tuber n uptake and in petiole no3 concentrations the authors measured also a consistently lower no3 n concentration in soil and the trend toward a lower soil nh4 n concentration associated with a reduction in leaching and speculated it was the result of an increase in plant n use an alternative hypothesis is given by read et al 2003 which reported that lecithin a phospholipid surfactant of the root mucigel reduced the rate of n mineralisation in soil possibly through a direct effect on the microbial population we couldn t carry out soil analysis at the end of the agronomic trial to shed light on this hypothesis but nonetheless similarly to p and k our results on n may be indicative of a synergistic effect of the surfactant on plant nutrition which as previously reported should be explicated through the enhancing of the availability in soil of these nutrients of their uptake by the root or both fig 6 in this regard the comparative analysis of rec between aboveground and belowground biomass gave us some insight into the probable effect of pet also on nitrogen translocation in fact following the application of pet the recovery of nitrogen increased in the epigeic biomass and in parallel decreased in the root system fig 5 the phenomenon observed suggested the existence of a possible augmenting mechanism also for the nutrient transport via xylematic flow in need of verification by further experimental studies regarding the effect of pet on water uptakes data on lettuce fresh yield showed a particularly high increase of the irrigation use efficiency table 7 the irrigation use efficiency i e the ability of the plant to utilize water to grow increased 77 60 percentage points the adjuvant productivity which express the variation of the lettuce yield due to the application of the surfactant increased 12 26 percentage points with surfactant treatments at 0 2 ml l 1 and 1 0 ml l 1 respectively these findings are consistent with our nutritional data and can be explained considering that the driving forces for solute movement towards the roots are mainly the formation of a depleted zone at the roots interface and the diffusion of water and nutrients towards this zone jungk 1996 in agreement with our results chaichi et al 2015 which investigated the application of a non ionic surfactant on corn under limited irrigation reported the increase of the irrigation water use efficiency based on total dry matter and grain yield by 9 5 and 14 4 respectively additional data showing similar trends were obtained by few recent studies on deficit irrigation strategies implemented with the use of non ionic surfactants to improve water use efficiency in arid and semi arid regions chaichi et al 2017 madsen et al 2016 4 2 1 effect on water and nutrient availability in soil in a soil profile the dominant mechanisms of nutrient transport in soil are diffusion through water films at the micro scale a few pores and convection through water flow at the macro scale from mm to m on the base of our preliminary laboratory tests on standard porous media we hypothesized that the application of pet lowering the surface tension of the soil solution can enhance the transport of solutes especially of immobile elements such as p and k and trace nutrients towards the root surface by affecting water flow and diffusion along the concentration gradient jungk 1996 to improve our mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon we should consider the physics behind the movement of an air water interface in soil the aggregation of particles and irregular mineral surfaces in soil results in angular pore spaces which form a variety of air water and solid water configurations and show a peculiar liquid behaviour during water displacement compared to the bcc model the angular cross sections determine capillary processes while adsorption processes dominate the internal surface areas tuller et al 1999 therefore in unsaturated soils water is held in corners and pits by capillary forces as small liquid bodies and is adsorbed as thin films on solid surfaces by means of various types of long and short range surface forces if the two phases water and air are in mutual equilibrium adsorbed water films can occur when δp 2γ r under these conditions the water retained by capillarity in angularities coexists with adsorbed films at near zero matric potentials soil water distribution is dominated by capillary forces in pores but at lower matric potentials the water retained in angularities become discontinuous and the hydraulic behaviour is controlled for a large extent by the network of interconnected adsorbed films tokunaga 2009 because of the relatively large surface area of soil at low potentials practically all the hydraulic resistance resides within adsorbed films tokunaga 2009 and therefore the interfacial forces are likely to play a larger role in solute transport and biological activity than predicted by the conventional bcc model tuller and or 2001 several models have been developed for describing the hydraulic properties of soil capillary pores and interspersed thin films tokunaga 2011 and references therein tuller et al 1999 and subsequent papers considered both adsorptive and capillary mechanisms using a combination of the conventional young laplace equation for the capillary pressure of water menisci in angular pores and of the disjoining pressure derjaguin 1987 for coexisting thin water films in the approach of tuller et al 1999 the contribution of adsorptive forces i e the thickness h μ of adsorbed films lining soil internal surfaces and the contribution of capillary forces i e the liquid elements with radius of interface curvature r μ are considered separately as functions of the matric potential μ the meniscus radius r μ for the capillary water in unsaturated conditions is given by the young laplace eq 1 the thickness h μ of the thin liquid films adsorbed on the surface of angular pores and confined by the vapor phase is calculated as 5 h μ a s v l 6 π ρ μ 3 where asvl is the hamaker constant it summarizes the interactions between solid surface and gas through a liquid film asvl 6 10 20 j for water on silicate surfaces eq 5 represents the simplest form of liquid adsorption on solid surfaces considering van der waals forces only derjaguin 1987 but the hamaker effective value of 6 0 10 20 j defined by tuller et al 1999 and widely accepted in the literature accounts for both van der waals and ionic electrostatic forces as pointed out by tokunaga 2011 given the eq 5 the average film thickness is predicted to increase with the matric potential μ at relatively wet conditions the so called field capacity μ 10 to 30 j kg 1 the thickness of water film on a smooth mineral surface is about 10 nm or et al 2007 in unsaturated macropores measurements on rough mineral surfaces showed significant surface film flows for near zero matric potentials 0 250 j kg 1 with an average film thicknesses from 2 to 70 μm comparable to local surface roughness tokunaga 2009 according to the model of tuller et al 1999 and or et al 2007 we can calculate the effective film thickness h μ available for water and nutrient transport as the average cross sectional amount of liquid associated with films adsorbed on flat mineral surfaces and films internal to angularities by 6 6 h μ h μ β l 2 l cos α 2 r μ tan α 2 l β tan α 2 in eq 6 h μ is the thickness of the adsorbed film expressed by eq 5 and r μ is the radius of interface curvature given by eq 1 β l and γ are geometric parameters of the surface modelling it is now clear that the interaction of surfactants with the soil structure could affect the soil hydraulic behaviour by multiple possible mechanisms operating simultaneously and with counteracting effects the scaling relations show that lowering the interfacial tension decreases the radius of curvature of liquid elements r μ increases the effective film thickness h μ and causes the existence of adsorbed films under lower magnitude δp or higher magnitude μ conversely the effect of the contact angle decrease θ or increase in wettability leads to higher δp values though with lower magnitude of variation and greatest uncertainty kim et al 2012 from eq 6 as the matric potential increases the r μ and the film thickness h μ increase with counteracting effects on h μ however the increase of matric potential expressed by h μ dominates over meniscus changes in determining the final effect on the effective film thickness the conceptual model proposed here is that according to the eqs 1 and 5 the pet induced reduction of the surface tension led to a combined effect of decreasing the liquid air interfacial radii of curvature and thickening the adsorbed films in simpler words as the radius of curvature associated with capillarity in pores decreased with liquid elements receding deeper into pores because of the reduction of the capillary pressure the thickness and the connectivity of the water films adsorbed on all planar surfaces i e the effective film thickness h μ expressed by eq 6 increased the primary conceptual steps of our model are illustrated in fig 9 the μ dependent thickness of these thin nanometer to micrometer conductive water films strongly affected water and chemical transport in soil at medium and low saturations over many orders of magnitude in length scale the augmentative effect of pet on h μ was further enhanced by the peculiar superspreading ability of trisiloxanes which showed a greater adsorption at the liquid solid interface of the wetting front especially on hydrophobic areas over soil particle surfaces fig 7 and contributed to extend and improve the network of interconnected adsorbed films tokunaga 2009 then the surfactant induced capillary pressure gradient towards the wetting front increased the infiltration of water i e the wettability and the drainage and rewetting events in the immediate vicinity of the roots allowed a faster continuous replenishment of nutrients in the depletion zone silber et al 2003 4 2 2 effect on root uptake the improvement of the root uptake can be explained assuming that pet behaved on the surface area of the root hairs similarly to what already verified in studying non ionic surfactants penetration at the foliar and cuticular level fernández and eichert 2009 and references therein specifically organosilicones are generally reported to promote stomatal infiltration by significantly lowering the surface tension but there is also evidence that they can also affect the diffusion of substances through the plasma membrane and the cuticle it is now recognized that non ionic surfactants and biosurfactants can form channels through lipid membranes schlieper and de robertis 1977 and cause a more efficient uptake of chemicals than allowed by the facilitated stomatal diffusion read et al 2003 fernández and eichert 2009 one possible explanation is that non ionic surfactants exert a concentration dependent effect on cell permeability increasing water diffusion and ion flow through the membrane lipid bilayer and consequently acting as absorption enhancers in this regard the identification of the optimal surfactant concentration together with the choice of the formulation are of paramount importance in our opinion to obtain nutrient solutions capable of enhancing ion transport while causing no side effects baratella et al 2016 in fact non ionic surfactants similarly to anionic and cationic surfactants form molecular aggregates or micelles when the concentration exceeds a critical level in aqueous solutions cmc critical micelle concentration so that their characteristic properties are markedly changed krogh et al 2003 first found in 1970 on beet tissues haapala 1970 and then widely confirmed in the literature the micelles of a surfactant above the cmc can complex with the globular lipoprotein units of the outermost plasma layer of plant cells and solubilize the plasmalemma with leakage of ions and sugars conversely at concentrations lower than the cmc there was an enhanced retention of solutes in vegetable tissue haapala 1970 fernández and eichert 2009 failure to consider these factors may have led to the many inconsistencies currently found in the literature when studying the agronomic efficacy of these kind of adjuvants 5 conclusion the pets seem to represent an advantageous agronomic innovation for irrigation in order to reduce water and nutritional inputs at the same time guaranteeing adequate crop production and quality when entering the soil environment at safe agronomic doses organosilicones are expected to be adsorbed in the first centimetres of the soil thickness not leaching to the groundwater and to cause temporal changes in the diffusional capacity of soil water and nutrient proportionally to their strength and concentration decreasing the capillary water movements pets would reduce both water evaporation loss upwards movements facilitate the wetting and rewetting of soil superspreading effect improving the water use efficiency and finally crops nutrient availability according to the theoretical model provided the administration of pet as irrigation adjuvant reducing the interfacial tension decreased the radius of curvature of liquid elements in soil pores at the same time increasing the matric potential pet increased the thickness of the network of adsorbed liquid films i e the effective film thickness h μ furthermore for a given pore space geometry adsorbed films occurred under lower magnitude δp or at less negative chemical potentials i e in more wet conditions because of the relatively large surface area of soil the contribution of liquid films dominates interfacial forces and can strongly affect water and chemical transport in soil at medium and low saturations over many orders of magnitude in length scale tokunaga 2009 therefore the formation of thicker adsorbed water films which were determined primarily by the increase of the matric potential supported larger water diffusion rates and likely played a primary role in nutrient transport we can reasonably infer that the augmentative effect of pet on h μ was further enhanced by the peculiar superspreading or superwetting ability of trisiloxanes which improved the connectivity of water films along the gradient of capillary pressure from the point of irrigation into the depletion zone also drawing water and therefore nutrients from smaller soil pores than would otherwise be not accessible to roots overall our experiments provide a first evidence that organosilicones as irrigation adjuvant can significantly affect the chemical and physical environment of the rhizosphere and the ecophysiology of crops modifying solutes availability and hydraulic conductivity and improving the uptake and use efficiency of water and nutrients organosilicone surfactants could therefore represent a valid agronomic innovation to reduce inputs and improve the sustainability of vegetable production systems
