12080,the threat of chaotic and unorganized expansion of urban areas and growing stress of human actions on hydro geomorphologic system frequently outcome in alteration of the current recharge system which directs to numerous ecological challenges this study attempts to examine the applicability of geographical information system gis and remote sensing in dealing with spatio temporal variability of dynamic phenomena i e urban development and its relationship with groundwater aquifers this research paper mainly covers quantitative impacts of urban advancement on the behavior of water lying beneath the earth surface in mardan city pakistan satellite images were used to examine the expansion of urban areas in the city during the last two decades the outcomes of this paper signify that both the land use land cover and groundwater table has changed drastically in the study area over the study period the investigation showed that the rapid increase in population coupled with inevitable urban growth over the surrounding fertile agricultural land were the most important factors of groundwater fluctuation in the study area moreover gis and remote sensing techniques have been found significant in measurement of spatial and temporal phenomenon of urban expansion and its effects on groundwater system graphical abstract image 1 keywords land use land cover change groundwater exploitation water table urban expansion gis remote sensing mardan city 1 introduction rapid pace of urbanization and unprecedented increasing pressure of multiplying anthropogenic activities are the main issues to water resources management in urban centers the prime source of water supply in the urban centers is mainly underground water from wells and tube wells the excessive reliance and withdrawal of groundwater more than recharge frequently result in deficient and unreliable supplies mohammed 2004 rodell et al 2009 declining availability of water is one of the grave global environmental issues for the coming century postel and vickers 2004 skole 2004 groundwater is one of the most imperative and reliable sources of water for human activity which includes drinking water agricultural and industrial use and other domestic purposes rodell et al 2009 and as predicted the future water demands are growing as the developing countries across the world seek new levels of economic growth and prosperity jury and vaux 2005 similarly more industrialized countries are confronting augmented water demands and scarcity kettle et al 2007 groundwater declining is a significant issue driven by augment in population land use and land cover change climate change olivares et al 2019 economic advancement and expending agriculture for an ever growing demands for water across the globe wada et al 2010 urban population has increased more than tenfold during the twentieth century with most of this increase taking place in low and middle income countries this trend of urbanization has an influence on the use of fresh water and affects the quantity of groundwater with the changing patterns and rates of recharge vahid 2013 mahmood et al 2013 eni et al 2011 kanagalakshmi and nagan 2013 before 1950 about 30 of the global population were living in cities since 2008 more than half of the world population is residing in urban areas it is projected that about 60 of inhabitants are supposed to live in urban centers by 2030 haque et al 2013 rai and kumari 2012 vahid 2013 asia in spite of its lower level of urbanization is home to nearly 53 of the world s total urban population united nations 2014 and is predicted to climb to 66 by 2050 the past research has highlighted that as urban centers expend in population the total water demand for adequate municipal supply increases as well bradley et al 2002 mcdonald et al 2011 2014 all these new urban residents will need water but astonishingly very little is known worldwide form where these urban centers will get their water mcdonald et al 2014 globally appropriately 2 billion people depend on groundwater as their main source of water supply for agricultural and domestic uses swenson and famiglietti 2011 consequently groundwater plays an indispensable role in economic agriculture and global food security sharma 2009 zhang et al 2014 globally more than a third of all water used by humans comes from groundwater aquifers the percentage is even more in rural areas more than half of all the drinking water across the globe is provided from these aquifers harter 2015 the incessant abstracting of groundwater from these aquifers is contributing to groundwater depletion in different parts of the world ralph 2009 groundwater the renewable stock of freshwater is stored in aquifers belhassan 2011 the groundwater supplies a freshwater water source that is quite stable and consistent however all anthropogenic practices can detrimentally influence both quantity and quality of water present in these underground aquifers the outcome of these impacts can result in eternal or temporary loss of these resources moreover the vulnerability of groundwater is the same issue confronting both by developed and developing countries where the advancement of agricultural and industrial is very fast at the same time with the process of urbanization breabăn and paiu 2012 for this reason evaluation monitoring and estimating water resources assists in the efficient and equitable distribution of water amongst competing needs genxu et al 2008 increasing urbanization and rapid growth in population has contributed to the devastation of natural resources by enhancing surface flow and decreasing groundwater recharge vahid 2013 urbanization generates the augment of urban water demand in two ways the increase of urban population and expansion of water usage per urban dweller as surface water is not sufficient for urban residential and industrial use therefore groundwater aquifers is the chief source of urban water supply siebert et al 2010 lejars et al 2012 wu and tan 2012 shahid et al 2015 eastoe and gu 2016 even in cities with access to surface water the demand to provide sufficient water for domestic and industrial consumption led to over exploitation of underground aquifers some well known examples are new mexico albuquerque plummer et al 2004 and the urban areas including el paso texas and ciudad juarez chihuhua hibbs et al 1997 consistent augment in urban environment excessive abstraction and low recharging rate of groundwater from precipitation resulting in the depletion of both surface and groundwater sources changming and jingjie 2001 khan et al 2019 socioeconomic infrastructural advancement coupled with unprecedented increase in population have amplify the uses and withdrawal of groundwater sources myint et al 2013 the groundwater once depleted is very difficult to recover jakeman et al 2016 urban land use transformation is one of the significant human induced factor influencing groundwater system doll et al 2012 in urban centers usually existing surface water resources are insufficient to meet the whole water requirements moreover the dependence on underground aquifers has amplified over the years jat et al 2005 figured out that abstraction of groundwater both for agricultural and industrial purposes has been increased than the recharged rate situation further deteriorated in urban centers where pumping of groundwater increases with decline in recharge due the transformation of permeable areas into impervious surfaces mapani 2005 held et al 2007 modification in land use and land cover directly affects recharge distribution and reduces recharge amount josiah 2011 excessive withdrawal of groundwater will lead to a decrease in water table and ultimately caused a reduction in the flow from the system tellam et al 2006 tilahun and broder 2009 arunprakash et al 2014 the major problem of urbanization is the relationship among urban development and groundwater cities and towns that are situated on deep shallow unconfined underground aquifers groundwater withdrawal thus directly affects the amount and water levels as pointed out by putra and baier 2008 expansion of urban area has at least three key issues relating to groundwater fluctuation in the level of groundwater groundwater pollution and its effect on building engineering and integrity urban development is causing a decline in the penetration of groundwater due to the impermeability of catchment by paved areas building and roads lerner et al 1990 foster et al 1993 yun et al 2011 campo et al 2014 the pathways and sources for the recharge of groundwater in urban centers are more abundant and complex compare to rural areas the recharge of groundwater in urbanized areas is closely linked to the three main sources wastewater rainwater and leakage from the water supply lines however in cities lacking proper planning of sewers for wastewater transport as much as 90 percent of abstracted water may return as groundwater recharge lerner et al 1990 in these cities the main source of recharge would be the permeation of wastewater from great number of septic tanks inadequate sewers and latrines lerner 2002 thus it is vital to appraise the effects of urban development on quantity and quality of groundwater for its optimal consumption and sustainable environment gis remote sensing and other new tools and techniques have been employed for quite long time to extract and analyze data to appraise contemporary and future groundwater conditions olivares et al 2019 in term of quantity quality and its movement goodchild et al 1993 mac donald et al 2016 across the globe gis and remote sensing advancements have been utilized frequently for mapping of topographical phenomena urban development monitoring measurement of land use land cover haack and rafter 2006 jat et al 2008 mapping of underlying water aquifers

et al 2004 starr 2005 arslan 2012 kang and kaur 2017 the purpose of this study is to examined the lowering down of groundwater as a result of unprecedented modification in land use land cover in mardan city pakistan the results of this study may support former findings this study used an incorporated approach to evaluate the impact of urban land use land cover change on groundwater resources 2 study area mardan is one the rapid growing city of khyber pakhtunkhwa subsequent to the provincial capital peshawar pakistan physically mardan city stretches from 72 3 11 to 72 14 48 e longitude and 34 9 4 to 34 13 21 n latitude occupying an area of about 32 km2 fig 1 mardan city covers a part of the most productive and fertile land of peshawar valley according to population census of pakistan its population was just about 246 000 which has jumped to 400 000 by the year 2010 gop 1998 a noteworthy extension in mardan city started after the year 1990 and the city officials failed to put into practice development control during this spreading out yar 2014 the process is ongoing and it is requisite to observe and compute the extent and rate of this rapid urban advancement and transformation of food basket land into non agricultural uses so that approaches could be developed for mitigating the adverse effects of the event and preserve the future assault mardan city is growing swiftly in all directions this chaotic unplanned and haphazard development is totally over the fertile agricultural land in and around city which used to be land producing food for the city s residents yar 2014 the city is located on a gently sloping plain the plain consist of fine alluvial deposits the depth and composition of which is spatially variable mardan basin has been filled by sub recent sediments derived from soils and losses plain river kalpani is the only source regarding groundwater recharge furthermore streams irrigation canals and precipitation also amplify the process it is about 270 m above mean seal level the flow of the surface water follow the slopping pattern of the city which is towards southeast from northwest yar 2014 in mardan summers are usually long hot humid and clear whereas winters are generally cold short and partly cloudy summer season starts from may to september the temperature reaches to it maximum 40 48 c in june december and january are the coldest months in which the temperature lowers down to an average 2 09 c most of the rainfall occurs during the month of july august december and january the maximum rainfall recorded in the month of august is 125 85 mm gop 1998 3 materials and methods the data used in the paper mainly comprised of remotely sensed imageries and hydrologic data the remotely sensed data consist of landsat 30 m images for the year 1990 and 2010 for accessing the two decadal land use and land cover changes the available open source landsat images of 1990 and 2010 has been downloaded from global land cover facility glcf the remotely sensed images were processed by mean of supervised maximum likelihood classified technique in arc map 10 1 for each and every land use group i e agricultural land build environment cultivable wasteland and water bodies a total of around 132 training signatures samples were created to generate the composite images of 1990 and 2010 respectively which were having the same projection coordinates transverse mercator projection table 1 in order to discover the changes in land use pattern six concentric circles at 0 7 km intervals were supperimposed on the land use map of 1990 and 2010 see table 4 a stratified random sampling procedure was adopted to verify samples and resultant thematic layer classes for each type of land use about 50 reference points were then created most of these reference points were authenticated with the field survey the overall accuracy including producer s accuracy user s accuracy and kappa coefficient were considered for 1990 and 2010 classified maps the concluding thematic maps met the overall minimum 85 accuracy table 2 as specified by the anderson classification anderson et al 1976 in order to create a spatio temporal water table map of mardan city groundwater data for the year 1990 and 2010 was collected from water and works department mardan moreover for the confirmation of spatial data a gps survey was also performed fig 4 subsequently the accessible water table data was then stored in geo database and processed using arcgis 10 1 software the stored data was interpolated using idw inverse distance weighted technique in arcgis 10 1 environment then the idw maps for the year 1990 and 2010 were created and overlaid using raster calculator tool in arcmap finally the maps showing the variations in water table during the study period from 1990 to 2010 were compared and analyzed fig 2 4 results and discussions the results of the study implied that there are widespread variations in urban built up areas in mardan with the highest extent of land transformation occurring in the years 1990 2010 fig 3 illustrates the land use map for the year 1990 2010 the spatio temporal analysis revealed that mardan city has experiencing a hasty expansion of urban built uses growth in population socio economic and physical development the unprecedented increase in population and improved socio economic conditions has resulted in the engulfment of prime agricultural land results indicate that the area of built environment has grown steadily over time in addition the area under farmland and cultivable wasteland have recorded a sharp declined in the study period the quantified area and coverage of various land use classes are displayed in tables 3 and 4 this transformation has ultimately replaced the natural surface by impermeable structures and has affected the rate of infiltration the over abstraction of groundwater and decreasing infiltration rates hashs put an enormous pressure on fresh water sources and threatened the existing groundwater aquifers lowering down of water level has already been reported in different parts of the study area see fig 5 see table 5 4 1 spatio temporal distribution of land use land cover according to the land use land cover data the built uses has shown a sharp increase in the study area after 1990 the area covered by built uses comprising of housing and other infrastructures has more than doubled from 953 ha to 1994 ha negatively affecting cropland which has shrunk to 1108 ha from 1339 ha and wasteland dwindled to 16 ha from 827 ha during the research period 1990 2010 table 3 fig 3 the preliminary analysis shows that the growing pressure of population rising income coupled with subsequent rapid urbanization has altered the contemporary land use land cover pattern during this period the government started developmental projects enhanced health and education facilities law and order situations and the real estate business began to boom this finally led to migration of employment seekers from different areas particularly the northern parts of the province and increases the demand for land a number of factors including government policy and strategy economic and market forces and population growth were responsible for this rapid land use changes most of this build environment which is totally unplanned and chaotic is expanding in all directions fig 3 shows the observed spatial and temporal land use changes that has occurred in mardan during the study period 4 2 land use gradient a total of six concentric rings at 0 7 km intervals were drawn from the heart of the city outwards on the land use map of 1990 and 2010 to determine the changes in land use pattern the examination disclosed that expansion of urban area from 1990 to 2010 has primarily occurred at the cost of most productive agricultural land fig 3 shows the observed spatial and temporal land use changes that has occurred in mardan city during the study period using landsat imageries a glance on land use trajectories shows that the percentage of impervious surfaces is shrinking while on the other hand the concentration of land producing food is growing from the core towards the outskirts of the study area 4 3 impact of land use and land cover change on groundwater level when the rapid modification of land use land cover occurs the natural ground surface is replaced by impervious surfaces which interrupts surface runoff and penetration of water deep into the ground the hasty increase in population of the study area has caused to augment withdrawal of fresh water from ground and has consistently jeopardized the potential of groundwater the study discloses that the area under built environment has doubled from 30 in 1990 to over 60 in 2010 according to khan et al 2019 when 10 20 percent land cover of an area is transformed to impervious surfaces resulting in an increase of runoff by two folds although deep and shallow permeation of water are reduced by nearly 4 percent deep infiltration is more consequential in recharging of groundwater aquifers than shallow infiltration the study area was divided into six zones as portrayed in illustration 5 and tables 4 and 5 in order to assess the association of rapid urban development with the variation in groundwater level over the specific time period 1990 2010 to figure out the correlation between impervious land and water table the measurement of area in each zone is requisite as shown in the illustrations 3 5 and table 4 and 5 it is apparent from fig 3 that the development in built environment can been seen in all zones in mardan city during the study period nevertheless most of this urban growth has taken place in the first 3 zones the investigation discloses that an overall increase of 24 in built uses was recorded in zone 1 which has resulted in decline of water level in the areas of karwan road from 27 feet to 38 feet and in bari cham 25 feet40 feet during 1990 2010 in zone 2 built environment has jumped from merely 48 to over 80 falling down falling the level of water to 40 feet from 30 feet in the area of hoti khas the groundwater table in zone 3 has lowered down in various wells including uc hoti from 27 to 38 feet sikandarey from 59 to 70 feet and muslim abad from 17 to 80 feet as an outcome of this hasty growth of impervious surfaces from 30 to over 67 water level has descended in par hoti 18 30 feet shah dand 11 65 feet and farm koroona 12 27 feet in zone 4 during the study period advancement in urban area in zone 5 has resulted in the depletion of water table in sugar mill area from 19 to 60 and in gujar ghari 18 52 feet respectively in zone 6 again a decreased in water table has been recorded wapda colony from 24 to 48 feet the lowering down of water level and diminishing of groundwater aquifers is a grave threat to the potential groundwater sources in mardan city 5 conclusion this study used an integrated approach to appraise the effects of urban advancement on groundwater table in mardan city satellite images were employed to assess the land use dynamics over the past two decades 1990 2010 the analysis shows that the growing pressure of population rising income together with subsequent rapid urbanization have modified the contemporary land use land cover pattern most of the fertile agricultural land has lost to built uses which has resulted in an enormous increased in impervious surfaces the research area was also divided into six different zones in order to calculate the impervious area and was then closely related to groundwater table the study revealed that most of this growth in built uses has occurred in the first three zones and the intensity of food basket land is enhancing towards the outskirts of the city this increasing trends of sealing the natural ground surface with impervious surface cover has the capability to decrease the permeability of rainwater into the ground affecting the recharging rate moreover this unprecedented urban expansion and growth in population were the main reasons behind groundwater fluctuation and deterioration furthermore the study area is expanding in all directions in chaotic and unplanned fashion results from this study have provided a systematic ground for understanding sustainability related problems and answers in the study area the accredited association among the advancement of urban area and groundwater resources signified by rs gis technologies is valuable to support decision making and policy analysis for the sustainable improvement of both the arid and semiarid areas in pakistan predominantly outcomes of this study have offered sound technical support for the management of water resources which specifies that gis rs

study period from 1990 to 2010 were compared and analyzed fig 2 4 results and discussions the results of the study implied that there are widespread variations in urban built up areas in mardan with the highest extent of land transformation occurring in the years 1990 2010 fig 3 illustrates the land use map for the year 1990 2010 the spatio temporal analysis revealed that mardan city has experiencing a hasty expansion of urban built uses growth in population socio economic and physical development the unprecedented increase in population and improved socio economic conditions has resulted in the engulfment of prime agricultural land results indicate that the area of built environment has grown steadily over time in addition the area under farmland and cultivable wasteland have recorded a sharp declined in the study period the quantified area and coverage of various land use classes are displayed in tables 3 and 4 this transformation has ultimately replaced the natural surface by impermeable structures and has affected the rate of infiltration the over abstraction of groundwater and decreasing infiltration rates hashs put an enormous pressure on fresh water sources and threatened the existing groundwater aquifers lowering down of water level has already been reported in different parts of the study area see fig 5 see table 5 4 1 spatio temporal distribution of land use land cover according to the land use land cover data the built uses has shown a sharp increase in the study area after 1990 the area covered by built uses comprising of housing and other infrastructures has more than doubled from 953 ha to 1994 ha negatively affecting cropland which has shrunk to 1108 ha from 1339 ha and wasteland dwindled to 16 ha from 827 ha during the research period 1990 2010 table 3 fig 3 the preliminary analysis shows that the growing pressure of population rising income coupled with subsequent rapid urbanization has altered the contemporary land use land cover pattern during this period the government started developmental projects enhanced health and education facilities law and order situations and the real estate business began to boom this finally led to migration of employment seekers from different areas particularly the northern parts of the province and increases the demand for land a number of factors including government policy and strategy economic and market forces and population growth were responsible for this rapid land use changes most of this build environment which is totally unplanned and chaotic is expanding in all directions fig 3 shows the observed spatial and temporal land use changes that has occurred in mardan during the study period 4 2 land use gradient a total of six concentric rings at 0 7 km intervals were drawn from the heart of the city outwards on the land use map of 1990 and 2010 to determine the changes in land use pattern the examination disclosed that expansion of urban area from 1990 to 2010 has primarily occurred at the cost of most productive agricultural land fig 3 shows the observed spatial and temporal land use changes that has occurred in mardan city during the study period using landsat imageries a glance on land use trajectories shows that the percentage of impervious surfaces is shrinking while on the other hand the concentration of land producing food is growing from the core towards the outskirts of the study area 4 3 impact of land use and land cover change on groundwater level when the rapid modification of land use land cover occurs the natural ground surface is replaced by impervious surfaces which interrupts surface runoff and penetration of water deep into the ground the hasty increase in population of the study area has caused to augment withdrawal of fresh water from ground and has consistently jeopardized the potential of groundwater the study discloses that the area under built environment has doubled from 30 in 1990 to over 60 in 2010 according to khan et al 2019 when 10 20 percent land cover of an area is transformed to impervious surfaces resulting in an increase of runoff by two folds although deep and shallow permeation of water are reduced by nearly 4 percent deep infiltration is more consequential in recharging of groundwater aquifers than shallow infiltration the study area was divided into six zones as portrayed in illustration 5 and tables 4 and 5 in order to assess the association of rapid urban development with the variation in groundwater level over the specific time period 1990 2010 to figure out the correlation between impervious land and water table the measurement of area in each zone is requisite as shown in the illustrations 3 5 and table 4 and 5 it is apparent from fig 3 that the development in built environment can been seen in all zones in mardan city during the study period nevertheless most of this urban growth has taken place in the first 3 zones the investigation discloses that an overall increase of 24 in built uses was recorded in zone 1 which has resulted in decline of water level in the areas of karwan road from 27 feet to 38 feet and in bari cham 25 feet40 feet during 1990 2010 in zone 2 built environment has jumped from merely 48 to over 80 falling down falling the level of water to 40 feet from 30 feet in the area of hoti khas the groundwater table in zone 3 has lowered down in various wells including uc hoti from 27 to 38 feet sikandarey from 59 to 70 feet and muslim abad from 17 to 80 feet as an outcome of this hasty growth of impervious surfaces from 30 to over 67 water level has descended in par hoti 18 30 feet shah dand 11 65 feet and farm koroona 12 27 feet in zone 4 during the study period advancement in urban area in zone 5 has resulted in the depletion of water table in sugar mill area from 19 to 60 and in gujar ghari 18 52 feet respectively in zone 6 again a decreased in water table has been recorded wapda colony from 24 to 48 feet the lowering down of water level and diminishing of groundwater aquifers is a grave threat to the potential groundwater sources in mardan city 5 conclusion this study used an integrated approach to appraise the effects of urban advancement on groundwater table in mardan city satellite images were employed to assess the land use dynamics over the past two decades 1990 2010 the analysis shows that the growing pressure of population rising income together with subsequent rapid urbanization have modified the contemporary land use land cover pattern most of the fertile agricultural land has lost to built uses which has resulted in an enormous increased in impervious surfaces the research area was also divided into six different zones in order to calculate the impervious area and was then closely related to groundwater table the study revealed that most of this growth in built uses has occurred in the first three zones and the intensity of food basket land is enhancing towards the outskirts of the city this increasing trends of sealing the natural ground surface with impervious surface cover has the capability to decrease the permeability of rainwater into the ground affecting the recharging rate moreover this unprecedented urban expansion and growth in population were the main reasons behind groundwater fluctuation and deterioration furthermore the study area is expanding

12081,the research aims to uncover the variation of morphometric features of wadi mezal within the western plateau in najaf governorate and the extent of the influence of natural geographical factors represented by the geological situation and also the characteristics of the surface climate water resources soil and natural vegetation on the variation of these characteristics which showed that the basin reached maturity or balance in its cycle the basin occupies an area of 654 km2 most of which is within the western plateau of the najaf governorate as the basin is located within the stable non twisting pier at the division of iraq physiographically the research included an introduction that comprises the problem hypothesis goal importance methodology and spatial boundaries the first topic came to study the natural factors of the study area while the second topic dealt with an analysis of the most important morphometric characteristics of the basin and its water network using geographical information systems and a number of important programs and then the most important results were reached graphical abstract image 1 keywords morphometric geographical information geological groundwater 1 introduction the wadi mezal basin represents an integrated geomorphological unit this contributed to the formation of natural characteristics represented by the geological situation the surface nature climate water resources soil and natural plants as well as the processes resulted from these factors throughout the ages this formation took place especially during the quadratic time which witnessed most of the changes on the surface of the globe the main features are still seen an analysis of morphometric characteristics is one of the recent trends in applied geomorphology this is concerned with the surveying and formal characteristics of the water network of river basins and streams it helps in analyzing them according to precise mathematical and engineering foundations that benefit the specialists thus it helps to utilize them in various fields the research area is part of the iraqi western plateau within parts of the lower valleys and the hajar region with a dry desert climate for major part of the year therefore a dense network of valley was formed in light of rainy climatic conditions dating back to the pleistocene era the study problem is summarized in the following question 1 how diverse are the morphometric characteristics of the wadi mezal basin 2 what is the relationship of natural geographic features and geomorphic processes in those characteristics the research hypothesis is that there is a variation in the morphometric characteristics of the wadi mezal basin it is due to the result of the influence of the natural geographical characteristics and geomorphic processes on these characteristics the research aims to identify the most important natural geographic characteristics and geomorphic processes it has contributed significantly to the variation of surveying terrain and formal characteristics of the water network of the wadi mezal basin it is to present a clear picture with substantial specialties the importance of the study is to show how there is a lack of interest in the desert environment and its natural resources it is to bring about an awareness that needs to intensify field studies to serve the region and invest a lot of its natural resources that are still out of reach of the researchers 2 study area the wadi mezal basin is located in the southwestern part of iraq within the administrative borders of najaf governorate it occupies an area of 654 km2 and takes in its extension an irregular shape similar to the rectangular shape it is bounded on the north by the shanafia side of the qadisiyah governorate and on the east by the wadi madoud basin and from the east west of wadi abu talh basin it extends astronomically between the longitude 44 23 43 35 and two latitudes 31 42 31 03 as shown in fig 1 3 methods to reach the desired goal of the study the descriptive and analytical method was followed using the quantitative method the results were analyzed by relying on some modern technologies represented by geographic information systems some programs were also used that facilitate the researcher s work and give accurate results in addition some general data and climate data related to the research area was also taken into account fig 2 shows the summary of present study 3 1 first the natural characteristics of the study area natural characteristics play a great role in morphometric characteristics it is especially shown to be related to geology and climate with its various elements and its role in weathering and erosion the changes and modification in the main features throughout the ages has been observed which is shown as follows 3 2 geological situation the research area lies within the structural divisions of iraq in the stable pavement stable shelf within the salman belt according to the buday and jassim division al khalaf 1965 it is a part of the western plateau of iraq and has been affected to a varying level by the movements of arab plate the effect is less than it is in iraq due to the distance of the region from the center of the earth movement the hardness of the rocks that resists the ground area is also the focus of the present study most of the formations of the research area are due to the formations of euphrates and dammam by 80 and 15 respectively the total area of the basin and a few portions of the flood plain deposits are at a rate of 5 of the total area for the basin there are also many faults in the area the most important of which is the abu al jeer rift which passes through the northern parts of the basin in addition to this the other faults in the northeast southwestern direction have greatly affected the extensions of some valleys including the wadi mezal this is the subject of the present research 3 3 surface the entire wadi mezal basin is located within the lower valley region this is a plateau that generally descends from the southwest to the northeast the general surface slope rate is 0 5 per 1 km the highest peak in the region is 325 m which is far southwest of it the lowest depression is at the low level of the hor reaches 20 m above sea level the slope of the surface varies between the western and eastern sides of the basin it is concluded by the researcher from this that the surface of the basin is an asymmetric plateau in terms of height and local slope in most of its parts it is also noted that sometimes the slope is northeast and sometimes it is northwest 3 4 climate during the quadratic period the study area was exposed to climatic changes represented by rainy periods that interfered with dry periods these rainy periods resulted in large floods that contributed to the formation of valleys in the research area these rains carried sediments deposited in the depressions and were gradually filled these valleys are one of the legacies in the western plateau where the amounts of precipitation exceeded its amounts at the present time in a very large level the current dry desert climate has led to the alteration and change in the features of these aspects contributing to its geomorphology the wadi mezal basin is characterized by high temperature in general the annual average temperature in the najaf climatic station reached 30 c during the period 1977 2010 july is regarded as the hottest month with a temperature of 45 c however the temperatures drop to 15 c during the month of january and during the same period the annual and monthly thermal range rises to 30 c this activates the weathering operations like drying breaking up the soil and making it susceptible to erosion when it comes to the rain the amount of annual rain in the najaf climatic station during the mentioned period amounted to 104 mm it falls during winter till the beginning of spring characterized by rainfall on the basin the impact would be significant in the basin areas that fall upon very heavy showers leading to the occurrence of water erosion in the ranks of the valleys of the basin wind speeds vary in the najaf station as they reach 3 1 m s and they vary accordingly during the months of the year the highest can be in the summer months as they reach 3 8 m s in june they are at the lowest point in the winter when it reaches 2 4 m s for the month of january the northwestern wind prevailed during these months of the year in the region as its frequency of 37 3 and its rate of 34 6 was from the rest of the wind in the study area then the north wind came second with a rate of 21 6 of the total wind and rest ratios wind is one of the important factors in the formation of earthly phenomena which in turn affects the morphology of the valleys as it performs the operations of ablation and refinement along with the transfer of crumbs and their sedimentation in depressions and valleys basins this also contributes to changing their morphometric properties as well as the process of evaporation and drying the soil surface 3 5 surface water with regard to surface water the rainfall over the basin of the research area is the main source despite its varying amounts and suddenness a greater part of it is lost by evaporation transpiration and infiltration into the ground and thus the region is free of surface water but sudden rain of limited hours through a number of years or violent torrents at which time rainwater flows in the form of temporary surface channels may continue to flow for a short period in some of the lower parts of the basin in the form of temporary water channels in the bottom of the riverine valleys 3 6 soil the study of soil morphology represented by its characteristics varieties and geographical distribution is important in morphometric studies of dry valleys this is because soil has a large and influential role in other geographical characteristics such as water resources and natural vegetation soil is the vessel that embraces living organisms and supplies them with survival requirements the characteristics of the soils of the research area were affected by a group of interrelated factors that controlled its formation the most prominent among them were foundation rocks climate terrain natural vegetation and neighborhoods in addition to the time factor so the characteristics of the soil vary according to the influence of these factors according to these characteristics many types of soils have emerged the most important of which are 1 swampy soil covered with silt it is characterized with a clayey soil or a mixture of clay based on an impermeable layer and its surface is mostly covered by a silt layer this soil is saturated with water so the average depth of the ground water in it is less than 1 m and may reach the surface as it rises in the proportion of salts the surface of this soil is flat and its slope rate reaches 0 0002 cracks appear in it when it dries and some salt deposits in it which makes it retain water and surface runoff especially at the mouth of the valley that ends in it within the lands of hor salib 2 wadi bottom soil these are sedimentary soils transported by running water in the bottoms of valleys after the low speed of water and the low slope consist of sandy and gravel mixture mixed with silt and clay the texture of the surface layer of this soil alluvial mixture increases and its smoothness increases with its increasing depth the color of the wet layer is brown or yellowish brown 3 flood soils or depressions it consists of soft sediments mixed with sand silt clay less gravel and large boulders some of these soils have a thickness of 60 cm and runoff may occur after the rain falls 4 mixed desert gypsum soil this soil covers most of the study area the soil is characterized by a low salinity and high gypsum this is due to the lack of sufficient amount of rain to wash it from the soil surface subjected to wind erosion its depth exceeds several centimeters and may be rocky in some areas due to wind deflection 3 7 natural plant the research area is characterized by the lack of distribution of the natural plant which worked to increase the effectiveness and activity of different geomorphic processes the natural plant in the study area was affected by several factors the most important of which is the deterioration of climate fluctuation and drought during the last ten years this is in addition to the human factor represented by the way in which the pastures are exploited as the plant density is inversely proportional to the intensity of grazing the overgrazing leads to the lack of vegetation this can divide the natural vegetation in the study area as following 3 8 annuals plants annual plants constitute about 73 of the total desert plants in the study area they are short lived plants and mostly grow during the period from november to may the intensity of their spread varies depending on the amount of rainfall the majority of annual plants from the evangelical family such as wild oats wild barley ritual barley and the annual legumes like abu damim are spread in limited areas especially in the depressions and places where water collects among these are also plants such as m polymarpha melilotus indicus t monatha artemisia harba alba achillea fragrantissima haloxylon salicronicum 3 9 the perennial plant group the perennial plant group constitutes about 25 of the total desert plants they are permanent plants that have adapted themselves to drought conditions some of them possess long roots that help them absorb water from the depths of the soil some of them store water in the leafy parts that grow with pointed leaves and which are covered with a waxy layer to prevent moisture leakage most of these plants grow on the banks and in the bottom of valleys and depressions which helps to provide moisture content to them in addition due to the availability of deep and fertile soils artemisia harba alba achillea fragrantissima and haloxylon salicronicum are among the semi woody bushes that grow here and reach a height of more than 1m rhamnus a phrase on shade plants that have sharp thorns and many branches tolerate drought but do not bear low temperatures and have solid wood among them are also al arfaj plants that are perennial shrubs which reach a maximum height of 70 cm al dujaili 2001 3 10 second morphometric characteristics of the wadi mezal basin morphometric characteristics is a recent geomorphic study that is concerned with the study of the engineering properties it deals with the exact quantity of some features and terrestrial shapes that result from the erosion system this depends mainly on analyzing the levels of elevations and the directions of the slopes these characteristics are as follows 3 11 area characteristics determining the area of a river basin is an important issue in morphometric studies the area directly affects the amount of rain fall over the basin as there is a direct relationship between basin area and the volume of water discharge thus the actual value of running water and its flowing systems differ from one basin to another according to geographical location there is a relationship between the water resources that it acquires and loses through evaporation and leakage also the difference in the area of the water basin and the level of its lands depends on the variation in ground movements rock type terrain and climatic characteristics al salawi 1989 there is a correlation between the area of the basins and erosion operations as the area of water basins increases the activity of the water erosion process increases it is clear from table 1 that the total area of the wadi mezal basin is 654 km2 this is considered as one of the medium sized basins that extended within the area of the lower valleys while the length of the real basin is 110 km as for the ideal length it reached 101 km and the basin circumference reached 267 km the survey properties vary directly with the age of the valley so the lower the spatial dimensions the more is the novelty of the valley see table 2 with regard to the average basin width which represents the transverse straight distance between the two most distant points on the basin circumference it has been extracted according to the following equation ashour 1986 1 a v e r a g e b a s i n w i d t h b a s i n a r e a k m 2 b a s i n l e n g t h k m thus the average width of the basin was 6 4 km and the basin was distinguished by an increase in its length compared to its width the variation in the average width is due to the variation of the air and water erosion processes according to the variation of the rocks that descend towards the main valley 3 12 morphological characteristics the shape of the basin is a reflection of the geological and natural conditions that affect the formation of the basin and its appearance with varied morphological patterns it is just as the shape of the basin is affected by all stages of geomorphological development that gave its current image the study is entirely based on the use of mathematical equations which would give a quantum geomorphological description of the basin properties that relate to its shape hydrological significance of this study and a significant impact on water discharge al enein 1990 it can take place in the valleys of the basin and measure the rates of water erosion and the effect of this is seen on the resulting terrestrial shapes the formal characteristics of the basin are as follows elongation rate this rate indicates the approach of the valley shape to the rectangular shape and is expressed by the following formula salama 1982 2 e l o n g a t i o n r a t e d i a m e t e r o f c i r c l e e q u a l t o t h e b a s i n a r e a k m m a x i m u m l e n g t h k m the elongation of the basin form increases if the equation s value falls to less than the correct one with the lowest value that is when the length of the circle s diameter decreases relative to the maximum circumference while the basin form approaches the circular shape if the result approaches the correct one from the application of the above equation it becomes clear that the average elongation reached 0 2 table 2 from this we conclude that the basin is approaching the rectangular shape which is characterized by irregular water flow in terms of time and in relatively small quantities rotation rate the rotation rate indicates the extent to which the basin approaches the circular shape and the regularity of the water dividing line the values that approach the correct one indicate the approach of the basin to the circular shape whenever the ratio is less than the correct one the basin changes its shape from the circular to roundness through the following equation 3 rotation rate basin area km 2 the area of a circle whose circumference is equal to the circumference of the basin itself km 2 after applying the equation the rotation rate of the basin reached to 0 3 these values indicate the distance of the basin from the circular shape this means that its circumference or the dividing lines of the waters surrounding each basin do not go regularly rather pass through noticeable aliasing which affects the length of the sewage water length to width ratio it is also an indicator to know the shape of the basin and indicates the ratio of the length to the basin width its results are similar to those values for the elongation rate that was previously mentioned elongation of the shape of the basin increases if the value of its length to its width increases the length to width ratio of the basin has been extracted according to the following equation ritter 1982 4 l e n g t h t o w i d t h b a s i n l e n g t h k m b a s i n w i d t h k m the ratio of length to width reached 15 7 which is high and indicates that the basin tends to elongate more than roundness and this distance is due to the winding of the water dividing lines in it basin shape factor this parameter indicates the reciprocal relationship between each area of the basin and its length and it is expressed by the following formula 5 b a s i n s h a p e f a c t o r b a s i n a r e a k m 2 s q u a r e b a s i n l e n g t h k m the lower values for the correct one for this parameter indicate the relative decrease in the numerator of this relationship basin area in relation to its position square of the basin length the increase in the length of both sides of this parameter and the approach of the basin gives a triangle shape if the value of the basin is characterized by its increase with the value of the square of its length then the shape of the basin is close to a square shape from the application of the above equation we find that the coefficient of the basin shape reached 0 06 which is lower of one value the decrease in the value of the coefficient of the shape and its approach to a triangular shape affects the drainage system when the source area constitutes the head of the triangle and the downstream area is its base the water discharge increases immediately after the rains fall it thus causes to the rise of the water level quickly due to the proximity of the streams and the slopes to the main downstream however if the head of the triangle is the area of the estuary and its base is at the headwaters then the water will reach it alternately according to the distance of the streams and the slopes from the estuary merger factor this parameter is useful for knowing the corrosive stage of the basin where high values indicate that the basin has a higher level of aliasing in its vicinity and less level of consistency in the form the low values indicate that the basin has gone a long way in the corrosive stage and is still continuing in it it is calculated by dividing the basin circumference by the circumference of the circle where the area is equivalent to the basin area as in the following equation stanley 1977 6 c o f f i c i e n t o f f u s i o n b a s i n c i r c u m f e r e n c e k m t h e c i r c u m f e r e n c e o f a c i r c l e t h e a r e a o f w h i c h i s e q u i v a l e n t t o t h e a r e a o f t h e b a s i n k m applying this equation it was found that the values of the fusion coefficient are low which indicates the inconsistency of the basin and the divergence of the water dividing lines from the center of the basin this reflects the extent of difference and rock variation within the basin 3 13 third terrain characteristics the extent of river basin damage represents the final result from the act of different weathering and erosion factors in the geological formations of the basins and their structural systems from the beginning of the basin hydrology and geomorphology has a great importance in knowing the processes of water and air erosions weathering processes and their role in shaping the surface of the earth as it is a reflection of the rock nature and its structural characteristics al baywani 2000 the knowledge of the development of the basin and the cycle of erosion and among the most important measures that were developed to know these characteristics are terrain ratio the terrain ratio is a measure of knowledge of the topographical nature of a region or of any basin it means the difference between the highest and lowest point in the basin is measured in meters to the length of the basin in kilometers this is a good indicator in the estimation of the sediment transported in kind and quantity as its ratio increases with increasing the ratio of the terrain it may extend long distances from the basin and this contributes to the formation of different geomorphological forms including fans alluvial cones and bad lands its effect on the speed of water flow after heavy rain fall increases with an increase in that percentage this is reflected with the increase in effect of the efficiency of the water activity which in turn it has on the increase of the transferred sediments this is measured according to the mechanical method trapp 1997 7 t e r r a i n r a t i o b a s i n t o p o g r a p h y d i f f e r e n e b e t w e e n t h e h i g h e s t a n d l o w e s t b a s i n m b a s i n l e n g t h k m after applying the above equation the basin topography ratio reached 3 01m km table 3 it clearly indicates the activity of the water erosion process in it and shows the relationship between the ratio of the terrain and the slope factor as the slope ratio is low then the proportion of the terrain is less it has to do with determining the wadi capacity basin texture this parameter shows the size of the erosion to which the earth was exposed the extent of its severity and the extent of convergence or spacing of the river drainage network without taking into account the lengths of the valleys indicate the severity of the basin break and the high rates of erosion it is extracted according to the following formula mkoula 1986 8 b a s i n t e x t u r e n u m b e r o f v a l l e y s b a s i n c i r c u m f e r e n c e k m the basin texture is rough if the texture s rate is less than 4 valley km and the average is between 4 and 10 it is soft if it is more than 10 it appears from the application of the equation that the basin texture has reached 7 this is an average texture due to the nature of the rock components of the weak resistance of the aquatic processes of sand and dolomitic rocks relative terrain the relative terrain represents the relative relationship between the terrain of the basin the difference between the highest and lowest point in the basin the perimeter of the basin and its implications indicate a negative relationship between the relative terrain and the degree of rock resistance when the relative terrain is measured according to the following equation al enein 1990 9 relative terrain basin topography m basin circumference km from the application of the above equation it appears that the relative terrain rate reached 1 14 which are intermediate values indicating the presence of relative terrain that increases erosion if factors causing erosion processes such as water and wind are available hyposomal integration hypsomeric integration indicates the relationship between the basin area basin topography and expresses this relationship by the following formula 10 hypometry integration basin area km 2 basin topography m the high hypsometry integration values denote the large basin area and the low values denote basin molarity trapp 1997 this case is represented in basins that were able to capture waterways of lesser strength these waterways have reached advanced stages in their erosion period while indicating low hyposomal integration values on the novelty of the age of the basins the small basin areas are still at the beginning of the phases of the erosive form that are cycled from the application of the above equation it was found that the value of the hyposomal integration of the basin reached 2 1 km2 m which are relatively high values indicating that the basin went a long way the roughness value it is the relationship between the topography of the basin the difference between the highest and lowest point in the basin and the lengths of the drainage network ducts this parameter is expressed by the following formula al enein 1990 11 v a l u e b a s i n t o p o g r a p h y x l o n g i t u d i n a l d r a i n a g e d e n s i t y 1000 as the value of roughness decreases from the first stages of the erosive cycle of the basin and then begins to gradually increase until it reaches its maximum level at the beginning of the ripening stage its value gradually begins to decrease again at the end of the erosive cycle from a study of the roughness value of the basin it was found that it reached 0 09 which are low values indicating that the basin is approaching the equilibrium stage 3 14 fourth groundwater resources geomorphological characteristics especially those related to morphometric characteristics play a large role in increasing the water reserves of the area the capacity of the water basin and its shape and topography greatly affect the feeding process and the renewal of the groundwater and the possibility of investing it well it may contribute to support the national economy through agricultural and industrial processes the origin of groundwater in the western plateau region varies from groundwater of marine origin represented by the euphrates reservoir to groundwater of air origin represented by the dammam reservoir it is the most important groundwater reservoir in the study area because the geological formations that contain these reservoirs spread within large areas of the study area it is rich in carbonates due to the presence of limestone in its formations the groundwater in the study area is as follows 3 15 a springs spring water varies in terms of its quantity from year to year and from one season to another in relation to the amount of rain fall it depends on other factors such as the nature of the rocks that contain the water being porous or many cracks and breaks and the area of the storage basin the water may rush in the form of sporadic rivers and be in spaced areas and this happens within the porous rocks if they are connected with a rock formation that does not have pores the springs are of importance to humans since ancient times where people live near them and depend on the mineral water that comes out from some springs also the water that comes out of the springs is more easy to use than the water of the different wells it is noted that most of these springs have decreased their productivity as in ain al rahba and ain sayyid hussain this is due to the large number of surface or artesian wells that have been dug in recent years and also because of the neglect suffered by these springs where it is necessary to continue cleaning its openings from air and water sediments the springs affect and are affected by the morphology of the valley by providing the moisture content of the soil they help in the presence of a vegetation that contributes greatly to reducing erosion operations as well as fixing the moving sand and preventing it from forming sand dunes and the possibility of using them in agriculture this is a positive factor in increasing the volume of water by reducing the volume of runoff and the rate of evaporation 3 16 b wells the layers carrying this water from limestone is the formation of dammam and topped with layers of marl and clay to form the euphrates they form an impermeable cover for these layers and the feeding area is from the western plateau which extends the basin of wadi mizal the flow of water from the wells is uneven and depends on the amount of cracks and channels of dissolution and their extension and on the quality of the wells if it is shallow it has a salinity ranging from 4500 3000 mg l2 wells are considered one of the oldest methods for groundwater and one of the most common in iraq and it is not intended for digging for drinking and household needs rather water is used in agriculture especially when there is no rain al salawi 1989 most of the wells in the study area are of artesian type concentrated in the northern part numbering 20 wells most of it is used in winter planting for wheat and barley crops these wells vary in their location depth level and water level the highest depth reaches 60 m and the lowest depth reaches 25 m as for the surface wells they number 10 wells which are used in irrigation for agricultural crops these wells have a role in stabilizing the soil through the moisture contained in them which makes them constantly wet and this contributes to increasing the density of agricultural and natural plants it has an indirect effect on the morphometric characteristics of the valleys and their basins by holding the soil and saving it from erosion al ghamdi 2006 the percentage of moisture remains higher than that is surrounding it in addition to the type of soil present several surface water and groundwater resources across the world provide residents with fresh water and are used for agricultural industrial and energy based purposes kalhor et al 2019 4 conclusions the research concluded that the surface of the basin is a plateau that descends in a general direction from the southwest to the northeast while the direction of the local slopes that affected the water drainage and its directions varied this is in turn led to the change of a number of morphometric characteristics the natural geographical factors had an effect on the variability of morphometric characteristics of the basin especially those related to the quality of rocks and climate it was found through an analysis of the morphometric characteristics that the basin has reached the stage of maturity or equilibrium and has gone a long way in stripping processes then to avoid future water shortage and manage the groundwater resource of najaf sustainably it is important to implement all the management interventions together declaration of competing interest

12081,the research aims to uncover the variation of morphometric features of wadi mezal within the western plateau in najaf governorate and the extent of the influence of natural geographical factors represented by the geological situation and also the characteristics of the surface climate water resources soil and natural vegetation on the variation of these characteristics which showed that the basin reached maturity or balance in its cycle the basin occupies an area of 654 km2 most of which is within the western plateau of the najaf governorate as the basin is located within the stable non twisting pier at the division of iraq physiographically the research included an introduction that comprises the problem hypothesis goal importance methodology and spatial boundaries the first topic came to study the natural factors of the study area while the second topic dealt with an analysis of the most important morphometric characteristics of the basin and its water network using geographical information systems and a number of important programs and then the most important results were reached graphical abstract image 1 keywords morphometric geographical information geological groundwater 1 introduction the wadi mezal basin represents an integrated geomorphological unit this contributed to the formation of natural characteristics represented by the geological situation the surface nature climate water resources soil and natural plants as well as the processes resulted from these factors throughout the ages this formation took place especially during the quadratic time which witnessed most of the changes on the surface of the globe the main features are still seen an analysis of morphometric characteristics is one of the recent trends in applied geomorphology this is concerned with the surveying and formal characteristics of the water network of river basins and streams it helps in analyzing them according to precise mathematical and engineering foundations that benefit the specialists thus it helps to utilize them in various fields the research area is part of the iraqi western plateau within parts of the lower valleys and the hajar region with a dry desert climate for major part of the year therefore a dense network of valley was formed in light of rainy climatic conditions dating back to the pleistocene era the study problem is summarized in the following question 1 how diverse are the morphometric characteristics of the wadi mezal basin 2 what is the relationship of natural geographic features and geomorphic processes in those characteristics the research hypothesis is that there is a variation in the morphometric characteristics of the wadi mezal basin it is due to the result of the influence of the natural geographical characteristics and geomorphic processes on these characteristics the research aims to identify the most important natural geographic characteristics and geomorphic processes it has contributed significantly to the variation of surveying terrain and formal characteristics of the water network of the wadi mezal basin it is to present a clear picture with substantial specialties the importance of the study is to show how there is a lack of interest in the desert environment and its natural resources it is to bring about an awareness that needs to intensify field studies to serve the region and invest a lot of its natural resources that are still out of reach of the researchers 2 study area the wadi mezal basin is located in the southwestern part of iraq within the administrative borders of najaf governorate it occupies an area of 654 km2 and takes in its extension an irregular shape similar to the rectangular shape it is bounded on the north by the shanafia side of the qadisiyah governorate and on the east by the wadi madoud basin and from the east west of wadi abu talh basin it extends astronomically between the longitude 44 23 43 35 and two latitudes 31 42 31 03 as shown in fig 1 3 methods to reach the desired goal of the study the descriptive and analytical method was followed using the quantitative method the results were analyzed by relying on some modern technologies represented by geographic information systems some programs were also used that facilitate the researcher s work and give accurate results in addition some general data and climate data related to the research area was also taken into account fig 2 shows the summary of present study 3 1 first the natural characteristics of the study area natural characteristics play a great role in morphometric characteristics it is especially shown to be related to geology and climate with its various elements and its role in weathering and erosion the changes and modification in the main features throughout the ages has been observed which is shown as follows 3 2 geological situation the research area lies within the structural divisions of iraq in the stable pavement stable shelf within the salman belt according to the buday and jassim division al khalaf 1965 it is a part of the western plateau of iraq and has been affected to a varying level by the movements of arab plate the effect is less than it is in iraq due to the distance of the region from the center of the earth movement the hardness of the rocks that resists the ground area is also the focus of the present study most of the formations of the research area are due to the formations of euphrates and dammam by 80 and 15 respectively the total area of the basin and a few portions of the flood plain deposits are at a rate of 5 of the total area for the basin there are also many faults in the area the most important of which is the abu al jeer rift which passes through the northern parts of the basin in addition to this the other faults in the northeast southwestern direction have greatly affected the extensions of some valleys including the wadi mezal this is the subject of the present research 3 3 surface the entire wadi mezal basin is located within the lower valley region this is a plateau that generally descends from the southwest to the northeast the general surface slope rate is 0 5 per 1 km the highest peak in the region is 325 m which is far southwest of it the lowest depression is at the low level of the hor reaches 20 m above sea level the slope of the surface varies between the western and eastern sides of the basin it is concluded by the researcher from this that the surface of the basin is an asymmetric plateau in terms of height and local slope in most of its parts it is also noted that sometimes the slope is northeast and sometimes it is northwest 3 4 climate during the quadratic period the study area was exposed to climatic changes represented by rainy periods that interfered with dry periods these rainy periods resulted in large floods that contributed to the formation of valleys in the research area these rains carried sediments deposited in the depressions and were gradually filled these valleys are one of the legacies in the western plateau where the amounts of precipitation exceeded its amounts at the present time in a very large level the current dry desert climate has led to the alteration and change in the features of these aspects contributing to its geomorphology the wadi mezal basin is characterized by high temperature in general the annual average temperature in the najaf climatic station reached 30 c during the period 1977 2010 july is regarded as the hottest month with a temperature of 45 c however the temperatures drop to 15 c during the month of january and during the same period the annual and monthly thermal range rises to 30 c this activates the weathering operations like drying breaking up the soil and making it susceptible to erosion when it comes to the rain the amount of annual rain in the najaf climatic station during the mentioned period amounted to 104 mm it falls during winter till the beginning of spring characterized by rainfall on the basin the impact would be significant in the basin areas that fall upon very heavy showers leading to the occurrence of water erosion in the ranks of the valleys of the basin wind speeds vary in the najaf station as they reach 3 1 m s and they vary accordingly during the months of the year the highest can be in the summer months as they reach 3 8 m s in june they are at the lowest point in the winter when it reaches 2 4 m s for the month of january the northwestern wind prevailed during these months of the year in the region as its frequency of 37 3 and its rate of 34 6 was from the rest of the wind in the study area then the north wind came second with a rate of 21 6 of the total wind and rest ratios wind is one of the important factors in the formation of earthly phenomena which in turn affects the morphology of the valleys as it performs the operations of ablation and refinement along with the transfer of crumbs and their sedimentation in depressions and valleys basins this also contributes to changing their morphometric properties as well as the process of evaporation and drying the soil surface 3 5 surface water with regard to surface water the rainfall over the basin of the research area is the main source despite its varying amounts and suddenness a greater part of it is lost by evaporation transpiration and infiltration into the ground and thus the region is free of surface water but sudden rain of limited hours through a number of years or violent torrents at which time rainwater flows in the form of temporary surface channels may continue to flow for a short period in some of the lower parts of the basin in the form of temporary water channels in the bottom of the riverine valleys 3 6 soil the study of soil morphology represented by its characteristics varieties and geographical distribution is important in morphometric studies of dry valleys this is because soil has a large and influential role in other geographical characteristics such as water resources and natural vegetation soil is the vessel that embraces living organisms and supplies them with survival requirements the characteristics of the soils of the research area were affected by a group of interrelated factors that controlled its formation the most prominent among them were foundation rocks climate terrain natural vegetation and neighborhoods in addition to the time factor so the characteristics of the soil vary according to the influence of these factors according to these characteristics many types of soils have emerged the most important of which are 1 swampy soil covered with silt it is characterized with a clayey soil or a mixture of clay based on an impermeable layer and its surface is mostly covered by a silt layer this soil is saturated with water so the average depth of the ground water in it is less than 1 m and may reach the surface as it rises in the proportion of salts the surface of this soil is flat and its slope rate reaches 0 0002 cracks appear in it when it dries and some salt deposits in it which makes it retain water and surface runoff especially at the mouth of the valley that ends in it within the lands of hor salib 2 wadi bottom soil these are sedimentary soils transported by running water in the bottoms of valleys after the low speed of water and the low slope consist of sandy and gravel mixture mixed with silt and clay the texture of the surface layer of this soil alluvial mixture increases and its smoothness increases with its increasing depth the color of the wet layer is brown or yellowish brown 3 flood soils or depressions it consists of soft sediments mixed with sand silt clay less gravel and large boulders some of these soils have a thickness of 60 cm and runoff may occur after the rain falls 4 mixed desert gypsum soil this soil covers most of the study area the soil is characterized by a low salinity and high gypsum this is due to the lack of sufficient amount of rain to wash it from the soil surface subjected to wind erosion its depth exceeds several centimeters and may be rocky in some areas due to wind deflection 3 7 natural plant the research area is characterized by the lack of distribution of the natural plant which worked to increase the effectiveness and activity of different geomorphic processes the natural plant in the study area was affected by several factors the most important of which is the deterioration of climate fluctuation and drought during the last ten years this is in addition to the human factor represented by the way in which the pastures are exploited as the plant density is inversely proportional to the intensity of grazing the overgrazing leads to the lack of vegetation this can divide the natural vegetation in the study area as following 3 8 annuals plants annual plants constitute about 73 of the total desert plants in the study area they are short lived plants and mostly grow during the period from november to may the intensity of their spread varies depending on the amount of rainfall the majority of annual plants from the evangelical family such as wild oats wild barley ritual barley and the annual legumes like abu damim are spread in limited areas especially in the depressions and places where water collects among these are also plants such as m polymarpha melilotus indicus t monatha artemisia harba alba achillea fragrantissima haloxylon salicronicum 3 9 the perennial plant group the perennial plant group constitutes about 25 of the total desert plants they are permanent plants that have adapted themselves to drought conditions some of them possess long roots that help them absorb water from the depths of the soil some of them store water in the leafy parts that grow with pointed leaves and which are covered with a waxy layer to prevent moisture leakage most of these plants grow on the banks and in the bottom of valleys and depressions which helps to provide moisture content to them in addition due to the availability of deep and fertile soils artemisia harba alba achillea fragrantissima and haloxylon salicronicum are among the semi woody bushes that grow here and reach a height of more than 1m rhamnus a phrase on shade plants that have sharp thorns and many branches tolerate drought but do not bear low temperatures and have solid wood among them are also al arfaj plants that are perennial shrubs which reach a maximum height of 70 cm al dujaili 2001 3 10 second morphometric characteristics of the wadi mezal basin morphometric characteristics is a recent geomorphic study that is concerned with the study of the engineering properties it deals with the exact quantity of some features and terrestrial shapes that result from the erosion system this depends mainly on analyzing the levels of elevations and the directions of the slopes these characteristics are as follows 3 11 area characteristics determining the area of a river basin is an important issue in morphometric studies the area directly affects the amount of rain fall over the basin as there is a direct relationship between basin area and the volume of water discharge thus the actual value of running water and its flowing systems differ from one basin to another according to geographical location there is a relationship between the water resources that it acquires and loses through evaporation and leakage also the difference in the area of the water basin and the level of its lands depends on the variation in ground movements rock type terrain and climatic characteristics al salawi 1989 there is a correlation between the area of the basins and erosion operations as the area of water basins increases the activity of the water erosion process increases it is clear from table 1 that the total area of the wadi mezal basin is 654 km2 this is considered as one of the medium sized basins that extended within the area of the lower valleys while the length of the real basin is 110 km as for the ideal length it reached 101 km and the basin circumference reached 267 km the survey properties vary directly with the age of the valley so the lower the spatial dimensions the more is the novelty of the valley see table 2 with regard to the average basin width which represents the transverse straight distance between the two most distant points on the basin circumference it has been extracted according to the following equation ashour 1986 1 a v e r a g e b a s i n w i d t h b a s i n a r e a k m 2 b a s i n l e n g t h k m thus the average width of the basin was 6 4 km and the basin was distinguished by an increase in its length compared to its width the variation in the average width is due to the variation of the air and water erosion processes according to the variation of the rocks that descend towards the main valley 3 12 morphological characteristics the shape of the basin is a reflection of the geological and natural conditions that affect the formation of the basin and its appearance with varied morphological patterns it is just as the shape of the basin is affected by all stages of geomorphological development that gave its current image the study is entirely based on the use of mathematical equations which would give a quantum geomorphological description of the basin properties that relate to its shape hydrological significance of this study and a significant impact on water discharge al enein 1990 it can take place in the valleys of the basin and measure the rates of water erosion and the effect of this is seen on the resulting terrestrial shapes the formal characteristics of the basin are as follows elongation rate this rate indicates the approach of the valley shape to the rectangular shape and is expressed by the following formula salama 1982 2 e l o n g a t i o n r a t e d i a m e t e r o f c i r c l e e q u a l t o t h e b a s i n a r e a k m m a x i m u m l e n g t h k m the elongation of the basin form increases if the equation s value falls to less than the correct one with the lowest value that is when the length of the circle s diameter decreases relative to the maximum circumference while the basin form approaches the circular shape if the result approaches the correct one from the application of the above equation it becomes clear that the average elongation reached 0 2 table 2 from this we conclude that the basin is approaching the rectangular shape which is characterized by irregular water flow in terms of time and in relatively small quantities rotation rate the rotation rate indicates the extent to which the basin approaches the circular shape and the regularity of the water dividing line the values that approach the correct one indicate the approach of the basin to the circular shape whenever the ratio is less than the correct one the basin changes its shape from the circular to roundness through the following equation 3 rotation rate basin area km 2 the area of a circle whose circumference is equal to the circumference of the basin itself km 2 after applying the equation the rotation rate of the basin reached to 0 3 these values indicate the distance of the basin from the circular shape this means that its circumference or the dividing lines of the waters surrounding each basin do not go regularly rather pass through noticeable aliasing which affects the length of the sewage water length to width ratio it is also an indicator to know the shape of the basin and indicates the ratio of the length to the basin width its results are similar to those values for the elongation rate that was previously mentioned elongation of the shape of the basin increases if the value of its length to its width increases the length to width ratio of the basin has been extracted according to the following equation ritter 1982 4 l e n g t h t o w i d t h b a s i n l e n g t h k m b a s i n w i d t h k m the ratio of length to width reached 15 7 which is high and indicates that the basin tends to elongate more than roundness and this distance is due to the winding of the water dividing lines in it basin shape factor this parameter indicates the reciprocal relationship between each area of the basin and its length and it is expressed by the following formula 5 b a s i n s h a p e f a c t o r b a s i n a r e a k m 2 s q u a r e b a s i n l e n g t h k m the lower values for the correct one for this parameter indicate the relative decrease in the numerator of this relationship basin area in relation to its position square of the basin length the increase in the length of both sides of this parameter and the approach of the basin gives a triangle shape if the value of the basin is characterized by its increase with the value of the square of its length then the shape of the basin is close to a square shape from the application of the above equation we find that the coefficient of the basin shape reached 0 06 which is lower of one value the decrease in the value of the coefficient of the shape and its approach to a triangular shape affects the drainage system when the source area constitutes the head of the triangle and the downstream area is its base the water discharge increases immediately after the rains fall it thus causes to the rise of the water level quickly due to the proximity of the streams and the slopes to the main downstream however if the head of the triangle is the area of the estuary and its base is at the headwaters then the water will reach it alternately according to the distance of the streams and the slopes from the estuary merger factor this parameter is useful for knowing the corrosive stage of the basin where high values indicate that the basin has a higher level of aliasing in its vicinity and less level of consistency in the form the low values indicate that the basin has gone a long way in the corrosive stage and is still continuing in it it is calculated by dividing the basin circumference by the circumference of the circle where the area is equivalent to the basin area as in the following equation stanley 1977 6 c o f f i c i e n t o f f u s i o n b a s i n c i r c u m f e r e n c e k m t h e c i r c u m f e r e n c e o f a c i r c l e t h e a r e a o f w h i c h i s e q u i v a l e n t t o t h e a r e a o f t h e b a s i n k m applying this equation it was found that the values of the fusion coefficient are low which indicates the inconsistency of the basin and the divergence of the water dividing lines from the center of the basin this reflects the extent of difference and rock variation within the basin 3 13 third terrain characteristics the extent of river basin damage represents the final result from the act of different weathering and erosion factors in the geological formations of the basins and their structural systems from the beginning of the basin hydrology and geomorphology has a great importance in knowing the processes of water and air erosions weathering processes and their role in shaping the surface of the earth as it is a reflection of the rock nature and its structural characteristics al baywani 2000 the knowledge of the development of the basin and the cycle of erosion and among the most important measures that were developed to know these characteristics are terrain ratio the terrain ratio is a measure of knowledge of the topographical nature of a region or of any basin it means the difference between the highest and lowest point in the basin is measured in meters to the length of the basin in kilometers this is a good indicator in the estimation of the sediment transported in kind and quantity as its ratio increases with increasing the ratio of the terrain it may extend long distances from the basin and this contributes to the formation of different geomorphological forms including fans alluvial cones and bad lands its effect on the speed of water flow after heavy rain fall increases with an increase in that percentage this is reflected with the increase in effect of the efficiency of the water activity which in turn it has on the increase of the transferred sediments this is measured according to the mechanical method trapp 1997 7 t e r r a i n r a t i o b a s i n t o p o g r a p h y d i f f e r e n e b e t w e e n t h e h i g h e s t a n d l o w e s t b a s i n m b a s i n l e n g t h k m after applying the above equation the basin topography ratio reached 3 01m km table 3 it clearly indicates the activity of the water erosion process in it and shows the relationship between the ratio of the terrain and the slope factor as the slope ratio is low then the proportion of the terrain is less it has to do with determining the wadi capacity basin texture this parameter shows the size of the erosion to which the earth was exposed the extent of its severity and the extent of convergence or spacing of the river drainage network without taking into account the lengths of the valleys indicate the severity of the basin break and the high rates of erosion it is extracted according to the following formula mkoula 1986 8 b a s i n t e x t u r e n u m b e r o f v a l l e y s b a s i n c i r c u m f e r e n c e k m the basin texture is rough if the texture s rate is less than 4 valley km and the average is between 4 and 10 it is soft if it is more than 10 it appears from the application of the equation that the basin texture has reached 7 this is an average texture due to the nature of the rock components of the weak resistance of the aquatic processes of sand and dolomitic rocks relative terrain the relative terrain represents the relative relationship between the terrain of the basin the difference between the highest and lowest point in the basin the perimeter of the basin and its implications indicate a negative relationship between the relative terrain and the degree of rock resistance when the relative terrain is measured according to the following equation al enein 1990 9 relative terrain basin topography m basin circumference km from the application of the above equation it appears that the relative terrain rate reached 1 14 which are intermediate values indicating the presence of relative terrain that increases erosion if factors causing erosion processes such as water and wind are available hyposomal integration hypsomeric integration indicates the relationship between the basin area basin topography and expresses this relationship by the following formula 10 hypometry integration basin area km 2 basin topography m the high hypsometry integration values denote the large basin area and the low values denote basin molarity trapp 1997 this case is represented in basins that were able to capture waterways of lesser strength these waterways have reached advanced stages in their erosion period while indicating low hyposomal integration values on the novelty of the age of the basins the small basin areas are still at the beginning of the phases of the erosive form that are cycled from the application of the above equation it was found that the value of the hyposomal integration of the basin reached 2 1 km2 m which are relatively high values indicating that the basin went a long way the roughness value it is the relationship between the topography of the basin the difference between the highest and lowest point in the basin and the lengths of the drainage network ducts this parameter is expressed by the following formula al enein 1990 11 v a l u e b a s i n t o p o g r a p h y x l o n g i t u d i n a l d r a i n a g e d e n s i t y 1000 as the value of roughness decreases from the first stages of the erosive cycle of the basin and then begins to gradually increase until it reaches its maximum level at the beginning of the ripening stage its value gradually begins to decrease again at the end of the erosive cycle from a study of the roughness value of the basin it was found that it reached 0 09 which are low values indicating that the basin is approaching the equilibrium stage 3 14 fourth groundwater resources geomorphological characteristics especially those related to morphometric characteristics play a large role in increasing the water reserves of the area the capacity of the water basin and its shape and topography greatly affect the feeding process and the renewal of the groundwater and the possibility of investing it well it may contribute to support the national economy through agricultural and industrial processes the origin of groundwater in the western plateau region varies from groundwater of marine origin represented by the euphrates reservoir to groundwater of air origin represented by the dammam reservoir it is the most important groundwater reservoir in the study area because the geological formations that contain these reservoirs spread within large areas of the study area it is rich in carbonates due to the presence of limestone in its formations the groundwater in the study area is as follows 3 15 a springs spring water varies in terms of its quantity from year to year and from one season to another in relation to the amount of rain fall it depends on other factors such as the nature of the rocks that contain the water being porous or many cracks and breaks and the area of the storage basin the water may rush in the form of sporadic rivers and be in spaced areas and this happens within the porous rocks if they are connected with a rock formation that does not have pores the springs are of importance to humans since ancient times where people live near them and depend on the mineral water that comes out from some springs also the water that comes out of the springs is more easy to use than the water of the different wells it is noted that most of these springs have decreased their productivity as in ain al rahba and ain sayyid hussain this is due to the large number of surface or artesian wells that have been dug in recent years and also because of the neglect suffered by these springs where it is necessary to continue cleaning its openings from air and water sediments the springs affect and are affected by the morphology of the valley by providing the moisture content of the soil they help in the presence of a vegetation that contributes greatly to reducing erosion operations as well as fixing the moving sand and preventing it from forming sand dunes and the possibility of using them in agriculture this is a positive factor in increasing the volume of water by reducing the volume of runoff and the rate of evaporation 3 16 b wells the layers carrying this water from limestone is the formation of dammam and topped with layers of marl and clay to form the euphrates they form an impermeable cover for these layers and the feeding area is from the western plateau which extends the basin of wadi mizal the flow of water from the wells is uneven and depends on the amount of cracks and channels of dissolution and their extension and on the quality of the wells if it is shallow it has a salinity ranging from 4500 3000 mg l2 wells are considered one of the oldest methods for groundwater and one of the most common in iraq and it is not intended for digging for drinking and household needs rather water is used in agriculture especially when there is no rain al salawi 1989 most of the wells in the study area are of artesian type concentrated in the northern part numbering 20 wells most of it is used in winter planting for wheat and barley crops these wells vary in their location depth level and water level the highest depth reaches 60 m and the lowest depth reaches 25 m as for the surface wells they number 10 wells which are used in irrigation for agricultural crops these wells have a role in stabilizing the soil through the moisture contained in them which makes them constantly wet and this contributes to increasing the density of agricultural and natural plants it has an indirect effect on the morphometric characteristics of the valleys and their basins by holding the soil and saving it from erosion al ghamdi 2006 the percentage of moisture remains higher than that is surrounding it in addition to the type of soil present several surface water and groundwater resources across the world provide residents with fresh water and are used for agricultural industrial and energy based purposes kalhor et al 2019 4 conclusions the research concluded that the surface of the basin is a plateau that descends in a general direction from the southwest to the northeast while the direction of the local slopes that affected the water drainage and its directions varied this is in turn led to the change of a number of morphometric characteristics the natural geographical factors had an effect on the variability of morphometric characteristics of the basin especially those related to the quality of rocks and climate it was found through an analysis of the morphometric characteristics that the basin has reached the stage of maturity or equilibrium and has gone a long way in stripping processes then to avoid future water shortage and manage the groundwater resource of najaf sustainably it is important to implement all the management interventions together declaration of competing interest

of the study area rsv characterizes the standard values of groundwater wcv indicated the relative weight of co efficient values of the variables irrigation water quality index is represented as iwqi and the amounts of groundwater quality parameters is indicated by n the iwqi which is dimensionless parameters is ranged from 0 to 100 table 4 4 result and discussion 4 1 statistical analysis of hydro chemical parameters the total summary of the hydrogeological parameters on the analysis of descriptive statistical propagation and the result are shown in the groundwater statistical samples table 2 the groundwater quality variables for irrigation by the descriptive statistics propagation is shown in table 2 the structures of chemical and physical properties of groundwater parameters together with statistical methods such as the maximum minimum sd standard deviation median the average concentration of parameters are shown in table 2 the hydro geochemical composition of groundwater n 100 is showed inside the range of the district the parameters of groundwater sample electrical conductivity ec in the investigation area varies from 394 to 16 598 μs cm micro siemens per centimeter and the average value is 1937 77μs cm the range of total dissolved solids tds differ from 11 618 6 to 275 8 mg l with the average values of 1356 439 mg l the absorption of ph value of the investigation area for the corelation of irrigation purpopses varies from 3 7 to 10 01 with a normal average value of 7 4098 which specifies the dissolved carbonates are moderately large in the hco3 representing the nature mainly alkaline part in the samples of groundwater the ground water samples of the investigation area s main cations series have found in the order na ca2 mg2 k fe2 the cation series table 2 of the study area indicated that sodium has been considered the most leading cation which control the irrigation system for the purposes of groundwater in the investigation area and concentration of its differs from 20 78 to 1157 813 mg l and the average value 302 7172 mg l in the investigation areas the main anions dominancy of groundwater samples have found in the series of order namely cl so4 2 no3 the chloride is the most leading anion of the investigation area in purposes of irrigation system of groundwater samples and the concentration of its differs from 4700 to 0 mg l with average value

among the features of physicochemical properties of groundwater samples that can expose the sources of solutes and the procedure which has made the observation of groundwater hydrochemical compositions the numerical degree of the relations of groundwater physicochemical factors spoke by the coefficient of connection fluctuates between 1 and 1 as per the factual import of the evaluated connection of the framework a higher connection lattice coefficient near 1 method a decent positive connection among two hydrogeological variables and its incentive around 0 methods with no connection among the two groundwater factors in general the outcomes express the higher connections among s certain sets of groundwater variables appearing when r 0 8 measured as emphatically corresponded though r esteem somewhere in the range of 0 5 and 0 8 shows moderate correlations a negative coefficient express that the measureable factors are developing in inverse ways in this present investigation spss version 20 the package of statistical software programming bundle has utilized to figure connection lattice examination with the outcomes recorded in table 3 table 3 gives the relationship grid resultant values among the groundwater quality factors of the investigation areas and it very well might be comprehended that from this connection network ec and tds practically 99 have profoundly associated one another ec and tds have higher 85 ideal connection with ca na cl so4 and sar the most grounded critical connections among the factors were r 0 70 tolerably huge connection among the parameters r esteems somewhere in the range of 0 5 and 0 7 and r 0 adversely huge relationship among the factors that is immaterial relationship between the groundwater factors 4 2 suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation purposes 4 2 1 comparison of salinity hazard on groundwater irrigation based on ec and tds saltiness or alkalinity conditions is a significant thought for the irrigation system by groundwater if the nature of groundwater is considered as great or free from salinity the soil and irrigation practices is also good and it helps to produce higher harvest yield the reasonableness of groundwater for irrigation system relies on saltiness and the sodium content in connection to the measures of ca2 and mg2 or sar diersing and nancy 2009 simsek and gunduz 2007 the standard of most influential groundwater distinction on yield proficiency is considered by the index of saltiness that has multiplied by the values of electrical conductivity the salt is originated by the dissolved mineral groundwater that is shown a high salinity table by ahmed et al 2002 yield profitability is exceptionally influenced when saltiness danger of ec is 3 ds m and it is great if ec is 0 25 ds m and furthermore great irrigation system by groundwater through a tds fig 5a value 450 mg l though that with more noteworthy than 2000 mg l is unacceptable for irrigation purposes if there is a higher cumulative absorption of ec there is also reducing groundwater snap by the plant and creasing the higher efficiency proportion soil structure permeability and aeration are also affected by salinity and among the properties of aeration which are mainly considered as the indirect parameters of the affection of plant growth the quantity of total dissolved solids are also depended by the water quality of irrigation and effect on the quality of irrigation this is a direct result of diminishing plant development rates because of diminished water take up the groundwater quality classification basis on the irrigation purposes of different parameters are used based on salinity hazard on ssp na and sar are done according to literatures balachandar et al 2010 sadashivaiah et al 2008 see fig 4 and table 4 the essential impact of high ec on groundwater for crop productivity that cannot take the proper substances of irrigation here tds and ec make a higher impact on hydrochemical parameters the higher amount of ec the lower groundwater nearby to plants even though the dirt may seem wet since plants can just come to pass unadulterated groundwater usable for plant water in the dirt arrangement diminishes drastically as ec increments maas and nieman 1978 based on the groundwater quality classes table 4 it is suggested that the investigated water tests in the main study zone in view of electrical conductivity ec fig 2 b results 71 of the water tests have good and 20 permissible or moderate saline water for irrigation purposes and 9 doubtful or of the water tests have high salinity groundwater class 4 2 2 the impact sodium on groundwater determination by sar na and ssp the additional total quantity of na content groundwater has to distress the permeability of soil and structure that has been caused by the hazard of sodium it decreases the production rate by decreasing the accessible groundwater for plant progress and growth in this investigation area the groundwater has a high amount of sodium that immobilizes other nutrient ions particularly magnesium calcium and potassium this process makes the shortage of nutrient ions elements in plants yogendra and puttaiah 2008 as represented by table 4 which dependent on sar fig 3a order there are the numbers of water samples 32 borehole groundwater tests grouped as excellent water class 17 borehole groundwater test are found in a good class 26 are classified in doubtful at last 25 are classified on unsuitable category the consequence of sodium assimilation proportions sar appeared that 32 area of water tests have excellent water class s1 17 area of water tests are grouped under good reasonable water class s2 26 are ordered in doubtful areas s3 and 25 areas are classified in unsuitable s4 for the usage of groundwater irrigation system fig 3b the irrigation system parameter of na demonstrated according to table 4 that 13 numbers of boreholes or wells are excellent in class 25 quantities of the boreholes are good class 10 quantities of the boreholes are recognized as a permissible class 23 numbers of the boreholes are found in doubtful ranges the last 29 boreholes are found in unsuitable ranges the complete regions has been partitioned on five section and the irrigation parameter na of the absolute territories 13 zones are good 25 zones are characterized on the permissible limit 10 regions are kept on the poor classes 23 is dicey classes 29 of regions has been found on the unacceptable classes for the water system purposes fig 4 a soluble sodium percentage ssp indicated the amount of sodium soluble in the groundwater and its effects on the parameters of groundwater investigated total area is divided into two areas table 4 the total 85 numbers samples are found in suitable ranges and total 14 numbers samples are considered as unsuitable class it is divided the total areas into two portions where 85 areas are showed suitable in class and 14 areas are unsuitable zone for the soluble of sodium percentage fig 4b as to sodium characterization it is indicated that a large portion of the total areas of groundwater tests for irrigation purposes are found under the permissible limit table 4 there has no excellent groundwater class in the studied area yet for irrigation purposes 4 2 3 groundwater characterization based on pi permeability index or irrigation purposes the formula of pi which is developed by doreen yousefi et al 2017 is represented by the groundwater concoction properties for the water system framework in the larger case the irrigation system water has been indicated by pi which evaluates the effect on soil groundwater intrusion properties fig 4c and these are sodium calcium magnesium which effect on the soil of groundwater on the basis of classification table 4 there has been shown the distribution of soil permeability by gis on kriging on circular distribution yousefi et al 2017 most of the areas of groundwater samples fall in class 1 excellent class 2 poor and class 3 very poor from the data of table 4 it is indicated that total 43 areas included in class 1 excellent 21 areas are classified on class 2 poor and 36 are indicated as class 3 as very poor distribution fig 4c 4 2 4 groundwater quality for irrigation purposes classified based on total hardness th and ki kelly index the total hardness consequence of the groundwater on the investigation area s minimum of 0 maximum of 1400 mg l standard division of 220 818527 mg l median of 380 mg l and average value are found 430 92 mg l water test results showed that 74 areas are suitable for irrigation quality whereas about 26 is considered as an unacceptable water class fig 5b according to water quality class table 4 the groundwater compound properties are classified for irrigation system according to the kelly index fig 3c if the estimation of the kelly index is over 1 it indicates the excess amount of sodium on different cases kelly index lower than 1 which demonstrates a deficiency of na in groundwater groundwater water is considered as suitable for the system of irrigation when the kelly index limit is less than 1 when the limit is found in class ranges 1 and 2 according to kelly index the groundwater is marginally suitable for irrigation while the kelly s index limit is larger than 2 water is unsuitable for the system of irrigation in this study the estimation of kelly index of groundwater on irrigation purposes is appeared in three part by the class ranges table 4 the total hardness zone partitioned in three sections based on ki classification of 46 area is considered as excellent 20 area is considered as minimal appropriate and 34 area is indicated as unsatisfactory fig 3c 4 3 specific ion toxicity problems on the irrigation purposes of groundwater quality the problem of toxicity is various from salinity and permeability sectors in irrigation purposes when the groundwater has crossed the toxicity limit a higher amount of toxic metal is found in groundwater and it affects the yield production as a result of uptake and accumulation of certain constituents chloride and sodium are considered as certain ions that found in water or soil and these are accrued in sensitive yields in absorptions in large enough to cause yields destruction and condensed crops mainly toxicity has typically happened when the ions of toxicity are occupied up by the soil water and gather in the plants through the transpiration of water at a range that can destruct the plant leaves chloride sodium is generally found in irrigation water as the usual ions of toxic assessing the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes chloride is one of the most significant parameters in assessing the water quality for irrigation purposes fig 2c high absorption of chloride ion demonstrates a cause of higher level of natural contamination at the organic level ayars 2011 the irrigation system of specific ion toxicity hazard classification of groundwater has been done according to the recommendation of ayers and westcot 1985 the acceptable class has indicated chloride in water is under l00 mg l reasonable for irrigation system of usage and in excess of 100 mg l unacceptable as irrigation purposes if the concentration of these ions is prolonged the harmfulness of irrigation is increased the resultant average value fig 2c of 535 1298 mg l maximum 4700 mg l minimum 0 mg l standard division 797 499706 mg l and median is 62 5mg l table 2 it is indicated that the hazards of salinity are the main problem of jashore district the allowable limit of sodium in the irrigation system of water is under 70 mg l which is appropriate of irrigation system and in excess of 70 mg l inadmissible for water system according to an increased absorption limit than the ranges higher than 70 mg l the harmfulness of sodium has continuously been to increase the consequence of sodium in this investigation area table 2 is average 334 838 mg l maximum 1057 813 mg l minimum 32 mg l standard division 263 12062 mg l median 279 mg l table 2 geospatial distribution fig 2a is represented the groundwater parameter of sodium distribution for irrigation system in jashore district the total of sodium areas of 11 are excellent 36 are considered as good 13 is moderate class 18 is found in poor class and last 22 is showed in very poor class fig 2a 4 4 the model of irrigation water quality index iwqi water system for irrigation purposes has been done based on groundwater quality index depends on every parameter which indicated by water system for groundwater quality variables anticipated by the college of california board of trustees of advisors uccc and different subdivision of the irrigation quality has been showed in table 4 to make a map of spatial distribution on irrigation purposes the arc map version 10 5 with geostatistical analyst tools extension has been applied the distributional map of irrigation water quality index iwqi has made intersection model of using the combination of ten thematic irrigation parameter quality maps sar ssp rsc na ec tds na ki pi and cl table 4 shows that irrigation quality is excellent that are found the arrangement of groundwater quality record iwqi ranges from 85 100 and in this range s groundwater quality all yields can produce without any risk or no restriction the ranges 70 85 of groundwater quality where the irrigation quality is good this ranges indicated the low restriction areas which evaluate to avoid salty type plants or irrigation the ranges of 55 70 where moderate tolerant yields can be produced and plants with moderate tolerance of salts may be grown the ranges of 40 55 indicate very poor water quality classes and the restriction is high moderate to high tolerance plants or seeds should be irrigated in this indicated ranges investigation area the water quality ranges of 0 40 which is unsuitable for irrigation this area should be irrigated only plants with higher salt tolerance acceptance of groundwater through extremely lower values the consequence of water system groundwater quality index iwqi fig 6 showed that 36 of total district is considered in excellent condition of irrigation and there is no hazard or danger of irrigation 18 of total areas is considered as good class or low restriction of irrigation 15 areas are poor or moderate irrigation class the moderate saline sodium chloride based area has been indicated as 14 areas where irrigation is very poor class the 17 area has been indicated severe class and higher restriction for irrigation this area is indicated as high salinity sodium chloride based therefore it is identified that sharsha and chaugachha is considered as the excellent areas of irrigation abhaynagar and keshabpur lower portion areas is totally severe because of salinity intrusion and sodium hazard 5 adaptation strategies with the hazard different contraries of the world have used the salinity of groundwater by managements for their profitable irrigation such these different high developed country usa rhoades 1987 tunisia hachicha and ben aissa 2014 india ritzema et al 2008 who have used the groundwater for the irrigation system in highly progress where have been found the high mixture of salinity the examples have been identified by different studies worldwide rhoades 1983 and when the management of groundwater salinity is applied in the irrigation system it is considered several relevant information including groundwater quality weather soil nature yields irrigation systems and other management practices yields and period of use rhoades 1974 the crops which can be cultivated in the salinity sodium chloride the characteristics are different from general crops and these are high compliant with salinity according to the suggestion of maas et al 1977 the crops from higher salinity resistance to lower resistance that are showed in a series these are the common name of crops series in higher salinity resistance to lower maas 1986 barley cotton sugar beet sorghum safflower wheat beet red cowpea alfalfa tomato cabbage maize lettuce onion rice bean these are the botanical name of crops series in higher salinity resistance to lower tanji and management 1990 hordeum vulgare gossypium hirsutum beta vulgaris sorghum bicolor carthamus tinctorius triticum aestivum beta vulgaris vigna unguiculata medicago sativa lycopersicon lycopersicum brassica oleracea capitata zea rnays lactuca sativa allium cepa oryza sativa phaseolus vulgaris the paddy which is saline tolerant species abedin and shaw 2013 brri dhan 47 boro dhan brri dhan 40 brri dhan 41 t aman varieties bari tomato the following remediations are shown on the basis of investigation and exploration data 1 to minimize matric stress or harmful effects of salinity on groundwater farms should be used as high drip irrigation or borehole irrigation for groundwater 2 for irrigation in the salinity of groundwater high root with crops should not be used for irrigation salinity is high in the deeper regions of the root zone 3 it will be chosen such kinds of crops or yield variations that will be produced suitable yields underneath the prevailing or predicted situations of salinity or sodality 4 it would be maintained superior planting techniques which will diminish salt growth in the vicinity of the seed 5 it would be maintained land preparation to rise of groundwater circulation leaching and intrusion so that reduced the elimination of salinity 6 it would be maintained special cures for such as tillage and accompaniments of chemical adjustments carbon based organisms and growing green fertilizer yields preserving the permeability of soil 7 the total land would be kept uncovered through summer and winter and it might lead to excess salinity build up on soil due to evaporation so the total land will be covered with a plastic sheet that can be prevented from soil evaporation 8 it would be stored in excess rainwater in ponds for producing crops during the dry season 6 conclusion the hydrochemical distribution modeling and superiority of groundwater quality for irrigation systems created on gis geospatial analysis tools and irrigation water quality index iwqi is considered as most important issues for sustainable green socioeconomic growth this process of iwqi helps to indicate the quality of groundwater in jashore and to achieve accurate information about the present condition of irrigation water quality above the catchment the identification of suitable groundwater resources for the irrigation system is considered as the action of agricultural sustainable development the total investigation confirms that the water samples have salinity hazards high sodium chloride problems and hazards of specific ion toxicity that is originated from sodium and chloride but with no hazard of sodality and bicarbonate the last maps of spatial distribution on iwqi model that indicated sharsha and chaugachha are considered the excellent areas of irrigation abhaynagar and keshabpur lower portion are considered as the risk or very severe areas the model of iwq helps the ecological protection by the best management of the salinity of groundwater for the irrigation system not only increase the yield production rate but also it will enhance the food security of bangladesh therefore groundwater salinity adaptation strategies that are indicated in this investigation will be helped in order to control groundwater salinity

of the study area rsv characterizes the standard values of groundwater wcv indicated the relative weight of co efficient values of the variables irrigation water quality index is represented as iwqi and the amounts of groundwater quality parameters is indicated by n the iwqi which is dimensionless parameters is ranged from 0 to 100 table 4 4 result and discussion 4 1 statistical analysis of hydro chemical parameters the total summary of the hydrogeological parameters on the analysis of descriptive statistical propagation and the result are shown in the groundwater statistical samples table 2 the groundwater quality variables for irrigation by the descriptive statistics propagation is shown in table 2 the structures of chemical and physical properties of groundwater parameters together with statistical methods such as the maximum minimum sd standard deviation median the average concentration of parameters are shown in table 2 the hydro geochemical composition of groundwater n 100 is showed inside the range of the district the parameters of groundwater sample electrical conductivity ec in the investigation area varies from 394 to 16 598 μs cm micro siemens per centimeter and the average value is 1937 77μs cm the range of total dissolved solids tds differ from 11 618 6 to 275 8 mg l with the average values of 1356 439 mg l the absorption of ph value of the investigation area for the corelation of irrigation purpopses varies from 3 7 to 10 01 with a normal average value of 7 4098 which specifies the dissolved carbonates are moderately large in the hco3 representing the nature mainly alkaline part in the samples of groundwater the ground water samples of the investigation area s main cations series have found in the order na ca2 mg2 k fe2 the cation series table 2 of the study area indicated that sodium has been considered the most leading cation which control the irrigation system for the purposes of groundwater in the investigation area and concentration of its differs from 20 78 to 1157 813 mg l and the average value 302 7172 mg l in the investigation areas the main anions dominancy of groundwater samples have found in the series of order namely cl so4 2 no3 the chloride is the most leading anion of the investigation area in purposes of irrigation system of groundwater samples and the concentration of its differs from 4700 to 0 mg l with average value

among the features of physicochemical properties of groundwater samples that can expose the sources of solutes and the procedure which has made the observation of groundwater hydrochemical compositions the numerical degree of the relations of groundwater physicochemical factors spoke by the coefficient of connection fluctuates between 1 and 1 as per the factual import of the evaluated connection of the framework a higher connection lattice coefficient near 1 method a decent positive connection among two hydrogeological variables and its incentive around 0 methods with no connection among the two groundwater factors in general the outcomes express the higher connections among s certain sets of groundwater variables appearing when r 0 8 measured as emphatically corresponded though r esteem somewhere in the range of 0 5 and 0 8 shows moderate correlations a negative coefficient express that the measureable factors are developing in inverse ways in this present investigation spss version 20 the package of statistical software programming bundle has utilized to figure connection lattice examination with the outcomes recorded in table 3 table 3 gives the relationship grid resultant values among the groundwater quality factors of the investigation areas and it very well might be comprehended that from this connection network ec and tds practically 99 have profoundly associated one another ec and tds have higher 85 ideal connection with ca na cl so4 and sar the most grounded critical connections among the factors were r 0 70 tolerably huge connection among the parameters r esteems somewhere in the range of 0 5 and 0 7 and r 0 adversely huge relationship among the factors that is immaterial relationship between the groundwater factors 4 2 suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation purposes 4 2 1 comparison of salinity hazard on groundwater irrigation based on ec and tds saltiness or alkalinity conditions is a significant thought for the irrigation system by groundwater if the nature of groundwater is considered as great or free from salinity the soil and irrigation practices is also good and it helps to produce higher harvest yield the reasonableness of groundwater for irrigation system relies on saltiness and the sodium content in connection to the measures of ca2 and mg2 or sar diersing and nancy 2009 simsek and gunduz 2007 the standard of most influential groundwater distinction on yield proficiency is considered by the index of saltiness that has multiplied by the values of electrical conductivity the salt is originated by the dissolved mineral groundwater that is shown a high salinity table by ahmed et al 2002 yield profitability is exceptionally influenced when saltiness danger of ec is 3 ds m and it is great if ec is 0 25 ds m and furthermore great irrigation system by groundwater through a tds fig 5a value 450 mg l though that with more noteworthy than 2000 mg l is unacceptable for irrigation purposes if there is a higher cumulative absorption of ec there is also reducing groundwater snap by the plant and creasing the higher efficiency proportion soil structure permeability and aeration are also affected by salinity and among the properties of aeration which are mainly considered as the indirect parameters of the affection of plant growth the quantity of total dissolved solids are also depended by the water quality of irrigation and effect on the quality of irrigation this is a direct result of diminishing plant development rates because of diminished water take up the groundwater quality classification basis on the irrigation purposes of different parameters are used based on salinity hazard on ssp na and sar are done according to literatures balachandar et al 2010 sadashivaiah et al 2008 see fig 4 and table 4 the essential impact of high ec on groundwater for crop productivity that cannot take the proper substances of irrigation here tds and ec make a higher impact on hydrochemical parameters the higher amount of ec the lower groundwater nearby to plants even though the dirt may seem wet since plants can just come to pass unadulterated groundwater usable for plant water in the dirt arrangement diminishes drastically as ec increments maas and nieman 1978 based on the groundwater quality classes table 4 it is suggested that the investigated water tests in the main study zone in view of electrical conductivity ec fig 2 b results 71 of the water tests have good and 20 permissible or moderate saline water for irrigation purposes and 9 doubtful or of the water tests have high salinity groundwater class 4 2 2 the impact sodium on groundwater determination by sar na and ssp the additional total quantity of na content groundwater has to distress the permeability of soil and structure that has been caused by the hazard of sodium it decreases the production rate by decreasing the accessible groundwater for plant progress and growth in this investigation area the groundwater has a high amount of sodium that immobilizes other nutrient ions particularly magnesium calcium and potassium this process makes the shortage of nutrient ions elements in plants yogendra and puttaiah 2008 as represented by table 4 which dependent on sar fig 3a order there are the numbers of water samples 32 borehole groundwater tests grouped as excellent water class 17 borehole groundwater test are found in a good class 26 are classified in doubtful at last 25 are classified on unsuitable category the consequence of sodium assimilation proportions sar appeared that 32 area of water tests have excellent water class s1 17 area of water tests are grouped under good reasonable water class s2 26 are ordered in doubtful areas s3 and 25 areas are classified in unsuitable s4 for the usage of groundwater irrigation system fig 3b the irrigation system parameter of na demonstrated according to table 4 that 13 numbers of boreholes or wells are excellent in class 25 quantities of the boreholes are good class 10 quantities of the boreholes are recognized as a permissible class 23 numbers of the boreholes are found in doubtful ranges the last 29 boreholes are found in unsuitable ranges the complete regions has been partitioned on five section and the irrigation parameter na of the absolute territories 13 zones are good 25 zones are characterized on the permissible limit 10 regions are kept on the poor classes 23 is dicey classes 29 of regions has been found on the unacceptable classes for the water system purposes fig 4 a soluble sodium percentage ssp indicated the amount of sodium soluble in the groundwater and its effects on the parameters of groundwater investigated total area is divided into two areas table 4 the total 85 numbers samples are found in suitable ranges and total 14 numbers samples are considered as unsuitable class it is divided the total areas into two portions where 85 areas are showed suitable in class and 14 areas are unsuitable zone for the soluble of sodium percentage fig 4b as to sodium characterization it is indicated that a large portion of the total areas of groundwater tests for irrigation purposes are found under the permissible limit table 4 there has no excellent groundwater class in the studied area yet for irrigation purposes 4 2 3 groundwater characterization based on pi permeability index or irrigation purposes the formula of pi which is developed by doreen yousefi et al 2017 is represented by the groundwater concoction properties for the water system framework in the larger case the irrigation system water has been indicated by pi which evaluates the effect on soil groundwater intrusion properties fig 4c and these are sodium calcium magnesium which effect on the soil of groundwater on the basis of classification table 4 there has been shown the distribution of soil permeability by gis on kriging on circular distribution yousefi et al 2017 most of the areas of groundwater samples fall in class 1 excellent class 2 poor and class 3 very poor from the data of table 4 it is indicated that total 43 areas included in class 1 excellent 21 areas are classified on class 2 poor and 36 are indicated as class 3 as very poor distribution fig 4c 4 2 4 groundwater quality for irrigation purposes classified based on total hardness th and ki kelly index the total hardness consequence of the groundwater on the investigation area s minimum of 0 maximum of 1400 mg l standard division of 220 818527 mg l median of 380 mg l and average value are found 430 92 mg l water test results showed that 74 areas are suitable for irrigation quality whereas about 26 is considered as an unacceptable water class fig 5b according to water quality class table 4 the groundwater compound properties are classified for irrigation system according to the kelly index fig 3c if the estimation of the kelly index is over 1 it indicates the excess amount of sodium on different cases kelly index lower than 1 which demonstrates a deficiency of na in groundwater groundwater water is considered as suitable for the system of irrigation when the kelly index limit is less than 1 when the limit is found in class ranges 1 and 2 according to kelly index the groundwater is marginally suitable for irrigation while the kelly s index limit is larger than 2 water is unsuitable for the system of irrigation in this study the estimation of kelly index of groundwater on irrigation purposes is appeared in three part by the class ranges table 4 the total hardness zone partitioned in three sections based on ki classification of 46 area is considered as excellent 20 area is considered as minimal appropriate and 34 area is indicated as unsatisfactory fig 3c 4 3 specific ion toxicity problems on the irrigation purposes of groundwater quality the problem of toxicity is various from salinity and permeability sectors in irrigation purposes when the groundwater has crossed the toxicity limit a higher amount of toxic metal is found in groundwater and it affects the yield production as a result of uptake and accumulation of certain constituents chloride and sodium are considered as certain ions that found in water or soil and these are accrued in sensitive yields in absorptions in large enough to cause yields destruction and condensed crops mainly toxicity has typically happened when the ions of toxicity are occupied up by the soil water and gather in the plants through the transpiration of water at a range that can destruct the plant leaves chloride sodium is generally found in irrigation water as the usual ions of toxic assessing the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes chloride is one of the most significant parameters in assessing the water quality for irrigation purposes fig 2c high absorption of chloride ion demonstrates a cause of higher level of natural contamination at the organic level ayars 2011 the irrigation system of specific ion toxicity hazard classification of groundwater has been done according to the recommendation of ayers and westcot 1985 the acceptable class has indicated chloride in water is under l00 mg l reasonable for irrigation system of usage and in excess of 100 mg l unacceptable as irrigation purposes if the concentration of these ions is prolonged the harmfulness of irrigation is increased the resultant average value fig 2c of 535 1298 mg l maximum 4700 mg l minimum 0 mg l standard division 797 499706 mg l and median is 62 5mg l table 2 it is indicated that the hazards of salinity are the main problem of jashore district the allowable limit of sodium in the irrigation system of water is under 70 mg l which is appropriate of irrigation system and in excess of 70 mg l inadmissible for water system according to an increased absorption limit than the ranges higher than 70 mg l the harmfulness of sodium has continuously been to increase the consequence of sodium in this investigation area table 2 is average 334 838 mg l maximum 1057 813 mg l minimum 32 mg l standard division 263 12062 mg l median 279 mg l table 2 geospatial distribution fig 2a is represented the groundwater parameter of sodium distribution for irrigation system in jashore district the total of sodium areas of 11 are excellent 36 are considered as good 13 is moderate class 18 is found in poor class and last 22 is showed in very poor class fig 2a 4 4 the model of irrigation water quality index iwqi water system for irrigation purposes has been done based on groundwater quality index depends on every parameter which indicated by water system for groundwater quality variables anticipated by the college of california board of trustees of advisors uccc and different subdivision of the irrigation quality has been showed in table 4 to make a map of spatial distribution on irrigation purposes the arc map version 10 5 with geostatistical analyst tools extension has been applied the distributional map of irrigation water quality index iwqi has made intersection model of using the combination of ten thematic irrigation parameter quality maps sar ssp rsc na ec tds na ki pi and cl table 4 shows that irrigation quality is excellent that are found the arrangement of groundwater quality record iwqi ranges from 85 100 and in this range s groundwater quality all yields can produce without any risk or no restriction the ranges 70 85 of groundwater quality where the irrigation quality is good this ranges indicated the low restriction areas which evaluate to avoid salty type plants or irrigation the ranges of 55 70 where moderate tolerant yields can be produced and plants with moderate tolerance of salts may be grown the ranges of 40 55 indicate very poor water quality classes and the restriction is high moderate to high tolerance plants or seeds should be irrigated in this indicated ranges investigation area the water quality ranges of 0 40 which is unsuitable for irrigation this area should be irrigated only plants with higher salt tolerance acceptance of groundwater through extremely lower values the consequence of water system groundwater quality index iwqi fig 6 showed that 36 of total district is considered in excellent condition of irrigation and there is no hazard or danger of irrigation 18 of total areas is considered as good class or low restriction of irrigation 15 areas are poor or moderate irrigation class the moderate saline sodium chloride based area has been indicated as 14 areas where irrigation is very poor class the 17 area has been indicated severe class and higher restriction for irrigation this area is indicated as high salinity sodium chloride based therefore it is identified that sharsha and chaugachha is considered as the excellent areas of irrigation abhaynagar and keshabpur lower portion areas is totally severe because of salinity intrusion and sodium hazard 5 adaptation strategies with the hazard different contraries of the world have used the salinity of groundwater by managements for their profitable irrigation such these different high developed country usa rhoades 1987 tunisia hachicha and ben aissa 2014 india ritzema et al 2008 who have used the groundwater for the irrigation system in highly progress where have been found the high mixture of salinity the examples have been identified by different studies worldwide rhoades 1983 and when the management of groundwater salinity is applied in the irrigation system it is considered several relevant information including groundwater quality weather soil nature yields irrigation systems and other management practices yields and period of use rhoades 1974 the crops which can be cultivated in the salinity sodium chloride the characteristics are different from general crops and these are high compliant with salinity according to the suggestion of maas et al 1977 the crops from higher salinity resistance to lower resistance that are showed in a series these are the common name of crops series in higher salinity resistance to lower maas 1986 barley cotton sugar beet sorghum safflower wheat beet red cowpea alfalfa tomato cabbage maize lettuce onion rice bean these are the botanical name of crops series in higher salinity resistance to lower tanji and management 1990 hordeum vulgare gossypium hirsutum beta vulgaris sorghum bicolor carthamus tinctorius triticum aestivum beta vulgaris vigna unguiculata medicago sativa lycopersicon lycopersicum brassica oleracea capitata zea rnays lactuca sativa allium cepa oryza sativa phaseolus vulgaris the paddy which is saline tolerant species abedin and shaw 2013 brri dhan 47 boro dhan brri dhan 40 brri dhan 41 t aman varieties bari tomato the following remediations are shown on the basis of investigation and exploration data 1 to minimize matric stress or harmful effects of salinity on groundwater farms should be used as high drip irrigation or borehole irrigation for groundwater 2 for irrigation in the salinity of groundwater high root with crops should not be used for irrigation salinity is high in the deeper regions of the root zone 3 it will be chosen such kinds of crops or yield variations that will be produced suitable yields underneath the prevailing or predicted situations of salinity or sodality 4 it would be maintained superior planting techniques which will diminish salt growth in the vicinity of the seed 5 it would be maintained land preparation to rise of groundwater circulation leaching and intrusion so that reduced the elimination of salinity 6 it would be maintained special cures for such as tillage and accompaniments of chemical adjustments carbon based organisms and growing green fertilizer yields preserving the permeability of soil 7 the total land would be kept uncovered through summer and winter and it might lead to excess salinity build up on soil due to evaporation so the total land will be covered with a plastic sheet that can be prevented from soil evaporation 8 it would be stored in excess rainwater in ponds for producing crops during the dry season 6 conclusion the hydrochemical distribution modeling and superiority of groundwater quality for irrigation systems created on gis geospatial analysis tools and irrigation water quality index iwqi is considered as most important issues for sustainable green socioeconomic growth this process of iwqi helps to indicate the quality of groundwater in jashore and to achieve accurate information about the present condition of irrigation water quality above the catchment the identification of suitable groundwater resources for the irrigation system is considered as the action of agricultural sustainable development the total investigation confirms that the water samples have salinity hazards high sodium chloride problems and hazards of specific ion toxicity that is originated from sodium and chloride but with no hazard of sodality and bicarbonate the last maps of spatial distribution on iwqi model that indicated sharsha and chaugachha are considered the excellent areas of irrigation abhaynagar and keshabpur lower portion are considered as the risk or very severe areas the model of iwq helps the ecological protection by the best management of the salinity of groundwater for the irrigation system not only increase the yield production rate but also it will enhance the food security of bangladesh therefore groundwater salinity adaptation strategies that are indicated in this investigation will be helped in order to control groundwater salinity

12083,this paper studies aquifer s hydrodynamic behavior by combining a flow simulation model with transmissivity optimization cokriging in order to provide an optimal management scheme for the groundwater aquifer the use of a cokriging approach improves the transmissivity data which are insufficient for the database of the groundwater flow simulation model the obtained results are then used to model the groundwater flow of the tebessa morsott shallow aquifer located in ne algeria under a steady and transient regime the results of the model calibration for the steady state year 2010 show that the recharge by rainfall and leakage rate are similar compared to those calculated by the analytical approach 84 354 m3 day for the recharge and 36 986 m3 day for pumped water flow rate the results of the transient regime show the alluvial aquifer affected by large drawdowns reaching 40 m over 20 years year 2030 scenario due to increase in water exploitation from pumping wells to answer water needs of the tebessa region graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrodynamic characteristics water table drawdown cokriging groundwater modeling tebessa algeria 1 introduction the degradation of the natural environment including groundwater resources has gradually become a global concern groundwater is the most important natural resource used for drinking by many people around the world especially in arid and semi arid areas shawgar et al 2018 hamed 2015 the water resource cannot be optimally used and sustained unless the quantity of groundwater is assessed kevin 2006 shawgar et al 2018 for this reason it is of great importance to develop suitable simulation and optimization models for determining the optimal operation of pumping wells to ensure the maximum coverage of the water demands cornaton 2004 antoniou et al 2019 deterministic numerical models simulating the behavior of groundwater are useful tools in evaluating planning and managing this resource mary 2002 hill 2006 yangxiao and wenpeng 2011 more sophisticated and elaborate models are continuously being proposed under two to three dimensional consideration and are usually solved by finite difference or finite element methods after imposing different boundary conditions for various aquifer configurations trescott 1975 however the information is usually limited by and subject to large sampling and interpretative errors this restricts the development of more complex models applicable to this type of study to overcome these difficulties it is necessary to include the probabilistic approach geostatistics into these models in order to have a better quality quantity and spatial distribution of hydraulic heads and hydraulic conductivities data used in the model in semi arid areas of algeria the main source of water supply is groundwater because of its relatively easy exploitation aquifers are shallow chiles 2004 hamed et al 2018 the population growth and agricultural modernization are causing a high demand for the groundwater potentials already in limited quantity for such reason it is suitable to study the prediction of the groundwater aquifer state at short and long term the groundwater resources present an important source for water in this part of algeria because of the lack of permanent surface water and reservoirs owing to the arid climatic conditions the groundwater resources constitute the most widely available source for fresh water rouabhia et al 2010 in this region groundwater is used for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes drias 2013 fehdi et al 2016 the tebessa morsott basin contains an alluvial aquifer which is under exploitation as a result groundwater levels and spring discharges are steadily decreasing threatening the short term viability of resources drias 2013 for the sustainability of the water resources we propose to establish a diagnostic model of the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquifer such a diagnostic model will allow us to propose additions in order to ensure the rational management of the resource in the future hydrodynamic parameters are initially determined by a wide variety of analytical methods such as thies jacob and chow theis 1935 jacob 1940 chow 1952 which consider the aquifer heterogeneity the hydrodynamic parameters hydraulic heads hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity were then studied jointly by both the probabilistic method of the cokriging delhomme 1978 bohling 2005 shakeel 1987 and the deterministic method using a groundwater simulation model by modflow software version 3 0 harbaugh et al 2000 the objectives of this study are 1 enhance the aquifer hydrodynamic parameters i e transmissivity permeability and water head which can be used later in the groundwater flow simulation by using geostatistical techniques kriging and cokriging and 2 study the actual and future effect of water extraction on the groundwater aquifer under different scenarios for better water resources management 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the city of tebessa is located in the northeastern part of algeria at the gateway to the algerian desert about 650 km south east of algiers the capital city fig 1 the tebessa morsott plain is part of the medjerda watershed and the k sob wadi sub basin the average elevation of the plain is about 900 m above sea level the study area extends along the nw se direction and corresponds to a large closed depression kowalski et al 1997 with an area of about 600 km2 it is bounded on the north by zitouna mountain in the south by bouroumane doukkane anoual and ozmour mountains in the west by matlougue mountain and by djebissa mountain to the east these mountains are the main source of lateral water recharge of the shallow aquifer of tebessa morsott the piezometric levels vary between 710 m and 885 m above sea level with a hydraulic gradient 0 02 0 03 in the eastern and southern parts of study area drias 2013 the climate is semi arid where the annual average rainfall is about 350 mm and evaporation rate is about 650 mm year and the annual average temperature is 23 c drias 2013 2 2 geological and hydrogeological context the geological structures are constituted by cretaceous formations forming a series of anticlines and synclines vila 1980 the stratigraphic sequence is presented in the form of alternating carbonate formations of limestone marly limestones and argillaceous marls kowalski et al 1997 plio quaternary and quaternary formations occupy the central part of the tebessa morsott plain and are composed of alluvial deposits conglomerates gravels and sandstones and contain the shallow groundwater aquifer drias 2013 the tebessa morsott shallow groundwater aquifer is mainly recharged by direct precipitation and from the leakage from a deep aquifer cretaceous formation through faults drias 2013 fig 2 the thickness of the shallow aquifer is variable reaching 300 m in the ain chabro area southern part thus constituting an area favorable for drilling transmissivities of the shallow aquifer were estimated from pumping tests of several water wells using analytical methods of thies jacob and chow theis 1935 jacob 1940 chow 1952 drias and toubal 2010 and probabilistics cokriging drias 2013 the transmissivity values vary from 10 3 to 5 10 2 m2 s which allowed us to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of 3 10 4 m s the measured water discharge in 2010 from 22 water wells at ain chabro is 4700 m3 day which is the highest value in the study area 2 3 geostatistical approach in hydrogeological studies it is important to estimate hydrodynamic parameters from geoelectrical data a number of authors give some linear regression models between hydrodynamic parameters transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and electrical parameters electric transverse resistance pardo and dowd 2005 multivariate geostatistical methods can also be used to find correlations between hydrodynamic and geoelectrical data shakeel 1987 there is an advantage of using multivariate geostatistical method compared to the regression method one being that the regression technique does not consider the spatial variability of the phenomenon it simply neglects the spatial coordinates of the data however geostatistics are based on the spatial variability and covariability of the different variables cokriging is a geostatistical technique which improves the hydrogeological models cokriging calculates estimates for a poorly sampled variable with help of a well sampled variable delhomme 1978 bohling 2005 this is important in the case of the transmissivity t of an aquifer which is highly correlated with specific capacity and electric transverse resistivity shakeel 1987 also t values are easy to measure in the field the level of cross spatial correlation between two variables is given by the cross variogram journel and huijbregts 1978 vauclin et al 1983 2 4 the tebessa morsott aquifer numerical model development the hydrodynamics and regional groundwater mass balance of the tebessa morsott aquifer are still not well understood developing the first numerical flow model of the study area will help to integrate all existing information and data on the tebessa morsott aquifer for a better understanding of its groundwater flow hydrodynamics and provide a basis for a better groundwater management policies 2 4 1 aquifer geometry information from previous studies rouabhia et al 2010 and drias 2013 combined with recent borehole lithostratigraphic logs and geoelectric pseudo sections obtained from cgg 1975 helped in delineation of the main aquifer formations and morphology of the basement rocks fig 3 the piezometric map of 2010 drias and toubal 2010 was obtained from the steady state head of around thirty water wells exploiting the shallow aquifer we note here that most of the wells were in the pumping shutdown state in 2010 this 2010 piezometric map was used as a top layer of the numerical model and for the calibration of the steady state regime both the basement rock and the steady state head maps allowed us to compute the saturated aquifer thickness map and develop the aquifer geometry model 2 4 2 flow and mass transport transmissivity values from 22 short term pumping tests were provided by the local water management authority these transmissivity data were estimated from conventional interpretation methods i e assuming a homogenous medium of drawdown data peaudecerf 1970 kerrou et al 2010 first in order to have a better transmissivity map for the whole area we applied the cokriging method to the available transmissivity data next the transmissivity map is transformed to hydraulic conductivities by using the total saturated thickness of the aquifer and length of water well screens for full penetrating water wells after that 22 permeabilities were calculated the mean hydraulic conductivity and the variance of the natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivities are 8 9 10 5 m s and 0 67 respectively these estimates are used as initial information for the calibration of the flow simulation model with regard to transport parameters there are no tracer test data to allow for the estimation of local dispersivity kerrou et al 2010 however the electrical resistivity value er was used to estimate the porosity of the plio quaternary formation of the shallow aquifer konikow and reilly 1998 kachi 2007 fig 4 shows the total porosity distribution at the tebessa morsott aquifer kachi 2007 2 4 3 water recharge zone evaluation of effective recharge is a challenging task in arid and semi arid regions scanlon and goldsmith 1997 kerrou et al 2010 using thorntwhaite s method the effective recharge rate ranges between 5 and 8 of the regional average annual rainfall drias 2013 these percentages are used in the numerical model according to the type of soil the most permeable soils with 10 and the least permeable soils with 5 3 results and discussions 3 1 geostatistical approach 3 1 1 hydrodynamic and geoelectric data transmissivity t data mostly from short duration pumping tests are available at 22 wells not well distributed in the study area drias 2013 data on electric transverse resistance tr exists at 127 points in the study area gcg 1975 kachi 2007 calculated the electric transverse resistance based on the apparent resistivity and saturated thickness measured through vertical electrical sounding ves the electric transverse resistance was corrected for the variations in the water resistivity measured directly in sampled water from wells t and tr corrected values table 1 were used in the geostatistical approach cross variogram and cokriging previous studies shakeel 1987 pardo and dowd 2005 showed that transmissivity and transverse resistance have a lognormal distribution and hence they were transformed to logarithmic distribution and their logarithms taken the linear regression of log t versus log tr shows a good correlation coefficient of 0 715 fig 5 table 2 thus justifies the data transformation see fig 6 the experimental histograms suggest that a single adjustment by a log normal distribution would be valid however the x2 test rejects this hypothesis at the threshold of 0 05 for the log t variables under these conditions the adoption of the log normal distribution for the two variables t and rt must be considered as a suitable reference model allowing simple and sufficiently precise calculations the histograms have a unimodal appearance the distribution tail on the low value side for tr is due to the heterogeneous materials 3 1 1 1 experimental variogram after data normalization the experimental variograms were plotted by gs software deutsch 1998 then the best theoretical model was fitted to each variogram based on the minimum rss residual sums of squares a cross validation method was used to determine the accuracy of the estimated data the nugget effect for transmissivities can be attributed to measurement errors and micro regionalization these effects are however less important for transverse resistance tr which benefits from a measurement network compatible with the scale of work fig 7 shows the theoretical models spherical adjusted to experimental models considered consistent with the data 3 1 1 2 cross variogram after data normalization the experimental variograms were prepared the results including cross variograms are presented in table 3 and fig 8 cross validation tests confirm the validity of the variograms the calculated transmissivity values using a cokriging system are then carried out on square mesh of uniform sizes 500 m 500 m the results are presented in fig 9 a b c the residual transmissivities fig 9a show that the deviations are minimal and justify the choice of the spherical model which fits well with the logarithmic variables while the obtained transmissivities map is much better and reflects the lithology of the aquifer well 3 2 groundwater flow model of a shallow aquifer in tebessa morsott the groundwater flow model was developed using modflow software harbaugh et al 2000 waterloo 2011 the finite difference model consists of 70 rows 82 columns and 1 layer the study area 600 km2 is covered by 1200 cells and each cell has a dimension of 500 m 500 m fig 10 a three dimensional 3d digital hydrogeological framework model hfm was developed which defines the physical geometry and materials of hydrogeological units and the hydrogeological structures hill 2006 the hydrogeological framework model was discretized into numerical flow model input arrays using hydro geological unit flow package of modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 the permeability distribution map of the top layer of the aquifer is used by modflow software in some lateral boundaries of the tebessa morsott alluvial aquifer the boundaries are closed and do not permit lateral flow these closed boundaries are first detected from the piezometric map some boundaries were simulated as open flow boundaries where hydraulic gradients permit flow across these boundaries through fractures or high permeability zones 3 2 1 flow simulation model 3 2 1 1 steady state regime the simulation is divided into a steady state regime and a transient regime the steady state regime is before 2010 with no pumping the transient regime was then developed for the period 2010 and 2030 and was divided into annual stress periods for which pumping rates were defined the constructed numerical model was calibrated using a nonlinear regression method the final calibrated model was evaluated by comparing measured and computed groundwater heads and discharges pumping wells good fit with observed groundwater heads are observed in areas of flat hydraulic gradients mean fit with the observed groundwater heads is visible in areas with steep hydraulic gradient fig 11 the results from the hydrogeological assessment of calibration in the steady state regime are the followings fig 12 outflow from tebessa morsott aquifer 195 320 6 m3 year contribution by the boundary limits maestrichtian and turonian limestones 147 953 4 m3 year contribution by precipitation recharge 84 354 33 m3 year pumped water rate 36 986 0 m3 year the results obtained by the model especially recharge by rainfall and inputs by border limits are similar to those calculated by the empirical approach the various tests of the model made it possible to adjust the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 10 5 to 10 4 m s fig 13 the most permeable areas are found in the south part of the plain ain chabro while in the center part the hydraulic conductivity values remain low overall this distribution resulting from calibration is the same as that obtained from block kriging however a slight increase in values is obtained in the south part of the plain ain chabro 10 10 4 m s while in the center of the plain the hydraulic conductivity decreases to 10 5 m s 3 2 1 2 transient regime the simulation in the transient regime represents a continuation of the steady state regime under external conditions the main objective of this simulation step is to represent the future conditions of the hydraulic heads of the tebessa morsott aquifer two scenarios were developed during this transient regime modeling 1 first with same existing recharge and discharge conditions of the steady state regime and a simulation for 20 years and 2 second with increasing discharge from the productive water wells the hydraulic heads map generated with the first scenario shows similarities with flow directions as calculated in the steady state with hmin 716 05 m morsott zone and hmax 884 67 m bekkaria and tebessa zones fig 14 in the second scenario we increased the discharge rate from the most productive wells located in four different sectors of the study area namely el hammamet gr5 ain chabro j2 3bis tebessa t3 and bekkaria w2bis the hydraulic heads map generated in the second scenario fig 15 shows considerable drawdowns in the aforementioned wells of up to 40 m in the south part of steady area el hammamet zone 4 conclusions in this paper an approach for hydrodynamic data preparation for the numerical hydrogeological model is presented for the combined use of a flow simulation model with optimized transmissivity values using a cokriging method aiming at the rational and optimal management of groundwater aquifer the use of the cokriging method helps in improving the transmissivity data which are originally insufficient for the database of the flow simulation model this made it possible to optimize the permeability fields in steady state whose values range from 10 to 4 to 10 2 m s the results of the transient regime for the tebessa morsott aquifer hydrodynamic model reveal large drawdowns reaching 40 m for the year 2030 scenario for future recommendations we propose an artificial recharge of the tebessa morsott shallow aquifer by the flood waters of bouakous river while setting up levees at the borders of the river to reduce the velocity of flowing waters and increase the effective infiltration recharge to the shallow

the natural environment including groundwater resources has gradually become a global concern groundwater is the most important natural resource used for drinking by many people around the world especially in arid and semi arid areas shawgar et al 2018 hamed 2015 the water resource cannot be optimally used and sustained unless the quantity of groundwater is assessed kevin 2006 shawgar et al 2018 for this reason it is of great importance to develop suitable simulation and optimization models for determining the optimal operation of pumping wells to ensure the maximum coverage of the water

the flow simulation model this made it possible to optimize the permeability fields in steady state whose values range from 10 to 4 to 10 2 m s the results of the transient regime for the tebessa morsott aquifer hydrodynamic model reveal large drawdowns reaching 40 m for the year 2030 scenario for future recommendations we propose an artificial recharge of the tebessa morsott shallow aquifer by the flood waters of bouakous river while setting up levees at the borders of the river to reduce the velocity of flowing waters and increase the effective infiltration recharge to the shallow

12084,the basin of oum er rabiaa is part of the middle atlas it constitutes an important water resource on the scale of morocco the hydrogeological system of the region is characterized by many springs some of which have a high salinity rate spilling into oum er rabiaa river the present study aims to investigate firstly the distribution of lineaments along the major shear corridors crossing the area as well as their hydrogeological importance and secondly to verify the influence of geological characteristics on the physicochemical properties of the studied water bodies this study is based on a combined analysis through remote sensing satellite imagery geographic information systems gis field studies and geochemical analysis the results demonstrated that the lithological and structural characteristics of the geological formations play a predominant role in the creation of this hydrogeological system as well as in the diversity of the physicochemical proprieties of water resources in the area these geological formations are mainly composed by liassic limestone characterized by a circulation of fresh water fresh springs this liassic limestone is put in contact with the triassic saline clays through geological faults which is in the origin of the creation of saline springs contaminating the upstream of the oum er rabiaa river in the light of the decisive results obtained a set of solutions have been proposed such as the diversion of saline springs the purification in situ and the development of a fish farming project these solutions aim to guarantee a better quality of water resources of the area to preserve agriculture and to valorize the saline water bodies with a sustainable development perspective graphical abstract image 1 keywords water resources saline springs sustainable development geochemical analysis morocco 1 introduction arid and semi arid zones cover a large part of countries in the southern mediterranean periphery in these regions the water salinity is one of the main factors limiting the use of a considerable part of the available water resources zid and grignon 1991 hchicha and job 1994 bouchaou et al 2005 2008 lee 2010 amer et al 2012 in morocco as it is the case throughout north africa the issue of salt water is an extremely common phenomenon that influences the quality of water resources it is conditioned by a double factor on one hand the desert or sub desert climate which is currently present in a very large part of the country and on the other hand the existence of a period of lagoon deposits under a very dry and desert climate marked by the creation of salt deposits from the late permian until the early lias archambault 1972 étienne and guessab 1975 hinaje 2004 martin 1981 which is considered as the main cause of the presence of ancient saline soils that currently contaminate the water resources that flow through them which is the case in the current study water resource salinity is also a major factor that influences the fertility of agricultural soils leffelaar and sharma 1977 fao 2002 pitman and läuchli 2004 iptrid fao 2006 amer et al 2012 silber et al 2015 feng et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 on average the world loses 10 ha of arable lands per minute including 3 ha due to salinization this phenomenon constitutes a real risk to the world s food security indeed the salinization already affects 400 million hectares that suffer in different degrees and seriously threatens an equivalent surface area legros 2009 the high basin of oum er rabiaa which is the subject of this study contains the most important river in morocco bentayeb and leclerc 1977 it descends from the atlas mountains in khenifra region and joins the atlantic ocean at azzemmour in south of the city of casablanca after a 600 km journey his basin of about 35 000 km2 covers the fertile plains between the atlas and the atlantic coast and ensure the irrigation for all arable lands in central morocco fig 1 the groundwater resources that feed this basin are diverse and they have different physicochemical characteristics the fresh springs 0 5 g l have the higher flow rate 12 14 m3 s but they are contaminated near their outlet by a group of springs with a much lower flow rate 400 500 l s but with a high salinity of 17 5 g l this invisible and progressive salinity affects all irrigated perimeters along the river tadla bahira abda doukkala etc in the long term also the water supply of cities including the large metropolitan city of casablanca is threatened by this continuous and progressive degradation of water quality the identification of water resources contamination mechanism is crucial to implementing strategies for salinity reduction groundwater and surface water management also for the ecosystem protection archambault 1971 bobba et al 1992 leblanc et al 2003a 2003b tweed et al 2011 li and liu 2019 remote sensing satellite observation technology and geographic information systems gis have always been relevant elements which have greatly facilitated the study the management and the monitoring of water resources at different scales of investigation burdick and speirer 1981 švoma and houzim 1981 švoma and pysek 1983 švoma 1990 mahmoud 1996 magowe and carr 1999 mabee et al 1994 2002 sener et al 2004 hoffmann 2005 mansour and ait brahim 2005 mesev and walrath 2007 dar et al 2010 hutti and nijagunappa 2011 issiaka 2012 rodriguez et al 2016 porwal and gonzález álvarez 2018 it was therefore essential to undertake a study of the hydrogeological system and to determine the conditions of emergence as well as the causes of heterogeneity of the physicochemical proprieties of the water bodies in the area the analytical and interpretative elements are provided by a combination of remote sensing satellite imagery geographic information systems gis field studies and geochemical analysis 2 background of the study area 2 1 geographic location the study area corresponds to the high basin of oum er rabiaa which belongs geologically to the middle atlas domain michard and miege 1976 fig 1a it is exactly part of a transitional zone between the atlas of beni mellal and the middle northern atlas it should be noted that the middle atlas is a mountainous region extending over 400 km from the sw to the ne between the sraghna plain and the guercif plain it is bordered to the west by the bahira tadla plain and the moroccan central plateau to the east by the moulouya to the south and south east by the central high atlas and to the north by the meknes fès and the inaouene valley as illustrated in fig 1b the area is located about 40 km north of the city of khenifra and it is characterized by the presence of several irrigated perimeters 2 2 geological background the massive stratigraphic series of the studied basin is composed of a paleozoic basement on which rests in unconformity a sedimentary cover going from the triassic to the quaternary period the impermeable substratum is constituted by a permo triassic red salty clay gypsum and marl thereafter follows the liassic dolomitic limestones fig 2 2 3 hydrogeological background the main groundwater springs in the region are a set of emergences that characterize the structural contact between the liassic formations and its triassic substrate amraoui 2005 these springs appear in the screes located at the bottom of a large cliff each spring is made up of several outlets sometimes masked by the screes fig 3 these many emergences mix to form the main river of oum er rabiaa therefore these springs which are partly saline constitute the base flow of this large basin 2 4 geomorphology of the area the main aquifers of the atlas develop in carbonate rocks more or less fissured fractured and karstified amraoui 2005 menjour et al 2017 the predominance of liassic carbonate layers in the basin creates a geomorphological peculiarity marked on many occasions by spectacular limestone outcrops fig 4 the massive liassic limestone series that forms the majority of outcrops are intensely corroded by chemical and mechanical erosion the witnesses of karstification are frequently observed in the region fig 5 3 materials and methods 3 1 master data many types of data were used in the study of this particular issue earth observing satellites using satellite image landsat 8 etm enhanced thematic mapper plus creating detailed digital terrain model using aster satellite topographic map of khenifra at 1 50 000 scale geological map of morocco at 1 100 000 scale database containing the coordinates of fresh and saline springs in the area hydraulic basin agency of oum er rabiaa before using the acquired data a set of image pre processing operations filtering atmospheric correction main component analysis were carried out by a set of software in order to provide additional visual supports on which the extraction of lineaments and the field reality were based the flowchart below summarizes the methodology and the different operations followed during this study fig 6 3 2 data processing 3 2 1 pretreatment of satellite images this part consists of applying local processing to the images which means that the numerical value of a point will be reallocated according to its adjacent surrounding areas and therefore according to the spatial distribution the purpose of this operation is to improve the quality of images and increase the readability of data in order to select the areas of interest and prepare the analytical processing ehrich 1979 burdick and speirer 1981 touzi et al 1988 zhang et al 2016 adiri et al 2017 nguemhe fils et al 2018 these pre processing operations were carried out by various methods by emphasizing contours or directions eliminating background noise use of filters increasing the contrast of some pixels calculation of neochannels arithmetic combinations making radiometric or geographic masks to process part of the data for this study a low pass filter was applied over the entire topographic watershed to which the study area belongs the filter consists in spatializing the regional lineaments in the whole region and also clarified the vision about the area of interest 3 2 2 principal component analysis the principal component analysis is an effective technique for enhancing a multispectral image for geological interpretation purposes dar et al 2010 koita et al 2010 mwaniki et al 2017 nguemhe fils et al 2018 it reduces the information contained in several bands to a more limited number of components sometimes the information of 5 or 6 bands is reduced by the principal component analysis to only 3 components the resulting image of the principal component analysis was used several times during this work firstly during the extraction of lineaments and it was used also as a filter base to check the validity of these lineaments 3 2 3 lineament enhancement in this hydrogeological study the major interest is the discovery of discontinuities in textures for example the contours of relatively homogeneous zones which can reveal the presence of faults or fractures kayan and klemas 1978 burdick and speirer 1981 oikonomidis et al 2015 teikeu assatse et al 2016 having a significant link with the studied problem the lineament enhancement was achieved using directional filters in many angles 0 45 45 90 90 135 and 135 180 while performing a visual analysis to eliminate any misrepresentations that coincide with roads overhead power lines 3 3 fieldwork data in the hydrogeological studies the field observations are essential in order to determine the state of water resources in terms of quantity and quality walton 1979 banna et al 2014 coelho et al 2018 cooke et al 2018 li and liu 2019 it was essential to schedule several field missions thirteen field missions in order to evaluate the flow direction four field missions collect several water samples for laboratory analysis five field missions measure the fracturing and produce a structural map of the area four field missions 3 3 1 underground flow direction for this study four field missions were carried out the used methods are varied measurement of latitudes longitudes altitudes piezometric levels and conductivity the material used for this survey is global positioning system gps it allows to give the exact position in 3 dimensions latitude x longitude y and altitude z of the point at which the measurement is made piezometric sensor the sensor measures the depth at which the water surface is located at the measuring points it is fitted with an electrical sensor with a sound effect that lights up once the tip of the sensor is in contact with the water surface the water level is calculated by the difference between the soil altitude z and the water depth hp for the springs it is the altitude of natural emergence h z electrical conductivity meter a conductivity meter was used to measure the electrical conductivity of the water bodies by sweeping the entire area 3 3 2 geochemical analysis four prospecting and sampling missions were carried out during which 30 water samples were analyzed at the laboratory of the hydraulic direction of the oum er rabiaa basin appendix a to be noted that the analytical error as inferred from ionic balance was around 3 the major parameters measured and the various techniques used are summarized below the physicochemical parameters temperature electrical conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen were measured directly during the field missions using a u 52 horiba multi parameter probe the major ions concentrations were determined by using the volumetric titration method for ca2 mg2 cl hco3 the absorption uv visible spectrophotometer for so 4 the flame spectrometer for na and k 3 3 3 structural mapping and measurement of fracturing four field missions were carried out in the area with the aim of mapping the geological layers of the area and studying the structural elements the geological elements that have been studied in the field are the lithological composition the geological epoch of the geological layers the structural position of the geological formations 4 results 4 1 observation of major accidents by creating a low pass image for this study the filter was applied to the entire topographic basin to which the study area belongs which is the springs area of oum er rabiaa the result was useful and has made it possible to have an overview of fracturing and to specialize the regional lineaments throughout the region fig 7 the low pass image made it possible to visualize as much structural detail as possible and also confirming the existence of a large shear zone that pass through the area martin 1981 menjour et al 2017 this technique allows making a first appreciation of the of fracturing in the establishment of this hydrogeological system 4 2 enhancement of lineaments associated with the shear zone after applying the low pass filter to the study area it was found that the area is crossed by multi kilometer faults these large faults would have created tectonic dislocations where the groundwater circulation occurs amraoui 2005 it is from this first observation that the idea of using remote sensing to enhance the fracturing in the area was initiated the enhancement of lineaments associated with the large shear zones was realized using directional filters applied to the first principal component analysis pc1 at several angles 0 45 45 90 90 135 135 180 fig 8 a b c d the results were meaningful in all directions with well defined geological lineaments which means that the fracturing in the area is multi phased and it is manifested in the tectonic movement of geological faults lineaments which have compartmentalized the area and giving origin to a complex geometry also the directional filtering ensures that a wide variety of lineaments are captured and the privileged directions are those between 45 and 90 these results confirm the previous works done in the middle atlas zone and also confirm the information collected in the field oblique faults are therefore frequent features of this context 4 3 combination of directional filters the sobel filters combination fig 9 allows to specify privileged directions in the image by combining the 4 components previously extracted using directional filters horizontal vertical inclined nw se inclined ne sw in this way the sobel operator calculates the gradient intensity of each pixel by enlarging the filter window then an appreciation of the contribution of the geological faults could be made in relation with the sudden change in brightness variation from clear to dark touzi et al 1988 nezry et al 1991 ajith and sushmitha 2015 yeomans et al 2018 this combination of filters is widely used for the search of boundary and linear phenomena geology hydrology as it is the case in this study 4 4 land water discrimination this combination of bands is effective to identify land and water in this false color image the earth appears in shades of orange green and magenta while the water appears in shades of blue this combination made it possible to better identify the location of springs in the study area fig 10 4 5 mapping of major lineaments and synthesis map of fracturing the synthesis map of lineaments represents all the segments resulting from the superposition of the information contained in the 4 filtered images and also those provided by the sobel filters combinations the fig 11 includes all the extracted lineaments and highlights 4 families of orientation which are n s e w ne sw and nw se the two dominant directions are e w and ne sw the lineament synthesis map fig 11 and the fracturing density map fig 12 showed that the springs in the study area are organized in favour of lineaments representing geological faults which confirms that the detected lineaments are only sub surface expressions of deep geological phenomena in particular major shear zones crossing the area thus creating a series of new groundwater emergences with a particular physicochemical characteristics the directional distribution of lineaments shows that the direction n45 is the major direction of the lineaments grid fig 13 having a regional expression already noticed on the combinations of directional filters 4 6 validation of remote sensing results by fieldwork data 4 6 1 structural mapping and measurements of structural elements in order to characterize the flow systems in the area and to develop a relevant synthesis it was essential to go through the field study to compare the field data with the results of remote sensing and satellite imagery several field missions were carried out in order to highlight the different geological anomalies in the area in general the surveys have shown that the area is characterized by the presence of structural contacts that have juxtaposed the liassic limestones and the triassic clays fig 14 in this way the supply of emergences is ensured by the water which circulates into the compartments in tilted blocks formed as a result of the succession of extensive tectonic periods in the region the figures fig 15 and fig 16 show the springs that gush out in contact with the triassic clay and it is clearly noticed that these water bodies are characterized by whitish salt deposits indicating high salinity rates 4 6 2 underground flow direction after carrying out the geological surveys to validate the distribution of lineaments in the area the next objective was to identify the role of these lineaments in the groundwater circulation the proposed technique is to carry out a hydrogeological analysis of the groundwater circulation and to study the spatial variation of salinity the groundwater circulation fig 17 and the spatial distribution of salinity fig 18 in the area are made by following a privileged axis with a ne sw orientation indicating the same finding as the results obtained earlier which means that the water circulation is favoured in addition to the porosity of the liassic limestone aquifer by the faults acting as preferential water flow axes also these axes constitute structural contact zones between the liassic limestones and the triassic saline clays which indicates that the high values of salinity of the groundwater in the zone are only the result of the interaction of water bodies with the triassic saline clays in order to clarify this finding the following paragraph has been the subject of a geochemical characterization of the various water bodies in the area 4 7 geochemical characterization the results of physicochemical analyses are presented in the appended table appendix a these results show a large variability the piper diagram fig 19 shows that the samples collected in the fresh springs area are essentially bicarbonate calcium and magnesium type whereas the salt water samples are essentially sodium chloride and potassium type these results highlight the influence of geological characteristics on the physicochemical properties of the investigated water bodies this observation is also confirmed by the berkaloff diagram which shows a dominance of the chemical elements ca mg and hco3 in the fresh water samples indicating that these water bodies are derived from a karst carbonate reservoirs whereas the dominance of the chemical elements na k and cl in the salt water samples is essentially linked to the presence of the evaporite triassic formations fig 20 5 discussion in this section a detailed analysis is carried out in the light of the main findings obtained through this study the investigations carried out in this study revealed a strong link between the underground flows of the area and the fracturing the last one has allowed on the regional scale in the middle atlas to develop a stepped block structure and juxtapose the liassic limestones to the triassic saline clays on the local scale in the area of springs has made it possible to generate a specific circulation of groundwater whose physicochemical characteristics are essentially dictated by the geological formations through which the flows pass the elaboration of a geological cross section fig 21 and fig 22 allowed to further elucidate this finding and it is clearly observed that the fracturing gave rise to 2 distinct hydrogeological systems the first system it takes place only in the karstified units of the liassic formations and gives rise to the fresh springs the second system is characterized by a circulation which takes place partly in the liassic formation but thereafter it is only carried out on the triassic clays put in juxtaposition with the liassic limestones throughout the fracturing and the geological faults thus giving rise to the saline springs the upper basin of oum er rabiaa constitutes an important river network fed by many springs this hydrogeological system plays a primordial role in the economy and agriculture on the national level and ensures the irrigation of a large part of central morocco bolelli 1948 drpe 1985 belhacene et al 1992 faouzi et al 2001 barbouchi et al 2013 el harti et al 2016 nevertheless the present study demonstrated that this important water resource is contaminated from the outset with a set of saline springs as a consequence the river spills annually thousands of tons of na cl this salt is totally distributed throughout the irrigated perimeters and gradually accumulated in the soil and the water table fig 23 this situation deserves the strictest attention to avoid a disruption of the irrigated agriculture in the oum er rabiaa basin therefore the idea was put forward to try to retain this salt as close as possible to its natural origine before it reaches the fresh waters this idea is reinforced by the results obtained through the geological investigations conducted in the area which showed that all the saline springs emerge from the left bank of the oum er rabiaa river and can be routed to a point with an altitude of about 1250 a m s l fig 24 this point would be very favourable to several gravity operations and some proposed solutions are listed below diversion and gravity pipeline this solution is based on the channelling of the salt water to a series of evaporative basins to be created on the left bank of the river fig 24 this solution seems attractive a priori to try to recover the salt and valorize it for economic purposes under a local socio economic development purification in situ the desalination will be ensured by a treatment by the technique of reverse osmosis the discharge to the treatment unit to be created on the left bank of the river will be carried out by the solar energy photovoltaic pumping development of a fish farming project the project consists of the creation of a large basins to retain the saltwater for the purpose of rearing aquatic saltwater species in enclosures or cages that are open to the natural environment such as fish crustaceans molluscs and aquatic plants this project will allow on one hand to retain the saltwater and to avoid the contamination of the river and on the other hand to offer very interesting local development prospects 6 conclusion in this paper the scopes of investigation are broad evolving from the study on a general scale through remote sensing and satellite imagery tools to the study on a local scale using multiple fieldwork protocols and a set of geochemical analysis the application of a low pass filter showed that the springs area is crossed by a large shear corridor and the use of the directional filters under various angles showed that this shear zone is not composed of a single fracture but of a network of fractures with different orientations the field work protocols made it possible to validate the distribution of lineaments in the region and to identify their role in the circulation of groundwater bodies which led to the determination of two circulation systems with physicochemical properties mainly controlled by the geological characteristics and fracturing in the light of the obtained results a model of the groundwater circulation in the area was proposed as well as a set of solutions to ensure a better quality of water resources in the area this study has provided baseline data that could be used by decision makers to protect and monitor water resources furthermore the approach used in this work could be used at

12084,the basin of oum er rabiaa is part of the middle atlas it constitutes an important water resource on the scale of morocco the hydrogeological system of the region is characterized by many springs some of which have a high salinity rate spilling into oum er rabiaa river the present study aims to investigate firstly the distribution of lineaments along the major shear corridors crossing

obtained a set of solutions have been proposed such as the diversion of saline springs the purification in situ and the development of a fish farming project these solutions aim to guarantee a better quality of water resources of the area to preserve agriculture and to valorize the saline water bodies with a sustainable development perspective graphical abstract image 1 keywords water resources saline springs sustainable development geochemical analysis morocco 1 introduction arid and semi arid zones cover a large part of countries in the southern mediterranean periphery in these regions the water salinity is one of the main factors limiting the use of a considerable part of the available water resources zid and grignon 1991 hchicha and job 1994 bouchaou et al 2005 2008 lee 2010 amer et al 2012 in morocco as it is the case throughout north africa the issue of salt water is an extremely common phenomenon that influences the quality of water resources it is conditioned by a double factor on one hand the desert or sub desert climate which is currently present in a very large part of the country and on the other hand the existence of a period of lagoon deposits under a very dry and desert climate marked by the creation of salt deposits from the late permian until the early lias archambault 1972 étienne and guessab 1975 hinaje 2004 martin 1981 which is considered as the main cause of the presence of ancient saline soils that currently contaminate the water resources that flow through them which is the case in the current study water resource salinity is also a major factor that influences the fertility of agricultural soils leffelaar and sharma 1977 fao 2002 pitman and läuchli 2004 iptrid fao 2006 amer et al 2012 silber et al 2015 feng et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 on average the world loses 10 ha of arable lands per minute including 3 ha due to salinization this phenomenon constitutes a real risk to the world s food security indeed the salinization already affects 400 million hectares that suffer in different degrees and seriously threatens an equivalent surface area legros 2009 the high basin of oum er rabiaa which is the subject of this study contains the most important river in morocco bentayeb and leclerc 1977 it descends from the atlas mountains in khenifra region and joins the atlantic ocean at azzemmour in south of the city of casablanca after a 600 km journey his basin of about 35 000 km2 covers the fertile plains between the atlas and the atlantic coast and ensure the irrigation for all arable lands in central morocco fig 1 the groundwater resources that feed this basin are diverse and they have different physicochemical characteristics the fresh springs 0 5 g l have the higher flow rate 12 14 m3 s but they are contaminated near their outlet by a group of springs with a much lower flow rate 400 500 l s but with a high salinity of 17 5 g l this invisible and progressive salinity affects all irrigated perimeters along the river tadla bahira abda doukkala etc in the long term also the water supply of cities including the large metropolitan city of casablanca is threatened by this continuous and progressive degradation of water quality the identification of water resources contamination mechanism is crucial to implementing strategies for salinity reduction groundwater and surface water management also for the ecosystem protection archambault 1971 bobba et al 1992 leblanc et al 2003a 2003b tweed et al 2011 li and liu 2019 remote sensing satellite observation technology and geographic information systems gis have always been relevant elements which have greatly facilitated the study the management and the monitoring of water resources at different scales of investigation burdick and speirer 1981 švoma and houzim 1981 švoma and pysek 1983 švoma 1990 mahmoud 1996 magowe and carr 1999 mabee et al 1994 2002 sener et al 2004 hoffmann 2005 mansour and ait brahim 2005 mesev and walrath 2007 dar et al 2010 hutti and nijagunappa 2011 issiaka 2012 rodriguez et al 2016 porwal and gonzález álvarez 2018 it was therefore essential to undertake a study of the hydrogeological system and to determine the conditions of emergence as well as the causes of heterogeneity of the physicochemical proprieties of the water bodies in the area the analytical and interpretative elements are provided by a combination of remote sensing satellite imagery geographic information systems gis field studies and geochemical analysis 2 background of the study area 2 1 geographic location the study area corresponds to the high basin of oum er rabiaa which belongs geologically to the middle atlas domain michard and miege 1976 fig 1a it is exactly part of a transitional zone between the atlas of beni mellal and the middle northern atlas it should be noted that the middle atlas is a mountainous region extending over 400 km from the sw to the ne between the sraghna plain and the guercif plain it is bordered to the west by the bahira tadla plain and the moroccan central plateau to the east by the moulouya to the south and south east by the central high atlas and to the north by the meknes fès and the inaouene valley as illustrated in fig 1b the area is located about 40 km north of the city of khenifra and it is characterized by the presence of several irrigated perimeters 2 2 geological background the massive stratigraphic series of the studied basin is composed of a paleozoic basement on which rests in unconformity a sedimentary cover going from the triassic to the quaternary period the impermeable substratum is constituted by a permo triassic red salty clay gypsum and marl thereafter follows the liassic dolomitic limestones fig 2 2 3 hydrogeological background the main groundwater springs in the region are a set of emergences that characterize the structural contact between the liassic formations and its triassic substrate amraoui 2005 these springs appear in the screes located at the bottom of a large cliff each spring is made up of several outlets sometimes masked by the screes fig 3 these many emergences mix to form the main river of oum er rabiaa therefore these springs which are partly saline constitute the base flow of this large basin 2 4 geomorphology of the area the main aquifers of the atlas develop in carbonate rocks more or less fissured fractured and karstified amraoui 2005 menjour et al 2017 the predominance of liassic carbonate layers in the basin creates a geomorphological peculiarity marked on many occasions by spectacular limestone outcrops fig 4 the massive liassic limestone series that forms the majority of outcrops are intensely corroded by chemical and mechanical erosion the witnesses of karstification are frequently observed in the region fig 5 3 materials and methods 3 1 master data many types of data were used in the study of this particular issue earth observing satellites using satellite image landsat 8 etm enhanced thematic mapper plus creating detailed digital terrain model using aster satellite topographic map of khenifra at 1 50 000 scale geological map of morocco at 1 100 000 scale database containing the coordinates of fresh and saline springs in the area hydraulic basin agency of oum er rabiaa before using the acquired data a set of image pre processing operations filtering atmospheric correction main component analysis were carried out by a set of software in order to provide additional visual supports on which the extraction of lineaments and the field reality were based the flowchart below summarizes the methodology and the different operations followed during this study fig 6 3 2 data processing 3 2 1 pretreatment of satellite images this part consists of applying local processing to the images which means that the numerical value of a point will be reallocated according to its adjacent surrounding areas and therefore according to the spatial distribution the purpose of this operation is to improve the quality of images and increase the readability of data in order to select the areas of interest and prepare the analytical processing ehrich 1979 burdick and speirer 1981 touzi et al 1988 zhang et al 2016 adiri et al 2017 nguemhe fils et al 2018 these pre processing operations were carried out by various methods by emphasizing contours or directions eliminating background noise use of filters increasing the contrast of some pixels calculation of neochannels arithmetic combinations making radiometric or geographic masks to process part of the data for this study a low pass filter was applied over the entire topographic watershed to which the study area belongs the filter consists in spatializing the regional lineaments in the whole region and also clarified the vision about the area of interest 3 2 2 principal component analysis the principal component analysis is an effective technique for enhancing a multispectral image for geological interpretation purposes dar et al 2010 koita et al 2010 mwaniki et al 2017 nguemhe fils et al 2018 it reduces the information contained in several bands to a more limited number of components sometimes the information of 5 or 6 bands is reduced by the principal component analysis to only 3 components the resulting image of the principal component analysis was used several times during this work firstly during the extraction of lineaments and it was used also as a filter base to check the validity of these lineaments 3 2 3 lineament enhancement in this hydrogeological study the major interest is the discovery of discontinuities in textures for example the contours of relatively homogeneous zones which can reveal the presence of faults or fractures kayan and klemas 1978 burdick and speirer 1981 oikonomidis et al 2015 teikeu assatse et al 2016 having a significant link with the studied problem the lineament enhancement was achieved using directional filters in many angles 0 45 45 90 90 135 and 135 180 while performing a visual analysis to eliminate any misrepresentations that coincide with roads overhead power lines 3 3 fieldwork data in the hydrogeological studies the field observations are essential in order to determine the state of water resources in terms of quantity and quality walton 1979 banna et al 2014 coelho et al 2018 cooke et al 2018 li and liu 2019 it was essential to schedule several field missions thirteen field missions in order to evaluate the flow direction four field missions collect several water samples for laboratory analysis five field missions measure the fracturing and produce a structural map of the area four field missions 3 3 1 underground flow direction for this study four field missions were carried out the used methods are varied measurement of latitudes longitudes altitudes piezometric levels and conductivity the material used for this survey is global positioning system gps it allows to give the exact position in 3 dimensions latitude x longitude y and altitude z of the point at which the measurement is made piezometric sensor the sensor measures the depth at which the water surface is located at the measuring points it is fitted with an electrical sensor with a sound effect that lights up once the tip of the sensor is in contact with the water surface the water level is calculated by the difference between the soil altitude z and the water depth hp for the springs it is the altitude of natural emergence h z electrical conductivity meter a conductivity meter was used to measure the electrical conductivity of the water bodies by sweeping the entire area 3 3 2 geochemical analysis four prospecting and sampling missions were carried out during which 30 water samples were analyzed at the laboratory of the hydraulic direction of the oum er rabiaa basin appendix a to be noted that the analytical error as inferred from ionic balance was around 3 the major parameters measured and the various techniques used are summarized below the physicochemical parameters temperature electrical conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen were measured directly during the field missions using a u 52 horiba multi parameter probe the major ions concentrations were determined by using the volumetric titration method for ca2 mg2 cl hco3 the absorption uv visible spectrophotometer for so 4 the flame spectrometer for na and k 3 3 3 structural mapping and measurement of fracturing four field missions were carried out in the area with the aim of mapping the geological layers of the area and studying the structural elements the geological elements that have been studied in the field are the lithological composition the geological epoch of the geological layers the structural position of the geological formations 4 results 4 1 observation of major accidents by creating a low pass image for this study the filter was applied to the entire topographic basin to which the study area belongs which is the springs area of oum er rabiaa the result was useful and has made it possible to have an overview of fracturing and to specialize the regional lineaments throughout the region fig 7 the low pass image made it possible to visualize as much structural detail as possible and also confirming the existence of a large shear zone that pass through the area martin 1981 menjour et al 2017 this technique allows making a first appreciation of the of fracturing in the establishment of this hydrogeological system 4 2 enhancement of lineaments associated with the shear zone after applying the low pass filter to the study area it was found that the area is crossed by multi kilometer faults these large faults would have created tectonic dislocations where the groundwater circulation occurs amraoui 2005 it is from this first observation that the idea of using remote sensing to enhance the fracturing in the area was initiated the enhancement of lineaments associated with the large shear zones was realized using directional filters applied to the first principal component analysis pc1 at several angles 0 45 45 90 90 135 135 180 fig 8 a b c d the results were meaningful in all directions with well defined geological lineaments which means that the fracturing in the area is multi phased and it is manifested in the tectonic movement of geological faults lineaments which have compartmentalized the area and giving origin to a complex geometry also the directional filtering ensures that a wide variety of lineaments are captured and the privileged directions are those between 45 and 90 these results confirm the previous works done in the middle atlas zone and also confirm the information collected in the field oblique faults are therefore frequent features of this context 4 3 combination of directional filters the sobel filters combination fig 9 allows to specify privileged directions in the image by combining the 4 components previously extracted using directional filters horizontal vertical inclined nw se inclined ne sw in this way the sobel operator calculates the gradient intensity of each pixel by enlarging the filter window then an appreciation of the contribution of the geological faults could be made in relation with the sudden change in brightness variation from clear to dark touzi et al 1988 nezry et al 1991 ajith and sushmitha 2015 yeomans et al 2018 this combination of filters is widely used for the search of boundary and linear phenomena geology hydrology as it is the case in this study 4 4 land water discrimination this combination of bands is effective to identify land and water in this false color image the earth appears in shades of orange green and magenta while the water appears in shades of blue this combination made it possible to better identify the location of springs in the study area fig 10 4 5 mapping of major lineaments and synthesis map of fracturing the synthesis map of lineaments represents all the segments resulting from the superposition of the information contained in the 4 filtered images and also those provided by the sobel filters combinations the fig 11 includes all the extracted lineaments and highlights 4 families of orientation which are n s e w ne sw and nw se the two dominant directions are e w and ne sw the lineament synthesis map fig 11 and the fracturing density map fig 12 showed that the springs in the study area are organized in favour of lineaments representing geological faults which confirms that the detected lineaments are only sub surface expressions of deep geological phenomena in particular major shear zones crossing the area thus creating a series of new groundwater emergences with a particular physicochemical characteristics the directional distribution of lineaments shows that the direction n45 is the major direction of the lineaments grid fig 13 having a regional expression already noticed on the combinations of directional filters 4 6 validation of remote sensing results by fieldwork data 4 6 1 structural mapping and measurements of structural elements in order to characterize the flow systems in the area and to develop a relevant synthesis it was essential to go through the field study to compare the field data with the results of remote sensing and satellite imagery several field missions were carried out in order to highlight the different geological anomalies in the area in general the surveys have shown that the area is characterized by the presence of structural contacts that have juxtaposed the liassic limestones and the triassic clays fig 14 in this way the supply of emergences is ensured by the water which circulates into the compartments in tilted blocks formed as a result of the succession of extensive tectonic periods in the region the figures fig 15 and fig 16 show the springs that gush out in contact with the triassic clay and it is clearly noticed that these water bodies are characterized by whitish salt deposits indicating high salinity rates 4 6 2 underground flow direction after carrying out the geological surveys to validate the distribution of lineaments in the area the next objective was to identify the role of these lineaments in the groundwater circulation the proposed technique is to carry out a hydrogeological analysis of the groundwater circulation and to study the spatial variation of salinity the groundwater circulation fig 17 and the spatial distribution of salinity fig 18 in the area are made by following a privileged axis with a ne sw orientation indicating the same finding as the results obtained earlier which means that the water circulation is favoured in addition to the porosity of the liassic limestone aquifer by the faults acting as preferential water flow axes also these axes constitute structural contact zones between the liassic limestones and the triassic saline clays which indicates that the high values of salinity of the groundwater in the zone are only the result of the interaction of water bodies with the triassic saline clays in order to clarify this finding the following paragraph has been the subject of a geochemical characterization of the various water bodies in the area 4 7 geochemical characterization the results of physicochemical analyses are presented in the appended table appendix a these results show a large variability the piper diagram fig 19 shows that the samples collected in the fresh springs area are essentially bicarbonate calcium and magnesium type whereas the salt water samples are essentially sodium chloride and potassium type these results highlight the influence of geological characteristics on the physicochemical properties of the investigated water bodies this observation is also confirmed by the berkaloff diagram which shows a dominance of the chemical elements ca mg and hco3 in the fresh water samples indicating that these water bodies are derived from a karst carbonate reservoirs whereas the dominance of the chemical elements na k and cl in the salt water samples is essentially linked to the presence of the evaporite triassic formations fig 20 5 discussion in this section a detailed analysis is carried out in the light of the main findings obtained through this study the investigations carried out in this study revealed a strong link between the underground flows of the area and the fracturing the last one has allowed on the regional scale in the middle atlas to develop a stepped block structure and juxtapose the liassic limestones to the triassic saline clays on the local scale in the area of springs has made it possible to generate a specific circulation of groundwater whose physicochemical characteristics are essentially dictated by the geological formations through which the flows pass the elaboration of a geological cross section fig 21 and fig 22 allowed to further elucidate this finding and it is clearly observed that the fracturing gave rise to 2 distinct hydrogeological systems the first system it takes place only in the karstified units of the liassic formations and gives rise to the fresh springs the second system is characterized by a circulation which takes place partly in the liassic formation but thereafter it is only carried out on the triassic clays put in juxtaposition with the liassic limestones throughout the fracturing and the geological faults thus giving rise to the saline springs the upper basin of oum er rabiaa constitutes an important river network fed by many springs this hydrogeological system plays a primordial role in the economy and agriculture on the national level and ensures the irrigation of a large part of central morocco bolelli 1948 drpe 1985 belhacene et al 1992 faouzi et al 2001 barbouchi et al 2013 el harti et al 2016 nevertheless the present study demonstrated that this important water resource is contaminated from the outset with a set of saline springs as a consequence the river spills annually thousands of tons of na cl this salt is totally distributed throughout the irrigated perimeters and gradually accumulated in the soil and the water table fig 23 this situation deserves the strictest attention to avoid a disruption of the irrigated agriculture in the oum er rabiaa basin therefore the idea was put forward to try to retain this salt as close as possible to its natural origine before it reaches the fresh waters this idea is reinforced by the results obtained through the geological investigations conducted in the area which showed that all the saline springs emerge from the left bank of the oum er rabiaa river and can be routed to a point with an altitude of about 1250 a m s l fig 24 this point would be very favourable to several gravity operations and some proposed solutions are listed below diversion and gravity pipeline this solution is based on the channelling of the salt water to a series of evaporative basins to be created on the left bank of the river fig 24 this solution seems attractive a priori to try to recover the salt and valorize it for economic purposes under a local socio economic development purification in situ the desalination will be ensured by a treatment by the technique of reverse osmosis the discharge to the treatment unit to be created on the left bank of the river will be carried out by the solar energy photovoltaic pumping development of a fish farming project the project consists of the creation of a large basins to retain the saltwater for the purpose of rearing aquatic saltwater species in enclosures or cages that are open to the natural environment such as fish crustaceans molluscs and aquatic plants this project will allow on one hand to retain the saltwater and to avoid the contamination of the river and on the other hand to offer very interesting local development prospects 6 conclusion in this paper the scopes of investigation are broad evolving from the study on a general scale through remote sensing and satellite imagery tools to the study on a local scale using multiple fieldwork protocols and a set of geochemical analysis the application of a low pass filter showed that the springs area is crossed by a large shear corridor and the use of the directional filters under various angles showed that this shear zone is not composed of a single fracture but of a network of fractures with different orientations the field work protocols made it possible to validate the distribution of lineaments in the region and to identify their role in the circulation of groundwater bodies which led to the determination of two circulation systems with physicochemical properties mainly controlled by the geological characteristics and fracturing in the light of the obtained results a model of the groundwater circulation in the area was proposed as well as a set of solutions to ensure a better quality of water resources in the area this study has provided baseline data that could be used by decision makers to protect and monitor water resources furthermore the approach used in this work could be used at
