a coupled hec hms and hec ras models for different flood scenarios calibrated and validated hec hms models were used to forecast floods in terms of peak flows and results forced into the 2d unsteady flow hec ras model to simulate flood inundation areas new hydrological insight for the region the calibrated and validated hec hms model indicated good performance nse 0 65 in simulating the runoff

retention basin the retention basin increased the basin lag time by an average of 4 h across all different flood scenarios the introduction of retention basins will serve a pivotal role in flood management and planning in the orb graphical abstract ga1 keywords flood arrival time flood attenuation hec ras odaw river basin orb retention basin return period data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods have become a rampant natural disaster in a number of countries and hence a global concern singh et al 2018 since the 2000 s the number of flood cases in the world have nearly doubled when compared to the 1990s guha sapir et al 2004 floods poses serious threat with huge socio economic burden and health implications on victims cred 2018 extreme events in africa europe and asia demonstrate the importance of climate change in causing increased flood incidences floods are linked not only to climate change but also to urbanization dynamics hassan et al 2022 in sub saharan africa floods are deemed as the most commonest natural disaster with the propensity of disrupting socio economic activities altering ecosystem services and functions and ultimately impacting on the quality of lives pusch et al 2016 cred 2018 on the global scale aside disease outbreaks and accidents flooding is the third most common environmental disaster adversely claiming 20 million lives annually asumadu sarkodie et al 2015 in ghana hydro meteorological risks have been identified as the most common source of catastrophes and emergencies over the past century ansah et al 2020 surface runoff volumes are surging as a result of increases in impervious surface areas caused by increases inh urban expansion guo 2001 the world bank 2011 categorized ghana as one of the most flood prone countries in west africa with severe implications especially for urban areas ifrc 2011 a very telling example is the june 3rd twin disaster of flood and fire that claimed the lives of about 200 people recount could also be made of the over 100 00 people killed and an estimated land size of 196 km2 of crops destroyed in the northern part of ghana due to high rainfall intensities coupled with discharges from the bagre dam from burkina faso floodlist 2018 for centuries hydraulic structures have been used as one of the key structural measures in regulating floods in most instances the objective is to prevent overflows and ensure that flood peaks and volumes are quickly dissipated guo 2001 one of the best flood prevention strategies is reservoir construction building reservoirs is done to quickly control flood effects and lessen the peak flood discharge building check dams is an effective engineering measure for flood attenuation in torrential mountain streams mostafazadeh et al 2017 and soil erosion control in arid and semiarid regions with high sediment yields a check dam is a hydraulic structure that is built across a channel or gully to retain runoff and promote sedimentation conservation chen et al 2023 they are built in many countries including mexico spain italy iran ethiopia and china due to their high efficiency in sediment reduction and low construction costs piton et al 2020 ran et al 2021 guyassa et al 2017 reduced annual runoff and sediment yields caused by check dams have been widely observed and studied at the catchment scale ran et al 2021 check dams can also be a series of small barriers built across steep tributary streams with simple geometry as a result small reservoirs capable of storing floodwaters are created reducing flood peak discharge and lengthen the time to peak in downstream areas yuan et al 2019 they may also have an impact on the transfer of runoff from uplands to lower areas and thus on runoff connectivity in the landscape guyassa et al 2017 retention basin are one of the most commonly used flood mitigation structures around the world chan et al 1997 did 2000 bustami et al 2009 takaijudin et al 2010 it is typically designed to manage high upstream runoff volume by incorporating a permanent pond area with landscaped banks and surroundings to provide additional storage capacity during rainfall events it allows runoff to infiltrate into the soil and can sometimes be modified to serve as water storage for irrigation purposes in order to alleviate agricultural water shortages camnasio and becciu 2011 a retention basin can function as an on stream or off stream facility guo 2012 a designed spillway directs the extra flood water into the off stream basin when the inflow channel is full retention basins are strategically positioned within drainage networks to efficiently attenuate the peak flood flows guo 2004 some best management practices bmps for urban stormwater management have been implemented in developing countries some bmps such as retention basins have storage treatment capabilities and are typically designed for runoff reduction and pollutant removal semadeni davies 2006 balascio and lucas 2009 as a result it is necessary to investigate the effectiveness of these alternative practices for urban flood mitigation according to asare kyei et al 2015 there were significant floods in the following years 1973 1986 1995 1999 2001 and 2002 with the majority of them happening in accra ghana s capital accra is a populous city which has been struck consistently with high flood incidence in accra it is estimated that about 172 000 residents are at risk of flooding rain et al 2011 of that total 33 000 residents are located in slums or substandard housing units considering the marked changes in average monthly precipitation from 160 mm in 1991 2010 to 200 mm in 2011 2030 ipcc 2010 flood risk incidence is anticipated to worsen to forestall any future flood occurences the government of ghana with funding from the world bank is implementing the greater accra resilient and integrated development garid project the garid project with a duration of six years 2020 2025 is aimed at building long term capability for flood risk management and mitigate flood risk in the odaw river basin the odaw basin in the greater accra region is identified as the entry point of the intervention given its high flood risk population and business density amongst the four main basin in the greater accra region the odaw basin which passes through the most urbanized areas of the region has the highest overall flood risks two retention basins have been proposed to be constructed on two sites namely atomic energy east and atomic energy west in ga east municipal assembly the retention basins are to store peak flood waters as a means of reducing the risk of floods at these two locations we hypothesize that establishing a retention basin in the odaw river basin will have an impact on downstream peak attenuation however the magnitude of the impact remains unknown and thus the study seeks to examine the without and with a retention basin effects on flood peaks by quantifying peak flow and runoff volume attenuation as well as the time of flood arrival in the lower sections of the odaw river basin orb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area odaw river basin orb the odaw river basin fig 1 is located in the dry equatorial climatic zone between latitudes 5 52 n and 5 32 n and longitudes 0 10 w and 0 15 w with a total catchment area of approximately 275 km2 the odaw river begins near aburi in the akuapem hills meanders south and eventually empty into the sea atlantic ocean through the korle lagoon which serves as the main repository for most streams in accra the river basin has the country s highest population density accounting for 60 of the greater accra region s population estimated at 4 3 million people and is plagued by continuous flooding with an estimated 30 of the population at risk living in flood prone informal settlements mwh 2019 the basin features a low lying geography with altitudes ranging from 7 to 460 m above mean sea level with a succession of hills slopes and rare rocky headlands ofori sarpong et al 2001 the basin is reasonably flat from the center to the southern half while the northern half is steep the odaw river basin is located in ghana s equatorial climate zone which is influenced by two major winds the moisture laden southwest monsoon winds from the atlantic ocean which are responsible for precipitation events and the north east trade winds harmattan from the saharan desert which are responsible for dry and hazy dry times the basin is located in the geomorphic western coastal region of accra ofori sarpong et al 2001 the basin experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern with major and minor rainy seasons the major rainy season begins in april and ends in october during the two seasons total annual precipitation averages 730 mm ghana statistical service 2014 rainfall duration within the odaw river watershed is usually short but heavy resulting in floods particularly in locations where drainage routes are clogged attipoe 2015 march is the warmest month of the year with an average temperature of 28 c august is the coldest month of the year with an average temperature of 24 7 c danquah 2013 relative humidity ranges from 65 in the afternoon to 95 at night ghana statistical service 2014 flooding has long been a source of concern for the basin s water management as the landscape is characterized by relatively flat lands and occasional hills with an average height of 20 m above sea level nyarko 2000 2 2 data acquisition and geo spatial preprocessing hydro meteorological and physiographic data are the two most important types of data sets required in hydrological modeling arsenault et al 2020 the hydro meteorological data used for this study are mean daily rainfall 1910 2020 obtained from the ghana meteorological agency and the ghana hydrological services department for the purpose of model calibration and validation a digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution and landsat 8 oli tirs satellite images acquired on 25 01 2021 were obtained from usgs earth explorer http www usgs gov table 1 for use in the study the flow direction flow accumulation and stream link grids were generated from the dem and used for the extraction of drainage networks and stream orders using arcgis version 10 6 3 from these physical parameters initial estimates of unit hydrograph parameters time of concentration tc and curve number cn were estimated for the orb reach routing parameters such as reach slope and length were also calculated in google earth pro extracting the boundary shape file from the dem and values imported into the hec hms model 2 3 hec hms model development without and with retention basin structure scenarios 2 3 1 without a retention basin arcgis version 10 6 3 was used to create the project for the basin as well as gather input data sets for the hec hms modeling the project basin model contains the hydrologic elements and their connectivity in the project basin model indicates the flow of water from the headwater source in aburi down through to atomic the parameters i e area and curve number generated served as inputs into the hec hms model the basin major hydrological parameters were estimated using the loss transform and routing methods the selection of the loss transformation and routing methods for each component of the hydrological processes in the event based hydrological modeling of the odaw river basin was based on data availability suitability for same hydrologic condition applicability and limitations of each method fig 2 shows a flowchart of the methodology for the hydrological model development in hec hms without a retention basin structure 2 3 2 with a retention basin structure a reservoir or retention pond reduces the negative effects of excess water by storing it in a way that prevents damage downstream retention basins mostly referred to as infiltration basins use infiltration as their principal method of storm water disposal flood control basins wet or dry are constructed to retain water in order to prevent floods and infiltration is thought to be the only way for the stored water to exit in hec hms the source creation tool was used as the inflow point i e from aburi down through to atomic east where the retention pond would be constructed a reservoir routing method was used to model the impact of a retention basin on downstream reaches within the orb fig 2 shows a flowchart of the methodology for the hydrological model development in hec hms with a retention basin structure 2 4 estimation of rainfall loss rainfall loss was accounted for using the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method in hec hms this method is widely used in rainfall runoff modeling events walega and salata 2019 satheeshkumar et al 2017 amutha and porchelvan 2009 the method includes the determination of three main parameters initial abstraction ia curve number cn and percentage imperviousness initial abstraction is the amount of precipitation that is trapped in cracks sinks and other formations or structures at the start of a rainfall event initial abstraction can be calculated as ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 1 iα 0 2 s where iα initial abstraction 2 s 25400 cn 254 where s total maximum retention mm cn curve number the cn represents the continuous rainfall losses after the initial abstraction has been exceeded the scs cn method calculates a curve number cn that accounts for the amount of rainfall that infiltrates the soil as well as the amount of surface runoff sahu et al 2007 curve number values range from approximately 30 for permeable soils with high infiltration rates to 100 for water bodies impervious surfaces and soils with near zero infiltration rates rimfors and velichkin 2015 and veichkin 2015 the average curve number for the sub basin was determined through arcgis 10 6 3 using the lulc map soil data and dem of the basin when a catchment consists of different land uses and soil types the curve number is calculated by the eq 3 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 3 cn composite a i cn i a i where cncomposite the composite curve number used for runoff volume estimationi an index of watersheds subdivision having uniform land use and soil typeai drainage area of a certain subdivision icni the curve number for subdivision i for this model both the percent impervious and initial abstraction were made to have a 0 significance value this was done in order to model the highest possible flood in the catchment i e worst scenario flood 2 5 direct runoff estimation the transform model simulates the direct runoff of excess precipitation on the watershed tassew et al 2019 hec hms incorporates numerous unit hydrograph methods for converting excess rainfall into a runoff the scs unit hydrograph model was selected for modeling direct runoff the sole input for this technique is the lag time t lag it is computed for each watershed based on the time of concentration tc from the center of mass of excess rainfall to the hydrograph peak the kirpich time of concentration eq 4 method was adopted for this study due to the temporal aspects of hydrological events time of concentrations are critical since they directly affect peak runoff and flow duration in estimating flood effects on properties and life 4 tc 0 0195 l0 77 s 0 385 tc time of concentration min l length of overland flow m s gradient of surface m m 5 t l a g 0 6 t c the time of concentration is the time taken for a drop to travel from the farthest point to the sub basin outlet while the storage coefficient represents the storage effects attenuation of the sub basin 2 6 flood routing estimation the routing model is used to simulate flow from the upstream parts of a basin to the downstream or basin s outlet nandalal and ratmayake 2010 flood runoff is attenuated as it passes along the channel reach due to channel storage effects this reduction is considered by the routing models in hec hms tassew et al 2019 the muskingum method was used in this study the muskingum routing method yields acceptable results than the muskingum cunge routing model with the later normally overestimating discharge values relative to a basin or watershed laouacheria et al 2018 in the muskingum method the downstream outflow can be predicted by using 6 oj 1 c0ij 1 c1ij c2oj where c0 c1 and c2 are the routing coefficients oj 1 downstream outflow at time j 1 m3 sec oj downstream outflow at time j m3 sec ij 1 upstream inflow at time j 1 m3 sec ij upstream inflow at time j m3 sec if the observed inflow and outflow hydrographs are available for a river reach the values of k and x is determined with the following equation 7 k 0 5 t i j 1 i j o j 1 o j x i j 1 i j 1 x o j 1 o j where k wave travel time h x weighting factor δt time interval h standard muskingum routing was used to complete the channel routing in the final model there was only one reach the muskingum k was determined using journey time estimations calculated by the gis based on channel slope and length values 2 7 retention basin design concept retention basins are pools with extra storage capacity that are designed to reduce surface runoff during rainfall events they are made up of a permanent pond area with landscaped banks and surroundings to provide extra storage capacity during rain events they are formed by excavating a new depression or excavating an existing natural depression gómez et al 2013 fig 3 is a conceptualization of the retention basin model design the target flow stored in the retention pond and inflow peak are 113 units and 186 units respectively in this diagram to bring this peak down to the desired level storage is provided as a result the amount of water in the shaded area is stored and used for other purposes i e irrigation or recreation 2 8 retention basin model in hec hms 2 8 1 defining reservoir routing the common level pool routing model can be used to calculate outflow from an impoundment with a horizontal water surface also known as modified plus routing model the model discretizes time breaking the total analysis time into equal intervals of duration δt it then solves recursively the following one dimensional approximation of the continuity equation 8 iavg oavg δs δt where iavg average inflow during time interval oavg average outflow during time interval δs storage change with a finite difference approximation this can be written as 9 i t it 1 2 o t o t 1 2 s t 1 st δ t where t index of time interval it and it 1 the inflow values at the beginning and end of the tth time interval respectively ot and ot 1 the corresponding outflow values st and st 1 corresponding storage values this equation can be rearranged as follows 10 2 st 1 δ t ot 1 i t i t 1 2 st δ t o t all terms on the right hand side are known the values of it and it 1 are the inflow hydrograph ordinates perhaps computed with models described earlier in the manual the values of ot and st are known at the tth time interval at t 0 these are the initial conditions and at each subsequent interval they are known from calculation in the previous interval for an impoundment storage and outflow are related and with this storage outflow relationship the corresponding values of ot 1 and st 1 can be found the computations can be repeated for successive intervals yielding values ot 1 ot 2 ot n the required outflow hydrograph ordinates 2 8 2 spillway design for outflow spillways are constructions at the top of dam like structures that allow water to flow uncontrollably over the top the reservoir model in hec hms can contain up to ten autonomous spillways broad crested ogee and user specified are the three methods for calculating discharge through a spillway hec 2022 the retention basin model used a broad crested spillway the broad crested spillway allows for uncontrolled flow over the reservoir s top according to the weir flow assumptions nrmrl 2002 the calculations for spillways begin with the standard weir equation 11 q clh 3 2 where q discharge over the weir or spillway crest c discharge coefficient accounts for energy losses as water enters the spillway flows through the spillway and eventually exits the spillway typical values will range from 2 6 to 4 0 depending upon the shape of the spillway crest l length of the spillway crest h upstream energy head above the spillway crest according to nemo 2005 the depth of a retention pond must be approximately 1 5 m 3 0 m deep with a bottom slope of 2 minimum the minimum depth of water in the pond must be 0 9 m the preferred depth of water in the retention pond should be between 1 2 m and 2 4 m strom 2009 the side slope should not be steeper than 3 1 or 4 1 or flatter and the slope of the retention pond should be defined by a basin length to width ratio of at least 3 1 pwud 2014 averagely the ponding time should be approximately 14 days or more for retention ponds strom 2005 2 9 model performance evaluation objective functions are statistical criteria used to determine the performance of a model and can consist of two of more goodness of fit gof measures depending on the model objective garcia et al 2017 the study used four objective functions to access the model accuracy namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percentage bias δb percent difference in runoff volume vr and the percent difference in peak discharge qp these objective functions are commonly used to access the performance of rainfall runoff models de silva et al 2014 skhakhfa and ouerdachi 2016 tassew

in 1999 specifically from 1st to 4th june per the 30 year rainfall data from the ghana meteorological agency gmet which corresponds to the findings of ackom et al 2020 as a result events from 1999 and the dates 1st to 4th june were chosen for the study the odaw river basin orb has no stream flow gauge station therefore for the model calibration the peak rainfall mm and discharge m3 s values reported by nyarko 2000 at the upper middle section of the orb was used the model was manually calibrated to make sure the model is an accurate reflection of the watershed areas above the odaw river basin orb have a storage coefficient of 0 2 and a runoff coefficient of 0 7 nyarko 2000 the runoff and storage coefficients from aburi s land use and land cover would influence the scs curve number 70 99 used in model calibration the frequency storm values used in the meteorological model were selected with respect to a rainfall return period value mm to achieve agreement between simulated and observed discharge flow data the model was automatically calibrated this method employs an iterative process to minimize the objective function to improve the calibration results optimization trials were conducted 3 2 validation the design document provided by the ghana hydrological department for the garid project stated that peak flows for various return periods at the atomic eastern site which is on average twice of the peak discharges recorded for the atomic western site the use of the 10 year return period peak flow event at the atomic east for validation was based on factors such as characteristics of the basin rainfall and lack of a streamflow gauge station in the odaw river basin the optimized parameters from the calibration stage were used to simulate flood events for peak discharges reaching the atomic eastern site by a 10 year return period flooding event for sensitivity analysis parameters such as curve number muskingum k muskingum x and lag time were adjusted in the range of 20 with 5 intervals to analyze the sensitivity of the calibration parameters 3 3 forecasting of peak flows the intensity duration frequency idf table table 2 was calculated from the 30 year rainfall data provided by the ghana meteorological agency gmet for aburi the calculated idf table was used for the simulation of forecasted peak flows reaching atomic east within the orb the idf shows the peak rainfall intensities for a 24 hour rainfall expressed in return periods the estimated rainfall depths from the idf table corresponding to 30 years 15 years 10 years 5 years and 1 year return periods were used as inputs into the established calibrated hydrologic model using the frequency storm method of the meteorological model in hec hms discharge hydrographs generated from the simulations were used as input data for the hec ras 2d unsteady flow computation model to determine the areas inundated by a return period flooding event 3 4 hec ras 2d model simulations for flood inundation simulations the study used hec ras 2d which is a 2 dimensional hydraulic model hydrodynamics horizontal and vertical flows and 2d flow visualization were all considered in this simulation model quirogaa et al 2016 allen 2021 the discharge values used by the model were obtained from the hec hms flood routing model manning s roughness coefficients were generated by inputting the terrain dem into ras mapper and reclassifying the land cover changes in hec ras using the national land cover database nlcd 2016 classification table 3 prior to the model building an aster dem with a resolution of 30 m was processed in arcgis to ensure spatial homogeneity the model was discretized into an equal number of grid cells of 30 m by 30 m i e equal geometry a dem with the same resolution was used because it was suitable for hydrological modeling investigations allen 2021 to preserve uniformity additional topographical characteristics and infrastructure layers were also made comparable to make 2d flow simulations a lot easier the hec ras 2d model allows the user the choice of three equation sets namely 2d diffusion wave equations not considered in this work shallow water equations swe elm with a eulerian lagrangian approach to solving for advection or a new shallow water equation solver swe em that uses a eulerian approach for advection the shallow water equations are derived from equations of conservation of mass and conservation of linear momentum the navier stokes equations which still holds with the assumptions of shallow water break down such as across a hydraulic jump in the case of a horizontal bed with negligible coriolis forces frictional and viscous forces the shallow water equations are 14 ρ η t ρ η u x ρ η v y 0 15 ρ η u t x ρ η 2 1 2 ρ g η 2 ρ η uv y 0 16 ρ η v t ρ η uv x y ρ η v 2 1 2 ρ g η 2 0 here η is the total fluid column height instantaneous fluid depth as a function of x y and t and the 2d vector u v is the fluid s horizontal flow velocity averaged across the vertical column further g is acceleration due to gravity and ρ is the fluid density the first equation is derived from mass conservation the second two from momentum conservation the shallow water equations swe elm with a eulerian lagrangian was used for this study due to its explicit solution scheme based on a strictly conservative form of the momentum equation and high accuracy swe elm solver produces less numerical diffusion than the swe em solver if a time step controlled by the courant number 1 0 is used in the setup otherwise instabilities are expected to occur due to the explicit nature of the scheme hec ras 2016 the hec ras software requires that all time steps end up exactly hitting the mapping output interval this requirement is because output for hec ras mapper must be written to the output file for all cross sections storage areas and 2d cells at the mapping interval due to this fact entering a maximum number of doubling base time step that results in a computation interval that does not exactly land on the mapping output interval then the unsteady flow computational program will compute its own time steps that work with the parameters hence the use of a courant number 3 5 hec ras 2d model flood plain the model geometry is linked to the digital terrain model dtm to visualize the flood plain this dtm is used to create a 2d mesh region by starting with a polygon shapefile with 37 518 cells the dtm and 2d mesh area are shown in fig 4 which includes a submerged area and water depths at each grid cell this can be used to calculate water surface heights depict flood plain geometry and assess flood risk in various communities around the catchment the ability of the hec ras software to provide a graphical representation of the inundated area in 2d as well as the flood depth and to calculate the time of flood arrival is one key advantage hec 2022 the arrival time h days in the hec ras results computation indicates how long it will take for water at a given depth to reach a specific location within the watershed depending on the characteristics of the basin such as land use changes land topography basin size and shape etc it is computed in days or in hours 3 6 hec ras 2d flood plain area creation landsat 8 oli tirs satellite images for the year 2021 was used in generating the land use land cover map fig 5 used for the model calibration the dimensions of the 2d flow area was drawn based on literature and news reports of areas inundated as a result of peak flows within the study area during calibration manning s coefficient values between 0 01 and 0 85 were utilized as an input to the model hec ras 2016 it was determined using the nlcd 2016 land use description and basin characteristic hec ras 2016 shown in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration for the calibration of the model the peak rainfall value recorded by nyarko 2000 at the same upper middle region of the odaw river basin i e atomic east that produced a peak discharge was used the most important aspect of the hydrograph when evaluating a flood event is the peak flow which corresponds to the greatest downstream flooding the hydrological services department of ghana does not record discharges because there is no streamflow gauge station in the odaw river basin however the model outcomes demonstrated a good fit between the simulated and the observed reported values following optimization and functions well across a variety of events even though the model tended to slightly overestimate the runoff before optimization the shape of the hydrograph and time of peaks matches suitably with the findings of nyarko 2000 table 4 and fig 6 the sensitivity analysis revealed that the curve number muskingum k muskingum x and lag time were shown to be the most sensitive less sensitive and least sensitive model parameters respectively this is consistent with the study of tassew et al 2019 who in their study conducted a sensitivity analysis of parameters by changing parameter values in the range 20 with 5 intervals until best fit was obtained between observed and simulated parameters the modeling results of peak discharge total volume and their relative errors in comparison to observed data the nash sutcliffe efficiency and root mean square error values during calibration are shown in table 4 the nse value obtained from the model calibration was 0 949 this indicated a very good agreement between the observed and simulated runoff based on the recommended nse values above 0 65 by hagen et al 2020 for flood forecasting in africa the percentage bias gave a satisfactory performance of 0 54 which is considered very good on the whole the model performs well with good agreement between simulated and observed values 4 2 model validation the design document for the proposed retention ponds on the garid project reported a peak discharge of 46 8 m3 s for a 10 year return period storm at atomic west and reported a peak discharge of 93 8 m3 s at atomic east for a 10 year return period the value reported at the atomic east site is approximately twice that recorded at atomic west i e a tributary of the main odaw and this was used for the model validation it was observed table 4 and fig 7 that the peak discharge for the 10 year return period at atomic east is slightly overestimated the percent difference in peak discharge was 18 3 the total volume was also slightly overestimated the percent difference in runoff volume was 19 4 considering the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criteria good results were obtained between the observed and simulated values with nse value of 0 942 the total simulation results of the events chosen for validation suggests that the hec hms model has the potential to perform well in predicting peak flows and runoff volume at atomic east within the odaw river basin using scs curve number and frequency storm methods 4 3 hec ras model computation the unsteady flow computation equation was used for the hec ras 2d model and the results from the 2d surface water elevation swe elm showed the model was very accurate with 1 overall volume accounting for error which corresponds to an actual volume of 1 351 m3 and took an hour and twenty seven minutes for the simulation run using 21 iterations in hec ras computations an error percentage less than 1 shows that the model is a very good one table 4 1 4 4 basin flood processes and inundation areas without retention basins the odaw river is the most susceptible basin to floods in the country hsd 2019 over 50 of accra s population are inhabitants within the odaw river basin and approximately half of this population live in informal settlements and others are in close proximity to the main odaw river world bank 2019 peak discharges coming from aburi reaching atomic i e upstream of odaw ranges from 131 1 m3 s 121 6 m3 s 106 4 m3 s 88 m3 s and 59 m3 s for the different return period scenarios i e 30 to 1 year respectively table 4 2 the peak discharges with flood volumes ranging from 6377 0 m3 to 14 272 4 m3 reach downstream communities at various flood arrival times depending on the return period of the flood event fig 8 the depths of flood inundated at these selected areas also vary with respect to the proximity of the community to the inflow point upstream the odaw land use land cover changes and proximity to the main odaw river table 4 3 globally flood disasters are common in low lying or flood plains which are heavily developed bathrellos et al 2018 accra is a low lying area and communities like alajo achimota and kotobabi are densely populated with high impervious surfaces created due to urbanization and industrialization table 3 and fig 5 this causes an increase in flood depths resulting in higher flood inundations in these communities whenever there is heavy rainfall runoff table 4 3 however there is a strong correlation between discharge and flood arrival times across the various communities in the orb and this is well highlighted in fig 8 the longer the return period the higher the flood level which influences water velocity and thus increases flood arrival times considering that only aburi inflows were used in the simulations the volumes of water reaching downstream of the odaw without a retention basin intervention are enormous the basin is prone to flooding with the lower reaches bearing the brunt of the damage nyarko 2000 it has a number of tributaries joining up downstream hsd 2019 and this is what causes the rampant high flood incidences particularly downstream of the basin the dome pillar 2 flood case is one of many reported examples according to the ghanaian times newspaper on wednesday may 29 2019 two roads and their surroundings were severely flooded after a 3 hour heavy rainfall event similarly on june 9 2020 the ghanaian report newspaper reported that two people died at mile 7 as a result of a 5 hour torrential rain event my joy news online reported on the 24th of may 2022 that some areas in accra including kaneshie adabraka weija teshie achimota dansoman mile 7 and tesano were flooded as a result of a two day continuous rainfall event in accra the odaw has many tributaries that contribute to its high volumes downstream but if only the atomic eastern site section can cause this extent of flooding fig 9 in various communities downstream then the waters coming from upstream must be closely monitored flood depth increases with increasing discharge and the river flows at high velocity dupre et al 2001 as a result it is ideal that as the discharge increases the flood depth increases table 4 3 and the arrival times of the flood at the hotspot zones increase fig 8 when flood depth and velocity increase we can expect the flood to inundate a larger area as shown in fig 9 the greater the return period flood the greater the inundated area 4 5 impacts of retention basins on flood peak attenuation retention basins are hydraulic structures that are used to hold and retain water in urbanized and developed areas with less permeable surfaces for infiltration bustami et al 2009 and have proven to significantly reduce flood incidences up to 30 takaijudin et al 2010 this can be observed in table 4 4 where for the different return periods i e 30 to 1 year the peak flows have been reduced by 8 1 8 4 9 1 13 6 and 13 2 respectively peak flow reduction resulted in a direct reduction in flood volumes the presence of a retention basin caused a reduction in flood discharge depth and a delay in flood arrival times at various flooding regions for the different return periods table 4 4 in table 4 5 it is observed that places like avernor and kotobabi that were previously inundated by a return period flooding event is no more inundated after the retention basin was introduced the retention basin is clearly capable of reducing flood incidences in some downstream communities but only to a certain extent it is insufficient because some areas downstream such as achimota alajo and tesano are still inundated by a return period flooding event across all scenarios the retention basin at atomic east increased the basin lag time downstream the orb by an average of four hours as a result a flood event that would have taken 7 h to reach dome now takes 11 h due to the presence of the retention basin upstream fig 10 the ability of retention basins to hold a maximum amount of water within a catchment before spilling the excess through the tailwater end causes a delay in basin lag time downstream of a catchment ensley et al 2021 therefore it is expected that the presence of a retention basin will delay the basin lag time for a particular return period hydrograph fig 10 and cause an attenuation in flood peaks fig 11 the ability of the retention basin to attenuate flood peaks is expected to result in a reduction in the areas inundated with respect to return periods according to fig 12 some of the areas that had previously been submerged by a 30 year return period flood are no longer submerged this highlights the value of the upstream retention basin although some communities were spared from a specific return period flood inundation some other communities still experienced flood inundations despite the reduced flood arrival times this clearly demonstrates that having just one retention basin at the atomic eastern site does not guarantee that there won t be any flooding downstream of the odaw more so with regards to the areas inundated by a return period flood this was not as significant the presence of the retention basin significantly lengthened the flood arrival times at various affected communities 5 conclusion flooding in the orb is caused by excessive rain high sea levels limited and low capacity drains extensive silting and trash accumulation occurring downstream poor drainage in built up areas and unregulated land use attipoe 2015 increased impermeable surfaces contribute to increased flooding in the odaw river basin by limiting storm water runoff absorption the model results showed a strong correlation between discharge inundation depth and flood arrival times the areas affected by a return period flood were caused by the flat topography low altitude and land cover changes i e impervious surfaces in the upper sections of the basin from aburi as a result communities within the orb such as achimota tesano alajo and kotobabi were all affected by a return period flood event the time of flood arrival was also observed to increase with increasing return period and discharge the presence of a retention basin caused a significant reduction in flood depth and an increase in the basin lag time by an average of 4 h at various flood hotspot zones i e dome achimota alajo tesano and kotobabi discharges generated from the main odaw i e atomic east ranged from 59 3 m3 s to 131 1 m3 s with high volumes also ranging from 6377 9 m3 to 14 274 2 m3 the orb has several tributaries each carrying specific discharges and volumes that add up to the volumes of water reaching downstream of the orb causing disasters the issue of sedimentation in the orb occurs at the middle course of the river approaching the downstream of the basin where there are a lot of anthropogenic activities a major example being agriculture the proposed retention basin is important and a step in the right direction for reducing flooding in the orb but it is undoubtedly insufficient because it only highlights a portion of the issue other factors like the drainage capacities rise in sea levels at the lower parts of the basin causing backwater flows as well as sediment deposition downstream must also be taken into consideration in order to draw an effective flood mitigation plan for the basin which would lead to the drastic reduction of periodic flood incidences in the basin the study demonstrated that the presence of a retention basin significantly attenuate floods by reducing flood peak and increasing lag time which helps the future flood warning systems at the downstream regions of qrb however other stringent factors must be considered in order to draw a comprehensive flood mitigation plan for the basin author statement on behalf of all the authors we consent to publishing the content of the manuscript and declare no

available on request 1 introduction floods have become a rampant natural disaster in a number of countries and hence a global concern singh et al 2018 since the 2000 s the number of flood cases in the world have nearly doubled when compared to the 1990s guha sapir et al 2004 floods poses serious threat with huge socio economic burden and health implications on victims cred 2018 extreme events in africa europe and asia demonstrate the importance of climate change in causing increased flood incidences floods are linked not only to climate change but also to urbanization dynamics hassan et al 2022 in sub saharan africa floods are deemed as the most commonest natural disaster with the propensity of disrupting socio economic activities altering ecosystem services and functions and ultimately impacting on the quality of lives pusch et al 2016 cred 2018 on the global scale aside disease outbreaks and accidents flooding is the third most common environmental disaster adversely claiming 20 million lives annually asumadu sarkodie et al 2015 in ghana hydro meteorological risks have been identified as the most common source of catastrophes and emergencies over the past century ansah et al 2020 surface runoff volumes are surging as a result of increases in impervious surface areas caused by increases inh urban expansion guo 2001 the world bank 2011 categorized ghana as one of the most flood prone countries in west africa with severe implications especially for urban areas ifrc 2011 a very telling example is the june 3rd twin disaster of flood and fire that claimed the lives of about 200 people recount could also be made of the over 100 00 people killed and an estimated land size of 196 km2 of crops destroyed in the northern part of ghana due to high rainfall intensities coupled with discharges from the bagre dam from burkina faso floodlist 2018 for centuries hydraulic structures have been used as one of the key structural measures in regulating floods in most instances the objective is to prevent overflows and ensure that flood peaks and volumes are quickly dissipated guo 2001 one of the best flood prevention strategies is reservoir construction building reservoirs is done to quickly control flood effects and lessen the peak flood discharge building check dams is an effective engineering measure for flood attenuation in torrential mountain streams mostafazadeh et al 2017 and soil erosion control in arid and semiarid regions with high sediment yields a check dam is a hydraulic structure that is built across a channel or gully to retain runoff and promote sedimentation conservation chen et al 2023 they are built in many countries including mexico spain italy iran ethiopia and china due to their high efficiency in sediment reduction and low construction costs piton et al 2020 ran et al 2021 guyassa et al 2017 reduced annual runoff and sediment yields caused by check dams have been widely observed and studied at the catchment scale ran et al 2021 check dams can also be a series of small barriers built across steep tributary streams with simple geometry as a result small reservoirs capable of storing floodwaters are created reducing flood peak discharge and lengthen the time to peak in downstream areas yuan et al 2019 they may also have an impact on the transfer of runoff from uplands to lower areas and thus on runoff connectivity in the landscape guyassa et al 2017 retention basin are one of the most commonly used flood mitigation structures around the world chan et al 1997 did 2000 bustami et al 2009 takaijudin et al 2010 it is typically designed to manage high upstream runoff volume by incorporating a permanent pond area with landscaped banks and surroundings to provide additional storage capacity during rainfall events it allows runoff to infiltrate into the soil and can sometimes be modified to serve as water storage for irrigation purposes in order to alleviate agricultural water shortages camnasio and becciu 2011 a retention basin can function as an on stream or off stream facility guo 2012 a designed spillway directs the extra flood water into the off stream basin when the inflow channel is full retention basins are strategically positioned within drainage networks to efficiently attenuate the peak flood flows guo 2004 some best management practices bmps for urban stormwater management have been implemented in developing countries some bmps such as retention basins have storage treatment capabilities and are typically designed for runoff reduction and pollutant removal semadeni davies 2006 balascio and lucas 2009 as a result it is necessary to investigate the effectiveness of these alternative practices for urban flood mitigation according to asare kyei et al 2015 there were significant floods in the following years 1973 1986 1995 1999 2001 and 2002 with the majority of them happening in accra ghana s capital accra is a populous city which has been struck consistently with high flood incidence in accra it is estimated that about 172 000 residents are at risk of flooding rain et al 2011 of that total 33 000 residents are located in slums or substandard housing units considering the marked changes in average monthly precipitation from 160 mm in 1991 2010 to 200 mm in 2011 2030 ipcc 2010 flood risk incidence is anticipated to worsen to forestall any future flood occurences the government of ghana with funding from the world bank is implementing the greater accra resilient and integrated development garid project the garid project with a duration of six years 2020 2025 is aimed at building long term capability for flood risk management and mitigate flood risk in the odaw river basin the odaw basin in the greater accra region is identified as the entry point of the intervention given its high flood risk population and business density amongst the four main basin in the greater accra region the odaw basin which passes through the most urbanized areas of the region has the highest overall flood risks two retention basins have been proposed to be constructed on two sites namely atomic energy east and atomic energy west in ga east municipal assembly the retention basins are to store peak flood waters as a means of reducing the risk of floods at these two locations we hypothesize that establishing a retention basin in the odaw river basin will have an impact on downstream peak attenuation however the magnitude of the impact remains unknown and thus the study seeks to examine the without and with a retention basin effects on flood peaks by quantifying peak flow and runoff volume attenuation as well as the time of flood arrival in the lower sections of the odaw river basin orb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area odaw river basin orb the odaw river basin fig 1 is located in the dry equatorial climatic zone between latitudes 5 52 n and 5 32 n and longitudes 0 10 w and 0 15 w with a total catchment area of approximately 275 km2 the odaw river begins near aburi in the akuapem hills meanders south and eventually empty into the sea atlantic ocean through the korle lagoon which serves as the main repository for most streams in accra the river basin has the country s highest population density accounting for 60 of the greater accra region s population estimated at 4 3 million people and is plagued by continuous flooding with an estimated 30 of the population at risk living in flood prone informal settlements mwh 2019 the basin features a low lying geography with altitudes ranging from 7 to 460 m above mean sea level with a succession of hills slopes and rare rocky headlands ofori sarpong et al 2001 the basin is reasonably flat from the center to the southern half while the northern half is steep the odaw river basin is located in ghana s equatorial climate zone which is influenced by two major winds the moisture laden southwest monsoon winds from the atlantic ocean which are responsible for precipitation events and the north east trade winds harmattan from the saharan desert which are responsible for dry and hazy dry times the basin is located in the geomorphic western coastal region of accra ofori sarpong et al 2001 the basin experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern with major and minor rainy seasons the major rainy season begins in april and ends in october during the two seasons total annual precipitation averages 730 mm ghana statistical service 2014 rainfall duration within the odaw river watershed is usually short but heavy resulting in floods particularly in locations where drainage routes are clogged attipoe 2015 march is the warmest month of the year with an average temperature of 28 c august is the coldest month of the year with an average temperature of 24 7 c danquah 2013 relative humidity ranges from 65 in the afternoon to 95 at night ghana statistical service 2014 flooding has long been a source of concern for the basin s water management as the landscape is characterized by relatively flat lands and occasional hills with an average height of 20 m above sea level nyarko 2000 2 2 data acquisition and geo spatial preprocessing hydro meteorological and physiographic data are the two most important types of data sets required in hydrological modeling arsenault et al 2020 the hydro meteorological data used for this study are mean daily rainfall 1910 2020 obtained from the ghana meteorological agency and the ghana hydrological services department for the purpose of model calibration and validation a digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution and landsat 8 oli tirs satellite images acquired on 25 01 2021 were obtained from usgs earth explorer http www usgs gov table 1 for use in the study the flow direction flow accumulation and stream link grids were generated from the dem and used for the extraction of drainage networks and stream orders using arcgis version 10 6 3 from these physical parameters initial estimates of unit hydrograph parameters time of concentration tc and curve number cn were estimated for the orb reach routing parameters such as reach slope and length were also calculated in google earth pro extracting the boundary shape file from the dem and values imported into the hec hms model 2 3 hec hms model development without and with retention basin structure scenarios 2 3 1 without a retention basin arcgis version 10 6 3 was used to create the project for the basin as well as gather input data sets for the hec hms modeling the project basin model contains the hydrologic elements and their connectivity in the project basin model indicates the flow of water from the headwater source in aburi down through to atomic the parameters i e area and curve number generated served as inputs into the hec hms model the basin major hydrological parameters were estimated using the loss transform and routing methods the selection of the loss transformation and routing methods for each component of the hydrological processes in the event based hydrological modeling of the odaw river basin was based on data availability suitability for same hydrologic condition applicability and limitations of each method fig 2 shows a flowchart of the methodology for the hydrological model development in hec hms without a retention basin structure 2 3 2 with a retention basin structure a reservoir or retention pond reduces the negative effects of excess water by storing it in a way that prevents damage downstream retention basins mostly referred to as infiltration basins use infiltration as their principal method of storm water disposal flood control basins wet or dry are constructed to retain water in order to prevent floods and infiltration is thought to be the only way for the stored water to exit in hec hms the source creation tool was used as the inflow point i e from aburi down through to atomic east where the retention pond would be constructed a reservoir routing method was used to model the impact of a retention basin on downstream reaches within the orb fig 2 shows a flowchart of the methodology for the hydrological model development in hec hms with a retention basin structure 2 4 estimation of rainfall loss rainfall loss was accounted for using the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method in hec hms this method is widely used in rainfall runoff modeling events walega and salata 2019 satheeshkumar et al 2017 amutha and porchelvan 2009 the method includes the determination of three main parameters initial abstraction ia curve number cn and percentage imperviousness initial abstraction is the amount of precipitation that is trapped in cracks sinks and other formations or structures at the start of a rainfall event initial abstraction can be calculated as ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 1 iα 0 2 s where iα initial abstraction 2 s 25400 cn 254 where s total maximum retention mm cn curve number the cn represents the continuous rainfall losses after the initial abstraction has been exceeded the scs cn method calculates a curve number cn that accounts for the amount of rainfall that infiltrates the soil as well as the amount of surface runoff sahu et al 2007 curve number values range from approximately 30 for permeable soils with high infiltration rates to 100 for water bodies impervious surfaces and soils with near zero infiltration rates rimfors and velichkin 2015 and veichkin 2015 the average curve number for the sub basin was determined through arcgis 10 6 3 using the lulc map soil data and dem of the basin when a catchment consists of different land uses and soil types the curve number is calculated by the eq 3 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 3 cn composite a i cn i a i where cncomposite the composite curve number used for runoff

runoff estimation the transform model simulates the direct runoff of excess precipitation on the watershed tassew et al 2019 hec hms incorporates numerous unit hydrograph methods for converting excess rainfall into a runoff the scs unit hydrograph model was selected for modeling direct runoff the sole input for this technique is the lag time t lag it is computed for each watershed based on the time of concentration tc from the center of mass of excess rainfall to the hydrograph peak the kirpich time of concentration eq 4 method was adopted for this study due to the temporal aspects of hydrological events time of concentrations are critical since they directly affect peak runoff and flow duration in estimating flood effects on properties and life 4 tc 0 0195 l0 77 s 0 385 tc time of

outlet while the storage coefficient represents the storage effects attenuation of the sub basin 2 6 flood routing estimation the routing model is used to simulate flow from the upstream parts of a basin to the downstream or basin s outlet nandalal and ratmayake 2010 flood runoff is attenuated as it passes along the channel reach due to channel storage effects this reduction is considered by the routing models in hec hms tassew et al 2019 the muskingum method was used in this study the muskingum routing method yields acceptable results than the muskingum cunge routing model with the later normally overestimating discharge values relative to a basin or watershed laouacheria et al 2018 in the muskingum method the downstream outflow can be predicted by using 6 oj 1 c0ij 1 c1ij c2oj where

where k wave travel time h x weighting factor δt time interval h standard muskingum routing was used to complete the channel routing in the final model there was only one reach the muskingum k was determined using journey time estimations calculated by the gis based on channel slope and length values 2 7 retention basin design concept retention basins are pools with extra storage capacity that are designed to reduce surface runoff during rainfall events they are made up of a permanent pond area with landscaped banks and surroundings to provide extra storage capacity during rain events they are formed by excavating a new depression or excavating an existing natural depression gómez et al 2013 fig 3 is a conceptualization of the retention basin model design the target flow stored in the retention pond and inflow peak are 113 units and 186 units respectively in this diagram to bring this peak down to the desired level storage is provided as a result the amount of water in the shaded area is stored and used for other purposes i e irrigation or recreation 2 8 retention basin model in hec hms 2 8 1 defining reservoir routing the common level pool routing model can be used to calculate outflow from an impoundment with a horizontal water surface also known as modified plus routing model the model discretizes time breaking the total analysis time into equal intervals of duration δt it then solves recursively the following one dimensional approximation of the continuity equation 8 iavg oavg δs δt where iavg average inflow during time interval oavg average outflow during time interval δs storage change with a finite difference approximation this can be written as 9 i t it 1 2 o t o t 1 2 s t 1 st δ t where t index of time interval it and it 1 the inflow values at the beginning and end of the tth time interval respectively ot and ot 1 the corresponding outflow values st and st 1 corresponding storage values this equation can be rearranged as follows 10 2 st 1 δ t ot 1 i t i t 1 2 st δ t o t all terms on the right hand side are known the values of it and it 1 are the inflow hydrograph ordinates perhaps computed with models described earlier in the manual the values of ot and st are known at the tth time interval at t 0 these are the initial conditions and at each subsequent interval they are known from calculation in the previous interval for an impoundment storage and outflow are related and with this storage outflow relationship the corresponding values of ot 1 and st 1 can be found the computations can be repeated for successive intervals yielding values ot 1 ot 2 ot n the required outflow hydrograph ordinates 2 8 2 spillway design for outflow spillways are constructions at the top of dam like structures that allow water to flow uncontrollably over the top the reservoir model in hec hms can contain up to ten autonomous spillways broad crested ogee and user specified are the three methods for calculating discharge through a spillway hec 2022 the retention basin model used a broad crested spillway the broad crested spillway allows for uncontrolled flow over the reservoir s top according to the weir flow assumptions nrmrl 2002 the calculations for spillways begin with the standard weir equation 11 q clh 3 2 where q discharge over the weir or spillway crest c discharge coefficient accounts for energy losses as water enters the spillway flows through the spillway and eventually exits the spillway typical values will range from 2 6 to 4 0 depending upon the shape of the spillway crest l length of the spillway crest h upstream energy head above the spillway crest according to nemo 2005 the depth of a retention pond must be approximately 1 5 m 3 0 m deep with a bottom slope of 2 minimum the minimum depth of water in the pond must be 0 9 m the preferred depth of water in the retention pond should be between 1 2 m and 2 4 m strom 2009 the side slope should not be steeper than 3 1 or 4 1 or flatter and the slope of the retention pond should be defined by a basin length to width ratio of at least 3 1 pwud 2014 averagely the ponding time should be approximately 14 days or more for retention ponds strom 2005 2 9 model performance evaluation objective functions are statistical criteria used to determine the performance of a model and can consist of two of more goodness of fit gof measures depending on the model objective garcia et al 2017 the study used four objective functions to access the model accuracy namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percentage bias δb percent difference in runoff volume vr and the percent difference in peak discharge qp these objective functions are commonly used to access the performance of rainfall runoff models de silva et al 2014 skhakhfa and ouerdachi 2016 tassew

in 1999 specifically from 1st to 4th june per the 30 year rainfall data from the ghana meteorological agency gmet which corresponds to the findings of ackom et al 2020 as a result events from 1999 and the dates 1st to 4th june were chosen for the study the odaw river basin orb has no stream flow gauge station therefore for the model calibration the peak rainfall mm and discharge m3 s values reported by nyarko 2000 at the upper middle section of the orb was used the model was manually calibrated to make sure the model is an accurate reflection of the watershed areas above the odaw river basin orb have a storage coefficient of 0 2 and a runoff coefficient of 0 7 nyarko 2000 the runoff and storage coefficients from aburi s land use and land cover would influence the scs curve number 70 99 used in model calibration the frequency storm values used in the meteorological model were selected with respect to a rainfall return period value mm to achieve agreement between simulated and observed discharge flow data the model was automatically calibrated this method employs an iterative process to minimize the objective function to improve the calibration results optimization trials were conducted 3 2 validation the design document provided by the ghana hydrological department for the garid project stated that peak flows for various return periods at the atomic eastern site which is on average twice of the peak discharges recorded for the atomic western site the use of the 10 year return period peak flow event at the atomic east for validation was based on factors such as characteristics of the basin rainfall and lack of a streamflow gauge station in the odaw river basin the optimized parameters from the calibration stage were used to simulate flood events for peak discharges reaching the atomic eastern site by a 10 year return period flooding event for sensitivity analysis parameters such as curve number muskingum k muskingum x and lag time were adjusted in the range of 20 with 5 intervals to analyze the sensitivity of the calibration parameters 3 3 forecasting of peak flows the intensity duration frequency idf table table 2 was calculated from the 30 year rainfall data provided by the ghana meteorological agency gmet for aburi the calculated idf table was used for the simulation of forecasted peak flows reaching atomic east within the orb the idf shows the peak rainfall intensities for a 24 hour rainfall expressed in return periods the estimated rainfall depths from the idf table corresponding to 30 years 15 years 10 years 5 years and 1 year return periods were used as inputs into the established calibrated hydrologic model using the frequency storm method of the meteorological model in hec hms discharge hydrographs generated from the simulations were used as input data for the hec ras 2d unsteady flow computation model to determine the areas inundated by a return period flooding event 3 4 hec ras 2d model simulations for flood inundation simulations the study used hec ras 2d which is a 2 dimensional hydraulic model hydrodynamics horizontal and vertical flows and 2d flow visualization were all considered in this simulation model quirogaa et al 2016 allen 2021 the discharge values used by the model were obtained from the hec hms flood routing model manning s roughness coefficients were generated by inputting the terrain dem into ras mapper and reclassifying the land cover changes in hec ras using the national land cover database nlcd 2016 classification table 3 prior to the model building an aster dem with a resolution of 30 m was processed in arcgis to ensure spatial homogeneity the model was discretized into an equal number of grid cells of 30 m by 30 m i e equal geometry a dem with the same resolution was used because it was suitable for hydrological modeling investigations allen 2021 to preserve uniformity additional topographical characteristics and infrastructure layers were also made comparable to make 2d flow simulations a lot easier the hec ras 2d model allows the user the choice of three equation sets namely 2d diffusion wave equations not considered in this work shallow water equations swe elm with a eulerian lagrangian approach to solving for advection or a new shallow water equation solver swe em that uses a eulerian approach for advection the shallow water equations are derived from equations of conservation of mass and conservation of linear momentum the navier stokes equations which still holds with the assumptions of shallow water break down such as across a hydraulic jump in the case of a horizontal bed with negligible coriolis forces frictional and viscous forces the shallow water equations are 14 ρ η t ρ η u x ρ η v y 0 15 ρ η u t x ρ η 2 1 2 ρ g η 2 ρ η uv y 0 16 ρ η v t ρ η uv x y ρ η v 2 1 2 ρ g η 2 0 here η is the total fluid column height instantaneous fluid depth as a function of x y and t and the 2d vector u v is the fluid s horizontal flow velocity averaged across the vertical column further g is acceleration due to gravity and ρ is the fluid density the first equation is derived from mass conservation the second two from momentum conservation the shallow water equations swe elm with a eulerian lagrangian was used for this study due to its explicit solution scheme based on a strictly conservative form of the momentum equation and high accuracy swe elm solver produces less numerical diffusion than the swe em solver if a time step controlled by the courant number 1 0 is used in the setup otherwise instabilities are expected to occur due to the explicit nature of the scheme hec ras 2016 the hec ras software requires that all time steps end up exactly hitting the mapping output interval this requirement is because output for hec ras mapper must be written to the output file for all cross sections storage areas and 2d cells at the mapping interval due to this fact entering a maximum number of doubling base time step that results in a computation interval that does not exactly land on the mapping output interval then the unsteady flow computational program will compute its own time steps that work with the parameters hence the use of a courant number 3 5 hec ras 2d model flood plain the model geometry is linked to the digital terrain model dtm to visualize the flood plain this dtm is used to create a 2d mesh region by starting with a polygon shapefile with 37 518 cells the dtm and 2d mesh area are shown in fig 4 which includes a submerged area and water depths at each grid cell this can be used to calculate water surface heights depict flood plain geometry and assess flood risk in various communities around the catchment the ability of the hec ras software to provide a graphical representation of the inundated area in 2d as well as the flood depth and to calculate the time of flood arrival is one key advantage hec 2022 the arrival time h days in the hec ras results computation indicates how long it will take for water at a given depth to reach a specific location within the watershed depending on the characteristics of the basin such as land use changes land topography basin size and shape etc it is computed in days or in hours 3 6 hec ras 2d flood plain area creation landsat 8 oli tirs satellite images for the year 2021 was used in generating the land use land cover map fig 5 used for the model calibration the dimensions of the 2d flow area was drawn based on literature and news reports of areas inundated as a result of peak flows within the study area during calibration manning s coefficient values between 0 01 and 0 85 were utilized as an input to the model hec ras 2016 it was determined using the nlcd 2016 land use description and basin characteristic hec ras 2016 shown in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration for the calibration of the model the peak rainfall value recorded by nyarko 2000 at the same upper middle region of the odaw river basin i e atomic east that produced a peak discharge was used the most important aspect of the hydrograph when evaluating a flood event is the peak flow which corresponds to the greatest downstream flooding the hydrological services department of ghana does not record discharges because there is no streamflow gauge station in the odaw river basin however the model outcomes demonstrated a good fit between the simulated and the observed reported values following optimization and functions well across a variety of events even though the model tended to slightly overestimate the runoff before optimization the shape of the hydrograph and time of peaks matches suitably with the findings of nyarko 2000 table 4 and fig 6 the sensitivity analysis revealed that the curve number muskingum k muskingum x and lag time were shown to be the most sensitive less sensitive and least sensitive model parameters respectively this is consistent with the study of tassew et al 2019 who in their study conducted a sensitivity analysis of parameters by changing parameter values in the range 20 with 5 intervals until best fit was obtained between observed and simulated parameters the modeling results of peak discharge total volume and their relative errors in comparison to observed data the nash sutcliffe efficiency and root mean square error values during calibration are shown in table 4 the nse value obtained from the model calibration was 0 949 this indicated a very good agreement between the observed and simulated runoff based on the recommended nse values above 0 65 by hagen et al 2020 for flood forecasting in africa the percentage bias gave a satisfactory performance of 0 54 which is considered very good on the whole the model performs well with good agreement between simulated and observed values 4 2 model validation the design document for the proposed retention ponds on the garid project reported a peak discharge of 46 8 m3 s for a 10 year return period storm at atomic west and reported a peak discharge of 93 8 m3 s at atomic east for a 10 year return period the value reported at the atomic east site is approximately twice that recorded at atomic west i e a tributary of the main odaw and this was used for the model validation it was observed table 4 and fig 7 that the peak discharge for the 10 year return period at atomic east is slightly overestimated the percent difference in peak discharge was 18 3 the total volume was also slightly overestimated the percent difference in runoff volume was 19 4 considering the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criteria good results were obtained between the observed and simulated values with nse value of 0 942 the total simulation results of the events chosen for validation suggests that the hec hms model has the potential to perform well in predicting peak flows and runoff volume at atomic east within the odaw river basin using scs curve number and frequency storm methods 4 3 hec ras model computation the unsteady flow computation equation was used for the hec ras 2d model and the results from the 2d surface water elevation swe elm showed the model was very accurate with 1 overall volume accounting for error which corresponds to an actual volume of 1 351 m3 and took an hour and twenty seven minutes for the simulation run using 21 iterations in hec ras computations an error percentage less than 1 shows that the model is a very good one table 4 1 4 4 basin flood processes and inundation areas without retention basins the odaw river is the most susceptible basin to floods in the country hsd 2019 over 50 of accra s population are inhabitants within the odaw river basin and approximately half of this population live in informal settlements and others are in close proximity to the main odaw river world bank 2019 peak discharges coming from aburi reaching atomic i e upstream of odaw ranges from 131 1 m3 s 121 6 m3 s 106 4 m3 s 88 m3 s and 59 m3 s for the different return period scenarios i e 30 to 1 year respectively table 4 2 the peak discharges with flood volumes ranging from 6377 0 m3 to 14 272 4 m3 reach downstream communities at various flood arrival times depending on the return period of the flood event fig 8 the depths of flood inundated at these selected areas also vary with respect to the proximity of the community to the inflow point upstream the odaw land use land cover changes and proximity to the main odaw river table 4 3 globally flood disasters are common in low lying or flood plains which are heavily developed bathrellos et al 2018 accra is a low lying area and communities like alajo achimota and kotobabi are densely populated with high impervious surfaces created due to urbanization and industrialization table 3 and fig 5 this causes an increase in flood depths resulting in higher flood inundations in these communities whenever there is heavy rainfall runoff table 4 3 however there is a strong correlation between discharge and flood arrival times across the various communities in the orb and this is well highlighted in fig 8 the longer the return period the higher the flood level which influences water velocity and thus increases flood arrival times considering that only aburi inflows were used in the simulations the volumes of water reaching downstream of the odaw without a retention basin intervention are enormous the basin is prone to flooding with the lower reaches bearing the brunt of the damage nyarko 2000 it has a number of tributaries joining up downstream hsd 2019 and this is what causes the rampant high flood incidences particularly downstream of the basin the dome pillar 2 flood case is one of many reported examples according to the ghanaian times newspaper on wednesday may 29 2019 two roads and their surroundings were severely flooded after a 3 hour heavy rainfall event similarly on june 9 2020 the ghanaian report newspaper reported that two people died at mile 7 as a result of a 5 hour torrential rain event my joy news online reported on the 24th of may 2022 that some areas in accra including kaneshie adabraka weija teshie achimota dansoman mile 7 and tesano were flooded as a result of a two day continuous rainfall event in accra the odaw has many tributaries that contribute to its high volumes downstream but if only the atomic eastern site section can cause this extent of flooding fig 9 in various communities downstream then the waters coming from upstream must be closely monitored flood depth increases with increasing discharge and the river flows at high velocity dupre et al 2001 as a result it is ideal that as the discharge increases the flood depth increases table 4 3 and the arrival times of the flood at the hotspot zones increase fig 8 when flood depth and velocity increase we can expect the flood to inundate a larger area as shown in fig 9 the greater the return period flood the greater the inundated area 4 5 impacts of retention basins on flood peak attenuation retention basins are hydraulic structures that are used to hold and retain water in urbanized and developed areas with less permeable surfaces for infiltration bustami et al 2009 and have proven to significantly reduce flood incidences up to 30 takaijudin et al 2010 this can be observed in table 4 4 where for the different return periods i e 30 to 1 year the peak flows have been reduced by 8 1 8 4 9 1 13 6 and 13 2 respectively peak flow reduction resulted in a direct reduction in flood volumes the presence of a retention basin caused a reduction in flood discharge depth and a delay in flood arrival times at various flooding regions for the different return periods table 4 4 in table 4 5 it is observed that places like avernor and kotobabi that were previously inundated by a return period flooding event is no more inundated after the retention basin was introduced the retention basin is clearly capable of reducing flood incidences in some downstream communities but only to a certain extent it is insufficient because some areas downstream such as achimota alajo and tesano are still inundated by a return period flooding event across all scenarios the retention basin at atomic east increased the basin lag time downstream the orb by an average of four hours as a result a flood event that would have taken 7 h to reach dome now takes 11 h due to the presence of the retention basin upstream fig 10 the ability of retention basins to hold a maximum amount of water within a catchment before spilling the excess through the tailwater end causes a delay in basin lag time downstream of a catchment ensley et al 2021 therefore it is expected that the presence of a retention basin will delay the basin lag time for a particular return period hydrograph fig 10 and cause an attenuation in flood peaks fig 11 the ability of the retention basin to attenuate flood peaks is expected to result in a reduction in the areas inundated with respect to return periods according to fig 12 some of the areas that had previously been submerged by a 30 year return period flood are no longer submerged this highlights the value of the upstream retention basin although some communities were spared from a specific return period flood inundation some other communities still experienced flood inundations despite the reduced flood arrival times this clearly demonstrates that having just one retention basin at the atomic eastern site does not guarantee that there won t be any flooding downstream of the odaw more so with regards to the areas inundated by a return period flood this was not as significant the presence of the retention basin significantly lengthened the flood arrival times at various affected communities 5 conclusion flooding in the orb is caused by excessive rain high sea levels limited and low capacity drains extensive silting and trash accumulation occurring downstream poor drainage in built up areas and unregulated land use attipoe 2015 increased impermeable surfaces contribute to increased flooding in the odaw river basin by limiting storm water runoff absorption the model results showed a strong correlation between discharge inundation depth and flood arrival times the areas affected by a return period flood were caused by the flat topography low altitude and land cover changes i e impervious surfaces in the upper sections of the basin from aburi as a result communities within the orb such as achimota tesano alajo and kotobabi were all affected by a return period flood event the time of flood arrival was also observed to increase with increasing return period and discharge the presence of a retention basin caused a significant reduction in flood depth and an increase in the basin lag time by an average of 4 h at various flood hotspot zones i e dome achimota alajo tesano and kotobabi discharges generated from the main odaw i e atomic east ranged from 59 3 m3 s to 131 1 m3 s with high volumes also ranging from 6377 9 m3 to 14 274 2 m3 the orb has several tributaries each carrying specific discharges and volumes that add up to the volumes of water reaching downstream of the orb causing disasters the issue of sedimentation in the orb occurs at the middle course of the river approaching the downstream of the basin where there are a lot of anthropogenic activities a major example being agriculture the proposed retention basin is important and a step in the right direction for reducing flooding in the orb but it is undoubtedly insufficient because it only highlights a portion of the issue other factors like the drainage capacities rise in sea levels at the lower parts of the basin causing backwater flows as well as sediment deposition downstream must also be taken into consideration in order to draw an effective flood mitigation plan for the basin which would lead to the drastic reduction of periodic flood incidences in the basin the study demonstrated that the presence of a retention basin significantly attenuate floods by reducing flood peak and increasing lag time which helps the future flood warning systems at the downstream regions of qrb however other stringent factors must be considered in order to draw a comprehensive flood mitigation plan for the basin author statement on behalf of all the authors we consent to publishing the content of the manuscript and declare no

elements covered by proglacial lake are set equal to the surface elevation plus depth of lake water bodies in the model lemieux 2006 a specified flux boundary condition is used to calculate precipitation recharge to groundwater prg fig 4 shows a simplified cross section illustrating the boundary conditions and conceptualized groundwater flow pattern of the model based on the annual mean precipitation from 1973 to 2019 fig 1c and the initial glacier thickness fig 1b as the boundary condition fig 4 a steady state model is first built fig s5 then a transient model is constructed and its initial hydraulic head is derived from the steady state model fig s5 the transient model is constructed to predict the groundwater system evolution in the next 80 years 2021 2100 under ssp126 and ssp585 climate change scenarios 3 3 3 model sensitivity analysis the relative sensitivity coefficient rse is used to evaluate parameters smrg prg and tgr sensitivity in the steady state model mccuen 1973 incremental value of each parameter is 10 of the corresponding base value for relative sensitivity analysis the rse can be expressed as mccuen 1973 7 rse ot ot ref ot ref m m ref m ref where ot and ot ref are the model output value with the changed parameter value m and the reference parameter value m ref a smaller value of rse means more stable in the model and a larger value of rse means more sensitive in the model mccuen 1973 sensitivity analysis indicates that hydraulic parameters β and k play important roles in smrg and tgr table s3 the prg is only sensitive to the recharge coefficient of precipitation α table s3 the proportion of glacier thickness ξ is the most stable parameter for the smrg and tgr table s3 4 results 4 1 future climate changes eight gcms are used to predict future annual mean temperature and precipitation from 2021 to 2100 fig 5 since each gcm focuses on different major impact factors affecting climate change there are some uncertainties about future climate projections especially for the ssp585 scenario zhou et al 2019 although there are some fluctuations in the annual mean temperature there is an obvious increasing trend especially for the ssp585 scenario fig 5a for the ssp126 scenario it will increase by 0 19 1 38 c in 2090 s at a rate of 0 005 0 045 c decade for the ssp585 scenario it will increase by 0 99 4 47 c in 2090 s with an increasing rate of 0 13 0 48 c decade fig 5a in most of gcms annual mean precipitation shows a rising tendency precipitation changes by 1 9 6 5 mm decade negative value only in cesm2 model and canesm5 model in the ssp126 scenario and increases by 2 6 20 1 mm decade in the ssp585 scenario fig 5b for the eight gcms the annual mean precipitation is projected to increase by 158 215 mm 0 62 35 22 and 195 318 mm 22 64 100 53 in 2090 s under the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios respectively fig 5b generally the two scenarios will experience increase trends in temperature and precipitation and the ssp585 scenario has significantly faster changing trends 4 2 future glacier retreat temperature and precipitation of the eight gcms are inputs for the δ h parameterization model the outputs are the simulated evolution of glacier area volume and average thickness from 2021 to 2100 fig 6 the jiemayangzong glacier shows various levels of retreat and ablation area shrinkage volume loss and thickness thinning in the eight gcms especially in the nesm and cesm2 models fig 6 compared with current status in 2021 fig 6 shows that the nesm model leads to the largest glacier area volume and average thickness shrink for both the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios for the ssp126 scenario area of jiemayangzong glacier decreases to 98 87 3 77 9 and 60 5 in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 respectively the glacier volume decreases to 88 7 65 6 47 6 and 26 1 respectively the average thickness of the jiemayangzong glacier decreases to 88 6 74 1 60 6 and 42 8 in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 respectively for the ssp585 scenario the glacier area decreases to 98 86 4 73 8 and 42 7 the volume decreases to 87 5 62 9 41 8 and 14 7 and the average thickness decreases to 88 6 72 2 56 2 and 34 2 in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 respectively fig 6 shows the smallest shrinkage which is simulated by the cmcc cm2 sr5 model toward the ssp126 scenario the area volume and average thickness decrease to 97 5 86 and 87 5 in 2100 respectively toward ssp585 scenario the area volume and average thickness will decrease to 95 9 81 6 and 84 4 in 2100 respectively fig 7 shows the simulated spatial changes in the glacier extent for different gcms the glacier area and thickness in miroc6 cmcc cm2 sr5 mri and canesm5 models change slightly however the glacier area and thickness of the inm bcc cesm2 and nesm models change dramatically especially in the ssp585 scenario generally faster temperature increase will cause the glacier to shrink faster the glacier retreats much faster for the ssp585 scenario than that of the ssp126 scenario especially in the late 21st century the glacier area reduces much faster in the late 21st century but the glacier volume and average thickness seem to be reduced quickly in the early 21st century in all the climate models glacier volume reduction occurs more rapidly than the average thickness and area 4 3 future groundwater recharge average value of the eight gcms is used to predict the groundwater system evolution of the jiemayangzong glacier basin from 2021 to 2100 aalto et al 2017 li et al 2017 hofer et al 2020 horvat 2021 fig 8 shows the groundwater system evolution including smrg prg and tgr in different future climate scenarios the annual mean smrg decreases from 4 84 105 m3 in the steady state to 2 50 105 m3 52 and 1 24 105 m3 26 in 2100 for the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios respectively fig 8a the ratio of smrg to tgr would decrease rapidly decreasing to 42 and 22 in 2100 for the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios fig 8a prg will increase with glacier retreat due to increase of precipitation and recharged area for the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios the annual mean prg will increase from 2 90 105 m3 in the steady state to 3 47 105 m3 119 and 4 37 105 m3 151 in 2100 respectively fig 8b the ratio of prg to tgr quickly increases to 58 and 78 in 2100 under two different climate scenarios fig 8b the tgr including smrg and prg would rapidly decrease to 5 97 105 m3 yr 77 and 5 62 105 m3 yr 73 in 2100 for ssp126 and ssp585 respectively fig 8c although prg continuously increases for ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios it could not counteract the loss of smrg 4 4 hydraulic head distribution fig 9 illustrates the simulated surficial layer hydraulic head changes in the steady state and the future in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 with continuous decreasing in smrg the hydraulic head would decrease rapidly for the ssp126 scenario the average change in hydraulic head is 2 28 m 11 25 m 30 27 m and 34 91 m in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 respectively the average change in hydraulic head is 2 20 m 12 07 m 36 30 m and 43 73 m for the ssp585 scenario the hydraulic head varied dramatically in the glacierized area and its vicinity especially in the glacier terminal zone the change in hydraulic head is more significant for the ssp585 scenario especially from 2070 to 2100 fig 10 shows the change in hydraulic head difference along the a a section fig 1a between the steady state and the future in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 the elevation of this profile varies from 5416 m to 6195 m the hydraulic head difference decreases dramatically which leads to less smrg for both climate change scenarios the hydraulic head would not change significantly from 2030 to 2050 the hydraulic head decreases quickly after about 2050 the largest change in hydraulic head occurs under the glacier especially for the ssp585 scenario the change in hydraulic head is more significant in the aquifer shallow zones elevation above 4000 m the change in hydraulic head in the a a section clearly shows that glacier retreat will have an evident impact on the groundwater flow system 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other studies based on the numerical groundwater flow model with glaciation taken into account the climate glacier groundwater mechanism in the headwater of yzb can be quantitatively understood fig 4 the results are consistent with preciousstudies showing an evident impact of glacier retreat on groundwater recharge storage and discharge flowers et al 2005 saberi et al 2019 somers et al 2019 2020 he et al 2022 the results also show that subglacial meltwater has an important effect on groundwater not only in the ice sheet lemieux et al 2008a 2008b 2008c zhang et al 2017 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 but also in the mountain glacierized region somers et al 2020 chen et al 2021 he et al 2022 therefore this study will help develop similar groundwater flow models in glacierized basins both on the tp and elsewhere in the world the steady state model simulated the flux of multi year average smrg to be 4 84 105 m3 yr 24 mm yr which accounts for 63 of tgr fig 8 which is similar to previous studies with a range between 15 and 36 mm yr boulton et al 1995 forsberg 1996 piotrowski et al 1997 2009 van weert et al 1997 person et al 2003 due to the greater glacier thickness and less precipitation in the jiemayangzong basin the simulated smrg is significantly higher than that 4 58 mm yr 6 33 in he et al 2022 the glacier meltwater contribution to groundwater recharge is 15 in a headwater basin in ecuador with glacier area covered 34 saberi et al 2019 chen et al 2021 simulated glacier meltwater contribution to groundwater ratio to be 10 and 34 8 in the lhasa river basin and the yangbajing basin two sub basins in the yzb with 1 3 and 11 5 glacier covered area respectively compared with saberi et al 2019 and chen et al 2021 the smrg ratio of the jiemayangzong basin is obviously higher due to a greater glacier area proportion 46 5 2 uncertainties the geological data used to determine the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage is simplified and local and regional heterogeneities are not considered the model also does not consider faults and anisotropy of materials previous studies found that geological structure has significant effects on groundwater flow in alpine basins carlier et al 2018 2019 wirth et al 2020 arnoux et al 2021 the simplified geological structures in the model could have an impact on the smrg and the distribution of hydraulic head especially for deep aquifers although permafrost covers a large area in the yzb cheng and wu 2007 ji et al 2020 liu et al 2020 yao et al 2021 the model ignores the impact of permafrost on the smrg since largely unknown permafrost extent thickness and continuity at the glacier periphery permafrost can prevent smrg kleinberg and griffin 2005 zhang et al 2017 which is due to the fact that hydraulic conductivity of permafrost can drop several orders of magnitude compared with unfrozen sediment williams and smith 1991 however the permafrost is covered by a glacier which will cause an insulating effect on the land surface and could warm up soil temperature above the freeing point cutler et al 2000 lemieux et al 2008a consequently subglacial permafrost has limited effect on smrg since it primarily occurs below cold based regions of the glacier which do not produce subglacial meltwater breemer et al 2002 lemieux et al 2008b future projections indicate that permafrost in the yzb will continue to degrade in response to future warming ji et al 2020 which will provide more thawing water to recharge groundwater niu et al 2011 zhao et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 besides the permafrost degradation will increase soil permeability which leads to more surface water infiltration to recharge groundwater niu et al 2011 qin et al 2017 there is no doubt that a model without permafrost degradation in non glacierized area will further aggravate the uncertainty of the results the glacier surface meltwater recharge groundwater is not considered in the model surface meltwater can reach to aquifer though fractures crevasses and moulins ravier and buoncristiani 2018 however most surface meltwater input to the subglacial system only occurs in outermost regions of glacier piotrowski et al 1997 glacier surface meltwater mainly contributes to groundwater in the proglacial basins which is up to 2 18 of groundwater discharge in the andes saberi et al 2019 somers et al 2019 despite these constraints a part of glacier surface meltwater indeed penetrates to subglacial groundwater which leads to the simulated ratio of smrg greater than the real value the simplifications of ddf and h parameterization methods may cause some uncertainties in the results the ddf comes from an empirical equation in the model duo to lack of measured ddf data in the mountainous study area zhang et al 2019 the empirical ddf is too simple and does not take into account its large space temporal variability in addition the application of the ddf method does not consider the effect of radiation or wind field changes on glacier mass balance duethmann et al 2016 for the h parameterization a limitation is that this method is only suitable for glaciers retreat and cannot simulate glaciers advance process which may occur in the near future huss et al 2010 most of the existing studies on smrg focus on the saturated zone but the unsaturated zone is rarely considered because it is difficult to be coupled to the glacier model boulton et al 1995 forsberg 1996 breemer et al 2002 person et al 2003 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 the specified head boundary adopted can only simulate the movement of subglacial meltwater in the saturated zone boulton et al 1995 forsberg 1996 breemer et al 2002 person et al 2003 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 groundwater flow in the unsaturated zone is not considered some subglacial meltwater flows through the unsaturated zone where it directly discharges to the surface and some reaches the water table as groundwater recharge lemieux et al 2008b ignoring the flow process in the unsaturated zone may also cause a certain amount of uncertainty in the model the constructed mountain groundwater model with glaciation is inherently difficult to validate which could lead to high uncertainty in the conclusions flowers 2015 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 at present only a limited number of methods can be used to constrain such models such as the isotopic and geochemical methods e g vaikmäe et al 2001 grasby and chen 2005 sterckx et al 2018 geological data and groundwater monitoring data are particularly scarce in high mountain environments raising a challenge for mountain groundwater models especially in the himalayas region somers et al 2020 besides the subglacial meltwater is extremely difficult to be measured directly and large uncertainties exist in the a varietious of boundary conditions used in the existing models e g piotrowski 1997a 1997b breemer et al 2002 person et al 2003 2007 carlson et al 2007 bense and person 2008 lemieux et al 2008a 2008b 2008c person et al 2012 sterckx et al 2017 the defect of specified flux boundary is that the flux of smrg varies both in time and space which is challenging to quantify smrg accurately while the specified head boundary may be able to avoid this situation it needs actual glacier thickness data which is also difficult to obtain furthermore the glacier thickness proportion has been applied to calculate the equivalent head varies significantly from 10 to 92 person et al 2003 bense and person 2008 lemieux et al 2008a sterckx et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 thus contributing to the uncertainties in the specified head boundary condition 6 conclusions a groundwater numerical model hgs and a glacier retreat model δ h parameterization are integrated to investigate how climate change influences glacier retreat and the effects of glacier retreat on the groundwater the coupled model is applied to the jiemayangzong glacier basin a typical glaciated basin in the headwater the of yzb furthermore we used the model to predict the glacier variation and its effects on groundwater system evolution from 2021 to 2100 under two scenarios ssp126 and ssp585 the glacier area is predicted to maximumly decrease to 86 4 in 2050 and 42 7 in 2100 while the glacier volume is predicted to maximumly decrease to 62 9 in 2050 and 14 7 in 2100 as well as the glacier average thickness decrease to 72 2 in 2050 and 34 2 in 2100 the simulated rate of annual smrg is 24 mm yr in the steady state model which accounts for 63 of tgr the smrg and tgr will maximumly decrease to 26 and 73 to 2100 respectively although prg continuously increases to 151 for ssp585 until 2100 it could not counteract the loss of smrg the change in hydraulic head varies dramatically in the glacier terminus and the aquifer shallow zones results of this study suggest that some mitigation strategies are needed to deal with the rapid glacier retreat which could lead to groundwater crisis in this region credit authorship contribution statement qiule he conceptualization

total groundwater recharge tgr in the jiemayangzong glacier basin source of the yarlung zangbo new hydrological insights for the region results show that the volume of the jiemayangzong glacier would

to 34 8 in the yangbajing sub basin glacier retreat also affects local groundwater recharge storage and discharge somers et al 2020 when thickness and length of a glacier increase the proportion of subglacial meltwater recharge to groundwater smrg will increase when the thickness and length of the glacier shrink the smrg will decrease and more groundwater will leak out to surface water due to

lithology of the proglacial lake area is dominated by quaternary sediment while the lithology of the other area is mainly monzogranite 3 methods 3 1 bias corrected of cmip6 climate change data some biases exist between output data of cmip6 and observation data gao et al 2018 we intend to eliminate the discrepancies between cmip6 outputs and observations from meteorological station by the bias correction method gudmundsson et al 2012 historical and future biases are assumed to be similar gao et al 2018 fitted parameters by regression function from the historical period 1973 2019 are used to

surface area are updated every five years to avoid the situation of glacier advance in the model gao et al 2018 2021 3 3 hgs model 3 3 1 model construction the model is developed using hgs aquanty 2015 as it simultaneously couples surface water and groundwater flow in a physically distributed manner hgs has been successfully applied to simulate smrg in the laurentide ice sheet during the pleistocene lemieux et al 2006 2008a 2008b 2008c the jiemayangzong glacier basin is discretized into triangular meshes fig 3 along the z axis the model is divided into 20 elements layers between the surface elevation excluding glacier thickness and an elevation of 5 km below sea level with a total of 131760 nodes and 247 280 elements from the top layer to the bottom layer the vertical thickness varies between 50 m and 1000 m surficial hydraulic properties of the different materials are listed in table 1 spatial distributions of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage in the model are shown in fig s2 3 3 2 boundary conditions the glacier bottom which is in contact with the ground surface reaches its pressure melting point caused by frictional and geothermal heating generating subglacial meltwater that can recharge the groundwater lemieux et al 2008a a specified head boundary is set to calculate the flux of smrg iverson and person 2012 person et al 2012 hart et al 2015 flowers 2015 hart 2017 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 hydraulic head in the glacierized area is equivalent to subglacial elevation plus weight of the glacier thickness which can be expressed as bense

proportion that used to calculate the equivalent head and d ice m is the glacier thickness the ξ is specified 0 9 in the study zhang et al 2017 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 hydraulic head of elements covered by proglacial lake are set equal to the surface elevation plus depth of lake water bodies in the model lemieux 2006 a specified flux boundary condition is used to calculate precipitation recharge to groundwater prg fig 4 shows a simplified cross section illustrating the boundary conditions and conceptualized groundwater flow pattern of the model based on the annual mean precipitation from 1973 to 2019 fig 1c and the initial glacier thickness fig 1b as the boundary condition fig 4 a steady state model is first built fig s5 then a transient model is constructed and its initial hydraulic head is derived from the steady state model fig s5 the transient model is constructed to predict the groundwater system evolution in the next 80 years 2021 2100 under ssp126 and ssp585 climate change scenarios 3 3 3 model sensitivity analysis the relative sensitivity coefficient rse is used to evaluate parameters smrg prg and tgr sensitivity in the steady state model mccuen 1973 incremental value of each parameter is 10 of the corresponding base value for relative sensitivity analysis the rse can be expressed as mccuen 1973 7 rse ot ot ref ot ref m m ref m ref where ot and ot ref are the model output value with the changed parameter value m and the reference parameter value m ref a smaller value of rse means more stable in the model and a larger value of rse means more sensitive in the model mccuen 1973 sensitivity analysis indicates that hydraulic parameters β and k play important roles in smrg and tgr table s3 the prg is only sensitive to the recharge coefficient of precipitation α table s3 the proportion of glacier thickness ξ is the most stable parameter for the smrg and tgr table s3 4 results 4 1 future climate changes eight gcms are used to predict future annual mean temperature and precipitation from 2021 to 2100 fig 5 since each gcm focuses on different major impact factors affecting climate change there are some uncertainties about future climate projections especially for the ssp585 scenario zhou et al 2019 although there are some fluctuations in the annual mean temperature there is an obvious increasing trend especially for the ssp585 scenario fig 5a for the ssp126 scenario it will increase by 0 19 1 38 c in 2090 s at a rate of 0 005 0 045 c decade for the ssp585 scenario it will increase by 0 99 4 47 c in 2090 s with an increasing rate of 0 13 0 48 c decade fig 5a in most of gcms annual mean precipitation shows a rising tendency precipitation changes by 1 9 6 5 mm decade negative value only in cesm2 model and canesm5 model in the ssp126 scenario and increases by 2 6 20 1 mm decade in the ssp585 scenario fig 5b for the eight gcms the annual mean precipitation is projected to increase by 158 215 mm 0 62 35 22 and 195 318 mm 22 64 100 53 in 2090 s under the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios respectively fig 5b generally the two scenarios will experience increase trends in temperature and precipitation and the ssp585 scenario has significantly faster changing trends 4 2 future glacier retreat temperature and precipitation of the eight gcms are inputs for the δ h parameterization model the outputs are the simulated evolution of glacier area volume and average thickness from 2021 to 2100 fig 6 the jiemayangzong glacier shows various levels of retreat and ablation area shrinkage volume loss and thickness thinning in the eight gcms especially in the nesm and cesm2 models fig 6 compared with current status in 2021 fig 6 shows that the nesm model leads to the largest glacier area volume and average thickness shrink for both the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios for the ssp126 scenario area of jiemayangzong glacier decreases to 98 87 3 77 9 and 60 5 in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 respectively the glacier volume decreases to 88 7 65 6 47 6 and 26 1 respectively the average thickness of the jiemayangzong glacier decreases to 88 6 74 1 60 6 and 42 8 in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 respectively for the ssp585 scenario the glacier area decreases to 98 86 4 73 8 and 42 7 the volume decreases to 87 5 62 9 41 8 and 14 7 and the average thickness decreases to 88 6 72 2 56 2 and 34 2 in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 respectively fig 6 shows the smallest shrinkage which is simulated by the cmcc cm2 sr5 model toward the ssp126 scenario the area volume and average thickness decrease to 97 5 86 and 87 5 in 2100 respectively toward ssp585 scenario the area volume and average thickness will decrease to 95 9 81 6 and 84 4 in 2100 respectively fig 7 shows the simulated spatial changes in the glacier extent for different gcms the glacier area and thickness in miroc6 cmcc cm2 sr5 mri and canesm5 models change slightly however the glacier area and thickness of the inm bcc cesm2 and nesm models change dramatically especially in the ssp585 scenario generally faster temperature increase will cause the glacier to shrink faster the glacier retreats much faster for the ssp585 scenario than that of the ssp126 scenario especially in the late 21st century the glacier area reduces much faster in the late 21st century but the glacier volume and average thickness seem to be reduced quickly in the early 21st century in all the climate models glacier volume reduction occurs more rapidly than the average thickness and area 4 3 future groundwater recharge average value of the eight gcms is used to predict the groundwater system evolution of the jiemayangzong glacier basin from 2021 to 2100 aalto et al 2017 li et al 2017 hofer et al 2020 horvat 2021 fig 8 shows the groundwater system evolution including smrg prg and tgr in different future climate scenarios the annual mean smrg decreases from 4 84 105 m3 in the steady state to 2 50 105 m3 52 and 1 24 105 m3 26 in 2100 for the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios respectively fig 8a the ratio of smrg to tgr would decrease rapidly decreasing to 42 and 22 in 2100 for the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios fig 8a prg will increase with glacier retreat due to increase of precipitation and recharged area for the ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios the annual mean prg will increase from 2 90 105 m3 in the steady state to 3 47 105 m3 119 and 4 37 105 m3 151 in 2100 respectively fig 8b the ratio of prg to tgr quickly increases to 58 and 78 in 2100 under two different climate scenarios fig 8b the tgr including smrg and prg would rapidly decrease to 5 97 105 m3 yr 77 and 5 62 105 m3 yr 73 in 2100 for ssp126 and ssp585 respectively fig 8c although prg continuously increases for ssp126 and ssp585 scenarios it could not counteract the loss of smrg 4 4 hydraulic head distribution fig 9 illustrates the simulated surficial layer hydraulic head changes in the steady state and the future in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 with continuous decreasing in smrg the hydraulic head would decrease rapidly for the ssp126 scenario the average change in hydraulic head is 2 28 m 11 25 m 30 27 m and 34 91 m in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 respectively the average change in hydraulic head is 2 20 m 12 07 m 36 30 m and 43 73 m for the ssp585 scenario the hydraulic head varied dramatically in the glacierized area and its vicinity especially in the glacier terminal zone the change in hydraulic head is more significant for the ssp585 scenario especially from 2070 to 2100 fig 10 shows the change in hydraulic head difference along the a a section fig 1a between the steady state and the future in 2030 2050 2070 and 2100 the elevation of this profile varies from 5416 m to 6195 m the hydraulic head difference decreases dramatically which leads to less smrg for both climate change scenarios the hydraulic head would not change significantly from 2030 to 2050 the hydraulic head decreases quickly after about 2050 the largest change in hydraulic head occurs under the glacier especially for the ssp585 scenario the change in hydraulic head is more significant in the aquifer shallow zones elevation above 4000 m the change in hydraulic head in the a a section clearly shows that glacier retreat will have an evident impact on the groundwater flow system 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other studies based on the numerical groundwater flow model with glaciation taken into account the climate glacier groundwater mechanism in the headwater of yzb can be quantitatively understood fig 4 the results are consistent with preciousstudies showing an evident impact of glacier retreat on groundwater recharge storage and discharge flowers et al 2005 saberi et al 2019 somers et al 2019 2020 he et al 2022 the results also show that subglacial meltwater has an important effect on groundwater not only in the ice sheet lemieux et al 2008a 2008b 2008c zhang et al 2017 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 but also in the mountain glacierized region somers et al 2020 chen et al 2021 he et al 2022 therefore this study will help develop similar groundwater flow models in glacierized basins both on the tp and elsewhere in the world the steady state model simulated the flux of multi year average smrg to be 4 84 105 m3 yr 24 mm yr which accounts for 63 of tgr fig 8 which is similar to previous studies with a range between 15 and 36 mm yr boulton et al 1995 forsberg 1996 piotrowski et al 1997 2009 van weert et al 1997 person et al 2003 due to the greater glacier thickness and less precipitation in the jiemayangzong basin the simulated smrg is significantly higher than that 4 58 mm yr 6 33 in he et al 2022 the glacier meltwater contribution to groundwater recharge is 15 in a headwater basin in ecuador with glacier area covered 34 saberi et al 2019 chen et al 2021 simulated glacier meltwater contribution to groundwater ratio to be 10 and 34 8 in the lhasa river basin and the yangbajing basin two sub basins in the yzb with 1 3 and 11 5 glacier covered area respectively compared with saberi et al 2019 and chen et al 2021 the smrg ratio of the jiemayangzong basin is obviously higher due to a greater glacier area proportion 46 5 2 uncertainties the geological data used to determine the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage is simplified and local and regional heterogeneities are not considered the model also does not consider faults and anisotropy of materials previous studies found that geological structure has significant effects on groundwater flow in alpine basins carlier et al 2018 2019 wirth et al 2020 arnoux et al 2021 the simplified geological structures in the model could have an impact on the smrg and the distribution of hydraulic head especially for deep aquifers although permafrost covers a large area in the yzb cheng and wu 2007 ji et al 2020 liu et al 2020 yao et al 2021 the model ignores the impact of permafrost on the smrg since largely unknown permafrost extent thickness and continuity at the glacier periphery permafrost can prevent smrg kleinberg and griffin 2005 zhang et al 2017 which is due to the fact that hydraulic conductivity of permafrost can drop several orders of magnitude compared with unfrozen sediment williams and smith 1991 however the permafrost is covered by a glacier which will cause an insulating effect on the land surface and could warm up soil temperature above the freeing point cutler et al 2000 lemieux et al 2008a consequently subglacial permafrost has limited effect on smrg since it primarily occurs below cold based regions of the glacier which do not produce subglacial meltwater breemer et al 2002 lemieux et al 2008b future projections indicate that permafrost in the yzb will continue to degrade in response to future warming ji et al 2020 which will provide more thawing water to recharge groundwater niu et al 2011 zhao et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 besides the permafrost degradation will increase soil permeability which leads to more surface water infiltration to recharge groundwater niu et al 2011 qin et al 2017 there is no doubt that a model without permafrost degradation in non glacierized area will further aggravate the uncertainty of the results the glacier surface meltwater recharge groundwater is not considered in the model surface meltwater can reach to aquifer though fractures crevasses and moulins ravier and buoncristiani 2018 however most surface meltwater input to the subglacial system only occurs in outermost regions of glacier piotrowski et al 1997 glacier surface meltwater mainly contributes to groundwater in the proglacial basins which is up to 2 18 of groundwater discharge in the andes saberi et al 2019 somers et al 2019 despite these constraints a part of glacier surface meltwater indeed penetrates to subglacial groundwater which leads to the simulated ratio of smrg greater than the real value the simplifications of ddf and h parameterization methods may cause some uncertainties in the results the ddf comes from an empirical equation in the model duo to lack of measured ddf data in the mountainous study area zhang et al 2019 the empirical ddf is too simple and does not take into account its large space temporal variability in addition the application of the ddf method does not consider the effect of radiation or wind field changes on glacier mass balance duethmann et al 2016 for the h parameterization a limitation is that this method is only suitable for glaciers retreat and cannot simulate glaciers advance process which may occur in the near future huss et al 2010 most of the existing studies on smrg focus on the saturated zone but the unsaturated zone is rarely considered because it is difficult to be coupled to the glacier model boulton et al 1995 forsberg 1996 breemer et al 2002 person et al 2003 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 the specified head boundary adopted can only simulate the movement of subglacial meltwater in the saturated zone boulton et al 1995 forsberg 1996 breemer et al 2002 person et al 2003 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 groundwater flow in the unsaturated zone is not considered some subglacial meltwater flows through the unsaturated zone where it directly discharges to the surface and some reaches the water table as groundwater recharge lemieux et al 2008b ignoring the flow process in the unsaturated zone may also cause a certain amount of uncertainty in the model the constructed mountain groundwater model with glaciation is inherently difficult to validate which could lead to high uncertainty in the conclusions flowers 2015 hermanowski and piotrowski 2019 at present only a limited number of methods can be used to constrain such models such as the isotopic and geochemical methods e g vaikmäe et al 2001 grasby and chen 2005 sterckx et al 2018 geological data and groundwater monitoring data are particularly scarce in high mountain environments raising a challenge for mountain groundwater models especially in the himalayas region somers et al 2020 besides the subglacial meltwater is extremely difficult to be measured directly and large uncertainties exist in the a varietious of boundary conditions used in the existing models e g piotrowski 1997a 1997b breemer et al 2002 person et al 2003 2007 carlson et al 2007 bense and person 2008 lemieux et al 2008a 2008b 2008c person et al 2012 sterckx et al 2017 the defect of specified flux boundary is that the flux of smrg varies both in time and space which is challenging to quantify smrg accurately while the specified head boundary may be able to avoid this situation it needs actual glacier thickness data which is also difficult to obtain furthermore the glacier thickness proportion has been applied to calculate the equivalent head varies significantly from 10 to 92 person et al 2003 bense and person 2008 lemieux et al 2008a sterckx et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 thus contributing to the uncertainties in the specified head boundary condition 6 conclusions a groundwater numerical model hgs and a glacier retreat model δ h parameterization are integrated to investigate how climate change influences glacier retreat and the effects of glacier retreat on the groundwater the coupled model is applied to the jiemayangzong glacier basin a typical glaciated basin in the headwater the of yzb furthermore we used the model to predict the glacier variation and its effects on groundwater system evolution from 2021 to 2100 under two scenarios ssp126 and ssp585 the glacier area is predicted to maximumly decrease to 86 4 in 2050 and 42 7 in 2100 while the glacier volume is predicted to maximumly decrease to 62 9 in 2050 and 14 7 in 2100 as well as the glacier average thickness decrease to 72 2 in 2050 and 34 2 in 2100 the simulated rate of annual smrg is 24 mm yr in the steady state model which accounts for 63 of tgr the smrg and tgr will maximumly decrease to 26 and 73 to 2100 respectively although prg continuously increases to 151 for ssp585 until 2100 it could not counteract the loss of smrg the change in hydraulic head varies dramatically in the glacier terminus and the aquifer shallow zones results of this study suggest that some mitigation strategies are needed to deal with the rapid glacier retreat which could lead to groundwater crisis in this region credit authorship contribution statement qiule he conceptualization

7632,study region francolí river catalonia iberian peninsula study focus the aim is the reconstruction of the october 2019 flash flood that was documented through extensive field work rainfall 300 mm in just a few hours flood marks times of flood passage and witnesses snapshots and reports channel changes log drift 20 000 trees and woody debris at bridges as well as large damage and six fatalities the methods are hydrological model built for the rainfall runoff in the basin and the flood routing in the river use of hydraulic principles such as flow at waterfalls flow against obstacles trees etc and finally 1d 2d free surface numerical models new hydrological insights the uppermost 100 km2 produced discharges of 700 m3 s up to 50 m3 s km2 locally three bridges failed but their cascading failure when one failure triggers the next one downstream was not proved the main channel widened more than 10 times dragging away soil and vegetation like a bulldozer the resulting large wood debris that clogged two bridges worsened the inundation an anomalous flow downstream probably a surge of around 1090 m3 s due to the failure of a woody jam at a narrow bridge took two lives water authority is now warning flood planners that vegetated torrential basins may cause catastrophic floods in the valley towns if their narrow bridges are sensitive to woody debris keywords flash flood large wood debris bridge hydraulics open channel surge torrential flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flash floods are a very common type of flooding in the mediterranean region gaume et al 2016 they bring together intense convective rains over small to medium size coastal basins of complex orography and steep slopes this relief favors the convergence and lift of maritime air that triggers convective systems that can remain stationary and accumulate large amounts of precipitation in a short time llasat et al 2016 vulnerability and exposure of the population and assets settled close to streams are high in general terms urban areas have increased in the last decades whereas agricultural land has been abandoned e g ravazzani et al 2016 martín vide et al 2020 urbanization has resulted in increased run off and given rise to a new hazard large forested areas which unless they are properly managed can find themselves in situations where either wind fires or floods tears trees down which then have the potential to be dragged away by floods the state of the art of the impact of large wood debris in flash floods is growing quickly the backwater rise caused by wood debris has been a topic of much laboratory research schalko et al 2018 gschnitzer et al 2016 panici and de almeida 2018 investigated how logs get stuck to and later detach from piers ruiz villanueva et al 2013 showed the role of wood debris in the actual flooding risk in the field the effect of bridge failures in a past catastrophic flood was shown by martín vide and llasat 2018 panici et al 2020 proposed a method to assess the risk of large wood debris lassettre and kondolf 2012 advocated for enlarging bridges instead of removing debris on financial grounds using the field data from a flash flood in a small basin 84 4 km2 macchione and lombardo 2021 studied the effect that the breakage of a wood debris jam at a bridge had on flood levels similar to this last study mentioned but on a much larger basin our work is a case study of the breaking of large wood debris at bridges in a flash flood the 2019 event in the francolí river ne iberian peninsula is a good example of a catastrophic flash flood upc 2020 urban growth was not a key factor in this case but wood debris was severe weather conditions on october 22nd were experienced by most of the northern iberian peninsula and the mediterranean coast including catalonia the balearic islands and valencia in addition to heavy rain there were lightning strikes wind gusts of over 80 km h occasional snowfall some tornadoes landslides and sea waves of up to 4 m high some other rivers streams and ravines broke their banks but the francolí river stood out among them all there were six fatalities and the total amount of damages paid by the national public reinsurer called ccs was about 44 million euros the objective of this paper is to provide a report of this flash flood which had strong added effects due to large wood debris at bridges ultimately our aim is to demonstrate that the flood wave caused by the collapse detachment of the debris jam piled up on one bridge increased the peak discharge and exacerbated flood damages downstream the end result of this sudden release was two fatalities we collected data on rainfall intensities flood marks and flow discharges channel changes log drift and wood debris at bridges damage and casualties fieldwork provided the opportunity to reconstruct the log contribution to this flash flood 1 how trees were torn down in the channel and floodplains 2 how bridges over the river were clogged by the log drift 3 how clogged bridges led to waves when the wood debris jam broke the presentation and discussion of these points provides the main contents of the paper 2 study area the francolí river catchment area of 838 km2 has a length of 60 km and a mean yearly flow of 1 2 m3 s at its mouth in tarragona fig 1 long bed slope in the study reach ranges from 2 0 upstream to 1 2 downstream mostly a torrential gradient as long as 1 5 after meunier 1991 but the continuity of the bed profile is interrupted by several waterfalls in limestone mudstone dominates in the nw of the basin the relief reaches 1200 m a m s l at the western mountain range with a dense deciduous forest pine trees prevail in forests at lower elevations combined with agricultural land towns of around 4000 7000 inhabitants stand on the valley plains close to the river channel large floods occurred in 1874 september 23rd 1930 october 18th 19th and 1994 october 10th always in autumn the latter roca et al 2009 was still well remembered 25 years later at the time of our event the peak flow in these large floods reached more than 1000 m3 s in the lowland river besides river slopes this is a second reason to call it a torrential river 3 field data and methods to our aim we proceeded from meteorology and pluviometry to hydrology and specially hydraulics the field estimation of discharges and log drift required the largest effort upc 2020 extensive field work was conducted from october 2019 right after the event until march 2020 in search of a marks of the maximum water level which were distinguishable in town houses and mills surveyed using topographical techniques b a 3d survey by means of several drone flights supported by ground topography to be used in hydraulic computation sometimes in combination with a pre event 2 m 2 m digital elevation model dem to report channel changes hooke 2016 c direct observations photographs video recordings interviews with witnesses reports of damages and dimensions of bridges the rainfall field during the event was reconstructed by combining rain gauge records and the rainfall field derived from weather radar observations rain records were obtained from two different sources i the automatic network of 186 rain gauges from the meteorological service of catalonia smc and ii the very dense network of rain gauges from the amateur association meteoprades with excellent coverage of the upper basin data from 9 rain gauges fig 1a cross validation showed remarkable consistency between both networks in turn the radar based rainfall was obtained from the smc radar network 4 single polarization c band radars for this event the radars rainfall estimates showed a general underestimation compared to the recorded data at rain gauges nevertheless the spatio temporal variability retained its significance the technique used for the combination of rain records and radar is kriging with an external drift e g velasco forero et al 2009 cassiraga et al 2020 which interpolates rain gauge observations using the radar rainfall as a drift describing the spatio temporal variability of the rainfall field the reconstructed rainfall was obtained with resolutions of 1 km and 30 min which suited our analysis in 2019 there were two flow gauging stations run by the catalan water authority fig 1 station a covered the upper 348 km2 it has the longest historical record including an estimate of 1094 m3 s for the 1930 flood on october 22nd it measured 2 m3 s at 20 10 time is utc throughout the text official time was utc 2 h 186 m3 s at 20 15 but then stopped recording due to flood damage at 20 20 station b covers 823 km2 almost the whole catchment it has a shorter historical record and yet provided a full hydrograph that night with a peak flow of 871 m3 s at 22 30 station b recorded an estimate of 1600 m3 s in the 1994 flood note that flood peak discharges may exceed by a thousand fold the mean river discharge 1 2 m3 s however both stations are inaccurate for large flows because water goes mostly overbank from a central canal into vegetated floodplains numerical models used for the analysis of data were a a hydrological model rainfall runoff and flood routing through its reaches in fig 1 specifically developed for this study upc 2020 and b 1d and 2d hydraulic models for estimating flood discharges 1d models were applications of the well known software hec ras used to solve the energy equation in steady flow over a fixed bed 2d models in steady and unsteady flow over a fixed bed were applications of the software iber and solved the depth averaged saint venant equations used elsewhere in the context of flash floods e g ruiz villanueva et al 2014 we also applied many hydraulic principles in steady and unsteady flow such as the occurrence of critical flow the energy bernoulli equation the discharge equations of weirs and a sluice gate the energy loss at bridge piers and decks and the mass and momentum conservation equations in rapidly varied unsteady flow direct observations of some undamaged river reaches anticipated that tributary 2 fig 1 did not overflow from its main channel and that tributary 3 had a minor flood 4 meteorological features on 22nd october 2019 at 12 00 the synoptic situation was characterized by a cold cut off low at mid to upper tropospheric levels located over south eastern iberian peninsula the associated low level cyclone progressed from north africa to the balearic islands during the day fig 2 at low levels this configuration caused a southeast to northwest surface wind circulation bringing warm and moist air towards catalonia while cold air was advancing over eastern spain the circulation associated with the cyclone contributed to the strengthening of the cold front and to the advection of warm and humid air towards the region the impingement of the easterly flow on the coastal orography resulted in a release of the strong latent instability and the triggering of deep moist convection over catalonia 5 hydrological modeling the total rainfall accumulated from 00 00 on october 22nd until 12 00 on october 23rd had a peak of almost 300 mm in one rain gauge in the upper western basin fig 1a the reconstructed radar rain gauge rainfall maps fig 1a show averages of 206 mm upstream of node 4 catchment area of 99 5 km2 and 255 mm upstream of node 1 27 6 km2 most of the rainfall occurred from 16 00 20 00 on october 22nd maximum rainfall intensities within this period peaked to almost 40 mm in 30 min around 19 00 fig 1c the flash flood and the damage it inflicted occurred shortly afterwards the gauged basin at b was divided into 20 sub basins for hydrologic modeling fig 1a those in the western uplands where the highest rainfall occurred had an area of 10 30 km2 while the remaining sub basins ranged from 50 to 100 km2 rainfall was spatially averaged in each sub basin runoff from one or several sub basins was concentrated in a node sub basin runoff was based upon the scs abstraction method curve number cn and the scs unit hydrograph chow et al 1988 estimating its peak time tp from the concentration time tc of kirpich 1940 the calibration of the sub basin model was done by means of two parameters one scaling factor for cn in all sub basins and one scaling factor for the relationship between tp and tc initial abstractions p0 mm varied between 30 mm in the most forested area in the uplands and 70 mm in the mostly agricultural lands according to soil use a river stretch spanned from one node to the next node downstream the flood hydrograph was routed in any of these stretches by using the kinematic wave that is suited to steep slopes jain 2001 with manning coefficient 0 050 s m 1 3 as in the hydraulic computations sections 6 7 8 moreover the large channel width in most of the river reaches 6 7 b fig 1 as well as in the ephemeral stream 3 in the uplands warranted introducing transmission losses through beds e g martín vide et al 1999 the model was calibrated to fit the hydrograph at station b also taking into account 1 times of flood passage especially the time at which station a went out of service due to the rapidly rising level 2 that ephemeral stream 3 with a 2 slope produced a minor flood and tributary 2 did not produce any flood 3 that tributary 1 peaked at 19 30 before the main francolí river peak thus alleviating the confluence of the two that in contrast was critical in 1994 roca et al 2009 and 4 the hydraulic calculations made by using the field marks see sections 6 7 as result of the calibration the scaling factor of cn in the upland part of the catchment was between 0 8 and 1 0 while in the rest of the basin the values of this parameter were between 0 4 and 0 6 which results in a stronger reduction of cn in addition the tc tp factor applied in the upland sub basins was smaller than in the rest of the basin furthermore transmission losses of 200 mm h in the reach 6 7 b and 1000 mm h in ephemeral stream 3 were needed the comparison of observed and simulated hydrographs at b is shown in an insert to fig 1 table 1 gathers the peak discharges of the hydrological model at the points of further hydraulic analysis the discharges inferred from flood marks and the times of peak reported by witnesses see sections 6 7 8 called hydraulic are added to table 1 the hydraulic discharges in the upper basin are higher than the hydrological ones and their times of peak a little ahead of those in the hydrological model 6 hydraulic modeling in the upper river and tributaries this section provides three results 1 an estimate of the total amount of large wood debris 2 an estimate of the conditions to tear down pine trees and 3 the discharge estimates in the upper part of the river and its tributaries 6 1 estimates of the amount of wood debris coming from the riverine forest shortly after october 23rd a photographic flight to the upstream river area was commissioned the orthographic result at 1 1000 scale allowed for the outlining of the area of the valley floor that underwent a large widening of its main channel fig 3 this sudden change could be viewed as a metamorphosis of the channel morphology but also as a devastation of the built environment in some parts it consisted of a stripe 15 35 m wide in the upland tributaries down to node 2 40 90 m wide in the valley reach between nodes 4 and 6 and then a transition of widths in between fig 1 formerly the channel had been around 2 m wide in tributaries and 5 m in the valley reach therefore the channel had widened more than tenfold the wide bed that results is either formed in alluvium or sometimes in rock depending on the geology or it becomes a wasteland within the built environment apart from the pre flood channel the rest of the widened area was mostly occupied by pine forest brushwood and agricultural lands vegetables and fruit trees table 2 collects the total areas ha by reaches and the three categories share of them it is especially interesting to see the total surface of 70 6 ha 47 2 23 4 ha at node 4 where the first clogged bridge c stood fig 3 while the contribution of the channelized ephemeral stream 3 not devastated was negligible according to tree density and volume rates obtained from the forestry administration these 70 6 ha would have supported 21 500 trees able to produce 6240 m3 of wood after two upstream bridges a fig 4 and b were broken in the flood these trees and bushes encountered bridge c the one that we will concentrate our research on see sections 7 2 and 8 6 2 an estimate of the conditions to tear down pine trees a lone pine tree close upstream of node 1 in tributary 4 withstood the flood among a copse of other pine trees that were torn down and drifted away this tree stood in the middle of a 1 80 slope channel which was much enlarged by the flood from 2 m to 32 m wide with a small central channel the tree had its bark stripped from 1 80 m to 3 20 m above the bed probably by the impact of other trees drifted by the flood fig 5 the average tree diameter in the copse was 17 cm the average distance between them 5 m this lone tree must have been the largest and strongest of them all as it was the only to withstand a discharge of 115 m3 s computed in uniform flow with trees as obstacles had a total head of 1 80 m in front of this tree and so the strike of drifted trunks must have started at that flow the thrust force of 25 kn and torque of 22 kn m in that situation computed with the equation of drag on obstacles are estimates of the mechanical actions needed to tear down these pine trees if hydraulic conditions channel width and slope are the same for the whole copse below these mechanical actions the trees would have withstood similarly a 3 20 m energy head with trees striking the upper bark is caused by a flow of 360 m3 s computed in uniform flow almost critical flow without trees thus the estimated discharge was in the range 115 m3 s 360 m3 s the hydraulic principles used here were 1 total head is water level plus kinematic head v 2 2 g where v is mean velocity 2 flow regime tends to be critical over steep slopes grant 1994 3 flow resistance in presence of trees is higher than without trees specifically a manning coefficient around 0 100 with trees instead of 0 050 without following e g freeman et al 2002 and 4 the drag force on submerged bodies is computed with a drag coefficient around 1 6 3 estimated peak flows in the upper river example of a waterfall the upland river and its tributaries all the way down to node 2 were analyzed with 2d models in order to get the peak discharges that matched the flood marks our drone maps had more resolution 3 cm pixel than the commissioned 1 1000 flight 10 cm pixel and were used for that purpose in the upper reaches we took advantage of several waterfalls cliffs of tough horizontally stratified limestone the most important of which is shown in fig 6b dashed rectangle in fig 3 the flood eroded most of the thin soil layer in the approach to the waterfall so the peak flow must have found a mostly rocky bed many floating debris marks were recorded at the margins of the flooded area fig 6 flow at waterfalls crosses critical flow at some point more precisely at a contour line around the half moon shape in plan view the 2d model is well suited to this configuration with the post flood rocky bed geometry the discharge that best fits the marks was in a range between 600 and 700 m3 s downstream of this waterfall there are good flood marks at the 1st mill a witness living in the mill reported that the loudest noise from the waterfall thus the peak flow occurred at 19 30 table 1 contrary to the rocky bed upstream there was a thick alluvial bed downstream of the waterfall that was scoured 0 5 2 m along ½ km fig 6a d with a net scoured volume of 16 850 m3 in the area of fig 6a 500 m long 40 m wide this was one of the most interesting geomorphological changes in our case study regarding the marks at the mill they would have been easily attained by a flow much lower than 600 700 m3 s if the former non scoured bed had been used in the 2d model the introduction of the scoured bed in the model was necessary in order to match the range 600 700 m3 s so as not to produce two different estimates of peak flow on either side of the waterfall the results of hydraulic estimates of peak discharge at several points in the upland river and tributaries like the preceding two examples are posted to fig 3 in terms of total discharge m3 s and specific discharge per unit basin area m3 s km2 ranges of the estimates were more realistic in view of the many uncertainties but only the upper limit of each range is posted the highest specific figures range from 42 to 53 m3 s km2 and from 31 to 51 m3 s km2 in two small sub basins to the north and to the west of town a respectively the soils in this area are formed on mudstone bedrock the figures 42 53 m3 s km2 come from the flow over a 100 m road length estimated by the broad crested weir equation with a discharge coefficient sensitive to wood debris on the road 7 hydraulic modeling in the lower river and the flooded valley towns towns c and g in the valley got flooded town b did not flooding was less severe at town i node 7 the flood peak occurred from 19 50 20 05 at c when it was already dark and from 20 00 20 15 at g both a little earlier than the hydrological peak table 1 lightning was so bright and frequent that some video snapshots are clear enough to understand the flow and see some details of it witnesses stated that a the rising rate of the flood level at town g was surprisingly fast much faster than in 1994 and b the level drop at town c was sudden six flood marks were surveyed at each town c and g as well as two more crucial marks at the 2nd mill and one at the 3rd mill most of these marks could be seen on building walls except for one mark on a traffic sign caught on a video shot by a driver whose car had stalled in front of a flooded river crossing the road to bridge c this section covers the discharge estimates obtained by using these marks in order from up to downstream of the lower river in the valley and describes the clogging of bridge c 7 1 a reliable estimate of discharge at the second mill the 2nd mill fig 7 upstream of town c was an ideal spot to assess the maximum discharge thanks to two accurate marks one at the courtyard sheltered from the flow stagnant water i e the mark there represents total head and the second in the open river in a quite straight reach both a 1d model and a uniform flow formula manning with n 0 050 slope is 1 35 produced a discharge of 775 m3 s which matched both the stagnant and flowing marks the two marks are related by the velocity head which amounts to 0 40 m i e a velocity of 2 80 m s the result is not very sensitive to coefficient n because the flow regime is close to critical grant 1997 fig 7e is an example of the way discharge is estimated throughout the lower river the 1d model is run for a set of discharges in abscissa to obtain a set of computed water elevations at the mark in ordinates then plotted in an elevation discharge graph where the computed line crosses with the horizontal line that states the recorded mark elevation we get the estimated discharge sensitivity to manning s n is explored by running the same model for different n values e g 0 040 and 0 060 in fig 7e the particular case of the 2nd mill where a pair of marks should be matched shows also that n 0 050 fits the marks better than any other values of n overall the sensitivity of the results of the models to manning s n is small throughout the river 7 2 flooding of town c and overtopping of bridge c the discharge estimate at the 2nd mill 775 m3 s was in line with the first three marks upstream at town c disregarding the discharge contribution of ephemeral river 3 fig 3 that was minor the other three marks including the one at the traffic sign were recorded on the road going to bridge c and proved that c was overtopped that night this fact besides being illuminated in a video snapshot by lightning was also made obvious by the large wood debris that was stuck on its deck the next morning fig 8a b overtopping makes the fitting of these marks very sensitive to the bridge consideration in the 1d model any 2d model seems less capable than hec ras for that purpose the arched bridge c had a single span of 11 5 m wide surprisingly small for the river after being widened by the flood though not bad for the river before this metamorphosis the flow over the road and bridge was more important than the flow through the span the former was considered a broad crested weir with a dimensionless discharge coefficient in the range 0 226 0 327 due to the wood debris jam ideally the coefficient of such a weir is 0 385 or with dimensions 1 7 m1 2 s 0 385 2 g g 9 81 m s2 regarding the arch and deck contraction expansion coefficients for arch bridges were applied martín vide and prió 2005 ineffective flow areas were also used near the bridge if the span had gotten rid of any obstruction at peak flow a flow in the range 650 760 m3 s would have reached the remaining three marks at town c those closest to the bridge with pressure flow in the upstream face and free flow in the downstream one fig 8c d the contribution of the flow through the span in this situation can be estimated with the sluice gate hydraulic equation for bridges hamill 1997 which comes out as 160 190 m3 s i e one fourth of the total in contrast if the span had been fully clogged with debris at peak flow 525 m3 s would have been enough to reach the marks in a regime of overtopping only let s keep the following conclusion as the flow at the 2nd mill is reliable it is likely that the bridge c span was free of debris at peak flow fig 8c taken the next morning suggests the same the flow at bridge c is even more complicated than what has been said so far the bridge is located just downstream of another waterfall in limestone fig 8c so that the bridge opening area is 30 m2 as seen from the upstream ground level but 120 m2 as seen from the downstream one fig 8d e moreover a wall on the right hand side used to access a building fig 8c encroached the flow further this building was literally bulldozed 7 3 the anomaly at bridge d bridge d very close downstream of bridge c at town c was also overtopped in this case there were no marks to prove the overtopping but there was clear evidence that a flood wave had swept its deck and railings that night fig 9a in fact this wave took a car with it as well as the lives of the two people inside the car had been waiting for the flood to recede in order to cross the river nevertheless bridge d withstood the flood the anomaly is that the same 1d model of the river at town c would not be able to predict a level so high as to overtop the bridge and sweep the road unless the flow peaked to 1200 m3 s fig 9b which is almost twice as much as the peak flow matching the set of six marks nearby in town c to explain this anomaly the hypothesis of a sudden release of a debris jam at bridge c was put forward to be investigated in section 8 with an unsteady 2d model this effort had to do with the ultimate objective of the research that a sudden release was more destructive than the flash flood itself domains of 1d and 2d models in the lowland river are drawn in fig 3 7 4 flooding of town g and clogging of the historical bridge f neighborhood f located on the left floodplain opposite the old town g on top of a hill was the most severely flooded town in the entire valley flood levels at many houses and businesses were 2 50 2 75 m above ground level some other houses which were more exposed to the high velocities were literally bulldozed a lot of coarse sand was found in the bed of the devastated area three bridges downstream of neighborhood f bridges f g h fig 3 were involved in the flooding problem a 1d model proves that the flow contraction at bridge h the farthest downstream of the three produced critical flow its total width of 35 m divided into three rectangular equal spans captured little wood debris some clear marks of stagnant water energy level on a building near the bridge allowed an accurate flow estimate of 700 m3 s with the 1d model at bridge h the historical four arched stone bridge f the closest to f of the three was heavily submerged except for its central section fig 10a its parapets and other appurtenances were damaged or lost moreover it became clogged by a lot of woody debris except for the two large central arches fig 10b where it was only partially clogged probably because of a lesser submergence at the center considering the clogged areas as blocked and using contraction expansion coefficients for arch bridges martín vide and prió 2005 the flooding marks in neighborhood f fit with a flow in the range of 640 790 m3 s this range includes within its limits the estimation of 700 m3 s at bridge h bridge g in turn and similarly to h was barely clogged by large wood debris thanks to the sacrifice of bridge f the 1d model proved that the clogging of bridge f worsened the flooding at f 8 hypothesis of a jam break producing a sudden release at bridge c the span of bridge c appeared clean the next morning fig 8c but at the same time much woody debris had crashed and piled up on its deck fig 8a as mentioned above this was the first surviving bridge in the river so it halted or obstructed the passage of drifted uprooted trees and bushes coming from 70 6 ha of highland e g fig 5 comparatively this was a larger load on c than the extra 57 4 ha with some 27 of forest on bridge f see table 2 which may have also captured debris not trapped at c bridge c s clean arch with wood debris all around c fig 8 suggests that the arch first clogged and then later collapsed broke thus producing a sudden water release a transient there is no direct evidence of this from witnesses except for the account of one riverine resident he endured 2 40 m of water covering his ground floor at the flood peak 19 50 20 05 but was then able to reenter the space safe and dry at 21 00 only 5 cm of mud on the floor suggesting the flood had suddenly receded contrary to that the hydrological model shows a slower recession e g one hour after the peak from 20 00 21 00 the flow had only halved the hypothesis of a sudden wood jam breakage at the peak flow is analyzed using a 2d unsteady model the information used to check this hypothesis is a the overtop at bridge d 2 fatalities fig 9a b a good flood mark on the wall of the 3rd mill and c the third failure of a bridge at e the latter was a bridge made of three beams which was washed away by the flow probably with the aid of debris impact and transported 170 m downstream to finally settle upside down in the channel fig 11 the slope there was 1 32 the model results are presented in fig 12 the domain boundaries were node 4 upstream and 270 m downstream of bridge e fig 3 the peak of the inflow hydrograph was set to 750 m3 s according to the above flow estimates at the 1st and 2nd mills and the first three marks at town c once this was set the hydrograph shape copied the result of the hydrologic model at town c node 4 the jam breaking was simulated in 2d by means of a breach progressing in depth and width to attain a breached area a m2 after a time t s campillo 2021 time t in the range 20 120 s did not make much difference in the routing of the unsteady flow downstream so t 60 s was selected area a was tested in the range of 50 120 m2 see fig 8d e for the actual span the moment of collapse was set at the peak of the inflow otherwise the unsteady peak flow is not high enough to match the three pieces of information above bridge decks are not included in the model manning coefficient in the channel is 0 050 as above results show the attenuation of the unsteady hydrograph in a rather short distance fig 12a to the point that the collapse at bridge c may have been hardly noticeable at towns f and g downstream of e contrarily the collapse makes a large difference in the fatal accident at bridge d 300 m downstream of c the transient flow there 1064 m3 s fig 12b most likely explains that overtopping a violent impact considering that the mean velocity was about 3 m s the flood mark at the 3rd mill was not predictable by the steady 1d model unless the flow peaked to 900 m3 s now with the higher unsteady peak 940 m3 s fig 12a the level is still 28 cm below the mark if a 120 m2 this difference should be accounted for by a fraction of the velocity head because the mill wall was not parallel to the flow regarding bridge e the strong impact on its deck can be explained by an unsteady flow if the flow had been steady it would have just grazed it fig 12c in conclusion the water marks recorded downstream of c could only be explained if the effect of a sudden release at bridge c was considered finally the three marks around bridge c posed the hardest question the peak inflow discharge of 750 m3 s supported by several estimates upstream is too high for these marks if the bridge is fully clogged at the time of collapse since a collapse before the peak much reduces the flow routing downstream at d the 3rd mill and e complicating the comparison of fig 12b c the clogging of c must have been partial allowing a certain seeping flow through but one that was less than 160 190 m3 s capacity in pressure flow without debris it is rather speculative to guess how much this through flow was but it must have been quite high to match the marks 9 the aftermath losses and perceptions of the flood six people died due to the flood aside from the car swept away at bridge d 2 fatalities a truck driver was dragged into the water along with his truck a bungalow in town h and a shack in town j were also drifted killing all three of their inhabitants other cars were also dragged e g fig 9a but those people were able to get out when the flood was rising very quickly the elderly couple living in the 2nd mill saved their lives by escaping at around 19 45 to the upper floor after the event 30 cm of mud covered everything on their ground floor the major destruction took place from 19 30 20 30 either caused by the drag of water or by the level rise due to the clogging of bridges especially c and f the clogging of c was worse than that of f due to its deadly consequences two bridges a b failed at town b one of them disappeared b fig 4 there was significant damage at town c a winery and a restaurant in the river channel accessed via a ramp the wall in fig 8c were bulldozed as were some premises near the river fortunately the restaurant was not open that night at town g the clogging by debris of bridge f 12th century caused overflow to the surrounding area f the severe damage caused to f will need historical restoration as mentioned houses close to the river channel at g were destroyed in total more than sixty houses and businesses were flooded with numerous direct and indirect losses water inside exceeded 1 5 m in many of them it reached 2 40 m at town c and 2 50 2 75 m at town f as mentioned town facilities such as sports halls sewer pipes and sewage treatment plants as well as ditches irrigation facilities rural roads and recreational areas were damaged water supply to towns b c and g had to be cut off the flood ravaged crops and caused the loss of livestock train tracks buckled at some points even causing a freight train to derail a first estimate of the damage to infrastructure excluding roads in the basin amounted to around 4 million euros plus 3 million euros to repair treatment plants towns g f and c with the most damage were paid more than 2 40 and 1 38 million euros respectively by ccs twenty five years prior to 2019 the 1994 flood had not been as severe as our flood in the upper part of the basin recovery actions began immediately on october 23rd local regional and state authorities agreed to remove debris and restore the damaged hydraulic infrastructure a few days later financial aid was approved to meet the costs of emergency and repair however storm gloria that hit the catalan coast in january 2020 scg followed by the lockdown due to the covid 19 pandemic slowed down and even stopped both the planned recovery measures and the effort to raise more funds citizens platforms such as flood of support helped the victims the study of the return of experience through citizen science buytaert et al 2014 was led by the university of barcelona and the museum of rural life at town c llasat et al 2021 among what participants drew from the flood experience the most valuable teaching was solidarity and cooperation in the face of adversity regarding more technical matters they were concerned by the design and maintenance clearance of bridges and rivers and by the risk of living in the floodplains they stressed the need to respect and adapt to nature managing riparian forests and recovering old practices pasture use of bank reeds 10 discussion the concentration of a heavy downpour in a small mediterranean mountainous basin resembles the case of the 1962 rubí flood that took more than 800 lives martín vide et al 1999 martín vide and llasat 2018 besides bridges being swept away by the flood the huge sediment load played an important role in that flood it also reminds us of the 2018 flood in mallorca which claimed 17 lives lorenzo lacruz et al 2019 amengual et al 2021 in the latter episode a peak discharge of about 300 m3 s was estimated for a basin of barely 23 km2 the role of the bridges and the paved riverbed across the town of sant llorenç resulted in a 7 m s wave velocity and widespread overflowing the approximate times of the peak s passage allow us to carry out a kinematic analysis of the wave in the francolí it traveled 6 8 km from the 1st mill to town c bridge c in 25 30 min and so the wave velocity was 3 8 4 5 m s the reliable hydraulic calculation at the 2nd mill within this reach fig 7 produced a water velocity of 2 80 m s at its peak this wave velocity vs water velocity is within the range 3 2 5 3 established by the klietz seddon law of flood routing as a kinematic wave in wide channels jain 2001 however after that stretch it continued to travel down another 6 1 km from bridge c to bridge f town f g in around 10 min therefore at a much higher wave velocity of 10 2 m s 36 6 km h the theory of open channel surges martín vide 1992 gives us a wave velocity in excess of the water velocity in the case of a sudden release such as the collapse of a wood debris jam per unit width this excess is v g y 2 y 1 y 1 y 2 2 1 2 where g 9 81 m s2 y 1 and y 2 are the water depths up and downstream of the surge which at bridge c were around 13 5 m and 5 5 m see fig 8d e it turns out to be an excess of 6 1 m s then this wave velocity added to the water velocity of 2 8 m s gets close to the surge velocity of 10 2 m s due to a sudden release therefore the acceleration of the flood in the last 6 1 km with respect to the upstream reach is plausible the same surge theory also supports the discharge increase this is simply v b y 1 y 2 per unit width where b 11 5 m is the span width it comes out 565 m3 s larger than the numerical result 1091 750 341 m3 s in fig 12 but of the same order of magnitude then the discharge increase from bridges c to f as well as the wave acceleration are plausible the actual wave attenuated witnesses spoke of a very quick level rise not of a surge or bore strictly speaking note that the surge theory is 1d used here per unit width not even 2d this discussion suggests that the wave produced by the collapse at c should have been noticeable at town f g contrary to the comment made in fig 12 station a may give us a clue to this point in the five minute lapse before being out of service the measured discharge climbed from 2 m3 s to 186 m3 s at a rate of 37 m3 s min so in 15 more minutes it may have reached 750 m3 s compare this with the rate of increase imposed to the model at the release 341 m3 s min and the same rate at bridge e as computed by the 2d model 20 m3 s min this result at e does not seem compatible with the data at station a since any wave should have further attenuated in the remaining 5 7 km from e to a either the release must have been more violent or the possibility of some numerical diffusion in the 2d numerical model producing too much attenuation can not be ruled out the model needs finite volumes of different sizes for the main channel and floodplains which may cause this numerical diffusion richtmyer and morton 1967 potter 1973 in general terms the damping of the hydrograph as seen in fig 12 is not contradictory to the lack of damping in flood routing over steep slopes jain 2001 because the volume of water involved here i e the small reservoir at the rear of bridge c is very small as in macchione and lombardo 2021 between the two bridges lost upstream of node 2 bridge b see dimensions in fig 4 in a 28 m wide valley became clogged by woody debris some pine trees are taller than its width e g fig 5 but it appeared not to have been overtopped floating debris at water level suggested a temporary reservoir upstream dam break flow theory jain 2001 a particular case of the surge theory provides a maximum discharge q b 27 g u 2 gy 1 3 where u is the velocity through the bridge bateman 1993 with u 0 full clogging y1 7 m and b 28 m it results in 480 m3 s the same equation can be applied to bridge c regarding bridge a it was a culvert in a very long road the result of introducing the flood marks on the road into a broad crested weir equation leads to results similar to those of bridge b the crucial point about these two bridges is whether their failure produced a wave going down to the 2nd mill and town c probably worsening the problem at bridge c even after accounting for a damping of the wave down the river as in fig 12 in favor of the wave hypothesis there is the large discrepancy between the hydrologic model and the hydraulic computation at the 2nd mill an extra discharge coming from the failure of bridge b would solve this discrepancy against the hypothesis of a surge type wave is the fact that the kinematic wave wave velocity 3 2 5 3 of water velocity coincides with the data regarding the time of passage at the 2nd mill we will probably never know whether there was a cascading failure of bridges table 3 compares our hydrologic and hydraulic results with the likely flood discharges according to the catalan water authority s plans at node 7 after the junction with tributary 1 total basin of 455 km2 we find an agreement between hydrology and hydraulic estimates that corresponds to a return period of less than 100 years the peak discharge at town i node 7 in 1994 after surveying flood marks and using 1d 2d models was 1100 m3 s roca et al 2009 larger than in 2019 from node 7 down to the river mouth the flood was worse in 1994 than in 2019 but just the opposite happened upstream of a the discrepancies between the peak discharge from hydrological and hydraulic analyses are very large upstream of node 2 this area of 41 9 km2 includes two small creeks with extreme specific discharges of 42 53 m3 s km2 to the north and 31 51 m3 s km2 close to town a fig 3 the rain gauge coverage there is less dense than in other sections extreme local rainfall may have passed unnoticed however cross validation of the reconstructed rainfall series at the four rain gauges closest to these two creeks has shown discrepancies in the total accumulations of less than 10 with no systematic bias to the observers the authors land had been literally washed by rainfall into these areas water had oozed from any field flowed through any furrow run down to any creek gulley or ravine the mudstone in the area must have played a role in this extreme runoff the contrast between the 2019 flood and the 500 year flood almost three times lower suggests poor space resolution in the plans upstream of node 1 27 6 km2 with no broken bridges involved the estimated discharge of 610 m3 s i e 23 m3 s km2 is as high as the discharge computed at station a 348 km2 transient discharges such as 1200 m3 s 1d or 1091 m3 s 2d fig 12 at bridge d are avoided in table 3 but were real so real as to explain the loss of two lives the flash flood in october 2019 is almost a geomorphic flood in the uplands in the sense of channel formation the extreme widening from 2 m to 15 35 m in the upland tributaries and from 5 m to 40 90 m in the valley reach taking with it soil agriculture brushwood pine trees and mature deciduous forest seems impossible to recover for decades the image of a bulldozer leveling the river with a huge blade growing in width from 15 m to 90 m going down the river is quite probably what happened in reality the geomorphic changes at the confluences especially at node 1 fig 4 deserves a detailed analysis which is out of the scope of this paper in the flood protection plans water authority has warned about paying special attention to the basins that meet the following conditions a a relief with a mountain range close to the sea able to enhance atmospheric processes much of the mediterranean coast of the iberian peninsula the pre coastal range in catalonia b a forest extended in the basin especially developed after the abandonment of agriculture and c towns with certain flooding risk in the river valley especially if they are served with roads and railways with small bridges upc 2020 bridge c in francolí river with only one 11 5 m wide span is the epitome of this concern 11 conclusions this case study has shown a flash flood with large wood debris able to clog at least two bridges we think we have proved beyond doubt that the sudden water release at one of them c after the collapse of its wood jam formed a surge responsible for the loss of two lives at a nearby bridge downstream d the second bridge f that became clogged farther downstream worsened the problem at a town which flooded up to 2 8 m above ground level in turn a bridge that broke farther upstream b may have worsened the flood but a cascading failure of bridges is uncertain the flash flood was almost a geomorphic flood able to widen the channel from 2 5 m to 35 90 m in this way it bulldozed the surrounding forest loading itself with a huge amount of trees and bushes which ended up at the bridges analysis and conclusions are based upon a

7632,study region francolí river catalonia iberian peninsula study focus the aim is the reconstruction of the october 2019 flash flood that was documented through extensive field work rainfall 300 mm in just a few hours flood marks times of flood passage and witnesses snapshots and reports channel changes log drift 20 000 trees and woody debris at bridges as well as large damage and six fatalities the methods are hydrological model built for the rainfall runoff in the basin and the flood routing in the river use of hydraulic principles such as flow at waterfalls flow against obstacles trees etc and finally 1d 2d free surface numerical models new hydrological insights the uppermost 100 km2 produced discharges of 700 m3 s up to 50 m3 s km2 locally three bridges failed but their cascading failure when one failure triggers the next one downstream was not proved the main channel widened more than 10 times dragging away soil and vegetation like a bulldozer the resulting large wood debris that clogged two bridges worsened the inundation an anomalous flow downstream probably a surge of around 1090 m3 s due to the failure of a woody jam at a narrow bridge took two lives water authority is now warning flood planners that vegetated torrential basins may cause catastrophic floods in the valley towns if their narrow bridges are sensitive to woody debris keywords flash flood large wood debris bridge hydraulics open channel surge torrential flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flash floods are a very common type of flooding in the mediterranean region gaume et al 2016 they bring together intense convective rains over small to medium size coastal basins of complex orography and steep slopes this relief favors the convergence and lift of maritime air that triggers convective systems that can remain stationary and accumulate large amounts of precipitation in a short time llasat et al 2016 vulnerability and exposure of the population and assets settled close to streams are high in general terms urban areas have increased in the last decades whereas agricultural land has been abandoned e g ravazzani et al 2016 martín vide et al 2020 urbanization has resulted in increased run off and given rise to a new hazard large forested areas which unless they are properly managed can find themselves in situations where either wind fires or floods tears trees down which then have the potential to be dragged away by floods the state of the art of the impact of large wood debris in flash floods is growing quickly the backwater rise caused by wood debris has been a topic of much laboratory research schalko et al 2018 gschnitzer et al 2016 panici and de almeida 2018 investigated how logs get stuck to and later detach from piers ruiz villanueva et al 2013 showed the role of wood debris in the actual flooding risk in the field the effect of bridge failures in a past catastrophic flood was shown by martín vide and llasat 2018 panici et al 2020 proposed a method to assess the risk of large wood debris lassettre and kondolf 2012 advocated for enlarging bridges instead of removing debris on financial grounds using the field data from a flash flood in a small basin 84 4 km2 macchione and lombardo 2021 studied the effect that the breakage of a wood debris jam at a bridge had on flood levels similar to this last study mentioned but on a much larger basin our work is a case study of the breaking of large wood debris at bridges in a flash flood the 2019 event in the francolí river ne iberian peninsula is a good example of a catastrophic flash flood upc 2020 urban growth was not a key factor in this case but wood debris was severe weather conditions on october 22nd were experienced by most of the northern iberian peninsula and the mediterranean coast including catalonia the balearic islands and valencia in addition to heavy rain there were lightning strikes wind gusts of over 80 km h occasional snowfall some tornadoes landslides and sea waves of up to 4 m high some other rivers streams and ravines broke their banks but the francolí river stood out among them all there were six fatalities and the total amount of damages paid by the national public reinsurer called ccs was about 44 million euros the objective of this paper is to provide a report of this flash flood which had strong added effects due to large wood debris at bridges ultimately our aim is to demonstrate that the flood wave caused by the collapse detachment of the debris jam piled up on one bridge increased the peak discharge and exacerbated flood damages downstream the end result of this sudden release was two fatalities we collected data on rainfall intensities flood marks and flow discharges channel changes log drift and wood debris at bridges damage and casualties fieldwork provided the opportunity to reconstruct the log contribution to this flash flood 1 how trees were torn down in the channel and floodplains 2 how bridges over the river were clogged by the log drift 3 how clogged bridges led to waves when the wood debris jam broke the presentation and discussion of these points provides the main contents of the paper 2 study area the francolí river catchment area of 838 km2 has a length of 60 km and a mean yearly flow of 1 2 m3 s at its mouth in tarragona fig 1 long bed slope in the study reach ranges from 2 0 upstream to 1 2 downstream mostly a torrential gradient as long as 1 5 after meunier 1991 but the continuity of the bed profile is interrupted by several waterfalls in limestone mudstone dominates in the nw of the basin the relief reaches 1200 m a m s l at the western mountain range with a dense deciduous forest pine trees prevail in forests at lower elevations combined with agricultural land towns of around 4000 7000 inhabitants stand on the valley plains close to the river channel large floods occurred in 1874 september 23rd 1930 october 18th 19th and 1994 october 10th always in autumn the latter roca et al 2009 was still well remembered 25 years later at the time of our event the peak flow in these large floods reached more than 1000 m3 s in the lowland river besides river slopes this is a second reason to call it a torrential river 3 field data and methods to our aim we proceeded from meteorology and pluviometry to hydrology and specially hydraulics the field estimation of discharges and log drift required the largest effort upc 2020 extensive field work was conducted from october 2019 right after the event until march 2020 in search of a marks of the maximum water level which were distinguishable in town houses and mills surveyed using topographical techniques b a 3d survey by means of several drone flights supported by ground topography to be used in hydraulic computation sometimes in combination with a pre event 2 m 2 m digital elevation model dem to report channel changes hooke 2016 c direct observations photographs video recordings interviews with witnesses reports of damages and dimensions of bridges the rainfall field during the event was reconstructed by combining rain gauge records and the rainfall field derived from weather radar observations rain records were obtained from two different sources i the automatic network of 186 rain gauges from the meteorological service of catalonia smc and ii the very dense network of rain gauges from the amateur association meteoprades with excellent coverage of the upper basin data from 9 rain gauges fig 1a cross validation showed remarkable consistency between both networks in turn the radar based rainfall was obtained from the smc radar network 4 single polarization c band radars for this event the radars rainfall estimates showed a general underestimation compared to the recorded data at rain gauges nevertheless the spatio temporal variability retained its significance the technique used for the combination of rain records and radar is kriging with an external drift e g velasco forero et al 2009 cassiraga et al 2020 which interpolates rain gauge observations using the radar rainfall as a drift describing the spatio temporal variability of the rainfall field the reconstructed rainfall was obtained with resolutions of 1 km and 30 min which suited our analysis in 2019 there were two flow gauging stations run by the catalan water authority fig 1 station a covered the upper 348 km2 it has the longest historical record including an estimate of 1094 m3 s for the 1930 flood on october 22nd it measured 2 m3 s at 20 10 time is utc throughout the text official time was utc 2 h 186 m3 s at 20 15 but then stopped recording due to flood damage at 20 20 station b covers 823 km2 almost the whole catchment it has a shorter historical record and yet provided a full hydrograph that night with a peak flow of 871 m3 s at 22 30 station b recorded an estimate of 1600 m3 s in the 1994 flood note that flood peak discharges may exceed by a thousand fold the mean river discharge 1 2 m3 s however both stations are inaccurate for large flows because water goes mostly overbank from a central canal into vegetated floodplains numerical models used for the analysis of data were a a hydrological model rainfall runoff and flood routing through its reaches in fig 1 specifically developed for this study upc 2020 and b 1d and 2d hydraulic models for estimating flood discharges 1d models were applications of the well known software hec ras used to solve the energy equation in steady flow over a fixed bed 2d models in steady and unsteady flow over a fixed bed were applications of the software iber and solved the depth averaged saint venant equations used elsewhere in the context of flash floods e g ruiz villanueva et al 2014 we also applied many hydraulic principles in steady and unsteady flow such as the occurrence of critical flow the energy bernoulli equation the discharge equations of weirs and a sluice gate the energy loss at bridge piers and decks and the mass and momentum conservation equations in rapidly varied unsteady flow direct observations of some undamaged river reaches anticipated that tributary 2 fig 1 did not overflow from its main channel and that tributary 3 had a minor flood 4 meteorological features on 22nd october 2019 at 12 00 the synoptic situation was characterized by a cold cut off low at mid to upper tropospheric levels located over south eastern iberian peninsula the associated low level cyclone progressed from north africa to the balearic islands during the day fig 2 at low levels this configuration caused a southeast to northwest surface wind circulation bringing warm and moist air towards catalonia while cold air was advancing over eastern spain the circulation associated with the cyclone contributed to the strengthening of the cold front and to the advection of warm and humid air towards the region the impingement of the easterly flow on the coastal orography resulted in a release of the strong latent instability and the triggering of deep moist convection over catalonia 5 hydrological modeling the total rainfall accumulated from 00 00 on october 22nd until 12 00 on october 23rd had a peak of almost 300 mm in one rain gauge in the upper western basin fig 1a the reconstructed radar rain gauge rainfall maps fig 1a show averages of 206 mm upstream of node 4 catchment area of 99 5 km2 and 255 mm upstream of node 1 27 6 km2 most of the rainfall occurred from 16 00 20 00 on october 22nd maximum rainfall intensities within this period peaked to almost 40 mm in 30 min around 19 00 fig 1c the flash flood and the damage it inflicted occurred shortly afterwards the gauged basin at b was divided into 20 sub basins for hydrologic modeling fig 1a those in the western uplands where the highest rainfall occurred had an area of 10 30 km2 while the remaining sub basins ranged from 50 to 100 km2 rainfall was spatially averaged in each sub basin runoff from one or several sub basins was concentrated in a node sub basin runoff was based upon the scs abstraction method curve number cn and the scs unit hydrograph chow et al 1988 estimating its peak time tp from the concentration time tc of kirpich 1940 the calibration of the sub basin model was done by means of two parameters one scaling factor for cn in all sub basins and one scaling factor for the relationship between tp and tc initial abstractions p0 mm varied between 30 mm in the most forested area in the uplands and 70 mm in the mostly agricultural lands according to soil use a river stretch spanned from one node to the next node downstream the flood hydrograph was routed in any of these stretches by using the kinematic wave that is suited to steep slopes jain 2001 with manning coefficient 0 050 s m 1 3 as in the hydraulic computations sections 6 7 8 moreover the large channel width in most of the river reaches 6 7 b fig 1 as well as in the ephemeral stream 3 in the uplands warranted introducing transmission losses through beds e g martín vide et al 1999 the model was calibrated to fit the hydrograph at station b also taking into account 1 times of flood passage especially the time at which station a went out of service due to the rapidly rising level 2 that ephemeral stream 3 with a 2 slope produced a minor flood and tributary 2 did not produce any flood 3 that tributary 1 peaked at 19 30 before the main francolí river peak thus alleviating the confluence of the two that in contrast was critical in 1994 roca et al 2009 and 4 the hydraulic calculations made by using the field marks see sections 6 7 as result of the calibration the scaling factor of cn in the upland part of the catchment was between 0 8 and 1 0 while in the rest of the basin the values of this parameter were between 0 4 and 0 6 which results in a stronger reduction of cn in addition the tc tp factor applied in the upland sub basins was smaller than in the rest of the basin furthermore transmission losses of 200 mm h in the reach 6 7 b and 1000 mm h in ephemeral stream 3 were needed the comparison of observed and simulated hydrographs at b is shown in an insert to fig 1 table 1 gathers the peak discharges of the hydrological model at the points of further hydraulic analysis the discharges inferred from flood marks and the times of peak reported by witnesses see sections 6 7 8 called hydraulic are added to table 1 the hydraulic discharges in the upper basin are higher than the hydrological ones and their times of peak a little ahead of those in the hydrological model 6 hydraulic modeling in the upper river and tributaries this section provides three results 1 an estimate of the total amount of large wood debris 2 an estimate of the conditions to tear down pine trees and 3 the discharge estimates in the upper part of the river and its tributaries 6 1 estimates of the amount of wood debris coming from the riverine forest shortly after october 23rd a photographic flight to the upstream river area was commissioned the orthographic result at 1 1000 scale allowed for the outlining of the area of the valley floor that underwent a large widening of its main channel fig 3 this sudden change could be viewed as a metamorphosis of the channel morphology but also as a devastation of the built environment in some parts it consisted of a stripe 15 35 m wide in the upland tributaries down to node 2 40 90 m wide in the valley reach between nodes 4 and 6 and then a transition of widths in between fig 1 formerly the channel had been around 2 m wide in tributaries and 5 m in the valley reach therefore the channel had widened more than tenfold the wide bed that results is either formed in alluvium or sometimes in rock depending on the geology or it becomes a wasteland within the built environment apart from the pre flood channel the rest of the widened area was mostly occupied by pine forest brushwood and agricultural lands vegetables and fruit trees table 2 collects the total areas ha by reaches and the three categories share of them it is especially interesting to see the total surface of 70 6 ha 47 2 23 4 ha at node 4 where the first clogged bridge c stood fig 3 while the contribution of the channelized ephemeral stream 3 not devastated was negligible according to tree density and volume rates obtained from the forestry administration these 70 6 ha would have supported 21 500 trees able to produce 6240 m3 of wood after two upstream bridges a fig 4 and b were broken in the flood these trees and bushes encountered bridge c the one that we will concentrate our research on see sections 7 2 and 8 6 2 an estimate of the conditions to tear down pine trees a lone pine tree close upstream of node 1 in tributary 4 withstood the flood among a copse of other pine trees that were torn down and drifted away this tree stood in the middle of a 1 80 slope channel which was much enlarged by the flood from 2 m to 32 m wide with a small central channel the tree had its bark stripped from 1 80 m to 3 20 m above the bed probably by the impact of other trees drifted by the flood fig 5 the average tree diameter in the copse was 17 cm the average distance between them 5 m this lone tree must have been the largest and strongest of them all as it was the only to withstand a discharge of 115 m3 s computed in uniform flow with trees as obstacles had a total head of 1 80 m in front of this tree and so the strike of drifted trunks must have started at that flow the thrust force of 25 kn and torque of 22 kn m in that situation computed with the equation of drag on obstacles are estimates of the mechanical actions needed to tear down these pine trees if hydraulic conditions channel width and slope are the same for the whole copse below these mechanical actions the trees would have withstood similarly a 3 20 m energy head with trees striking the upper bark is caused by a flow of 360 m3 s computed in uniform flow almost critical flow without trees thus the estimated discharge was in the range 115 m3 s 360 m3 s the hydraulic principles used here were 1 total head is water level plus kinematic head v 2 2 g where v is mean velocity 2 flow regime tends to be critical over steep slopes grant 1994 3 flow resistance in presence of trees is higher than without trees specifically a manning coefficient around 0 100 with trees instead of 0 050 without following e g freeman et al 2002 and 4 the drag force on submerged bodies is computed with a drag coefficient around 1 6 3 estimated peak flows in the upper river example of a waterfall the upland river and its tributaries all the way down to node 2 were analyzed with 2d models in order to get the peak discharges that matched the flood marks our drone maps had more resolution 3 cm pixel than the commissioned 1 1000 flight 10 cm pixel and were used for that purpose in the upper reaches we took advantage of several waterfalls cliffs of tough horizontally stratified limestone the most important of which is shown in fig 6b dashed rectangle in fig 3 the flood eroded most of the thin soil layer in the approach to the waterfall so the peak flow must have found a mostly rocky bed many floating debris marks were recorded at the margins of the flooded area fig 6 flow at waterfalls crosses critical flow at some point more precisely at a contour line around the half moon shape in plan view the 2d model is well suited to this configuration with the post flood rocky bed geometry the discharge that best fits the marks was in a range between 600 and 700 m3 s downstream of this waterfall there are good flood marks at the 1st mill a witness living in the mill reported that the loudest noise from the waterfall thus the peak flow occurred at 19 30 table 1 contrary to the rocky bed upstream there was a thick alluvial bed downstream of the waterfall that was scoured 0 5 2 m along ½ km fig 6a d with a net scoured volume of 16 850 m3 in the area of fig 6a 500 m long 40 m wide this was one of the most interesting geomorphological changes in our case study regarding the marks at the mill they would have been easily attained by a flow much lower than 600 700 m3 s if the former non scoured bed had been used in the 2d model the introduction of the scoured bed in the model was necessary in order to match the range 600 700 m3 s so as not to produce two different estimates of peak flow on either side of the waterfall the results of hydraulic estimates of peak discharge at several points in the upland river and tributaries like the preceding two examples are posted to fig 3 in terms of total discharge m3 s and specific discharge per unit basin area m3 s km2 ranges of the estimates were more realistic in view of the many uncertainties but only the upper limit of each range is posted the highest specific figures range from 42 to 53 m3 s km2 and from 31 to 51 m3 s km2 in two small sub basins to the north and to the west of town a respectively the soils in this area are formed on mudstone bedrock the figures 42 53 m3 s km2 come from the flow over a 100 m road length estimated by the broad crested weir equation with a discharge coefficient sensitive to wood debris on the road 7 hydraulic modeling in the lower river and the flooded valley towns towns c and g in the valley got flooded town b did not flooding was less severe at town i node 7 the flood peak occurred from 19 50 20 05 at c when it was already dark and from 20 00 20 15 at g both a little earlier than the hydrological peak table 1 lightning was so bright and frequent that some video snapshots are clear enough to understand the flow and see some details of it witnesses stated that a the rising rate of the flood level at town g was surprisingly fast much faster than in 1994 and b the level drop at town c was sudden six flood marks were surveyed at each town c and g as well as two more crucial marks at the 2nd mill and one at the 3rd mill most of these marks could be seen on building walls except for one mark on a traffic sign caught on a video shot by a driver whose car had stalled in front of a flooded river crossing the road to bridge c this section covers the discharge estimates obtained by using these marks in order from up to downstream of the lower river in the valley and describes the clogging of bridge c 7 1 a reliable estimate of discharge at the second mill the 2nd mill fig 7 upstream of town c was an ideal spot to assess the maximum discharge thanks to two accurate marks one at the courtyard sheltered from the flow stagnant water i e the mark there represents total head and the second in the open river in a quite straight reach both a 1d model and a uniform flow formula manning with n 0 050 slope is 1 35 produced a discharge of 775 m3 s which matched both the stagnant and flowing marks the two marks are related by the velocity head which amounts to 0 40 m i e a velocity of 2 80 m s the result is not very sensitive to coefficient n because the flow regime is close to critical grant 1997 fig 7e is an example of the way discharge is estimated throughout the lower river the 1d model is run for a set of discharges in abscissa to obtain a set of computed water elevations at the mark in ordinates then plotted in an elevation discharge graph where the computed line crosses with the horizontal line that states the recorded mark elevation we get the estimated discharge sensitivity to manning s n is explored by running the same model for different n values e g 0 040 and 0 060 in fig 7e the particular case of the 2nd mill where a pair of marks should be matched shows also that n 0 050 fits the marks better than any other values of n overall the sensitivity of the results of the models to manning s n is small throughout the river 7 2 flooding of town c and overtopping of bridge c the discharge estimate at the 2nd mill 775 m3 s was in line with the first three marks upstream at town c disregarding the discharge contribution of ephemeral river 3 fig 3 that was minor the other three marks including the one at the traffic sign were recorded on the road going to bridge c and proved that c was overtopped that night this fact besides being illuminated in a video snapshot by lightning was also made obvious by the large wood debris that was stuck on its deck the next morning fig 8a b overtopping makes the fitting of these marks very sensitive to the bridge consideration in the 1d model any 2d model seems less capable than hec ras for that purpose the arched bridge c had a single span of 11 5 m wide surprisingly small for the river after being widened by the flood though not bad for the river before this metamorphosis the flow over the road and bridge was more important than the flow through the span the former was considered a broad crested weir with a dimensionless discharge coefficient in the range 0 226 0 327 due to the wood debris jam ideally the coefficient of such a weir is 0 385 or with dimensions 1 7 m1 2 s 0 385 2 g g 9 81 m s2 regarding the arch and deck contraction expansion coefficients for arch bridges were applied martín vide and prió 2005 ineffective flow areas were also used near the bridge if the span had gotten rid of any obstruction at peak flow a flow in the range 650 760 m3 s would have reached the remaining three marks at town c those closest to the bridge with pressure flow in the upstream face and free flow in the downstream one fig 8c d the contribution of the flow through the span in this situation can be estimated with the sluice gate hydraulic equation for bridges hamill 1997 which comes out as 160 190 m3 s i e one fourth of the total in contrast if the span had been fully clogged with debris at peak flow 525 m3 s would have been enough to reach the marks in a regime of overtopping only let s keep the following conclusion as the flow at the 2nd mill is reliable it is likely that the bridge c span was free of debris at peak flow fig 8c taken the next morning suggests the same the flow at bridge c is even more complicated than what has been said so far the bridge is located just downstream of another waterfall in limestone fig 8c so that the bridge opening area is 30 m2 as seen from the upstream ground level but 120 m2 as seen from the downstream one fig 8d e moreover a wall on the right hand side used to access a building fig 8c encroached the flow further this building was literally bulldozed 7 3 the anomaly at bridge d bridge d very close downstream of bridge c at town c was also overtopped in this case there were no marks to prove the overtopping but there was clear evidence that a flood wave had swept its deck and railings that night fig 9a in fact this wave took a car with it as well as the lives of the two people inside the car had been waiting for the flood to recede in order to cross the river nevertheless bridge d withstood the flood the anomaly is that the same 1d model of the river at town c would not be able to predict a level so high as to overtop the bridge and sweep the road unless the flow peaked to 1200 m3 s fig 9b which is almost twice as much as the peak flow matching the set of six marks nearby in town c to explain this anomaly the hypothesis of a sudden release of a debris jam at bridge c was put forward to be investigated in section 8 with an unsteady 2d model this effort had to do with the ultimate objective of the research that a sudden release was more destructive than the flash flood itself domains of 1d and 2d models in the lowland river are drawn in fig 3 7 4 flooding of town g and clogging of the historical bridge f neighborhood f located on the left floodplain opposite the old town g on top of a hill was the most severely flooded town in the entire valley flood levels at many houses and businesses were 2 50 2 75 m above ground level some other houses which were more exposed to the high velocities were literally bulldozed a lot of coarse sand was found in the bed of the devastated area three bridges downstream of neighborhood f bridges f g h fig 3 were involved in the flooding problem a 1d model proves that the flow contraction at bridge h the farthest downstream of the three produced critical flow its total width of 35 m divided into three rectangular equal spans captured little wood debris some clear marks of stagnant water energy level on a building near the bridge allowed an accurate flow estimate of 700 m3 s with the 1d model at bridge h the historical four arched stone bridge f the closest to f of the three was heavily submerged except for its central section fig 10a its parapets and other appurtenances were damaged or lost moreover it became clogged by a lot of woody debris except for the two large central arches fig 10b where it was only partially clogged probably because of a lesser submergence at the center considering the clogged areas as blocked and using contraction expansion coefficients for arch bridges martín vide and prió 2005 the flooding marks in neighborhood f fit with a flow in the range of 640 790 m3 s this range includes within its limits the estimation of 700 m3 s at bridge h bridge g in turn and similarly to h was barely clogged by large wood debris thanks to the sacrifice of bridge f the 1d model proved that the clogging of bridge f worsened the flooding at f 8 hypothesis of a jam break producing a sudden release at bridge c the span of bridge c appeared clean the next morning fig 8c but at the same time much woody debris had crashed and piled up on its deck fig 8a as mentioned above this was the first surviving bridge in the river so it halted or obstructed the passage of drifted uprooted trees and bushes coming from 70 6 ha of highland e g fig 5 comparatively this was a larger load on c than the extra 57 4 ha with some 27 of forest on bridge f see table 2 which may have also captured debris not trapped at c bridge c s clean arch with wood debris all around c fig 8 suggests that the arch first clogged and then later collapsed broke thus producing a sudden water release a transient there is no direct evidence of this from witnesses except for the account of one riverine resident he endured 2 40 m of water covering his ground floor at the flood peak 19 50 20 05 but was then able to reenter the space safe and dry at 21 00 only 5 cm of mud on the floor suggesting the flood had suddenly receded contrary to that the hydrological model shows a slower recession e g one hour after the peak from 20 00 21 00 the flow had only halved the hypothesis of a sudden wood jam breakage at the peak flow is analyzed using a 2d unsteady model the information used to check this hypothesis is a the overtop at bridge d 2 fatalities fig 9a b a good flood mark on the wall of the 3rd mill and c the third failure of a bridge at e the latter was a bridge made of three beams which was washed away by the flow probably with the aid of debris impact and transported 170 m downstream to finally settle upside down in the channel fig 11 the slope there was 1 32 the model results are presented in fig 12 the domain boundaries were node 4 upstream and 270 m downstream of bridge e fig 3 the peak of the inflow hydrograph was set to 750 m3 s according to the above flow estimates at the 1st and 2nd mills and the first three marks at town c once this was set the hydrograph shape copied the result of the hydrologic model at town c node 4 the jam breaking was simulated in 2d by means of a breach progressing in depth and width to attain a breached area a m2 after a time t s campillo 2021 time t in the range 20 120 s did not make much difference in the routing of the unsteady flow downstream so t 60 s was selected area a was tested in the range of 50 120 m2 see fig 8d e for the actual span the moment of collapse was set at the peak of the inflow otherwise the unsteady peak flow is not high enough to match the three pieces of information above bridge decks are not included in the model manning coefficient in the channel is 0 050 as above results show the attenuation of the unsteady hydrograph in a rather short distance fig 12a to the point that the collapse at bridge c may have been hardly noticeable at towns f and g downstream of e contrarily the collapse makes a large difference in the fatal accident at bridge d 300 m downstream of c the transient flow there 1064 m3 s fig 12b most likely explains that overtopping a violent impact considering that the mean velocity was about 3 m s the flood mark at the 3rd mill was not predictable by the steady 1d model unless the flow peaked to 900 m3 s now with the higher unsteady peak 940 m3 s fig 12a the level is still 28 cm below the mark if a 120 m2 this difference should be accounted for by a fraction of the velocity head because the mill wall was not parallel to the flow regarding bridge e the strong impact on its deck can be explained by an unsteady flow if the flow had been steady it would have just grazed it fig 12c in conclusion the water marks recorded downstream of c could only be explained if the effect of a sudden release at bridge c was considered finally the three marks around bridge c posed the hardest question the peak inflow discharge of 750 m3 s supported by several estimates upstream is too high for these marks if the bridge is fully clogged at the time of collapse since a collapse before the peak much reduces the flow routing downstream at d the 3rd mill and e complicating the comparison of fig 12b c the clogging of c must have been partial allowing a certain seeping flow through but one that was less than 160 190 m3 s capacity in pressure flow without debris it is rather speculative to guess how much this through flow was but it must have been quite high to match the marks 9 the aftermath losses and perceptions of the flood six people died due to the flood aside from the car swept away at bridge d 2 fatalities a truck driver was dragged into the water along with his truck a bungalow in town h and a shack in town j were also drifted killing all three of their inhabitants other cars were also dragged e g fig 9a but those people were able to get out when the flood was rising very quickly the elderly couple living in the 2nd mill saved their lives by escaping at around 19 45 to the upper floor after the event 30 cm of mud covered everything on their ground floor the major destruction took place from 19 30 20 30 either caused by the drag of water or by the level rise due to the clogging of bridges especially c and f the clogging of c was worse than that of f due to its deadly consequences two bridges a b failed at town b one of them disappeared b fig 4 there was significant damage at town c a winery and a restaurant in the river channel accessed via a ramp the wall in fig 8c were bulldozed as were some premises near the river fortunately the restaurant was not open that night at town g the clogging by debris of bridge f 12th century caused overflow to the surrounding area f the severe damage caused to f will need historical restoration as mentioned houses close to the river channel at g were destroyed in total more than sixty houses and businesses were flooded with numerous direct and indirect losses water inside exceeded 1 5 m in many of them it reached 2 40 m at town c and 2 50 2 75 m at town f as mentioned town facilities such as sports halls sewer pipes and sewage treatment plants as well as ditches irrigation facilities rural roads and recreational areas were damaged water supply to towns b c and g had to be cut off the flood ravaged crops and caused the loss of livestock train tracks buckled at some points even causing a freight train to derail a first estimate of the damage to infrastructure excluding roads in the basin amounted to around 4 million euros plus 3 million euros to repair treatment plants towns g f and c with the most damage were paid more than 2 40 and 1 38 million euros respectively by ccs twenty five years prior to 2019 the 1994 flood had not been as severe as our flood in the upper part of the basin recovery actions began immediately on october 23rd local regional and state authorities agreed to remove debris and restore the damaged hydraulic infrastructure a few days later financial aid was approved to meet the costs of emergency and repair however storm gloria that hit the catalan coast in january 2020 scg followed by the lockdown due to the covid 19 pandemic slowed down and even stopped both the planned recovery measures and the effort to raise more funds citizens platforms such as flood of support helped the victims the study of the return of experience through citizen science buytaert et al 2014 was led by the university of barcelona and the museum of rural life at town c llasat et al 2021 among what participants drew from the flood experience the most valuable teaching was solidarity and cooperation in the face of adversity regarding more technical matters they were concerned by the design and maintenance clearance of bridges and rivers and by the risk of living in the floodplains they stressed the need to respect and adapt to nature managing riparian forests and recovering old practices pasture use of bank reeds 10 discussion the concentration of a heavy downpour in a small mediterranean mountainous basin resembles the case of the 1962 rubí flood that took more than 800 lives martín vide et al 1999 martín vide and llasat 2018 besides bridges being swept away by the flood the huge sediment load played an important role in that flood it also reminds us of the 2018 flood in mallorca which claimed 17 lives lorenzo lacruz et al 2019 amengual et al 2021 in the latter episode a peak discharge of about 300 m3 s was estimated for a basin of barely 23 km2 the role of the bridges and the paved riverbed across the town of sant llorenç resulted in a 7 m s wave velocity and widespread overflowing the approximate times of the peak s passage allow us to carry out a kinematic analysis of the wave in the francolí it traveled 6 8 km from the 1st mill to town c bridge c in 25 30 min and so the wave velocity was 3 8 4 5 m s the reliable hydraulic calculation at the 2nd mill within this reach fig 7 produced a water velocity of 2 80 m s at its peak this wave velocity vs water velocity is within the range 3 2 5 3 established by the klietz seddon law of flood routing as a kinematic wave in wide channels jain 2001 however after that stretch it continued to travel down another 6 1 km from bridge c to bridge f town f g in around 10 min therefore at a much higher wave velocity of 10 2 m s 36 6 km h the theory of open channel surges martín vide 1992 gives us a wave velocity in excess of the water velocity in the case of a sudden release such as the collapse of a wood debris jam per unit width this excess is v g y 2 y 1 y 1 y 2 2 1 2 where g 9 81 m s2 y 1 and y 2 are the water depths up and downstream of the surge which at bridge c were around 13 5 m and 5 5 m see fig 8d e it turns out to be an excess of 6 1 m s then this wave velocity added to the water velocity of 2 8 m s gets close to the surge velocity of 10 2 m s due to a sudden release therefore the acceleration of the flood in the last 6 1 km with respect to the upstream reach is plausible the same surge theory also supports the discharge increase this is simply v b y 1 y 2 per unit width where b 11 5 m is the span width it comes out 565 m3 s larger than the numerical result 1091 750 341 m3 s in fig 12 but of the same order of magnitude then the discharge increase from bridges c to f as well as the wave acceleration are plausible the actual wave attenuated witnesses spoke of a very quick level rise not of a surge or bore strictly speaking note that the surge theory is 1d used here per unit width not even 2d this discussion suggests that the wave produced by the collapse at c should have been noticeable at town f g contrary to the comment made in fig 12 station a may give us a clue to this point in the five minute lapse before being out of service the measured discharge climbed from 2 m3 s to 186 m3 s at a rate of 37 m3 s min so in 15 more minutes it may have reached 750 m3 s compare this with the rate of increase imposed to the model at the release 341 m3 s min and the same rate at bridge e as computed by the 2d model 20 m3 s min this result at e does not seem compatible with the data at station a since any wave should have further attenuated in the remaining 5 7 km from e to a either the release must have been more violent or the possibility of some numerical diffusion in the 2d numerical model producing too much attenuation can not be ruled out the model needs finite volumes of different sizes for the main channel and floodplains which may cause this numerical diffusion richtmyer and morton 1967 potter 1973 in general terms the damping of the hydrograph as seen in fig 12 is not contradictory to the lack of damping in flood routing over steep slopes jain 2001 because the volume of water involved here i e the small reservoir at the rear of bridge c is very small as in macchione and lombardo 2021 between the two bridges lost upstream of node 2 bridge b see dimensions in fig 4 in a 28 m wide valley became clogged by woody debris some pine trees are taller than its width e g fig 5 but it appeared not to have been overtopped floating debris at water level suggested a temporary reservoir upstream dam break flow theory jain 2001 a particular case of the surge theory provides a maximum discharge q b 27 g u 2 gy 1 3 where u is the velocity through the bridge bateman 1993 with u 0 full clogging y1 7 m and b 28 m it results in 480 m3 s the same equation can be applied to bridge c regarding bridge a it was a culvert in a very long road the result of introducing the flood marks on the road into a broad crested weir equation leads to results similar to those of bridge b the crucial point about these two bridges is whether their failure produced a wave going down to the 2nd mill and town c probably worsening the problem at bridge c even after accounting for a damping of the wave down the river as in fig 12 in favor of the wave hypothesis there is the large discrepancy between the hydrologic model and the hydraulic computation at the 2nd mill an extra discharge coming from the failure of bridge b would solve this discrepancy against the hypothesis of a surge type wave is the fact that the kinematic wave wave velocity 3 2 5 3 of water velocity coincides with the data regarding the time of passage at the 2nd mill we will probably never know whether there was a cascading failure of bridges table 3 compares our hydrologic and hydraulic results with the likely flood discharges according to the catalan water authority s plans at node 7 after the junction with tributary 1 total basin of 455 km2 we find an agreement between hydrology and hydraulic estimates that corresponds to a return period of less than 100 years the peak discharge at town i node 7 in 1994 after surveying flood marks and using 1d 2d models was 1100 m3 s roca et al 2009 larger than in 2019 from node 7 down to the river mouth the flood was worse in 1994 than in 2019 but just the opposite happened upstream of a the discrepancies between the peak discharge from hydrological and hydraulic analyses are very large upstream of node 2 this area of 41 9 km2 includes two small creeks with extreme specific discharges of 42 53 m3 s km2 to the north and 31 51 m3 s km2 close to town a fig 3 the rain gauge coverage there is less dense than in other sections extreme local rainfall may have passed unnoticed however cross validation of the reconstructed rainfall series at the four rain gauges closest to these two creeks has shown discrepancies in the total accumulations of less than 10 with no systematic bias to the observers the authors land had been literally washed by rainfall into these areas water had oozed from any field flowed through any furrow run down to any creek gulley or ravine the mudstone in the area must have played a role in this extreme runoff the contrast between the 2019 flood and the 500 year flood almost three times lower suggests poor space resolution in the plans upstream of node 1 27 6 km2 with no broken bridges involved the estimated discharge of 610 m3 s i e 23 m3 s km2 is as high as the discharge computed at station a 348 km2 transient discharges such as 1200 m3 s 1d or 1091 m3 s 2d fig 12 at bridge d are avoided in table 3 but were real so real as to explain the loss of two lives the flash flood in october 2019 is almost a geomorphic flood in the uplands in the sense of channel formation the extreme widening from 2 m to 15 35 m in the upland tributaries and from 5 m to 40 90 m in the valley reach taking with it soil agriculture brushwood pine trees and mature deciduous forest seems impossible to recover for decades the image of a bulldozer leveling the river with a huge blade growing in width from 15 m to 90 m going down the river is quite probably what happened in reality the geomorphic changes at the confluences especially at node 1 fig 4 deserves a detailed analysis which is out of the scope of this paper in the flood protection plans water authority has warned about paying special attention to the basins that meet the following conditions a a relief with a mountain range close to the sea able to enhance atmospheric processes much of the mediterranean coast of the iberian peninsula the pre coastal range in catalonia b a forest extended in the basin especially developed after the abandonment of agriculture and c towns with certain flooding risk in the river valley especially if they are served with roads and railways with small bridges upc 2020 bridge c in francolí river with only one 11 5 m wide span is the epitome of this concern 11 conclusions this case study has shown a flash flood with large wood debris able to clog at least two bridges we think we have proved beyond doubt that the sudden water release at one of them c after the collapse of its wood jam formed a surge responsible for the loss of two lives at a nearby bridge downstream d the second bridge f that became clogged farther downstream worsened the problem at a town which flooded up to 2 8 m above ground level in turn a bridge that broke farther upstream b may have worsened the flood but a cascading failure of bridges is uncertain the flash flood was almost a geomorphic flood able to widen the channel from 2 5 m to 35 90 m in this way it bulldozed the surrounding forest loading itself with a huge amount of trees and bushes which ended up at the bridges analysis and conclusions are based upon a

7633,study region northeastern united states neus study focus we investigate the potential impacts of climate change on precipitation streamflow and inland flooding in the neus during the mid 21st century dynamically downscaled climate projections from three global climate models for historical 1995 2004 and future 2045 2054 periods under business as usual scenarios were used to force the hydrologic model wrf hydro at 200 meter resolution and create ensemble hydrologic simulations additionally an extreme value model was developed to project the risks associated with low frequency hydrologic events new hydrological insights for the region results from four major watersheds indicate a significantly wetter regime in winter months and potential drier conditions during late spring to early summer discharges in fall are projected to decrease in the northern watersheds and increase toward the south extreme flow and water depths resulting from extreme inland flooding are projected to increase by 5 20 and 100 respectively the extent of the total flooded area is likely to be 20 greater by the mid century these increased risks can be attributed to i an approximate 25 increase in decadal mean and 40 increase in decadal extreme precipitation intensity ii up to 30 lower snow availability and 5 25 higher evapotranspiration throughout the year and iii a projected 5 increase in soil moisture in all seasons except summer furthermore rapid snow melting in winter will likely cause an earlier peak flow in the rivers graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrology flood streamflow extremes data availability the local scale inland flood data is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7784943 any additional data will be made available on request 1 introduction earth s climate is changing primarily due to the increasing amount of carbon dioxide co2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere observations indicate that human induced global warming reached approximately 1 c above pre historic levels in 2017 and is likely to reach 1 5 c above pre industrial levels by 2040 allen et al 2018 because the clausius clapeyron equation suggests about a 7 increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere per degree of warming trenberth 1999 allan and soden 2008 climate change is expected to significantly impact the future hydrologic cycle this has important implications for changes in precipitation allen and ingram 2002 groisman et al 2005 shaw et al 2011 pendergrass et al 2017 tropical storms and hurricanes seneviratne et al 2012

ecosystems aquatic habitats hydropower water quality and so on the northeastern united states neus has experienced noteworthy increases in extreme precipitation events over the past five decades melillo et al 2014 walsh et al 2014 parr and wang 2015a while the intensities of the most extreme precipitation events or the heaviest 1 of all daily events have increased in every region of the contiguous united states since the 1950s the maximum change in precipitation intensity of extreme events occurring in the neus reached 71 melillo et al 2014 the changing rainfall characteristics of the neus are expected to further influence other components of the hydrologic cycle in the future including streamflow soil moisture sm and evapotranspiration et having direct impacts on droughts and floods hayhoe et al 2007 wuebbles et al 2017 siddique et al 2021 horton et al 2014 bose et al 2017 several studies have investigated the potential future changes in some of these aspects mostly at different sub regions of the neus for example increased occurrences of flooding compared to historic flooding records have been identified collins 2009 armstrong et al 2014 demaria et al 2016a siddique et al 2020 an increase in annual et at the rate of around 3 cm per c of temperature increase with a consequent reduction of april may runoff in new england was documented in huntington et al 2009 marshall and randhir 2008 suggested a 12 22 decrease in runoff in the connecticut watershed depending on co2 emission scenarios because runoff depends upon snowmelt timings of discharges are also important in the neus hayhoe et al 2007 berton et al 2016 villarini 2016 and dhakal and palmer 2020 identified potential changes in the timings and seasonality of flood events hodgkins et al 2003 and kam and sheffield 2016 indicated higher winter discharges and earlier peak discharges in spring in a warmer climate parr et al 2015b projected an increase in sm during winter and spring due to precipitation increase and a decrease in autumn and summer due to increases in et up to 0 2 mm day in the connecticut watershed while most of the above mentioned studies investigated either historic records or individual river basins very few studies provide a region wide projection of future hydrological characteristics using detailed meteorological drivers developed from a high resolution dynamically downscaled dataset demaria et al 2016b investigated the effects of climate change on streamflow and seasonal snowpack over a large region covering the neus and the midwest they found positive trends in 3 day peak flows and negative trends in 7 day low flows along with statistically significant decreases in snow water equivalent swe i e depth of water that would result from the complete melting of the snowpack they also concluded that the snow cover might migrate northward in the future due to consistent warming in a recent study grogan et al 2020 also documented similar conclusions however lack of domain coverage or analysis of limited hydrologic characteristics demaria et al 2016a naz et al 2016 remains as hindrance to a comprehensive understanding of the future regional hydrologic changes in the neus in addition to the lack of large scale multi variable analyses changes in inland flooding in the context of climate change have also not been investigated in this region the extent of inland flooding and the amount of surface water depths resulting from extreme flood events are also likely to change in the future because they are directly linked to the changes in precipitation davenport et al 2021 wing et al 2022 however this has not been investigated yet perhaps due to the limited availability of observations as well as simulated flood elevation estimates wobus et al 2021 collins et al 2022 therefore precise future changes in spatiotemporal patterns of the key hydrologic properties e g runoff et sm swe and inland flooding at kilometer to meter scale are yet to be explored the weather research and forecasting wrf model and its hydrologic routing component wrf hydro are suitable for investigating such local scale changes because they ensure highly resolved climate forcing and detailed representation of heterogeneous topographical features however because the computational cost for large domains is high most studies have used it over a basin scale and focused on short term events in a recent study somos valenzuela and palmer 2018 used wrf hydro to calculate historical water budget tendencies over neus watersheds in our study we applied a modeling framework based on wrf and wrf hydro at a continental scale such that our modeling approach generated unique inland flooding water depth maps every hour at 200 meter resolution along with the conventional hydrologic modeling outputs such as streamflow swe sm and et the broader scientific question that motivated our research was the potential applicability of such a neighborhood scale hydrologic model at continental spatial and climate temporal scale leveraging recent advancements in high performance computing hpc to provide information on hydrologic extremes that are useful for decision makers our study is the first of its kind to estimate changes in the magnitudes and extent of extreme inland flooding in the mid 21st century at a resolution of 200 m over the entire neus 1380 1320 km2 in addition we developed stationary and non stationary extreme value analysis parameters over the neus to calculate flood return levels with uncertainty estimates for any given return period we also provided a comprehensive overview of other hydrologic changes over the entire neus to understand the changes in water balance and the potential drivers of the changes in streamflow and inland flooding our results also help reinforce some of the conclusions found in previous literature furthermore the methodologies and modeling framework developed in this study are being applied to other regions of the united states the main goals of this study are to i investigate the changes in the hydrologic conditions in terms of streamflow et sm and snowpack amount of the entire neus and validate with previous regional scale studies which used different model combinations ii quantify changes in inland flood magnitudes and extents in the near future and iii use generalized extreme value gev theory to predict risks and associated uncertainties of the low frequency events the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study region data and methods are discussed section 3 describes the results then a discussion of the results is documented in section 4 and finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 additional information is provided in supporting information si 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the neus is a region where strong evidence of increased extreme precipitation intensity has been observed in the 20th century brown et al 2010 guilbert et al 2015 zobel et al 2018a it is also one of the most developed areas in the world with more than 64 million people living there higher elevations in the neus are seen in the appalachian mountain region toward the south and lower elevations are in the coastal areas fig 1 temperatures in the region decrease to the north with distance from the coast and with elevation horton et al 2012 precipitation too tends to decrease to the north and further inland while coastal areas receive high mean annual precipitation of 115 130 cm some of the inland locations get more than 150 cm due to localized orographic rainfall especially in west virginia and new york in general the neus remains warm humid and wet in the summer and cold and snowy in the winter streams achieve peak flow in spring march may due to rainfall and snowmelt also making those months flood rich collins 2009 while the major land cover types are forests wetlands croplands and urban developed areas predominant

dynamical downscaling and regional climate model rcm outputs global climate models gcms are widely used tools to simulate the response of global climate to increasing greenhouse gas ghg concentrations in the future however most of the current gcms have horizontal grid spacing ranging from about 70 250 km taylor et al 2012 eyring et al 2016 and are often unable to reproduce climatic and weather features at regional to local scale 10 50 kilometers we used the wrf v3 3 1 model skamarock et al 2008 to dynamically downscale castro et al 2005 pal et al 2019 kotamarthi et al 2021 three sets of coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 gcms community climate system model 4 ccsm4 gent et al 2011 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory earth system model 2 gfdl esm2g donner et al 2011 and the hadley centre global environment model version 2 hadgem2 es jones et al 2011 these gcms were found suitable to represent the spread of climate sensitivity for the 30 gcms in the cmip5 experiment sherwood et al 2014 the corresponding downscaled products are referred to as ccsm wrf gfdl wrf and hadgem wrf hereafter in both ccsm wrf and gfdl wrf boundary conditions are bias corrected using reanalysis data and nudging techniques are applied to wrf runs wang and kotamarthi 2015 no bias correction or nudging was applied to the hadgem wrf the wrf domain covered most of north america with 12 km grid spacing a detailed description of the wrf model setup and rcm simulations can be found in zobel et al 2018a and pringle et al 2021 each rcm provides dynamically downscaled estimates of two decadal periods 1995 2004 historic hereafter and 2045 2054 future hereafter at 12 km resolution with 1 year spin up time for each period 1994 and 2044 which are excluded for analysis the future projections were conducted under rcp 8 5 assuming business as usual because it accurately represents current emissions out until mid century schwalm et al 2020 output from the wrf simulations at 3 hourly intervals were regridded to 4 km and used to force the hydrologic model wrf hydro the precipitation was bias corrected see section 2 3 before regridding 2 3 bias correction of precipitation all the wrf precipitation projections were bias corrected with hybridized quantile mapping technique which isolates extremes from the lower quantiles to identify and correct biases separately the extremes were determined based on the top 2 precipitation as points over threshold pot choosing the threshold as 98th percentile 95 96 97 and 99 percentile were also considered was a balance between having sufficient sample size in the pot series to reliably fit an extreme value distribution higher thresholds yield fewer pot data leading to higher variance in parameter estimates and ensuring that the pot series did indeed represent an extreme value distribution lower thresholds may include values that cannot be characterized by the extreme value distribution leading to bias in the fitted model the generalized pareto gp cumulative distribution function cdf identifies quantiles in the observed and modeled pots for the same reference period that are equivalent to those in the future projected pot the future projections were then adjusted by the ratio of the observed to the modeled reference pot as a scaling factor at each quantile with the following equation po t c pot fut f gp obs 1 f gp fut pot fut f gp hist 1 f gp fut pot fut where pot c is bias corrected future pot pot fut are the modeled future pot f gp fut is the gp cdf for the modeled future pot and f gp obs 1 and f gp hist 1 are the inverse gp cdfs for the observed and modeled reference pot respectively the lower 98 of precipitation as points under threshold put were split into four subsets by seasons and each was corrected similarly according to the equation put c put fut f emp obs 1 f emp fut put fut f emp hist 1 f emp fut put fut where put fut are the modeled future put for a given seasonal subset f emp fut is the empirical cdf for the modeled future put and f emp obs 1 and f emp hist 1 are the inverse empirical cdfs for the observed and modeled reference put respectively the put c are the corrected put precipitation for a given season the bias correction was explicitly performed based on the daily data the corrected daily precipitation was temporally downscaled to 3 hourly values using the same temporal distribution for each day projected by the model 2 4 wrf hydro modeling and calibration the bias corrected precipitation along with other wrf meteorological forcing specific humidity air temperature incoming shortwave radiation incoming longwave radiation surface pressure and near surface wind were used every 3 h to force the hydrologic model wrf hydro in standalone mode to create ensemble hydrologic model simulations wrf hydro 5 1 1 gochis et al 2020 pal et al 2021a is a physics based parallelized distributed hydrologic model it was set up using multiple grid structures in the basin such that the noah mp land surface model lsm niu et al 2011 pal et al 2021b operated at 4 km horizontal grid spacing with an additional representation of overland flow and channel routing on a 200 m grid aggregation factor of 20 to realistically represent the river network of the neus a 90 m digital elevation model dem was incorporated to create this routing grid using wrf hydro gis pre processing toolkit v5 1 1 our domain contained 6880 west east by 6580 north south grid cells surface flow saturated subsurface flow gridded channel routing and a conceptual baseflow pass through were active during the simulations the time steps for noah mp channel routing and terrain routing were 60 min 20 min and 10 s respectively six continuous decadal hydrologic simulations were conducted table 1 with a similar model set up except the climate forcing to identify the changes in hydrologic conditions due to climatic change projected by different gcms the historic simulations started on january 1 1995 and continued till december 31 2004 the future simulations started on january 1 2045 and continued until december 31 2054 all these simulations were warm started from similar initial conditions after six months of model spin up july 1994 december 1994 using north american land data assimilation system nldas2 xia et al 2012 forcing lsm outputs including et swe and sm were saved every 6 hour and routing outputs including streamflow and surface water depth were saved every hour multi model averages mma of the ensemble are frequently used in this study to demonstrate the results which helps to reduce the variability coming from the individual models usgs discharge data at the four major river locations fig 1 were used to calibrate and validate the performance of wrf hydro the stations on these major rivers were chosen based on the available data record for 1995 2004 and avoiding any flow with dam interference since this study focuses on hydrological extremes and associated risks simulating such events were given higher importance event based model calibration was performed for two major extreme rainfall events of 1995 one in winter jan15 18 and one in spring march 9 12 after the model spin up see fig s3 using parameter estimation tool pest following wang et al 2019 the calibration simulations were performed over 4 days with 120 parallel simulations to calibrate a total 22 model parameters table s1 on a hpc system the forcing used for calibration also came from nldas2 2 4 1 inland flooding in wrf hydro the lsm within wrf hydro calculates the fluxes of moisture and energy infiltration excess ponded water depth and soil moisture are subsequently disaggregated from the lsm grid here 4 km to the routing grid here 200 m using a time step weighted method gochis and chen 2003 and are passed to the overland and subsurface terrain routing modules gochis et al 2020 depth of surface head or ponded water on any grid cell is a combination of the local infiltration excess the amount of water flowing onto the grid cell from overland flow and exfiltration from groundwater flow and is saved as one of the hourly outputs in wrf hydro variable sfcheadsubrt after the execution of routing schemes these fine grid values are aggregated back to the native land surface model grid as sfcheadrt and used on the next iteration as sfcheadrt i j sfcheadsubrt irt jrt aggfactrt 2 where irt jrt are the grid cells within the native grid cell i j and aggrefactrt is the aggregation factor we can use the variable sfcheadsubrt unit mm as a proxy for inundation with nonzero values indicating wet land surfaces however the simulated depths might be slightly off from actual inundation at local scales partially because of the small size of the grid cells and the coarseness of the dem at that scale in addition wrf hydro does not explicitly represent inundation areas from overbank flow as water does not flow from any channel back to the terrain therefore we consider non channel overland flow or local ponding depth as inland flood depth in this study this type of inland flooding is often called pluvial flooding which happens when the ground is over saturated and the excess water cannot be absorbed 2 5 extreme value analysis and uncertainty quantification extreme value analysis eva is performed to estimate intensities of extreme hydroclimatic events from annual maximum series ams isolated from the historic and future simulations a general form of cumulative distribution function cdf of the gev distribution can be represented as f x μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ with parameters μ location σ scale and ξ shape for a stationary gev all parameters are considered constant where the distribution of extreme events is expected to change over time one or more parameters of the gev may be defined as time variant s in this study for a non stationary gev the location parameter is modeled as a first degree linear function of time for historical eva the stationary gev is used for the future scenario either the stationary or the non stationary gev is chosen via the log likelihood ratio test to account for numerical instabilities in the wrf hydro simulations while fitting the gev only points with sufficient data above a 0 3 mm 0 001 ft threshold are considered in the historic analysis sufficient data is defined as 8 years of annual maximums above the threshold in the combined historic and future analysis 16 years of data above the threshold is used to define data sufficiency each year included in the analysis was required to have at least two models with adequate data extreme inland flood and flow events are calculated at 2 5 10 25 and 50 year return periods by calculating the respective percentiles of the fitted distribution s cdf at each grid cell calculated gev return levels are often subjected to potential uncertainties due to small sample sizes to quantify the uncertainties of extreme climate events statistical bootstrapping is used to generate a pool of 500 augmented ams in each augmented ams annual maxima are randomly sampled from the ams isolated from the three rcms stationary and non stationary gev are fit to each ams and the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of 500 gev returns are used as lower median and upper bounds for extreme event estimates this method enables us to calculate realistic gev estimates comparable to longer records within the confidence interval nevertheless we found greater uncertainty spread for smaller sample sizes a proof of concept with sample precipitation data is shown in fig s4 3 results 3 1 validation of wrf and wrf hydro model the wrf simulations used in this study have been evaluated extensively wang and kotamarthi 2015 chang et al 2016 zobel et al 2017 2018a pringle et al 2021 here we evaluate the performance of wrf hydro when forced with wrf outputs and bias corrected downscaled precipitation estimates we compare the model simulated monthly streamflow at the major river locations and demonstrate that the hydrologic model represents the seasonality and magnitude of mean monthly flow well fig 2 the temporal correlation of mma and observed flow was found to be 0 92 0 89 0 88 and 0 89 in the connecticut hudson delaware and potomac rivers respectively however there are some overestimations for most months in all locations except some of the summer months for gfdl and hadgem this is likely due to the calibration of the model with respect to the high flow events which may tend to produce higher mean flow however since we use the same calibrated parameters for both historic and future scenarios the effect of such bias on the changes is expected to be minimal all the rivers achieve peak flow in march april and low flows in the summer jja connecticut river the longest river in new england has the highest discharge reaching up to mean monthly discharge of 1200 cubic meters per second cms in april 3 2 changes in precipitation fig 3 shows the changes in decadal mean precipitation and decadal extreme 98th percentile precipitation overall the projected changes in the decadal mean are smaller compared to the changes in the extremes the decadal mean precipitation changes fig 3a d are within 25 whereas changes in decadal extreme precipitation are likely to exceed 40 while all three models show similar magnitude in the changes of mean and maximum precipitation the location of these changes remains uncertain ccsm wrf and gfdl wrf fig 3a b project majorly positive changes in the decadal mean precipitation but hadgem wrf fig 3c predicts both negative and positive mean changes nonetheless profound changes in decadal extreme precipitation 98th percentile are likely to be positive future extreme precipitation is projected to increase by more than 50 in the southern neus by ccsm wrf parts of new york pennsylvania and maine by gfdl wrf and hadgem wrf fig 3e 3 g additionally gfdl wrf predicts similar large changes in massachusetts and connecticut as well fig 3f the ensemble mma estimate of extremes fig 3h reduces some of the high variability and predicts 40 increase in some regions of new york and pennsylvania in depth discussions on changes in extreme precipitation can be found in zobel et al 2018b here we focus on the effects of such precipitation changes on surface hydrology 3 3 changes in streamflow relative changes in monthly streamflow between the historic and future simulations are shown in fig 4 the left right column demonstrates the changes in mean extreme flow the relative changes for mean flow range between 20 and 60 in most months with decreases in the summer and late spring and increases in winter and early spring fall discharge is projected to increase in the southern watersheds delaware and potomac and decrease in the northern watersheds connecticut and hudson these results are consistent with previous studies parr et al 2015b siddique et al 2021 botero acosta et al 2022 indicating that the watersheds of the neus are moving toward a wetter regime particularly during the winter months along with a drier summer season it is likely that future increases in temperature fig s5 will allow the atmosphere to hold more moisture which will result in an increase in precipitation in most of the months of the year fig s6 snow also plays a critical role in this region as snowmelt contributes to the seasonal flow with higher temperatures less available snowpack see fig s7 and fig 8 and faster snowmelt will result in an increase in flow in early spring and decrease in flow in late spring consensus among the three models is found in the distributions of extreme flow 95th percentile as shown in the right column of fig 4 the distributions shift towards the right in the future indicating a higher mean intensity of extreme flows in the future the extreme flows in these rivers are mostly observed in winter and spring combined multi model mm black lines in the right column of fig 4 flows indicate the mean of the extreme flow is predicted to increase by 20 in the connecticut and hudson river figs 4b d 10 5 in the delaware fig 4f river and 5 1 in the potomac river fig 5 shows the return level of streamflow for different return periods based on the re sampled lower median and higher quantities of streamflow over each of the four rivers see section 2 5 overall the changes were prominent in the low frequency events such as the once every 50 year events fig 5 for example based on the resampled median quantities the 50 year flow magnitude increased from 6240 to 7030 cms in the connecticut river figs 5a e 5 040 5800 cms in the delaware river figs 5c g 2 900 to 4 250 cms in the hudson river figs 5d h and 6 750 to 7 520 cms in the potomac river fig 5b f the 5th and 95th quantiles of the uncertainty bounds were also plotted to incorporate the inter model spread some of the bi modality in the plots fig 5b g results from multiple models with differing underlying mechanics in a statistical bootstrap especially when model extremes demonstrate different shapes nonetheless we conclude that return levels of low frequency events will increase in the future and the changes in extreme precipitation over these watersheds are the main drivers for this table 2 demonstrates a complete picture of the percent changes in the risks associated with 3 4 changes in inland flooding this study highlights the capability of wrf hydro in simulating and projecting changes in inland pluvial flooding conditions over the neus in wrf hydro inland flooding can be assessed in terms of the extent and depth of surface water accumulation see section 2 4 we analyze combined multi model estimates instead of individual models using the resampling approach explained in section 2 5 the results indicate more inundation areas and increased intensity of extreme inland floods measured by millimeters of water in the neus by mid century fig 6 demonstrates the predicted changes in maximum flood depth in each season the highest changes are seen in summer jja and fall son likely due to the increases in extreme precipitation and tropical to extratropical cyclone activities over the atlantic coast in these months in the future garner et al 2021 gori et al 2022 regions in new york connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire may experience a change of 200 fig 6c d winter djf and spring mam changes range between 50 and 100 in the states of virginia new hampshire and maine according to the gev analysis the likelihood and flood severity of extreme low frequency flood is expected to increase fig 7 shows the map of 2 year a b and 50 year c d events for the historic and mid century periods water depth from high frequency flooding may increase from 60 mm 2 4 in to 100 mm 4 in in all states fig 7a b low frequency extreme events may cause accumulated water depths of 350 mm 1 15 ft in regions of pennsylvania and ohio that were not seen in the historic scenario predicted hotspots are in western vermont southern new york and connecticut fig 7c d in terms of spatial extent the total flooded area is projected to increase by 20 for all return periods fig 7e in general higher percent increases can be expected in the grid cells with higher water depth except 300 mm grid cells in the 2 year return period fig 7e this suggests that extreme inland flooding is likely to be widespread in the future compared to the historic scenario furthermore we were able to investigate the changes in inland flooding at a local scale or neighborhood level with the help of the modeling outputs at 200 m resolution fig 8 demonstrates some examples of changes near a few major cities of the neus philadelphia fig 8a b new york fig 8c d boston fig 8e f and washington d c fig 8g h in general lower flood intensity grids transparent dots are predicted to decrease and higher flood intensity grids blue and red dots are predicted to increase in number especially in the areas surrounding new york there was a significant increase in the number of flooded grids projected by gev analysis the estimates at 200 m resolution are available see data availability section for understanding flood risk at a local scale anywhere in the study domain however users should note that stormwater drainage systems anthropogenic land use change and compound flooding caused by additional storm surges in urban and coastal urban areas were not considered within the current modeling framework 3 5 changes in mean et sm and swe projected changes in precipitation and river flow are linked to the other hydrologic variables over the neus such as et sm and swe which are simulated by the lsm component of wrf hydro i e noah mp swe is projected to decrease in all the seasons and most of the regions of neus figs 9a 9d however part of mid atlantic region where minimal swe is simulated during son in the historic scenario is projected to experience significant percent increase in swe in the future fig 9d due to consistent warming in the neus fig s5 a larger portion of winter precipitation will likely fall as rainfall with decreased swe higher snowmelt in most of the parts of the neus especially in the watersheds of concern may lead to higher runoff in winter in the rivers of the neus peak flows generally occur during march through april when snowmelt is triggered by temperature increase earlier peak snowmelt will likely cause an earlier peak in river flow fig 4 fig s7 changes in sm can cause infiltration and surface runoff changes in general sm increases in djf and mam 9e f however we found a domain wide decrease in jja fig 9g and a decrease over the northern part in son fig 9h causing more infiltration and less surface runoff there this explains the decreases in summer flow in the rivers and decreases in spring flow in northern watersheds fig 4 the increases in sm in djf and mam fig 9e f is likely due to increased precipitation and snowmelt the range of mean sm change stays within 5 evapotranspiration over the neus is primarily energy limited vadeboncoeur et al 2018 xue and ullrich 2022 as temperature rises in the future fig s5 et is also expected to rise if moisture is available our simulations indicate an increase of et throughout all four seasons in the mid century fig 9i l with the highest increase in jja fig 9k future rises in temperature and precipitation cause a domain wide increase of et by 10 it is worth mentioning that the accuracy of et estimates in a land surface model depends on accurate land classification and et related parameter tuning pal et al 2021b in this study to attribute the changes to climate change only we did not modify any land related model parameters for the future projections 4 discussion assessing extreme precipitation and associated flood risks at regional to neighborhood scales in a warming atmosphere is necessary for decision making and developing mitigation strategies this study is first of its kind to simulate six decade long hydrologic simulations at 200 m resolution using 3 million cpu hours of supercomputing resources of argonne national laboratory total model outputs analyzed were 200 tb the high spatial resolution generates sufficiently detailed outcomes to inform local decisions while maintaining statistically robust outcomes needed for extreme value analysis more specifically we were able to use the output variable surface head from wrf hydro to investigate the changes in depths and extent of inland flooding in the future this variable which indicates the depth of ponded water has not been explored yet in the wrf hydro literature but we conclude that a properly calibrated model can provide realistic estimates of inland flooding this could be useful information for national water model product users for investigating local flooding in hydroclimate simulations or short term inundation modeling during tropical storms our results indicate that extreme precipitation is likely to increase more 40 than mean precipitation 25 potentially raising the risk of extreme inland flooding this is consistent with previous studies hayhoe et al 2008 zobel et al 2018b increases in mean temperature fig s5 likely cause such increases in mean precipitation in most of the months fig s6 in contrast changes in extreme precipitation are often related to changes in weather patterns tropical storms or changed atmospheric circulations temperature increase causes increases in et in all seasons because the neus is primarily energy limited these also impact other components of the water cycle for example swe decreases in all seasons due to substantial temperature increases sm increases in all seasons except summer decreases in sm may have implications for short term or long term droughts in the neus which need further investigation expected changes are seasonally varying for mean monthly flow in the rivers in djf more liquid rainfall and less snowfall increase the mean and extreme flow as well as the soil moisture and maximum inland flood depths in mam faster snowmelt causes earlier peak flow in the rivers but decreases the mean seasonal flow due to less available snowpack mean flow in summer months will likely decrease or increase depending on precipitation variability as such a decrease in precipitation in august fig s6 might cause the flow to decrease in the northern watersheds however southern watersheds acquire higher flow due to more rainfall similar changes are found in son where the northern and southern watersheds behave differently increases decreases in precipitation towards the south north causes increased decreased flow and soil moisture in southern northern rivers fig 4 in addition northern regions of the neus might experience a decrease in soil moisture which is consistent with the lower son mean flow there in the future the seasonal changes are summarized in fig 10 although we obtain a clear signal of changing hydrologic variables in winter and spring one way arrows spatiotemporal variability and mixed signals were found in summer and fall two way arrows indication of such future changes in seasonal flow was found in multiple papers when each of them investigated a single or few of the neus watersheds parr and wang 2015a dhakal and palmer 2020 siddique et al 2020 botero acosta et al 2022 nonetheless we provided a comprehensive regional overview in this study furthermore we found increases in annual extreme flows due to more water availability also demonstrated in stryker et al 2018 over the mad river watershed in vermont we further extended our analysis to investigate projected changes in inland flooding which is a novel insight provided by this study extreme inland pluvial flooding is projected to increase throughout the year especially in jja and son due to an increase in extreme precipitation likely related to intensified future storms gev estimates indicate a correlation between extreme precipitation risk and flow risk extreme inland flooding intensity and extent increase throughout the year especially in the months of jja and son specifically more areas of the neus are predicted to be affected by low frequency events in the future according to gev analysis total flooded area is projected to increase by 20 even the major cities and suburbs will be affected by low frequency floods of higher return levels we acknowledge that the results from this study may hold uncertainties inherent to future climate projections relevant to the chosen emission scenario rcp 8 5 atmospheric and hydrologic model structure and model parameters for example hydrologic model parameters were obtained through event based calibration during extreme events as this type of calibration technique was applied to ensure realistic model performance for extreme events the produced river flow and flood magnitude can be overestimated during high frequency low intensity events nonetheless we analyzed three different models to create ensemble projections and included uncertainty quantification in the final data set produced land use changes and human activities were not considered in this study and the changes in hydrologic variables are driven only by climatic changes although wang and stephenson 2018 concluded that climate variation is the primary driver of increasing runoff in the connecticut river basin using a budyko framework further research is necessary to obtain a comprehensive overview of the effects of land use change on the surface hydrology of the neus furthermore we analyzed two 10 year slices 1995 2004 and 2045 2054 which are 40 years apart to understand the changes between the historic and mid century at such timescales some of the changes could also be influenced by decadal variability griffiths and bradley 2007 huang et al 2021 however we considered a multi model analysis and perform bias correction of all dynamically downscaled precipitation to mitigate such effects moreover we performed additional end of century analysis 2085 2094 similar to zobel et al 2018b and compared with historic to confirm the robustness of the increasing precipitation change signal over the neus not shown drainage systems may play an important role to mitigate urban flooding and attenuate extreme flood depths which were not incorporated in the modeling framework 5 conclusions different agencies and industries are now considering climate change policies for adaptation and asset management purposes as extreme precipitation and flooding can pose significant risks to their infrastructures and networks can we apply a physics based reliable hydrologic model regionally at climate time scale leveraging hpc to provide useful information to them to investigate this we used regional models wrf and wrf hydro along with statistical techniques to quantify increases in hydrologic extremes and predict increased risks in the near future over the neus the results obtained from this study indicate a domain wide increase in decadal mean 20 25 and decadal extreme 40 precipitation in near future over the neus likely attributable to a higher temperature in mid century furthermore changes in the seasonality and monthly mean discharge in the major watersheds of the neus in near future are projected the magnitude and signal positive or negative of such changes depend on location of the watershed a 5 20 increase in extreme flow in the major rivers of the neus is projected in addition water depths resulting from extreme inland flooding may increase more than 100 in some regions due to higher temperature in the future up to 30 less snow will be available while 5 25 higher et is expected in the mid century a 5 increase in soil moisture is also projected in all seasons except summer neighborhood scale projections suggest that the major cities of the neus and the surrounding areas will likely be at higher flood risk the generated inland flood dataset is available for public use while keeping in mind the limitations of the applied modeling framework see section 4 our findings from this work are already being used by the decision makers of new york power authority and at t for asset management and adaptation strategies we will apply the ensemble regional climate modeling framework developed in this study over other geographical regions of the u s in the future furthermore the framework can be implemented in any global region and extended to incorporate hydraulic structures in urban areas application of a detailed stormwater hydraulic model leveraging the flood depth dataset extent and timing generated in this study to obtain stormwater drainage water surface profile and inundation in urban and coastal urban areas during extreme events remains a future work additionally this novel extensive dataset can also be used for the purpose of

7633,study region northeastern united states neus study focus we investigate the potential impacts of climate change on precipitation streamflow and inland flooding in the neus during the mid 21st century dynamically downscaled climate projections from three global climate models for historical 1995 2004 and future 2045 2054 periods under business as usual scenarios were used to force the hydrologic model wrf hydro at 200 meter resolution and create ensemble hydrologic simulations additionally an extreme value model was developed to project the risks associated with low frequency hydrologic events new hydrological insights for the region results from four major watersheds indicate a significantly wetter regime in winter months and potential drier conditions during late spring to early summer discharges in fall are projected to decrease in the northern watersheds and increase toward the south extreme flow and water depths resulting from extreme inland flooding are projected to increase by 5 20 and 100 respectively the extent of the total flooded area is likely to be 20 greater by the mid century these increased risks can be attributed to i an approximate 25 increase in decadal mean and 40 increase in decadal extreme precipitation intensity ii up to 30 lower snow availability and 5 25 higher evapotranspiration throughout the year and iii a projected 5 increase in soil moisture in all seasons except summer furthermore rapid snow melting in winter will likely cause an earlier peak flow in the rivers graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrology flood streamflow extremes data availability the local scale inland flood data is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7784943 any additional data will be made available on request 1 introduction earth s climate is changing primarily due to the increasing amount of carbon dioxide co2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere observations indicate that human induced global warming reached approximately 1 c above pre historic levels in 2017 and is likely to reach 1 5 c above pre industrial levels by 2040 allen et al 2018 because the clausius clapeyron equation suggests about a 7 increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere per degree of warming trenberth 1999 allan and soden 2008 climate change is expected to significantly impact the future hydrologic cycle this has important implications for changes in precipitation allen and ingram 2002 groisman et al 2005 shaw et al 2011 pendergrass et al 2017 tropical storms and hurricanes seneviratne et al 2012 droughts and floods tebaldi et al 2006 evaporation rates condon et al 2020 konapala et al 2020 snowpack amounts fyfe et al 2017 streamflow naz et al 2016 byun et al 2019 sea level rise yin et al 2009 kulp and strauss 2019 surface energy budget hu et al 2019 and water budget leta et al 2016 abesh et al 2022 furthermore these changes have cascading impacts on existing infrastructures freshwater ecosystems aquatic habitats hydropower water quality and so on the northeastern united states neus has experienced noteworthy increases in extreme precipitation events over the past five decades melillo et al 2014 walsh et al 2014 parr and wang 2015a while the intensities of the most extreme precipitation events or the heaviest 1 of all daily events have increased in every region of the contiguous united states since the 1950s the maximum change in precipitation intensity of extreme events occurring in the neus reached 71 melillo et al 2014 the changing rainfall characteristics of the neus are expected to further influence other components of the hydrologic cycle in the future including streamflow soil moisture sm and evapotranspiration et having direct impacts on droughts and floods hayhoe et al 2007 wuebbles et al 2017 siddique et al 2021 horton et al 2014 bose et al 2017 several studies have investigated the potential future changes in some of these aspects mostly at different sub regions of the neus for example increased occurrences of flooding compared to historic flooding records have been identified collins 2009 armstrong et al 2014 demaria et al 2016a siddique et al 2020 an increase in annual et at the rate of around 3 cm per c of temperature increase with a consequent reduction of april may runoff in new england was documented in huntington et al 2009 marshall and randhir 2008 suggested a 12 22 decrease in runoff in the connecticut watershed depending on co2 emission scenarios because runoff depends upon snowmelt timings of discharges are also important in the neus hayhoe et al 2007 berton et al 2016 villarini 2016 and dhakal and palmer 2020 identified potential changes in the timings and seasonality of flood events hodgkins et al 2003 and kam and sheffield 2016 indicated higher winter discharges and earlier peak discharges in spring in a warmer climate parr et al 2015b projected an increase in sm during winter and spring due to precipitation increase and a decrease in autumn and summer due to increases in et up to 0 2 mm day in the connecticut watershed while most of the above mentioned studies investigated either historic records or individual river basins very few studies provide a region wide projection of future hydrological characteristics using detailed meteorological drivers developed from a high resolution dynamically downscaled dataset demaria et al 2016b investigated the effects of climate change on streamflow and seasonal snowpack over a large region covering the neus and the midwest they found positive trends in 3 day peak flows and negative trends in 7 day low flows along with statistically significant decreases in snow water equivalent swe i e depth of water that would result from the complete melting of the snowpack they also concluded that the snow cover might migrate northward in the future due to consistent warming in a recent study grogan et al 2020 also documented similar conclusions however lack of domain coverage or analysis of limited hydrologic characteristics demaria et al 2016a naz et al 2016 remains as hindrance to a comprehensive understanding of the future regional hydrologic changes in the neus in addition to the lack of large scale multi variable analyses changes in inland flooding in the context of climate change have also not been investigated in this region the extent of inland flooding and the amount of surface water depths resulting from extreme flood events are also likely to change in the future because they are directly linked to the changes in precipitation davenport et al 2021 wing et al 2022 however this has not been investigated yet perhaps due to the limited availability of observations as well as simulated flood elevation estimates wobus et al 2021 collins et al 2022 therefore precise future changes in spatiotemporal patterns of the key hydrologic properties e g runoff et sm swe and inland flooding at kilometer to meter scale are yet to be explored the weather research and forecasting wrf model and its hydrologic routing component wrf hydro are suitable for investigating such local scale changes because they ensure highly resolved climate forcing and detailed representation of heterogeneous topographical features however because the computational cost for large domains is high most studies have used it over a basin scale and focused on short term events in a recent study somos valenzuela and palmer 2018 used wrf hydro to calculate historical water budget tendencies over neus watersheds in our study we applied a modeling framework based on wrf and wrf hydro at a continental scale such that our modeling approach generated unique inland flooding water depth maps every hour at 200 meter resolution along with the conventional hydrologic modeling outputs such as streamflow swe sm and et the broader scientific question that motivated our research was the potential applicability of such a neighborhood scale hydrologic model at continental spatial and climate temporal scale leveraging recent advancements in high performance computing hpc to provide information on hydrologic extremes that are useful for decision makers our study is the first of its kind to estimate changes in the magnitudes and extent of extreme inland flooding in the mid 21st century at a resolution of 200 m over the entire neus 1380 1320 km2 in addition we developed stationary and non stationary extreme value analysis parameters over the neus to calculate flood return levels with uncertainty estimates for any given return period we also provided a comprehensive overview of other hydrologic changes over the entire neus to understand the changes in water balance and the potential drivers of the changes in streamflow and inland flooding our results also help reinforce some of the conclusions found in previous literature furthermore the methodologies and modeling framework developed in this study are being applied to other regions of the united states the main goals of this study are to i investigate the changes in the hydrologic conditions in terms of streamflow et sm and snowpack amount of the entire neus and validate with previous regional scale studies which used different model combinations ii quantify changes in inland flood magnitudes and extents in the near future and iii use generalized extreme value gev theory to predict risks and associated uncertainties of the low frequency events the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study region data and methods are discussed section 3 describes the results then a discussion of the results is documented in section 4 and finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 additional information is provided in supporting information si 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the neus is a region where strong evidence of increased extreme precipitation intensity has been observed in the 20th century brown et al 2010 guilbert et al 2015 zobel et al 2018a it is also one of the most developed areas in the world with more than 64 million people living there higher elevations in the neus are seen in the appalachian mountain region toward the south and lower elevations are in the coastal areas fig 1 temperatures in the region decrease to the north with distance from the coast and with elevation horton et al 2012 precipitation too tends to decrease to the north and further inland while coastal areas receive high mean annual precipitation of 115 130 cm some of the inland locations get more than 150 cm due to localized orographic rainfall especially in west virginia and new york in general the neus remains warm humid and wet in the summer and cold and snowy in the winter streams achieve peak flow in spring march may due to rainfall and snowmelt also making those months flood rich collins 2009 while the major land cover types are forests wetlands croplands and urban developed areas predominant soil classes include silt loam and sandy loam in the neus figs s1 and s2 in the si this study encompasses the following states maine vermont new york new hampshire massachusetts rhode island

with natural flow on the major rivers based on complete data availability within the historic period gages with influences of dams were not considered due to the limited representation capability of reservoirs in the hydrologic model december to february djf march to may mam june to august jja and september to november son are considered winter spring summer and fall in the neus respectively 2 2 dynamical downscaling and regional climate model rcm outputs global climate models gcms are widely used tools to simulate the response of global climate to increasing greenhouse gas ghg concentrations in the future however most of the current gcms have horizontal grid spacing ranging from about 70 250 km taylor et al 2012 eyring et al 2016 and are often unable to reproduce climatic and weather features at regional to local scale 10 50 kilometers we used the wrf v3 3 1 model skamarock et al 2008 to dynamically downscale castro et al 2005 pal et al 2019 kotamarthi et al 2021 three sets of coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 gcms community climate system model 4 ccsm4 gent et al 2011 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory earth system model 2 gfdl esm2g donner et al 2011 and the hadley centre global environment model version 2 hadgem2 es jones et al 2011 these gcms were found suitable to represent the spread of climate sensitivity for the 30 gcms in the cmip5 experiment sherwood et al 2014 the corresponding downscaled products are referred to as ccsm wrf gfdl wrf and hadgem wrf hereafter in both ccsm wrf and gfdl wrf boundary conditions are bias corrected using reanalysis data and nudging techniques are applied to wrf runs wang and kotamarthi 2015 no bias correction or nudging was applied to the hadgem wrf the wrf domain covered most of north america with 12 km grid spacing a detailed description of the wrf model setup and rcm simulations can be found in zobel et al 2018a and pringle et al 2021 each rcm provides dynamically downscaled estimates of two decadal periods 1995 2004 historic hereafter and 2045 2054 future hereafter at 12 km resolution with 1 year spin up time for each period 1994 and 2044 which are excluded for analysis the future projections were conducted under rcp 8 5 assuming business as usual because it accurately represents current emissions out until mid century schwalm et al 2020 output from the wrf simulations at 3 hourly intervals were regridded to 4 km and used to force the hydrologic model wrf hydro the precipitation was bias corrected see section 2 3 before regridding 2 3 bias correction of precipitation all the wrf precipitation projections were bias corrected with hybridized quantile mapping technique which isolates extremes from the lower quantiles to identify and correct biases separately the extremes were determined based on the top 2 precipitation as points over threshold pot choosing the threshold as 98th percentile 95 96 97 and 99 percentile were also considered was a balance between having sufficient sample size in the pot series to reliably fit an extreme value distribution higher thresholds yield fewer pot data leading to higher variance in parameter estimates and ensuring that the pot series did indeed represent an extreme value distribution lower thresholds may include values that cannot be characterized by the extreme value distribution leading to bias in the fitted model the generalized pareto gp cumulative distribution function cdf identifies quantiles in the observed and modeled pots for the same reference period that are equivalent to those in the future projected pot the future projections were then adjusted by the ratio of the observed to the modeled reference pot as a scaling factor at each quantile with the following equation po t c pot fut f gp obs 1 f gp fut pot fut f gp hist 1 f gp fut pot fut where pot c is bias corrected future pot pot fut are the modeled future pot f gp fut is the gp cdf for the modeled future pot and f gp obs 1 and f gp hist 1 are the inverse gp cdfs for the observed and modeled reference pot respectively the lower 98 of precipitation as points under threshold put were split into four subsets by seasons and each was corrected similarly according to the equation put c put fut f emp obs 1 f emp fut put fut f emp hist 1 f emp fut put fut where put fut are the modeled future put for a given seasonal subset f emp fut is the empirical cdf for the modeled future put and f emp obs 1 and f emp hist 1 are the inverse empirical cdfs for the observed and modeled reference put respectively the put c are the corrected put precipitation for a given season the bias correction was explicitly performed based on the daily data the corrected daily precipitation was temporally downscaled to 3 hourly values using the same temporal distribution for each day projected by the model 2 4 wrf hydro modeling and calibration the bias corrected precipitation along with other wrf meteorological forcing specific humidity air temperature incoming shortwave radiation incoming longwave radiation surface pressure and near surface wind were used every 3 h to force the hydrologic model wrf hydro in standalone mode to create ensemble hydrologic model simulations wrf hydro 5 1 1 gochis et al 2020 pal et al 2021a is a physics based parallelized distributed hydrologic model it was set up using multiple grid structures in the basin such that the noah mp land surface model lsm niu et al 2011 pal et al 2021b operated at 4 km horizontal grid spacing with an additional representation of overland flow and channel routing on a 200 m grid aggregation factor of 20 to realistically represent the river network of the neus a 90 m digital elevation model dem was incorporated to create this routing grid using wrf hydro gis pre processing toolkit v5 1 1 our domain contained 6880 west east by 6580 north south grid cells surface flow saturated subsurface flow gridded channel routing and a conceptual baseflow pass through were active during the simulations the time steps for noah mp channel routing and terrain routing were 60 min 20 min and 10 s respectively six continuous decadal hydrologic simulations were conducted table 1 with a similar model set up except the climate forcing to identify the changes in hydrologic conditions due to climatic change projected by different gcms the historic simulations started on january 1 1995 and continued till december 31 2004 the future simulations started on january 1 2045 and continued until december 31 2054 all these simulations were warm started from similar initial conditions after six months of model spin up july 1994 december 1994 using north american land data assimilation system nldas2 xia et al 2012 forcing lsm outputs including et swe and sm were saved every 6 hour and routing outputs including streamflow and surface water depth were saved every hour multi model averages mma of the ensemble are frequently used in this study to demonstrate the results which helps to reduce the variability coming from the individual models usgs discharge data at the four major river locations fig 1 were used to calibrate and validate the performance of wrf hydro the stations on these major rivers were chosen based on the available data record for 1995 2004 and avoiding any flow with dam interference since this study focuses on hydrological extremes and associated risks simulating such events were given higher importance event based model calibration was performed for two major extreme rainfall events of 1995 one in winter jan15 18 and one in spring march 9 12 after the model spin up see fig s3 using parameter estimation tool pest following wang et al 2019 the calibration simulations were performed over 4 days with 120 parallel simulations to calibrate a total 22 model parameters table s1 on a hpc system the forcing used for calibration also came from nldas2 2 4 1 inland flooding in wrf hydro the lsm within wrf hydro calculates the fluxes of moisture and energy infiltration excess ponded water depth and soil moisture are subsequently disaggregated from the lsm grid here 4 km to the routing grid here 200 m using a time step weighted method gochis and chen 2003 and are passed to the overland and subsurface terrain routing modules gochis et al 2020 depth of surface head or ponded water on any grid cell is a combination of the local infiltration excess the amount of water flowing onto the grid cell from overland flow and exfiltration from groundwater flow and is saved as one of the hourly outputs in wrf hydro variable sfcheadsubrt after the execution of routing schemes these fine grid values are aggregated back to the native land surface model grid as sfcheadrt and used on the next iteration as sfcheadrt i j sfcheadsubrt irt jrt aggfactrt 2 where irt jrt are the grid cells within the native grid cell i j and aggrefactrt is the aggregation factor we can use the variable sfcheadsubrt unit mm as a proxy for inundation with nonzero values indicating wet land surfaces however the simulated depths might be slightly off from actual inundation at local scales partially because of the small size of the grid cells and the coarseness of the dem at that scale in addition wrf hydro does not explicitly represent inundation areas from overbank flow as water does not flow from any channel back to the terrain therefore we consider non channel overland flow or local ponding depth as inland flood depth in this study this type of inland flooding is often called pluvial flooding which happens when the ground is over saturated and the excess water cannot be absorbed 2 5 extreme value analysis and uncertainty quantification extreme value analysis eva is performed to estimate intensities of extreme hydroclimatic events from annual maximum series ams isolated from the historic and future simulations a general form of cumulative distribution function cdf of the gev distribution can be represented as f x μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ with parameters μ location σ scale and ξ shape for a stationary gev all parameters are considered constant where the distribution of extreme events is expected to change over time one or more parameters of the gev may be defined as time variant s in this study for a non stationary gev the location parameter is modeled as a first degree linear function of time for historical eva the stationary gev is used for the future scenario either the stationary or the non stationary gev is chosen via the log likelihood ratio test to account for numerical instabilities in the wrf hydro simulations while fitting the gev only points with sufficient data above a 0 3 mm 0 001 ft threshold are considered in the historic analysis sufficient data is defined as 8 years of annual maximums above the threshold in the combined historic and future analysis 16 years of data above the threshold is used to define data sufficiency each year included in the analysis was required to have at least two models with adequate data extreme inland flood and flow events are calculated at 2 5 10 25 and 50 year return periods by calculating the respective percentiles of the fitted distribution s cdf at each grid cell calculated gev return levels are often subjected to potential uncertainties due to small sample sizes to quantify the uncertainties of extreme climate events statistical bootstrapping is used to generate a pool of 500 augmented ams in each augmented ams annual maxima are randomly sampled from the ams isolated from the three rcms stationary and non stationary gev are fit to each ams and the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of 500 gev returns are used as lower median and upper bounds for extreme event estimates this method enables us to calculate realistic gev estimates comparable to longer records within the confidence interval nevertheless we found greater uncertainty spread for smaller sample sizes a proof of concept with sample precipitation data is shown in fig s4 3 results 3 1 validation of wrf and wrf hydro model the wrf simulations used in this study have been evaluated extensively wang and kotamarthi 2015 chang et al 2016 zobel et al 2017 2018a pringle et al 2021 here we evaluate the performance of wrf hydro when forced with wrf outputs and bias corrected downscaled precipitation estimates we compare the model simulated monthly streamflow at the major river locations and demonstrate that the hydrologic model represents the seasonality and magnitude of mean monthly flow well fig 2 the temporal correlation of mma and observed flow was found to be 0 92 0 89 0 88 and 0 89 in the connecticut hudson delaware and potomac rivers respectively however there are some overestimations for most months in all locations except some of the summer months for gfdl and hadgem this is likely due to the calibration of the model with respect to the high flow events which may tend to produce higher mean flow however since we use the same calibrated parameters for both historic and future scenarios the effect of such bias on the changes is expected to be minimal all the rivers achieve peak flow in march april and low flows in the summer jja connecticut river the longest river in new england has the highest discharge reaching up to mean monthly discharge of 1200 cubic meters per second cms in april 3 2 changes in precipitation fig 3 shows the changes in decadal mean precipitation and decadal extreme 98th percentile precipitation overall the projected changes in the decadal mean are smaller compared to the changes in the extremes the decadal mean precipitation changes fig 3a d are within 25 whereas changes in decadal extreme precipitation are likely to exceed 40 while all three models show similar magnitude in the changes of mean and maximum precipitation the location of these changes remains uncertain ccsm wrf and gfdl wrf fig 3a b project majorly positive changes in the decadal mean precipitation but hadgem wrf fig 3c predicts both negative and positive mean changes nonetheless profound changes in decadal extreme precipitation 98th percentile are likely to be positive future extreme precipitation is projected to increase by more than 50 in the southern neus by ccsm wrf parts of new york pennsylvania and maine by gfdl wrf and hadgem wrf fig 3e 3 g additionally gfdl wrf predicts similar large changes in massachusetts and connecticut as well fig 3f the ensemble mma estimate of extremes fig 3h reduces some of the high variability and predicts 40 increase in some regions of new york and pennsylvania in depth discussions on changes in extreme precipitation can be found in zobel et al 2018b here we focus on the effects of such precipitation changes on surface hydrology 3 3 changes in streamflow relative changes in monthly streamflow between the historic and future simulations are shown in fig 4 the left right column demonstrates the changes in mean extreme flow the relative changes for mean flow range between 20 and 60 in most months with decreases in the summer and late spring and increases in winter and early spring fall discharge is projected to increase in the southern watersheds delaware and potomac and decrease in the northern watersheds connecticut and hudson these results are consistent with previous studies parr et al 2015b siddique et al 2021 botero acosta et al 2022 indicating that the watersheds of the neus are moving toward a wetter regime particularly during the winter months along with a drier summer season it is likely that future increases in temperature fig s5 will allow the atmosphere to hold more moisture which will result in an increase in precipitation in most of the months of the year fig s6 snow also plays a critical role in this region as snowmelt contributes to the seasonal flow with higher temperatures less available snowpack see fig s7 and fig 8 and faster snowmelt will result in an increase in flow in early spring and decrease in flow in late spring consensus among the three models is found in the distributions of extreme flow 95th percentile as shown in the right column of fig 4 the distributions shift towards the right in the future indicating a higher mean intensity of extreme flows in the future the extreme flows in these rivers are mostly observed in winter and spring combined multi model mm black lines in the right column of fig 4 flows indicate the mean of the extreme flow is predicted to increase by 20 in the connecticut and hudson river figs 4b d 10 5 in the delaware fig 4f river and 5 1 in the potomac river fig 5 shows the return level of streamflow for different return periods based on the re sampled lower median and higher quantities of streamflow over each of the four rivers see section 2 5 overall the changes were prominent in the low frequency events such as the once every 50 year events fig 5 for example based on the resampled median quantities the 50 year flow magnitude increased from 6240 to 7030 cms in the connecticut river figs 5a e 5 040 5800 cms in the delaware river figs 5c g 2 900 to 4 250 cms in the hudson river figs 5d h and 6 750 to 7 520 cms in the potomac river fig 5b f the 5th and 95th quantiles of the uncertainty bounds were also plotted to incorporate the inter model spread some of the bi modality in the plots fig 5b g results from multiple models with differing underlying mechanics in a statistical bootstrap especially when model extremes demonstrate different shapes nonetheless we conclude that return levels of low frequency events will increase in the future and the changes in extreme precipitation over these watersheds are the main drivers for this table 2 demonstrates a complete picture of the percent changes in the risks associated with 3 4 changes in inland flooding this study highlights the capability of wrf hydro in simulating and projecting changes in inland pluvial flooding conditions over the neus in wrf hydro inland flooding can be assessed in terms of the extent and depth of surface water accumulation see section 2 4 we analyze combined multi model estimates instead of individual models using the resampling approach explained in section 2 5 the results indicate more inundation areas and increased intensity of extreme inland floods measured by millimeters of water in the neus by mid century fig 6 demonstrates the predicted changes in maximum flood depth in each season the highest changes are seen in summer jja and fall son likely due to the increases in extreme precipitation and tropical to extratropical cyclone activities over the atlantic coast in these months in the future garner et al 2021 gori et al 2022 regions in new york connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire may experience a change of 200 fig 6c d winter djf and spring mam changes range between 50 and 100 in the states of virginia new hampshire and maine according to the gev analysis the likelihood and flood severity of extreme low frequency flood is expected to increase fig 7 shows the map of 2 year a b and 50 year c d events for the historic and mid century periods water depth from high frequency flooding may increase from 60 mm 2 4 in to 100 mm 4 in in all states fig 7a b low frequency extreme events may cause accumulated water depths of 350 mm 1 15 ft in regions of pennsylvania and ohio that were not seen in the historic scenario predicted hotspots are in western vermont southern new york and connecticut fig 7c d in terms of spatial extent the total flooded area is projected to increase by 20 for all return periods fig 7e in general higher percent increases can be expected in the grid cells with higher water depth except 300 mm grid cells in the 2 year return period fig 7e this suggests that extreme inland flooding is likely to be widespread in the future compared to the historic scenario furthermore we were able to investigate the changes in inland flooding at a local scale or neighborhood level with the help of the modeling outputs at 200 m resolution fig 8 demonstrates some examples of changes near a few major cities of the neus philadelphia fig 8a b new york fig 8c d boston fig 8e f and washington d c fig 8g h in general lower flood intensity grids transparent dots are predicted to decrease and higher flood intensity grids blue and red dots are predicted to increase in number especially in the areas surrounding new york there was a significant increase in the number of flooded grids projected by gev analysis the estimates at 200 m resolution are available see data availability section for understanding flood risk at a local scale anywhere in the study domain however users should note that stormwater drainage systems anthropogenic land use change and compound flooding caused by additional storm surges in urban and coastal urban areas were not considered within the current modeling framework 3 5 changes in mean et sm and swe projected changes in precipitation and river flow are linked to the other hydrologic variables over the neus such as et sm and swe which are simulated by the lsm component of wrf hydro i e noah mp swe is projected to decrease in all the seasons and most of the regions of neus figs 9a 9d however part of mid atlantic region where minimal swe is simulated during son in the historic scenario is projected to experience significant percent increase in swe in the future fig 9d due to consistent warming in the neus fig s5 a larger portion of winter precipitation will likely fall as rainfall with decreased swe higher snowmelt in most of the parts of the neus especially in the watersheds of concern may lead to higher runoff in winter in the rivers of the neus peak flows generally occur during march through april when snowmelt is triggered by temperature increase earlier peak snowmelt will likely cause an earlier peak in river flow fig 4 fig s7 changes in sm can cause infiltration and surface runoff changes in general sm increases in djf and mam 9e f however we found a domain wide decrease in jja fig 9g and a decrease over the northern part in son fig 9h causing more infiltration and less surface runoff there this explains the decreases in summer flow in the rivers and decreases in spring flow in northern watersheds fig 4 the increases in sm in djf and mam fig 9e f is likely due to increased precipitation and snowmelt the range of mean sm change stays within 5 evapotranspiration over the neus is primarily energy limited vadeboncoeur et al 2018 xue and ullrich 2022 as temperature rises in the future fig s5 et is also expected to rise if moisture is available our simulations indicate an increase of et throughout all four seasons in the mid century fig 9i l with the highest increase in jja fig 9k future rises in temperature and precipitation cause a domain wide increase of et by 10 it is worth mentioning that the accuracy of et estimates in a land surface model depends on accurate land classification and et related parameter tuning pal et al 2021b in this study to attribute the changes to climate change only we did not modify any land related model parameters for the future projections 4 discussion assessing extreme precipitation and associated flood risks at regional to neighborhood scales in a warming atmosphere is necessary for decision making and developing mitigation strategies this study is first of its kind to simulate six decade long hydrologic simulations at 200 m resolution using 3 million cpu hours of supercomputing resources of argonne national laboratory total model outputs analyzed were 200 tb the high spatial resolution generates sufficiently detailed outcomes to inform local decisions while maintaining statistically robust outcomes needed for extreme value analysis more specifically we were able to use the output variable surface head from wrf hydro to investigate the changes in depths and extent of inland flooding in the future this variable which indicates the depth of ponded water has not been explored yet in the wrf hydro literature but we conclude that a properly calibrated model can provide realistic estimates of inland flooding this could be useful information for national water model product users for investigating local flooding in hydroclimate simulations or short term inundation modeling during tropical storms our results indicate that extreme precipitation is likely to increase more 40 than mean precipitation 25 potentially raising the risk of extreme inland flooding this is consistent with previous studies hayhoe et al 2008 zobel et al 2018b increases in mean temperature fig s5 likely cause such increases in mean precipitation in most of the months fig s6 in contrast changes in extreme precipitation are often related to changes in weather patterns tropical storms or changed atmospheric circulations temperature increase causes increases in et in all seasons because the neus is primarily energy limited these also impact other components of the water cycle for example swe decreases in all seasons due to substantial temperature increases sm increases in all seasons except summer decreases in sm may have implications for short term or long term droughts in the neus which need further investigation expected changes are seasonally varying for mean monthly flow in the rivers in djf more liquid rainfall and less snowfall increase the mean and extreme flow as well as the soil moisture and maximum inland flood depths in mam faster snowmelt causes earlier peak flow in the rivers but decreases the mean seasonal flow due to less available snowpack mean flow in summer months will likely decrease or increase depending on precipitation variability as such a decrease in precipitation in august fig s6 might cause the flow to decrease in the northern watersheds however southern watersheds acquire higher flow due to more rainfall similar changes are found in son where the northern and southern watersheds behave differently increases decreases in precipitation towards the south north causes increased decreased flow and soil moisture in southern northern rivers fig 4 in addition northern regions of the neus might experience a decrease in soil moisture which is consistent with the lower son mean flow there in the future the seasonal changes are summarized in fig 10 although we obtain a clear signal of changing hydrologic variables in winter and spring one way arrows spatiotemporal variability and mixed signals were found in summer and fall two way arrows indication of such future changes in seasonal flow was found in multiple papers when each of them investigated a single or few of the neus watersheds parr and wang 2015a dhakal and palmer 2020 siddique et al 2020 botero acosta et al 2022 nonetheless we provided a comprehensive regional overview in this study furthermore we found increases in annual extreme flows due to more water availability also demonstrated in stryker et al 2018 over the mad river watershed in vermont we further extended our analysis to investigate projected changes in inland flooding which is a novel insight provided by this study extreme inland pluvial flooding is projected to increase throughout the year especially in jja and son due to an increase in extreme precipitation likely related to intensified future storms gev estimates indicate a correlation between extreme precipitation risk and flow risk extreme inland flooding intensity and extent increase throughout the year especially in the months of jja and son specifically more areas of the neus are predicted to be affected by low frequency events in the future according to gev analysis total flooded area is projected to increase by 20 even the major cities and suburbs will be affected by low frequency floods of higher return levels we acknowledge that the results from this study may hold uncertainties inherent to future climate projections relevant to the chosen emission scenario rcp 8 5 atmospheric and hydrologic model structure and model parameters for example hydrologic model parameters were obtained through event based calibration during extreme events as this type of calibration technique was applied to ensure realistic model performance for extreme events the produced river flow and flood magnitude can be overestimated during high frequency low intensity events nonetheless we analyzed three different models to create ensemble projections and included uncertainty quantification in the final data set produced land use changes and human activities were not considered in this study and the changes in hydrologic variables are driven only by climatic changes although wang and stephenson 2018 concluded that climate variation is the primary driver of increasing runoff in the connecticut river basin using a budyko framework further research is necessary to obtain a comprehensive overview of the effects of land use change on the surface hydrology of the neus furthermore we analyzed two 10 year slices 1995 2004 and 2045 2054 which are 40 years apart to understand the changes between the historic and mid century at such timescales some of the changes could also be influenced by decadal variability griffiths and bradley 2007 huang et al 2021 however we considered a multi model analysis and perform bias correction of all dynamically downscaled precipitation to mitigate such effects moreover we performed additional end of century analysis 2085 2094 similar to zobel et al 2018b and compared with historic to confirm the robustness of the increasing precipitation change signal over the neus not shown drainage systems may play an important role to mitigate urban flooding and attenuate extreme flood depths which were not incorporated in the modeling framework 5 conclusions different agencies and industries are now considering climate change policies for adaptation and asset management purposes as extreme precipitation and flooding can pose significant risks to their infrastructures and networks can we apply a physics based reliable hydrologic model regionally at climate time scale leveraging hpc to provide useful information to them to investigate this we used regional models wrf and wrf hydro along with statistical techniques to quantify increases in hydrologic extremes and predict increased risks in the near future over the neus the results obtained from this study indicate a domain wide increase in decadal mean 20 25 and decadal extreme 40 precipitation in near future over the neus likely attributable to a higher temperature in mid century furthermore changes in the seasonality and monthly mean discharge in the major watersheds of the neus in near future are projected the magnitude and signal positive or negative of such changes depend on location of the watershed a 5 20 increase in extreme flow in the major rivers of the neus is projected in addition water depths resulting from extreme inland flooding may increase more than 100 in some regions due to higher temperature in the future up to 30 less snow will be available while 5 25 higher et is expected in the mid century a 5 increase in soil moisture is also projected in all seasons except summer neighborhood scale projections suggest that the major cities of the neus and the surrounding areas will likely be at higher flood risk the generated inland flood dataset is available for public use while keeping in mind the limitations of the applied modeling framework see section 4 our findings from this work are already being used by the decision makers of new york power authority and at t for asset management and adaptation strategies we will apply the ensemble regional climate modeling framework developed in this study over other geographical regions of the u s in the future furthermore the framework can be implemented in any global region and extended to incorporate hydraulic structures in urban areas application of a detailed stormwater hydraulic model leveraging the flood depth dataset extent and timing generated in this study to obtain stormwater drainage water surface profile and inundation in urban and coastal urban areas during extreme events remains a future work additionally this novel extensive dataset can also be used for the purpose of

2014 samaniego et al 2018 ovenden et al 2021 terrestrial ecosystems play a vital role in the global carbon water and energy cycle however the increasing intensity and frequency of droughts are affecting their behavior and recovery cartwright et al 2020 piao et al 2013 xi and yuan 2022 drought is usually defined as below normal water availability and generally classified according to the meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic perspective tallaksen et al 2004 wilhite and glantz 2019 van loon 2015 specifically hydrological drought is associated with a lack of water in the hydrological system such as rivers lakes and groundwater the propagation of meteorological drought over the terrestrial hydrological cycle determines the hydrological drought influenced by the cycle properties peters et al 2006 van lanen 2006 vidal et al 2010 the impacts of a drought are usually subjected to the severity and duration of the hydrological drought event which can be expressed by streamflow drought duration or deficit volume van loon 2015 meanwhile the life cycle of hydrological drought considers the development from the onset to the maximum intensity and the recovery is referred to as the maximum intensity to complete recovery wu et al 2020 during the last decades multiple drought events with high severity and duration resulted in extreme impacts on water resources such as low river discharge groundwater and reservoir levels this may lead to different implications for terrestrial ecosystems and human water consumption such as severe wildfires human migration hunger loss of life restriction of water use for irrigation and lack of domestic water van loon 2015 several examples of multi year drought evidenced these impacts such as the 2010 drought in brazil which presented a high impact on their terrestrial ecosystems human consumption problems in australia between 2002 and 2010 california usa between 2013 and 2014 sheng and xu 2019 williams et al 2015 and in europe between 2003 and 2006 van loon 2015 chile is experiencing a multi drought period with a large temporal and spatial extent its causes have been mostly attributed to anthropogenic climate change contrasting with la niña conditions that often accompanied past droughts garreaud et al 2020 boisier et al 2016 this period of water stress may lead to faster impacts on hydroclimate and terrestrial ecosystems by altering their composition structure and function zhang et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2013 2015 wu et al 2018 furthermore the extreme precipitation deficits up to 45 affected important natural resources including natural vegetation crops and water supply alvarez garreton et al 2020 garreaud et al 2017 garreaud et al 2017 showed that this precipitation deficit diminished the andean snow pack and resulted in amplified declines up to 90 of river flow reservoir volumes and groundwater levels along central chile decreases in water supply would be exacerbated within the multi year drought period as well alvarez garreton et al 2019 modeled the impacts on water supply due to afforestation with different combinations of native forest and forest plantations predicting a decrease in mean annual runoff in central south chile catchments also less water supply is shown in catchments with snow accumulation due to multi year drought increasing propagation alvarez garreton et al 2020 in natural areas the alteration of ecosystem metabolism due to water shortage can change the carbon sink dynamics triggering positive climate feedback leading to a reduction of carbon uptake or to a restoring function that recovers after the drought is ameliorated beer et al 2010 heimann and reichstein 2008 qie et al 2017 the impacts on forests due to droughts enhanced by climate change are producing negative effects on mediterranean sclerophyllous forests miranda et al 2020 and also affecting their future development with a decline projection of growth for the coming decades in forests dominated by endangered species matskovsky et al 2021 climate change is likely to affect atmospheric feedback and increase drought impacts on terrestrial ecosystems aghakouchak et al 2021 pugnaire et al 2019 the increase in the demand for evaporation and reductions in water availability will reduce the vegetation s resilience against future drought events vicente serrano et al 2013 gazol et al 2018 in the case of chile as a result of reductions in precipitation up to 30 under the most extreme scenario of ipcc rcp8 5 it is projected up to 40 reductions in runoff as well bozkurt et al 2017 valdés pineda et al 2016 in addition central chile had an important land cover change over the last 50 years showing a consistent decrease in the annual runoff with increments of forest plantations at the expense of natural vegetation which can influence the recovery of the catchment with high land cover change during this period lara et al 2012 drought monitoring and the analysis of the discharge vegetation and soil moisture recovery are important for policymakers and public use because the increasing impacts of climate change are connected with the hydrological cycle masson delmotte et al 2021 therefore innovative studies applying methods such as composite analysis ca can provide new insights and robust descriptions of drought events and drought recovery patterns xie et al 2017 the full drought recovery is defined by gessler et al 2020 as the capacity of ecosystems to return to the undisturbed ecosystem state and functioning following a drought disturbance in this regard studying the length and periodicity of droughts is crucial to understanding the post drought recovery time rt and for evaluating drought effects zhang et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 xi and yuan 2022 the post drought recovery times across various ecosystems are still controversial and not clear to the scientific community where a consensus on the understanding across global ecosystems and factors influencing post drought rt has not been reached yet a recent study from xi and yuan 2022 shows that ecosystem response represented by gross primary productivity on the onset and recovery stage has significant water stress from soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit during flash droughts this study also provides information to understand the implications of these impacts on the hydrological cycle in addition in previous studies the definition of drought events mostly stands on the meteorological drought index which is not necessarily associated with stress to the ecosystem vicente serrano et al 2013 this study intends to answer this relating the stress on the ecosystem by identifying hydrological drought and applying a composite analysis that includes key ecosystem variables as a novel approach in this study we aim to 1 quantify the length of the drought recovery in their extension and magnitude 2 identify spatial patterns related to drought recovery and 3 analyze and relate drought events to environmental factors such as hydrological properties 2 methods in this study we looked at the impact of climate and catchment properties on drought recovery in natural undisturbed catchments in chile to this end we used the extensive catchment data set for large sample studies specifically created for chile between the latitudes 17 8 and 55 0 s camels cl alvarez garreton et al 2018 the discharge from camels cl 1988 2020 for the hydrological drought identification was supplemented by vegetation productivity represented by the k ndvi index from modis 2000 2020 and soil moisture from esa cci sm 1991 2020 to determine drought termination d t and drought termination duration d t d the modis satellite retrievals at a daily time scale strengthened by the recently developed kernel ndvi kndvi were used to obtain the vegetation productivity justice et al 2002 this index is able to improve the representation of plant behavior compared with other vegetation indices the esa cci soil moisture products preimesberger et al 2021 provides also a robust data set for recovery analysis which uses active passive satellite retrievals at a daily scale with global coverage the spatial distribution of d t d t d was analyzed using a range of explanatory variables in combination with multiple linear regression mlr and random forest regression rfr to explain the observed spatial patterns in this section a description of the study area and the identification method of drought events is provided the acquisition of remote sensing data followed by the conceptual framework of the composite analysis and drought termination is defined finally the determination of explanatory variables is explained 2 1 study site the study site is located in the southwest of south america with a distinct geographical configuration and covers a latitudinal range of 4300 km from north to south fig 1 a total of 163 natural catchments out of 516 from camels cl were used for this study as dots in fig 1 the catchments selected as natural presented over 80 of the discharge observations between 1988 to 2020 without the presence of dams that alter discharge behavior alvarez garreton et al 2018 two mountain ranges are featured from west to east separated by the intermediate depression namely the coastal range 500 2 200 m a s l and the andes mountains 4000 7 000 m a s l fernández and gironás 2021 the precipitation regimes are strongly influenced by the andes barrier effect for atmospheric flows at high elevations particularly in the south of chile the elevation of the gauge stations ranged from 5 to 4 539 m a s l the study area is located along a climate gradient of particular importance and interest for conservation and food security due to its high levels of biodiversity life forms and agriculture diversity mittermeier et al 2004 the vegetation composition varies in latitude and longitude through this climate gradient at the lowest latitudes the presence of arid and semi arid shrub lands dominate changing to mediterranean forest to the south transitioning to a temperate forest and peat bogs towards the high latitudes luebert and pliscoff 2017 this variation is also influenced by longitude due to the andes and coastal mountain range where sun exposition and coast humidity play an important role in water availability and vegetation composition urrutia jalabert et al 2021 miranda et al 2020 the valleys are dominated by agricultural fields while over the mountains native forest and forest plantations are located conaf 2018 the climate and weather of this region are strongly influenced by the semi permanent subtropical anticyclone over the southeast pacific sep and the westerly wind regime at mid latitudes creating a north south precipitation gradient the climate ranges from hyper arid and semi arid in the north to the mediterranean with a marked dry period in spring summer in the center a temperate climate with mediterranean influences is present in the south the climate has been drying and warming up over the last decades across south central chile fernández and gironás 2021 urrutia jalabert et al 2021 luebert and pliscoff 2017 the precipitation volumes show a significant negative trend since 2010 with a reduction of 25 45 in annual precipitation garreaud et al 2020 this tendency is attributed to the pacific blob described by garreaud et al 2021 providing a decade long rainfall deficit in central chile accompanied by an above normal frequency of heat waves and more intense fire seasons gonzález et al 2018 2 2 remote sensing data 2 2 1 vegetation data the kernel ndvi kndvi index was obtained from the combined modis collection mcd43a4 version 6 nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function adjusted reflectance to assess vegetation productivity at a daily temporal resolution nasa 2022 the kndvi camps valls et al 2021 is closely related to the gross primary productivity gpp which is an important indicator of carbon fixation during photosynthesis this kernel ndvi method aims at overcoming the linear approach of the conventional ndvi normalized difference vegetation index by accounting for the non linear behavior of spectral indices with biomass or leaf area index the kndvi derives an automatic and pixel wise adaptive stretching keeping the relation between near infrared and red channel allowing it to cope with saturation effects complex phenological cycles and seasonal variations to deal with the mixed pixel problem and to propagate lower uncertainty than other indices camps valls et al 2021 the equation of the kndvi is given by 1 k n d v i t a n h n i r r e d 2 σ 2 where σ is a length scale parameter to be specified in each particular application and represents the sensitivity of the index to sparsely densely vegetated regions the modis products have 500 m resolution and are available since 2000 didan et al 2015 2 2 2 soil moisture data the combined cci soil moisture product v04 7 based on level 2 products for both passive and active retrievals was used to assess the first 10 cm of the water content of soil preimesberger et al 2021 esa 2021 the resolution of this product corresponds to 0 25 degrees at a daily time step the data was processed with a python algorithm to obtain the spatial average values for each catchment in the study area 2 3 composite analysis composite analysis ca was developed by chree 1913 1914 originally for space science however is widely used in different fields of earth science e g xie et al 2017 nicolai shaw et al 2017 also referred to as superposed epoch analysis and conditional sampling the ca is used to comprehend the relationship between different phenomena and hydrological variables ca involves collecting large numbers of cases of a given meteorological phenomenon in this case drought events these cases are composited together as a collection for each variable and catchment perhaps with different types of stratification using one or more covariates that are suspected to have an influence on the phenomenon the composite analysis then generally involves computing the composite mean and some other statistical measures such as the standard deviation and statistical significance the resulting structures which emerge can tell a powerful story about how that phenomenon is affected by the factors used in the composite stratification in the case of drought events a negative response to droughts from discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture is expected for a year after the event if drought events satisfy our selection criteria in the section definition of drought events the timing of those events is selected as key times and grouped per catchment later the drought response signal for each of the variables is isolated by calculating the average drought behavior in time over which the dt and dtd are determined due to the spatial resolution of vegetation 500 m and soil moisture 27 28 m the average composite analysis per catchment presents higher variability for soil moisture finally with the implementation of statistical tests we defined if there is a significant lagged connection between the variables this process enhances the signals as a result of the extraction of events while noises are averaged out xie et al 2017 the normalization was performed with the empirical cumulative distribution function of the data dekking et al 2005 the signal of variables with lower values is assessed better by accumulating the values close to zero due to the very steep curve of the function near zero that flattens out towards higher values this is especially relevant for low discharge vegetation and soil moisture measurements during drought periods the function provides the proportion of elements in the data set that are less than or equal to x 2 f n number of elements in the data set x n 2 4 definition of drought events a fixed threshold approach was used to define hydrological drought events with a fixed percentile threshold of 80 for the daily streamflow anomalies between 1988 to 2020 following wanders and wada 2015 and van loon et al 2016 these drought events were established for each catchment as key times in this study 2 5 determination of drought termination and drought termination duration drought termination can be characterized by its duration rate of recovery and seasonality nkemdirim and weber 1999 mo 2011 parry et al 2016 in this regard the ensemble mean from the ca was used to identify the drought development and drought termination fig 1 shows the location of the study area with the size of the catchments left a flow diagram of the ca analysis center and the drought termination in days right the first day of the drought termination corresponds to the day when a minimum peak is reached after the drought event starts di in fig 1 the drought ends when the signal exceeds the q80 threshold however the last day of the drought termination dt phase is found when the normalized threshold of 0 5 is reached this threshold is selected due to the normalization method dekking et al 2005 which performs normalization on sorted data and later brings data back in place based on the original index as defined by parry et al 2016 the drought termination duration dtd corresponds to the first recovery peak after crossing the normalized discharge threshold of 0 5 with a window of seven days these days after drought termination are added to the recovery because the basin needs more time to replenish flow deficit mo 2011 parry et al 2016 furthermore the window of seven days gives enough time to show a recovery peak and is based on half of the period used by ahmadi et al 2019a to classify discharge drought recovery us a group of drought events can provide an average termination phase in days between di and dt while the dtd is the number of days between di and dtd parry et al 2016 the differences between dt and dtd recovery rely on the identification method considering the recovery threshold at 0 5 the dt corresponds to the period between the minimum peak of the hydrological drought until it reaches the threshold in comparison dtd is the period between the lower peak after the drought starts and the first peak after the threshold the lower and upper peak is defined as a window of seven days where there is an increase and a reduction upper peak of the signal the presence or absence of snow between catchments was determined by the soil water equivalent from the camels data set 2 6 explanatory variables of dt and dtd the dt and dtd for all 163 catchments were used as input for geospatial analysis and pattern identification the impact estimation of different explanatory variables and catchment properties from the camels cl data on dt and dtd using lasso regression tibshirani 1996 and random forest regression breiman 2001 was performed lasso is good to reduce multi collinearity by putting penalties on jumping up and down regression coefficients meanwhile random forest regression is a meta estimator of the data set that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub samples and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over fitting kramer 2016 the random forest regression used 30 for training data random state zero and tree size length iteration over correlation was obtained other variables were included that are potentially linked with the drought recovery like the average groundwater depth from alvarez garreton et al 2018 the average rate of sun exposition from farr and kobrick 2000 and average soil moisture capacity from van beek and bierkens 2009 all variables listed in appendix a 5 the python package scikit learn was used to get the best explanatory variables and random forest for the discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture variables simpson et al 2021 the weight of each variable was calculated based on the residuals sum of squares from 3 r 2 1 u v where u is the residual sum of squares y t r u e y p r e d 2 it can be negative due to the arbitrarily worse of the model and 1 0 is the best possible score a filter with lasso regression was performed before rfr 3 results 3 1 composite analysis the response of each natural catchment after drought events between 1988 to 2020 is studied using a ca fig 2 shows the results of ca for the río cauquenes en el arrayán catchment 620 km 2 coordinates 72 30 s 36 6 w the upper figure shows the average response of discharge the central figure the kndvi as a proxy for vegetation productivity and the lower figure the soil moisture the quantiles in the graph present a skewed density distribution and correspond to the variable members between 10 90 25 75 and 40 60 including the recovery threshold 0 5 which is the end of the recovery for the dt the behavior of discharge and vegetation productivity in this catchment present a close relation in their recovery after drought events by comparing the average ca response black line in fig 2 where a fast recovery response is observed in the vegetation and a slightly slower one in the discharge the soil moisture presents a faster recovery and may be responsible for the faster recovery of the vegetation over the discharge 3 2 drought recovery patterns the spatial analysis was divided into four areas fig 1 due to catchments distribution in the study area north chile central chile north patagonia and south patagonia and bio climatic differences fig 3 3 2 1 drought termination the central chile area shows the main recognizable patterns visible from north to south illustrated by the changing colored circles in fig 3 and less clear east to west along a gradient of precipitation and temperature in general dominant patterns of discharge and soil moisture dt are visible from north to south in central chile meanwhile discharge and vegetation productivity are only recognizable from east to west fig 3 the discharge q fig 3 left shows a low to high recovery pattern from north to south and is increasing until latitude 35 s longer discharge recovery times were found at lower latitude catchments in environments with less precipitation higher temperatures and mostly shrublands while shorter discharge recovery times were found at higher latitudes in environments with higher precipitation lower temperatures and high vegetation cover after the latitude 35 s the recovery switch from high to low in addition the discharge present from east to west has high to low recovery times over 300 to under 200 days a pattern which is inverted at lower latitudes the recovery in north chile presents a high to low pattern towards the south the north patagonia region presents homogeneous recovery times similar to southcentral chile in south patagonia high to medium recovery times between 50 to 200 days are identified the vegetation shows low recovery in most of the locations without a clear pattern from north to south however from east to west a high to low recovery pattern in the north of central cl is recognized this pattern is inverted similarly after the latitude 35 s towards the south the north cl presents medium and high recovery times of vegetation without a clear distribution furthermore the recovery in north patagonia presents low recovery with similar behavior as southcentral chile similarly in south patagonia the recovery is also low the recovery of soil moisture presents a high to low pattern from north to south in central chile together with a high to low recovery pattern from east to west in the direction of southern latitudes that is inverted after latitude 35 s in north chile the recovery shows intermediate recovery times while in north patagonia a low recovery is present similar to south patagonia the scale is different between variables because their responses are different and to appreciate the spatial patterns is necessary a different scale for discharge vegetation and soil moisture 3 2 2 drought termination duration fig 4 shows the results of the dtd a dominant pattern for dtd in central chile is visible for discharge and soil moisture from north to south vegetation productivity shows a less distinctive pattern fig 4 the discharge in central chile as for dt presents an increased recovery time from north to south after drought events such a pattern is also visible from east to west with a low to high recovery pattern decreasing towards higher latitudes and shifting after approximately 35 s in north chile the discharge presents low to medium recovery times in north patagonia the recovery exhibits intermediate recovery times i e 150 200 days in contrast south patagonia does not show a clear pattern of recovery time the vegetation recovery time in central chile does not show a clear pattern from north to south however from east to west it exhibits a high to low recovery until a latitude of 35 s where the pattern is shifted towards the south in north chile the recovery is low with values close to 200 days in addition in northern patagonia the recovery is low while in south patagonia there is not a clear pattern with extremely high or low recovery the recovery of soil moisture presents a faster response compared with dt and also other variables particularly central cl show high to low recovery from north to south and a pattern from east to west with high to low recovery for all the region the north cl evidence a slow recovery of close to 2 months similar to north patagonia which is also slow with values over 2 months south patagonia presents high recovery in the north and low recovery in the south fig 4 3 3 snow accumulation and recovery the annual streamflow in rainfall fed catchments has a shorter hydrological memory mainly explained by the precipitation of the current year in the case of vegetation productivity the recovery is faster in catchments with the presence of snow and soil moisture recovery presents a slightly higher recovery in catchments without snow accumulation table 1 shows the average recovery of discharge vegetation and soil moisture 3 4 recovery and koppen climates the discharge recovery time showed longer values in semi arid climates the next mediterranean temperate and tundra climates our results show relatively similar recovery times for the rainy summer tundra climate of pluvial watersheds 100 days at south patagonia as found by wu et al 2020 reporting between 60 to 390 days over three unaltered flow rainfall driven basins under humid south asian subtropical monsoons the vegetation recovery showed faster average recovery in tundra climates 2 to 5 months followed by mediterranean 3 to 5 months temperate 3 to 5 months and semi arid 4 to 5 5 months jiao et al 2021 also found the recovery of canopy density 4 6 months and photosynthetically active radiation 2 to 3 months average times to return to normal status for arid semi arid semi humid and humid australian ecosystems the soil moisture recovery showed longer recovery in mediterranean environments 4 5 weeks followed by temperate 3 4 weeks and tundra 3 4 weeks meanwhile semi arid 2 3 weeks presented the faster recovery appendix 1 to 4 3 5 multiple linear regression the results of the mlr table 3 show significant values only for the discharge recovery of r 2 0 5 the vegetation productivity and soil moisture did not show significant skills to predict the dt and dtd the explanatory variables for discharge dt and dtd are associated with precipitation potential evapotranspiration and baseflow or by a combination of them with catchment characteristics related to storage and release e g land use 3 6 random forest regression the graphs presented in fig 5 show the most significant variables for the determination of dt and dtd of predicted versus observed values in general all the predictions have a high correlation coefficient due to the advantages of rfr for obtaining non linear relationships the downside of using decision trees is their tendency to overfit we used 30 of training data as they are highly sensitive to small changes in data the correlation coefficients for dt are given in table 3 and correspond to 0 92 0 84 and 0 89 with an rmse coefficient of 56 57 93 26 and 23 74 for discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture respectively the correlation coefficients for dtd correspond to 0 92 0 85 and 0 91 with an rmse coefficient of 57 03 56 50 and 19 73 for discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture respectively the model used 30 of the data for training and the main model features are included in the top right considering their contribution to the model and the correlation coefficient in the top left the most efficient rfr models used 200 200 and 500 trees for the prediction of discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture of dt meanwhile for the dtd the number of trees corresponding to 50 100 and 200 fig 5 top left parameters the variables with a higher contribution to the prediction of discharge dt and dtd are presented in fig 5 from a to d in the upper right corner the most important variables for the prediction of discharge recovery are linked with precipitation extreme discharge and snow accumulation meanwhile vegetation productivity can be explained with a combination of catchment characteristics catchment exposition ratio associated with storage and release shrub land cover and superficial water extraction for soil moisture the stream flow precipitation elasticity storage release characteristics crop and forest cover and water extraction ground and superficial are the main drivers the other variables from the camels cl data set correspond to variables that do not contribute to the model as much as the top ones 4 discussion 4 1 snow accumulation and recovery in general the recovery of discharge vegetation and soil moisture differs amongst catchments according to the presence or absence of snow particularly the discharge recovery shows a slower response on catchments with snow accumulation correspondingly alvarez garreton et al 2020 demonstrated that snow dominated catchments in chile possess a hydrological memory that results in strong correlations in stream flow generation over consecutive hydrological years the slow discharge recovery time of snow fed catchments demonstrates that the recovery is hampered by snowmelt infiltration into groundwater depleted levels reducing the river s stream flow in addition alvarez garreton et al 2020 demonstrated that catchments with snow accumulation long memory in chile exhibit a progressive reduction in stream flow generation during the same hydrological year as catchments without snow accumulation the multi year drought increased the drought propagation and increased differences between rainfall fed basins alvarez garreton et al 2020 it is possible that the recovery of long memory basins may have been affected during a multi year drought due to the increased frequency and intensity of hydrological drought during this period the flow of the stream would be reduced due to its dependence on rainfall but mostly due to the lack of snow accumulation in the corresponding year other factors that may affect the recovery of the stream flow include the allocation of water rights over the rivers and groundwater in the studied basins the replacement of native vegetation with water demanding species such as tree exotic plantations as well as the rapid shift in land use during the last few decades the consequent rise in water demand for agriculture irrigation and human consumption may also have an impact barría et al 2021b galleguillos et al 2021 the recovery of vegetation productivity which is faster in catchments with snow accumulation for dt but similar for dtd demonstrates a different behavior this faster recovery can be attributed to the physical properties of the soil profile such as porosity and resistance to penetration which are associated with the rooting depth of the vegetation which can reach 20 meters prosopis tamarugo and the impact timing of drought on the water table depth kannenberg et al 2019a decuyper et al 2016 in the maps presented by schwalm et al 2017 similar vegetation recovery for the same study area is visualized after analyzing three data sets of gross primary productivity gpp across diverse ecosystems worldwide in their findings drought recovery times were strongly associated with climate and carbon cycle dynamics on a global scale specifically in sparsely covered shrubland of central chile dominated with acacia caven in a mediterranean climate with a warm and dry season 7 8 months the ecosystem productivity was explained mostly by rainfall frequency with a significant time lag between plant growth and precipitation events sepúlveda et al 2018 this is supported by the global probability map of precipitation exceeding temperature as the main driver of tree growth for this region babst et al 2019 this can modulate the recovery since water availability acts as a crucial limit to global primary productivity and the hydrological drought is considered the starting point of the variability in the signal generating global concern also because hydrological drought is predicted to become more limiting globally zhou et al 2019 kannenberg et al 2020 a source of uncertainty for the prediction of vegetation recovery is evidenced by kannenberg et al 2019b where a decrease in tree growth can occur together with a quick recovery of gpp showing a large legacy effect vegetation recovery in literature in tree rings and growth away from the stem towards the canopy this is due to carbon allocation shifts linked with upregulated leaf level photosynthesis meaning that legacy effects in gpp are much smaller than those in tree rings the vegetation recovery of chile found in this study is also coherent to ahmadi et al 2019b for dtd between 3 4 months 90 120 days however they used water use efficiency wue which is a ratio between gross primary productivity gpp and potential evapotranspiration et the rise of wue helps the vegetation in arid regions to reduce water loss and maintain its growth due to a series of conservative water use strategies with this approach in dryer regions with high et is expected an increase in wue during drought episodes even though vegetation recovery is longer as demonstrated in this study particularly north central chile vicente serrano et al 2013 long et al 2013 overall we can conclude that the findings from this study are in line with other studies looking at vegetation recovery using different techniques the implications of faster recovery can imply that plants are more susceptible to future droughts and slower recovery to a controlled acclimation response optimizes survival in the long term gessler et al 2020 the soil moisture shows a slightly faster recovery in catchments with snow accumulation compared with rainfall fed recovery times between 3 4 weeks similar recovery times for the global snow free region of soil moisture were simulated with a land surface model assimilating satellite microwave brightness temperature and composite analysis of drought events by sawada 2018 even though their analysis did not include catchments with snow accumulation similar hydrological processes may explain similarities in the recovery the reductions in soil moisture after hydrological drought indicate the link with the start of agricultural drought leblanc et al 2009 in this sense the recovery of soil moisture is important for regulating vegetation growth and rainfall runoff relationships allowing the quick restoration of pre conditions for the recovery gibson et al 2020 suggesting that catchments may be buffered or less impacted by drought in high relief and well vegetated regions salazar et al 2016 potter et al 2015 4 2 climate zones and their influence on the recovery differences in recovery time between the various environmental conditions were also found within the studied natural catchments table 2 the köppen climate classification table a 4 was used to demonstrate the influence of seasonality precipitation and temperature based on the ecosystem properties and approximately three decades of data this study evidenced that most of the natural catchments in chile experienced an average recovery post drought with different timings for discharge table a 1 vegetation productivity table a 2 and soil moisture table a 3 the discharge recovery found by wu et al 2020 relates the importance of precipitation in the recovery of rivers in humid south asian subtropical monsoons with precipitation during the warm season consequently the faster discharge recovery occurs in catchments with climates that present higher rainfall regimes as temperate and tundra environments than in semi arid and mediterranean xi and yuan 2022 as stated previously the reduction of vegetation productivity starts after hydrological drought which is marked by the legacy effect before the recovery kannenberg et al 2020 wu et al 2018 stated that drought legacy effects on vegetation growth over the temperate northern hemisphere differ markedly between forests shrubs and grass across diverse bioclimatic conditions differences in drought legacy effects between impact plant functional groups to plant ecohydrological properties linked to traits can also play a role the gpp signal can also contribute to the variability in the identification of plant recovery such as the plant response mechanism to carbon allocation priority producing leaf abundance or photosynthesis instead of biomass growth in branches or stems kannenberg et al 2019b miranda et al 2020 evidenced that in the mediterranean chilean forest the local environmental conditions which provide higher soil moisture e g valley bottoms and forest composition enhanced forest resistance alleviation to drought moreover cartwright et al 2020 found that areas with low soil bulk density and high soil available water capacity presented a reduced drought sensitivity and high soil moisture recovery however the biome with faster soil moisture recovery corresponds to the semi arid which presents higher bulk density and low soil water capacity seguel et al 2013 the presence of higher mountains in this biome in the andes and coastal range with more valley bottoms and south exposition hills shade in the southern hemisphere provide good conditions to retain water due to low evaporation 4 3 drought recovery patterns spatio temporal recovery of river discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture is critical to investigate in regions without enough measurements and under increasing environmental pressure due to climate change and human activity as proven by this study collecting discharge data is important for understanding the processes in the catchment the method proposed in this study provides a comprehensive tool to assess regional drought vulnerability which is important for the effective basin scale management of water resources and ecosystems in central chile river discharge patterns exhibit a reduction in the recovery times from north to south this recovery pattern follows masiokas et al 2020 regional stream flow classification patterns for south america they estimated the north of central chile presented the lowest recovery times and the lowest discharge during the rainy season of rivers followed by an early summer single discharge peak that largely reflects the winter snow accumulation levels the recovery gradient from west to east is associated with the influence of winter orographic precipitation in the lower catchments between the coastal mountains and the valley which enhanced the recovery viale et al 2019 southern central chile shows an inverted pattern compared to the north a gradient of low recovery near the latitude of 35 s is found and this becomes slightly higher towards the south masiokas et al 2020 described this group of rivers as part of the lower andes smaller mountain range height with wetter conditions than the north in this region stream flows present a winter peak largely due to precipitation and in some cases a second spring peak due to snow melt the decreased recovery pattern from east to west is explained by the higher influence of precipitation reaching catchments located in the lower andes further than in the north and the addition of snowmelt discharge on the east garreaud et al 2020 the patterns in north patagonia are also described by masiokas et al 2020 as a single spring peak discharge due to snow melt with milder climatic conditions due to the low elevation of the andes and winter liquid precipitation the vegetation recovery spatio temporal patterns show longer recovery in densely vegetated areas of south central chile and faster recovery on semi arid shrublands of the high andes in central chile the maps developed by schwalm et al 2017 showed long recovery times in highly vegetated mountains of southern andes with values between 6 to 12 months too and recovery times of 3 to 6 months for the rest of the territory however the catchments placed in the arid and semi arid high andes of this study evidenced faster recovery 4 months between the 30 s to 35 s degrees and the rest of central chile presented values over 6 months dechant and moradkhani 2015 also found that semi arid vegetation recovers quickly in the upper colorado river basin due to loss of sensitivity to initial conditions of soil water storage after droughts in the mountainous northeastern region of the semi arid upper colorado river basin us contrary in their low lying arid southern and western regions the recovery was slow after drought events cartwright et al 2020 showed at a regional scale that ecosystems with a drier climate and lower biomass shrub steppe showed greater drought sensitivity greenness reduction relative to baseline soil moisture than conifer forests in the pacific northwest usa in their study drought sensitivity was generally greater in zones with high elevation drier climate and greater soil bulk density identifying variability in drought sensitivity within biomes and within ecosystems mediated by landscape topography climate and soil characteristics zhang et al 2021 found diverse post drought recovery trajectories for different biomes with forest ecosystems showing a longer recovery time compared with shrublands and grasslands jiao et al 2021 evidenced for australian ecosystems that forests and savanna required the longest recovery times for press drought 3 months but not extreme drought while grasslands were the slowest to recover for press drought 3 months extreme drought this may explain the differences between patterns of recovery in catchments close to each other with these characteristics in central chile and different vegetation compositions e g between 39 s and 38 s even though dechant and moradkhani 2015 reported that the vegetation drought recovery rate seems to be more related to specific locations than drought intensity this can suggest that intensity variation due to propagation is less relevant for vegetation recovery than the local characteristics of the site which are further evaluated using random forest regression where site exposition land use surface water rights and annual precipitation variation are the main relevant factors also most of the catchments of this region have experienced significant land cover change during the last hundred years lara et al 2012 shrub lands in northern chile have been transformed into avocado plantations over the last 10 years while native forest in central chile has been converted into productive plantations over the last 30 years native forest was converted into productive plantations furthermore deforestation of agricultural lands took place all over central chile in the last 100 years lara et al 2012 this adds a third component to plant recovery which is the physiological response of native and exotic species to droughts and their recovery time at the study site mediterranean species possess special adaptations to a drought that may influence the recovery as the storage of soluble carbohydrates during summer martínez vilalta et al 2016 however is not clear yet if this helps them to accelerate or extend the recovery as part of the legacy effects of drought impact studies carried by venegas gonzález et al 2018 matskovsky et al 2021 reported that the mediterranean endangered and endemic forest of nothofagus macrocarpa and austrocedrus chilensis in central chile presented an increased declination of radial growth in the last decades due to drought conditions the spatial distribution of soil moisture recovery presents patterns that may be related to discharge recovery dechant and moradkhani 2015 also demonstrated the difference between drought recovery time and rate of recovery since the drought recovery time is highly dependent on initial conditions of soil moisture and this value varies strongly temporally they reported that this variable is linked to the discharge recovery in terms of their geographical patterns in this sense soil moisture and discharge recovery presented an opposite gradient behavior in this study this is at a faster discharge recovery towards the south of central chile there is a slow soil moisture recovery the patterns can be also observed from east to west which tells that as rivers recover faster the soil moisture recovers slowly the reason for this pattern could be the preferential transport of water to the rivers when they are recovering and the consequent diminution of the soil moisture in the first 5 10 cm also surface run off with high rainfall intensity could be attributed to low infiltration in the first layers of soil improving only the discharge recovery woolhiser and goodrich 1988 molina et al 2007 4 4 random forest regression the predictors of dt and dtd fig 4 are connected to diverse hydrological processes with different contribution proportions to the model the processes linked with the discharge recovery model predictors are related to water provisions such as precipitation stream flow extremes and snow accumulation in this sense when a precipitation event begins it is also where and when drought starts the recovery with a lag until surface runoff reaches the outlet moreover the first rainy events after a dry period can provide extreme flows or even flash flows due to the effect of water repellency influenced by antecedent soil water content hydraulic conductivity and precipitation intensity cerda et al 1998 snow accumulation is particularly relevant for watersheds with high elevations and low elasticity of stream flow to precipitation and temperature changes in chile barrera et al 2020 also snow accounts for the storage of water provisioning water during dry periods and even in dry periods providing water to the stream flow and groundwater however in the short term higher snowmelt rates may help the recovery temporarily due to higher temperatures in chile garreaud et al 2020 in the long term this may induce snow drought due to early snow melt in combination with no recharge due to precipitation deficit van loon 2015 the vegetation recovery rfr model presents predictors that are connected to precipitation behavior together with water storage and release characteristics by the land cover shrub land cover the inclusion of the annual precipitation variation responds to the influence of el niño southern oscillation and the reduction of precipitation due to the southern blob in the last years garreaud et al 2021 the storage and release are mainly influenced by plants adaptation to efficient use of water martínez vilalta et al 2016 the influence of climate change on vegetation relocation distribution patterns batllori et al 2020 soil storage properties galleguillos et al 2021 and land cover change alvarez garreton et al 2019 the superficial water extraction as an explanatory variable relates the recovery with the private water rights system in chile which is not limited by catchments water provision capacity barría et al 2021b even though there is an extreme reduction in river stream flow due to the multi year drought during the last decade for many of them alvarez garreton et al 2020 the relevance of orographic precipitation across the coastal mountain range which is exacerbated in mesic locations is demonstrated by east exposition as a predictor cazorla et al 2022 viale et al 2019 the explanatory variables of the soil moisture recovery model such as superficial ground water extraction and land cover evidence that water management at a catchment scale is very relevant for this region barría et al 2021a in this regard the assessment of drought termination and resilience may improve planning and resource management at the catchment scale under future climate change droughts van loon et al 2016 at the moment the water rights market presents over allocation and may generate an even more extreme situation considering the weather predictions barría et al 2021b gibson et al 2020 climate change projections include precipitation reductions and higher temperatures that may increase evaporation and reduce soil moisture which will account for the increase in hydrological droughts wada et al 2013 similar projections show an increase in drought areas for europe up to 40 with a consequent exacerbation of soil moisture droughts samaniego et al 2018 5 conclusion this study investigated the impacts of multi year droughts in chile and analyzed for 163 catchments the drought duration and recovery time related to environmental conditions it demonstrates that the recovery of discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture after a hydrological drought can be explained by local catchment properties and characteristics the outcome of this study is a contribution to disentangling the connection of environmental conditions vegetation and soil moisture and discharge to assess the drought vulnerability of catchments the recovery analysis over different climate zones also contributes to the supply of quantitative thresholds to improve the modeling of ecosystem dynamics post drought snow accumulation influences the recovery of natural catchments compared to rain fed basins the decrease in discharge recovery due to snow melt infiltration into groundwater levels reduces the river s stream flow the vegetation recovery evidences faster recovery in watersheds with snow accumulation due to the constant water provision through the groundwater profile helping with water provision to species adapted to dry conditions and with deeper roots the soil moisture recovery presents higher recovery in basins with snow consequently due to the longer provision of water environments dominated by shrublands with less precipitation and higher temperatures present longer discharge recovery while in higher latitudes with increasing precipitation and lower temperatures the recovery times are shorter under higher vegetation cover the patterns of vegetation show longer recovery in densely vegetated areas of south central chile and faster recovery in semi arid shrublands of the high andes in central chile the spatial distribution of soil moisture recovery presents patterns that connect them with discharge recovery this might be explained by the preferential transport towards streams and the increasing surface run off due to high rainfall intensity with low infiltration of the first layers of soil the recovery of discharge is better explained by precipitation extreme discharge and snow accumulation meanwhile vegetation productivity by a combination of catchment characteristics catchment exposition ratio associated with storage and release shrub land cover and superficial water extraction the soil moisture main predictors correspond to stream flow precipitation elasticity storage release characteristics and ground superficial water extraction this study shows for the first time the discharge recovery for different environments at the catchment scale along with the recovery of vegetation productivity and soil moisture this is useful for the identification of drought vulnerability for managing water resources and ecosystems helping to predict drought recovery periods in

7634,study region the natural river basins of chile study focus drought effects on terrestrial ecosystems produce hydroclimatic stress with variable extensions particularly hydrological drought duration can provide a better understanding of recovery together with catchment characteristics and climatology this study focuses on the impacts of the multi year drought experienced in chile for more than a decade the recovery of relevant catchment variables to quantify the drought termination dt and drought termination duration dtd after the hydrological drought is presented a composite analysis of natural catchments using the camels cl data set discharge 1988 2020 k ndvi 2000 2020 and soil moisture 1991 2020 provides the average response of the recovery after severe droughts new hydrological insights for the region this study demonstrates that local catchment properties can explain the recovery of studied variables after a hydrological drought explanatory variables from camels cl to derive the dt using random forest regression rfr were used with a strong correlation of 0 92 0 84 and 0 89 for discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture respectively the discharge patterns show longer recovery over environments dominated by shrublands with less precipitation and higher temperatures in central chile while higher latitudes with higher vegetation cover increasing precipitation and lower temperatures present shorter recovery times the vegetation productivity shows longer recovery over highly vegetated mountains in central chile the soil moisture recovery spatial distribution presented patterns that connect them with the discharge recovery this work enables the identification of drought vulnerability which is valuable for managing water resources and ecosystems and is helping to predict drought recovery periods in regions with a lack of observations graphical abstract keywords camels cl data set composite analysis random forest regression discharge vegetation soil moisture data availability camels cl cci soil moisture and modis are open source data sets 1 introduction drought causes hydroclimatic stress on terrestrial ecosystems and its impacts are expected to increase due to changes in precipitation patterns and rising temperatures related to climate change wanders and wada 2015 van loon et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2014 samaniego et al 2018 ovenden et al 2021 terrestrial ecosystems play a vital role in the global carbon water and energy cycle however the increasing intensity and frequency of droughts are affecting their behavior and recovery cartwright et al 2020 piao et al 2013 xi and yuan 2022 drought is usually defined as below normal water availability and generally classified according to the meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic perspective tallaksen et al 2004 wilhite and glantz 2019 van loon 2015 specifically hydrological drought is associated with a lack of water in the hydrological system such as rivers lakes and groundwater the propagation of meteorological drought over the terrestrial hydrological cycle determines the hydrological drought influenced by the cycle properties peters et al 2006 van lanen 2006 vidal et al 2010 the impacts of a drought are usually subjected to the severity and duration of the hydrological drought event which can be expressed by streamflow drought duration or deficit volume van loon 2015 meanwhile the life cycle of hydrological drought considers the development from the onset to the maximum intensity and the recovery is referred to as the maximum intensity to complete recovery wu et al 2020 during the last decades multiple drought events with high severity and duration resulted in extreme impacts on water resources such as low river discharge groundwater and reservoir levels this may lead to different implications for terrestrial ecosystems and human water consumption such as severe wildfires human migration hunger loss of life restriction of water use for irrigation and lack of domestic water van loon 2015 several examples of multi year drought evidenced these impacts such as the 2010 drought in brazil which presented a high impact on their terrestrial ecosystems human consumption problems in australia between 2002 and 2010 california usa between 2013 and 2014 sheng and xu 2019 williams et al 2015 and in europe between 2003 and 2006 van loon 2015 chile is experiencing a multi drought period with a large temporal and spatial extent its causes have been mostly attributed to anthropogenic climate change contrasting with la niña conditions that often accompanied past droughts garreaud et al 2020 boisier et al 2016 this period of water stress may lead to faster impacts on hydroclimate and terrestrial ecosystems by altering their composition structure and function zhang et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2013 2015 wu et al 2018 furthermore the extreme precipitation deficits up to 45 affected important natural resources including natural vegetation crops and water supply alvarez garreton et al 2020 garreaud et al 2017 garreaud et al 2017 showed that this precipitation deficit diminished the andean snow pack and resulted in amplified declines up to 90 of river flow reservoir volumes and groundwater levels along central chile decreases in water supply would be exacerbated within the multi year drought period as well alvarez garreton et al 2019 modeled the impacts on water supply due to afforestation with different combinations of native forest and forest plantations predicting a decrease in mean annual runoff in central south chile catchments also less water supply is shown in catchments with snow accumulation due to multi year drought increasing propagation alvarez garreton et al 2020 in natural areas the alteration of ecosystem metabolism due to water shortage can change the carbon sink dynamics triggering positive climate feedback leading to a reduction of carbon uptake or to a restoring function that recovers after the drought is ameliorated beer et al 2010 heimann and reichstein 2008 qie et al 2017 the impacts on forests due to droughts enhanced by climate change are producing negative effects on mediterranean sclerophyllous forests miranda et al 2020 and also affecting their future development with a decline projection of growth for the coming decades in forests dominated by endangered species matskovsky et al 2021 climate change is likely to affect atmospheric feedback and increase drought impacts on terrestrial ecosystems aghakouchak et al 2021 pugnaire et al 2019 the increase in the demand for evaporation and reductions in water availability will reduce the vegetation s resilience against future drought events vicente serrano et al 2013 gazol et al 2018 in the case of chile as a result of reductions in precipitation up to 30 under the most extreme scenario of ipcc rcp8 5 it is projected up to 40 reductions in runoff as well bozkurt et al 2017 valdés pineda et al 2016 in addition central chile had an important land cover change over the last 50 years showing a consistent decrease in the annual runoff with increments of forest plantations at the expense of natural vegetation which can influence the recovery of the catchment with high land cover change during this period lara et al 2012 drought monitoring and the analysis of the discharge vegetation and soil moisture recovery are important for policymakers and public use because the increasing impacts of climate change are connected with the hydrological cycle masson delmotte et al 2021 therefore innovative studies applying methods such as composite analysis ca can provide new insights and robust descriptions of drought events and drought recovery patterns xie et al 2017 the full drought recovery is defined by gessler et al 2020 as the capacity of ecosystems to return to the undisturbed ecosystem state and functioning following a drought disturbance in this regard studying the length and periodicity of droughts is crucial to understanding the post drought recovery time rt and for evaluating drought effects zhang et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 xi and yuan 2022 the post drought recovery times across various ecosystems are still controversial and not clear to the scientific community where a consensus on the understanding across global ecosystems and factors influencing post drought rt has not been reached yet a recent study from xi and yuan 2022 shows that ecosystem response represented by gross primary productivity on the onset and recovery stage has significant water stress from soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit during flash droughts this study also provides information to understand the implications of these impacts on the hydrological cycle in addition in previous studies the definition of drought events mostly stands on the meteorological drought index which is not necessarily associated with stress to the ecosystem vicente serrano et al 2013 this study intends to answer this relating the stress on the ecosystem by identifying hydrological drought and applying a composite analysis that includes key ecosystem variables as a novel approach in this study we aim to 1 quantify the length of the drought recovery in their extension and magnitude 2 identify spatial patterns related to drought recovery and 3 analyze and relate drought events to environmental factors such as hydrological properties 2 methods in this study we looked at the impact of climate and catchment properties on drought recovery in natural undisturbed catchments in chile to this end we used the extensive catchment data set for large sample studies specifically created for chile between the latitudes 17 8 and 55 0 s camels cl alvarez garreton et al 2018 the discharge from camels cl 1988 2020 for the hydrological drought identification was supplemented by vegetation productivity represented by the k ndvi index from modis 2000 2020 and soil moisture from esa cci sm 1991 2020 to determine drought termination d t and drought termination duration d t d the modis satellite retrievals at a daily time scale strengthened by the recently developed kernel ndvi kndvi were used to obtain the vegetation productivity justice et al 2002 this index is able to improve the representation of plant behavior compared with other vegetation indices the esa cci soil moisture products preimesberger et al 2021 provides also a robust data set for recovery analysis which uses active passive satellite retrievals at a daily scale with global coverage the spatial distribution of d t d t d was analyzed using a range of explanatory variables in combination with multiple linear regression mlr and random forest regression rfr to explain the observed spatial patterns in this section a description of the study area and the identification method of drought events is provided the acquisition of remote sensing data followed by the conceptual framework of the composite analysis and drought termination is defined finally the determination of explanatory variables is explained 2 1 study site the study site is located in the southwest of south america with a distinct geographical configuration and covers a latitudinal range of 4300 km from north to south fig 1 a total of 163 natural catchments out of 516 from camels cl were used for this study as dots in fig 1 the catchments selected as natural presented over 80 of the discharge observations between 1988 to 2020 without the presence of dams that alter discharge behavior alvarez garreton et al 2018 two mountain ranges are featured from west to east separated by the intermediate depression namely the coastal range 500 2 200 m a s l and the andes mountains 4000 7 000 m a s l fernández and gironás 2021 the precipitation regimes are strongly influenced by the andes barrier effect for atmospheric flows at high elevations particularly in the south of chile the elevation of the gauge stations ranged from 5 to 4 539 m a s l the study area is located along a climate gradient of particular importance and interest for conservation and food security due to its high levels of biodiversity life forms and agriculture diversity mittermeier et al 2004 the vegetation composition varies in latitude and longitude through this climate gradient at the lowest latitudes the presence of arid and semi arid shrub lands dominate changing to mediterranean forest to the south transitioning to a temperate forest and peat bogs towards the high latitudes luebert and pliscoff 2017 this variation is also influenced by longitude due to the andes and coastal mountain range where sun exposition and coast humidity play an important role in water availability and vegetation composition urrutia jalabert et al 2021 miranda et al 2020 the valleys are dominated by agricultural fields while over the mountains native forest and forest plantations are located conaf 2018 the climate and weather of this region are strongly influenced by the semi permanent subtropical anticyclone over the southeast pacific sep and the westerly wind regime at mid latitudes creating a north south precipitation gradient the climate ranges from hyper arid and semi arid in the north to the mediterranean with a marked dry period in spring summer in the center a temperate climate with mediterranean influences is present in the south the climate has been drying and warming up over the last decades across south central chile fernández and gironás 2021 urrutia jalabert et al 2021 luebert and pliscoff 2017 the precipitation volumes show a significant negative trend since 2010 with a reduction of 25 45 in annual precipitation garreaud et al 2020 this tendency is attributed to the pacific blob described by garreaud et al 2021 providing a decade long rainfall deficit in central chile accompanied by an above normal frequency of heat waves and more intense fire seasons gonzález et al 2018 2 2 remote sensing data 2 2 1 vegetation data the kernel ndvi kndvi index was obtained from the combined modis collection mcd43a4 version 6 nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function adjusted reflectance to assess vegetation productivity at a daily temporal resolution nasa 2022 the kndvi camps valls et al 2021 is closely related to the gross primary productivity gpp which is an important indicator of carbon fixation during photosynthesis this kernel ndvi method aims at overcoming the linear approach of the conventional ndvi normalized difference vegetation index by accounting for the non linear behavior of spectral indices with biomass or leaf area index the kndvi derives an automatic and pixel wise adaptive stretching keeping the relation between near infrared and red channel allowing it to cope with saturation effects complex phenological cycles and seasonal variations to deal with the mixed pixel problem and to propagate lower uncertainty than other indices camps valls et al 2021 the equation of the kndvi is given by 1 k n d v i t a n h n i r r e d 2 σ 2 where σ is a length scale parameter to be specified in each particular application and represents the sensitivity of the index to sparsely densely vegetated regions the modis products have 500 m resolution and are available since 2000 didan et al 2015 2 2 2 soil moisture data the combined cci soil moisture product v04 7 based on level 2 products for both passive and active retrievals was used to assess the first 10 cm of the water content of soil preimesberger et al 2021 esa 2021 the resolution of this product corresponds to 0 25 degrees at a daily time step the data was processed with a python algorithm to obtain the spatial average values for each catchment in the study area 2 3 composite analysis composite analysis ca was developed by chree 1913 1914 originally for space science however is widely used in different fields of earth science e g xie et al 2017 nicolai shaw et al 2017 also referred to as superposed epoch analysis and conditional sampling the ca is used to comprehend the relationship between different phenomena and hydrological variables ca involves collecting large numbers of cases of a given meteorological phenomenon in this case drought events these cases are composited together as a collection for each variable and catchment perhaps with different types of stratification using one or more covariates that are suspected to have an influence on the phenomenon the composite analysis then generally involves computing the composite mean and some other statistical measures such as the standard deviation and statistical significance the resulting structures which emerge can tell a powerful story about how that phenomenon is affected by the factors used in the composite stratification in the case of drought events a negative response to droughts from discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture is expected for a year after the event if drought events satisfy our selection criteria in the section definition of drought events the timing of those events is selected as key times and grouped per catchment later the drought response signal for each of the variables is isolated by calculating the average drought behavior in time over which the dt and dtd are determined due to the spatial resolution of vegetation 500 m and soil moisture 27 28 m the average composite analysis per catchment presents higher variability for soil moisture finally with the implementation of statistical tests we defined if there is a significant lagged connection between the variables this process enhances the signals as a result of the extraction of events while noises are averaged out xie et al 2017 the normalization was performed with the empirical cumulative distribution function of the data dekking et al 2005 the signal of variables with lower values is assessed better by accumulating the values close to zero due to the very steep curve of the function near zero that flattens out towards higher values this is especially relevant for low discharge vegetation and soil moisture measurements during drought periods the function provides the proportion of elements in the data set that are less than or equal to x 2 f n number of elements in the data set x n 2 4 definition of drought events a fixed threshold approach was used to define hydrological drought events with a fixed percentile threshold of 80 for the daily streamflow anomalies between 1988 to 2020 following wanders and wada 2015 and van loon et al 2016 these drought events were established for each catchment as key times in this study 2 5 determination of drought termination and drought termination duration drought termination can be characterized by its duration rate of recovery and seasonality nkemdirim and weber 1999 mo 2011 parry et al 2016 in this regard the ensemble mean from the ca was used to identify the drought development and drought termination fig 1 shows the location of the study area with the size of the catchments left a flow diagram of the ca analysis center and the drought termination in days right the first day of the drought termination corresponds to the day when a minimum peak is reached after the drought event starts di in fig 1 the drought ends when the signal exceeds the q80 threshold however the last day of the drought termination dt phase is found when the normalized threshold of 0 5 is reached this threshold is selected due to the normalization method dekking et al 2005 which performs normalization on sorted data and later brings data back in place based on the original index as defined by parry et al 2016 the drought termination duration dtd corresponds to the first recovery peak after crossing the normalized discharge threshold of 0 5 with a window of seven days these days after drought termination are added to the recovery because the basin needs more time to replenish flow deficit mo 2011 parry et al 2016 furthermore the window of seven days gives enough time to show a recovery peak and is based on half of the period used by ahmadi et al 2019a to classify discharge drought recovery us a group of drought events can provide an average termination phase in days between di and dt while the dtd is the number of days between di and dtd parry et al 2016 the differences between dt and dtd recovery rely on the identification method considering the recovery threshold at 0 5 the dt corresponds to the period between the minimum peak of the hydrological drought until it reaches the threshold in comparison dtd is the period between the lower peak after the drought starts and the first peak after the threshold the lower and upper peak is defined as a window of seven days where there is an increase and a reduction upper peak of the signal the presence or absence of snow between catchments was determined by the soil water equivalent from the camels data set 2 6 explanatory variables of dt and dtd the dt and dtd for all 163 catchments were used as input for geospatial analysis and pattern identification the impact estimation of different explanatory variables and catchment properties from the camels cl data on dt and dtd using lasso regression tibshirani 1996 and random forest regression breiman 2001 was performed lasso is good to reduce multi collinearity by putting penalties on jumping up and down regression coefficients meanwhile random forest regression is a meta estimator of the data set that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub samples and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over fitting kramer 2016 the random forest regression used 30 for training data random state zero and tree size length iteration over correlation was obtained other variables were included that are potentially linked with the drought recovery like the average groundwater depth from alvarez garreton et al 2018 the average rate of sun exposition from farr and kobrick 2000 and average soil moisture capacity from van beek and bierkens 2009 all variables listed in appendix a 5 the python package scikit learn was used to get the best explanatory variables and random forest for the discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture variables simpson et al 2021 the weight of each variable was calculated based on the residuals sum of squares from 3 r 2 1 u v where u is the residual sum of squares y t r u e y p r e d 2 it can be negative due to the arbitrarily worse of the model and 1 0 is the best possible score a filter with lasso regression was performed before rfr 3 results 3 1 composite analysis the response of each natural catchment after drought events between 1988 to 2020 is studied using a ca fig 2 shows the results of ca for the río cauquenes en el arrayán catchment 620 km 2 coordinates 72 30 s 36 6 w the upper figure shows the average response of discharge the central figure the kndvi as a proxy for vegetation productivity and the lower figure the soil moisture the quantiles in the graph present a skewed density distribution and correspond to the variable members between 10 90 25 75 and 40 60 including the recovery threshold 0 5 which is the end of the recovery for the dt the behavior of discharge and vegetation productivity in this catchment present a close relation in their recovery after drought events by comparing the average ca response black line in fig 2 where a fast recovery response is observed in the vegetation and a slightly slower one in the discharge the soil moisture presents a faster recovery and may be responsible for the faster recovery of the vegetation over the discharge 3 2 drought recovery patterns the spatial analysis was divided into four areas fig 1 due to catchments distribution in the study area north chile central chile north patagonia and south patagonia and bio climatic differences fig 3 3 2 1 drought termination the central chile area shows the main recognizable patterns visible from north to south illustrated by the changing colored circles in fig 3 and less clear east to west along a gradient of precipitation and temperature in general dominant patterns of discharge and soil moisture dt are visible from north to south in central chile meanwhile discharge and vegetation productivity are only recognizable from east to west fig 3 the discharge q fig 3 left shows a low to high recovery pattern from north to south and is increasing until latitude 35 s longer discharge recovery times were found at lower latitude catchments in environments with less precipitation higher temperatures and mostly shrublands while shorter discharge recovery times were found at higher latitudes in environments with higher precipitation lower temperatures and high vegetation cover after the latitude 35 s the recovery switch from high to low in addition the discharge present from east to west has high to low recovery times over 300 to under 200 days a pattern which is inverted at lower latitudes the recovery in north chile presents a high to low pattern towards the south the north patagonia region presents homogeneous recovery times similar to southcentral chile in south patagonia high to medium recovery times between 50 to 200 days are identified the vegetation shows low recovery in most of the locations without a clear pattern from north to south however from east to west a high to low recovery pattern in the north of central cl is recognized this pattern is inverted similarly after the latitude 35 s towards the south the north cl presents medium and high recovery times of vegetation without a clear distribution furthermore the recovery in north patagonia presents low recovery with similar behavior as southcentral chile similarly in south patagonia the recovery is also low the recovery of soil moisture presents a high to low pattern from north to south in central chile together with a high to low recovery pattern from east to west in the direction of southern latitudes that is inverted after latitude 35 s in north chile the recovery shows intermediate recovery times while in north patagonia a low recovery is present similar to south patagonia the scale is different between variables because their responses are different and to appreciate the spatial patterns is necessary a different scale for discharge vegetation and soil moisture 3 2 2 drought termination duration fig 4 shows the results of the dtd a dominant pattern for dtd in central chile is visible for discharge and soil moisture from north to south vegetation productivity shows a less distinctive pattern fig 4 the discharge in central chile as for dt presents an increased recovery time from north to south after drought events such a pattern is also visible from east to west with a low to high recovery pattern decreasing towards higher latitudes and shifting after approximately 35 s in north chile the discharge presents low to medium recovery times in north patagonia the recovery exhibits intermediate recovery times i e 150 200 days in contrast south patagonia does not show a clear pattern of recovery time the vegetation recovery time in central chile does not show a clear pattern from north to south however from east to west it exhibits a high to low recovery until a latitude of 35 s where the pattern is shifted towards the south in north chile the recovery is low with values close to 200 days in addition in northern patagonia the recovery is low while in south patagonia there is not a clear pattern with extremely high or low recovery the recovery of soil moisture presents a faster response compared with dt and also other variables particularly central cl show high to low recovery from north to south and a pattern from east to west with high to low recovery for all the region the north cl evidence a slow recovery of close to 2 months similar to north patagonia which is also slow with values over 2 months south patagonia presents high recovery in the north and low recovery in the south fig 4 3 3 snow accumulation and recovery the annual streamflow in rainfall fed catchments has a shorter hydrological memory mainly explained by the precipitation of the current year in the case of vegetation productivity the recovery is faster in catchments with the presence of snow and soil moisture recovery presents a slightly higher recovery in catchments without snow accumulation table 1 shows the average recovery of discharge vegetation and soil moisture 3 4 recovery and koppen climates the discharge recovery time showed longer values in semi arid climates the next mediterranean temperate and tundra climates our results show relatively similar recovery times for the rainy summer tundra climate of pluvial watersheds 100 days at south patagonia as found by wu et al 2020 reporting between 60 to 390 days over three unaltered flow rainfall driven basins under humid south asian subtropical monsoons the vegetation recovery showed faster average recovery in tundra climates 2 to 5 months followed by mediterranean 3 to 5 months temperate 3 to 5 months and semi arid 4 to 5 5 months jiao et al 2021 also found the recovery of canopy density 4 6 months and photosynthetically active radiation 2 to 3 months average times to return to normal status for arid semi arid semi humid and humid australian ecosystems the soil moisture recovery showed longer recovery in mediterranean environments 4 5 weeks followed by temperate 3 4 weeks and tundra 3 4 weeks meanwhile semi arid 2 3 weeks presented the faster recovery appendix 1 to 4 3 5 multiple linear regression the results of the mlr table 3 show significant values only for the discharge recovery of r 2 0 5 the vegetation productivity and soil moisture did not show significant skills to predict the dt and dtd the explanatory variables for discharge dt and dtd are associated with precipitation potential evapotranspiration and baseflow or by a combination of them with catchment characteristics related to storage and release e g land use 3 6 random forest regression the graphs presented in fig 5 show the most significant variables for the determination of dt and dtd of predicted versus observed values in general all the predictions have a high correlation coefficient due to the advantages of rfr for obtaining non linear relationships the downside of using decision trees is their tendency to overfit we used 30 of training data as they are highly sensitive to small changes in data the correlation coefficients for dt are given in table 3 and correspond to 0 92 0 84 and 0 89 with an rmse coefficient of 56 57 93 26 and 23 74 for discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture respectively the correlation coefficients for dtd correspond to 0 92 0 85 and 0 91 with an rmse coefficient of 57 03 56 50 and 19 73 for discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture respectively the model used 30 of the data for training and the main model features are included in the top right considering their contribution to the model and the correlation coefficient in the top left the most efficient rfr models used 200 200 and 500 trees for the prediction of discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture of dt meanwhile for the dtd the number of trees corresponding to 50 100 and 200 fig 5 top left parameters the variables with a higher contribution to the prediction of discharge dt and dtd are presented in fig 5 from a to d in the upper right corner the most important variables for the prediction of discharge recovery are linked with precipitation extreme discharge and snow accumulation meanwhile vegetation productivity can be explained with a combination of catchment characteristics catchment exposition ratio associated with storage and release shrub land cover and superficial water extraction for soil moisture the stream flow precipitation elasticity storage release characteristics crop and forest cover and water extraction ground and superficial are the main drivers the other variables from the camels cl data set correspond to variables that do not contribute to the model as much as the top ones 4 discussion 4 1 snow accumulation and recovery in general the recovery of discharge vegetation and soil moisture differs amongst catchments according to the presence or absence of snow particularly the discharge recovery shows a slower response on catchments with snow accumulation correspondingly alvarez garreton et al 2020 demonstrated that snow dominated catchments in chile possess a hydrological memory that results in strong correlations in stream flow generation over consecutive hydrological years the slow discharge recovery time of snow fed catchments demonstrates that the recovery is hampered by snowmelt infiltration into groundwater depleted levels reducing the river s stream flow in addition alvarez garreton et al 2020 demonstrated that catchments with snow accumulation long memory in chile exhibit a progressive reduction in stream flow generation during the same hydrological year as catchments without snow accumulation the multi year drought increased the drought propagation and increased differences between rainfall fed basins alvarez garreton et al 2020 it is possible that the recovery of long memory basins may have been affected during a multi year drought due to the increased frequency and intensity of hydrological drought during this period the flow of the stream would be reduced due to its dependence on rainfall but mostly due to the lack of snow accumulation in the corresponding year other factors that may affect the recovery of the stream flow include the allocation of water rights over the rivers and groundwater in the studied basins the replacement of native vegetation with water demanding species such as tree exotic plantations as well as the rapid shift in land use during the last few decades the consequent rise in water demand for agriculture irrigation and human consumption may also have an impact barría et al 2021b galleguillos et al 2021 the recovery of vegetation productivity which is faster in catchments with snow accumulation for dt but similar for dtd demonstrates a different behavior this faster recovery can be attributed to the physical properties of the soil profile such as porosity and resistance to penetration which are associated with the rooting depth of the vegetation which can reach 20 meters prosopis tamarugo and the impact timing of drought on the water table depth kannenberg et al 2019a decuyper et al 2016 in the maps presented by schwalm et al 2017 similar vegetation recovery for the same study area is visualized after analyzing three data sets of gross primary productivity gpp across diverse ecosystems worldwide in their findings drought recovery times were strongly associated with climate and carbon cycle dynamics on a global scale specifically in sparsely covered shrubland of central chile dominated with acacia caven in a mediterranean climate with a warm and dry season 7 8 months the ecosystem productivity was explained mostly by rainfall frequency with a significant time lag between plant growth and precipitation events sepúlveda et al 2018 this is supported by the global probability map of precipitation exceeding temperature as the main driver of tree growth for this region babst et al 2019 this can modulate the recovery since water availability acts as a crucial limit to global primary productivity and the hydrological drought is considered the starting point of the variability in the signal generating global concern also because hydrological drought is predicted to become more limiting globally zhou et al 2019 kannenberg et al 2020 a source of uncertainty for the prediction of vegetation recovery is evidenced by kannenberg et al 2019b where a decrease in tree growth can occur together with a quick recovery of gpp showing a large legacy effect vegetation recovery in literature in tree rings and growth away from the stem towards the canopy this is due to carbon allocation shifts linked with upregulated leaf level photosynthesis meaning that legacy effects in gpp are much smaller than those in tree rings the vegetation recovery of chile found in this study is also coherent to ahmadi et al 2019b for dtd between 3 4 months 90 120 days however they used water use efficiency wue which is a ratio between gross primary productivity gpp and potential evapotranspiration et the rise of wue helps the vegetation in arid regions to reduce water loss and maintain its growth due to a series of conservative water use strategies with this approach in dryer regions with high et is expected an increase in wue during drought episodes even though vegetation recovery is longer as demonstrated in this study particularly north central chile vicente serrano et al 2013 long et al 2013 overall we can conclude that the findings from this study are in line with other studies looking at vegetation recovery using different techniques the implications of faster recovery can imply that plants are more susceptible to future droughts and slower recovery to a controlled acclimation response optimizes survival in the long term gessler et al 2020 the soil moisture shows a slightly faster recovery in catchments with snow accumulation compared with rainfall fed recovery times between 3 4 weeks similar recovery times for the global snow free region of soil moisture were simulated with a land surface model assimilating satellite microwave brightness temperature and composite analysis of drought events by sawada 2018 even though their analysis did not include catchments with snow accumulation similar hydrological processes may explain similarities in the recovery the reductions in soil moisture after hydrological drought indicate the link with the start of agricultural drought leblanc et al 2009 in this sense the recovery of soil moisture is important for regulating vegetation growth and rainfall runoff relationships allowing the quick restoration of pre conditions for the recovery gibson et al 2020 suggesting that catchments may be buffered or less impacted by drought in high relief and well vegetated regions salazar et al 2016 potter et al 2015 4 2 climate zones and their influence on the recovery differences in recovery time between the various environmental conditions were also found within the studied natural catchments table 2 the köppen climate classification table a 4 was used to demonstrate the influence of seasonality precipitation and temperature based on the ecosystem properties and approximately three decades of data this study evidenced that most of the natural catchments in chile experienced an average recovery post drought with different timings for discharge table a 1 vegetation productivity table a 2 and soil moisture table a 3 the discharge recovery found by wu et al 2020 relates the importance of precipitation in the recovery of rivers in humid south asian subtropical monsoons with precipitation during the warm season consequently the faster discharge recovery occurs in catchments with climates that present higher rainfall regimes as temperate and tundra environments than in semi arid and mediterranean xi and yuan 2022 as stated previously the reduction of vegetation productivity starts after hydrological drought which is marked by the legacy effect before the recovery kannenberg et al 2020 wu et al 2018 stated that drought legacy effects on vegetation growth over the temperate northern hemisphere differ markedly between forests shrubs and grass across diverse bioclimatic conditions differences in drought legacy effects between impact plant functional groups to plant ecohydrological properties linked to traits can also play a role the gpp signal can also contribute to the variability in the identification of plant recovery such as the plant response mechanism to carbon allocation priority producing leaf abundance or photosynthesis instead of biomass growth in branches or stems kannenberg et al 2019b miranda et al 2020 evidenced that in the mediterranean chilean forest the local environmental conditions which provide higher soil moisture e g valley bottoms and forest composition enhanced forest resistance alleviation to drought moreover cartwright et al 2020 found that areas with low soil bulk density and high soil available water capacity presented a reduced drought sensitivity and high soil moisture recovery however the biome with faster soil moisture recovery corresponds to the semi arid which presents higher bulk density and low soil water capacity seguel et al 2013 the presence of higher mountains in this biome in the andes and coastal range with more valley bottoms and south exposition hills shade in the southern hemisphere provide good conditions to retain water due to low evaporation 4 3 drought recovery patterns spatio temporal recovery of river discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture is critical to investigate in regions without enough measurements and under increasing environmental pressure due to climate change and human activity as proven by this study collecting discharge data is important for understanding the processes in the catchment the method proposed in this study provides a comprehensive tool to assess regional drought vulnerability which is important for the effective basin scale management of water resources and ecosystems in central chile river discharge patterns exhibit a reduction in the recovery times from north to south this recovery pattern follows masiokas et al 2020 regional stream flow classification patterns for south america they estimated the north of central chile presented the lowest recovery times and the lowest discharge during the rainy season of rivers followed by an early summer single discharge peak that largely reflects the winter snow accumulation levels the recovery gradient from west to east is associated with the influence of winter orographic precipitation in the lower catchments between the coastal mountains and the valley which enhanced the recovery viale et al 2019 southern central chile shows an inverted pattern compared to the north a gradient of low recovery near the latitude of 35 s is found and this becomes slightly higher towards the south masiokas et al 2020 described this group of rivers as part of the lower andes smaller mountain range height with wetter conditions than the north in this region stream flows present a winter peak largely due to precipitation and in some cases a second spring peak due to snow melt the decreased recovery pattern from east to west is explained by the higher influence of precipitation reaching catchments located in the lower andes further than in the north and the addition of snowmelt discharge on the east garreaud et al 2020 the patterns in north patagonia are also described by masiokas et al 2020 as a single spring peak discharge due to snow melt with milder climatic conditions due to the low elevation of the andes and winter liquid precipitation the vegetation recovery spatio temporal patterns show longer recovery in densely vegetated areas of south central chile and faster recovery on semi arid shrublands of the high andes in central chile the maps developed by schwalm et al 2017 showed long recovery times in highly vegetated mountains of southern andes with values between 6 to 12 months too and recovery times of 3 to 6 months for the rest of the territory however the catchments placed in the arid and semi arid high andes of this study evidenced faster recovery 4 months between the 30 s to 35 s degrees and the rest of central chile presented values over 6 months dechant and moradkhani 2015 also found that semi arid vegetation recovers quickly in the upper colorado river basin due to loss of sensitivity to initial conditions of soil water storage after droughts in the mountainous northeastern region of the semi arid upper colorado river basin us contrary in their low lying arid southern and western regions the recovery was slow after drought events cartwright et al 2020 showed at a regional scale that ecosystems with a drier climate and lower biomass shrub steppe showed greater drought sensitivity greenness reduction relative to baseline soil moisture than conifer forests in the pacific northwest usa in their study drought sensitivity was generally greater in zones with high elevation drier climate and greater soil bulk density identifying variability in drought sensitivity within biomes and within ecosystems mediated by landscape topography climate and soil characteristics zhang et al 2021 found diverse post drought recovery trajectories for different biomes with forest ecosystems showing a longer recovery time compared with shrublands and grasslands jiao et al 2021 evidenced for australian ecosystems that forests and savanna required the longest recovery times for press drought 3 months but not extreme drought while grasslands were the slowest to recover for press drought 3 months extreme drought this may explain the differences between patterns of recovery in catchments close to each other with these characteristics in central chile and different vegetation compositions e g between 39 s and 38 s even though dechant and moradkhani 2015 reported that the vegetation drought recovery rate seems to be more related to specific locations than drought intensity this can suggest that intensity variation due to propagation is less relevant for vegetation recovery than the local characteristics of the site which are further evaluated using random forest regression where site exposition land use surface water rights and annual precipitation variation are the main relevant factors also most of the catchments of this region have experienced significant land cover change during the last hundred years lara et al 2012 shrub lands in northern chile have been transformed into avocado plantations over the last 10 years while native forest in central chile has been converted into productive plantations over the last 30 years native forest was converted into productive plantations furthermore deforestation of agricultural lands took place all over central chile in the last 100 years lara et al 2012 this adds a third component to plant recovery which is the physiological response of native and exotic species to droughts and their recovery time at the study site mediterranean species possess special adaptations to a drought that may influence the recovery as the storage of soluble carbohydrates during summer martínez vilalta et al 2016 however is not clear yet if this helps them to accelerate or extend the recovery as part of the legacy effects of drought impact studies carried by venegas gonzález et al 2018 matskovsky et al 2021 reported that the mediterranean endangered and endemic forest of nothofagus macrocarpa and austrocedrus chilensis in central chile presented an increased declination of radial growth in the last decades due to drought conditions the spatial distribution of soil moisture recovery presents patterns that may be related to discharge recovery dechant and moradkhani 2015 also demonstrated the difference between drought recovery time and rate of recovery since the drought recovery time is highly dependent on initial conditions of soil moisture and this value varies strongly temporally they reported that this variable is linked to the discharge recovery in terms of their geographical patterns in this sense soil moisture and discharge recovery presented an opposite gradient behavior in this study this is at a faster discharge recovery towards the south of central chile there is a slow soil moisture recovery the patterns can be also observed from east to west which tells that as rivers recover faster the soil moisture recovers slowly the reason for this pattern could be the preferential transport of water to the rivers when they are recovering and the consequent diminution of the soil moisture in the first 5 10 cm also surface run off with high rainfall intensity could be attributed to low infiltration in the first layers of soil improving only the discharge recovery woolhiser and goodrich 1988 molina et al 2007 4 4 random forest regression the predictors of dt and dtd fig 4 are connected to diverse hydrological processes with different contribution proportions to the model the processes linked with the discharge recovery model predictors are related to water provisions such as precipitation stream flow extremes and snow accumulation in this sense when a precipitation event begins it is also where and when drought starts the recovery with a lag until surface runoff reaches the outlet moreover the first rainy events after a dry period can provide extreme flows or even flash flows due to the effect of water repellency influenced by antecedent soil water content hydraulic conductivity and precipitation intensity cerda et al 1998 snow accumulation is particularly relevant for watersheds with high elevations and low elasticity of stream flow to precipitation and temperature changes in chile barrera et al 2020 also snow accounts for the storage of water provisioning water during dry periods and even in dry periods providing water to the stream flow and groundwater however in the short term higher snowmelt rates may help the recovery temporarily due to higher temperatures in chile garreaud et al 2020 in the long term this may induce snow drought due to early snow melt in combination with no recharge due to precipitation deficit van loon 2015 the vegetation recovery rfr model presents predictors that are connected to precipitation behavior together with water storage and release characteristics by the land cover shrub land cover the inclusion of the annual precipitation variation responds to the influence of el niño southern oscillation and the reduction of precipitation due to the southern blob in the last years garreaud et al 2021 the storage and release are mainly influenced by plants adaptation to efficient use of water martínez vilalta et al 2016 the influence of climate change on vegetation relocation distribution patterns batllori et al 2020 soil storage properties galleguillos et al 2021 and land cover change alvarez garreton et al 2019 the superficial water extraction as an explanatory variable relates the recovery with the private water rights system in chile which is not limited by catchments water provision capacity barría et al 2021b even though there is an extreme reduction in river stream flow due to the multi year drought during the last decade for many of them alvarez garreton et al 2020 the relevance of orographic precipitation across the coastal mountain range which is exacerbated in mesic locations is demonstrated by east exposition as a predictor cazorla et al 2022 viale et al 2019 the explanatory variables of the soil moisture recovery model such as superficial ground water extraction and land cover evidence that water management at a catchment scale is very relevant for this region barría et al 2021a in this regard the assessment of drought termination and resilience may improve planning and resource management at the catchment scale under future climate change droughts van loon et al 2016 at the moment the water rights market presents over allocation and may generate an even more extreme situation considering the weather predictions barría et al 2021b gibson et al 2020 climate change projections include precipitation reductions and higher temperatures that may increase evaporation and reduce soil moisture which will account for the increase in hydrological droughts wada et al 2013 similar projections show an increase in drought areas for europe up to 40 with a consequent exacerbation of soil moisture droughts samaniego et al 2018 5 conclusion this study investigated the impacts of multi year droughts in chile and analyzed for 163 catchments the drought duration and recovery time related to environmental conditions it demonstrates that the recovery of discharge vegetation productivity and soil moisture after a hydrological drought can be explained by local catchment properties and characteristics the outcome of this study is a contribution to disentangling the connection of environmental conditions vegetation and soil moisture and discharge to assess the drought vulnerability of catchments the recovery analysis over different climate zones also contributes to the supply of quantitative thresholds to improve the modeling of ecosystem dynamics post drought snow accumulation influences the recovery of natural catchments compared to rain fed basins the decrease in discharge recovery due to snow melt infiltration into groundwater levels reduces the river s stream flow the vegetation recovery evidences faster recovery in watersheds with snow accumulation due to the constant water provision through the groundwater profile helping with water provision to species adapted to dry conditions and with deeper roots the soil moisture recovery presents higher recovery in basins with snow consequently due to the longer provision of water environments dominated by shrublands with less precipitation and higher temperatures present longer discharge recovery while in higher latitudes with increasing precipitation and lower temperatures the recovery times are shorter under higher vegetation cover the patterns of vegetation show longer recovery in densely vegetated areas of south central chile and faster recovery in semi arid shrublands of the high andes in central chile the spatial distribution of soil moisture recovery presents patterns that connect them with discharge recovery this might be explained by the preferential transport towards streams and the increasing surface run off due to high rainfall intensity with low infiltration of the first layers of soil the recovery of discharge is better explained by precipitation extreme discharge and snow accumulation meanwhile vegetation productivity by a combination of catchment characteristics catchment exposition ratio associated with storage and release shrub land cover and superficial water extraction the soil moisture main predictors correspond to stream flow precipitation elasticity storage release characteristics and ground superficial water extraction this study shows for the first time the discharge recovery for different environments at the catchment scale along with the recovery of vegetation productivity and soil moisture this is useful for the identification of drought vulnerability for managing water resources and ecosystems helping to predict drought recovery periods in
