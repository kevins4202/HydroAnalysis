measurement of total 2 mib permanganate free chlorine ozone and fluorescence index in the whole experiment in general all the experiments were performed at least in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of pseudoanabaena sp inactivation during the pre oxidation study the following three doses of each oxidant were chosen based on the real values applied in water treatment plants kmno4 doses of 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 naclo as chlorine doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg l 1 and o3 doses of 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 mg l 1 since the variations in the concentrations of the oxidants were not negligible pseudo second order equations were adopted and are expressed by eqs 3 5 3 d φ dt k y φ oxidant 4 φ ct φ 0 e k y ct 5 k y ln φ ct φ 0 ct where φct is photosynthetic capacity under a certain exposure value ct φ0 is the initial photosynthetic capacity of algae cells and k y is the second order decreasing rate of effective quantum yield i e inactivation rate the obtained inactivation rates followed the order ozonation chlorination permanganation fig 1 shows the experimental results of cell inactivation under exposure to the various oxidants the curves looked like a shoulder type exhibiting a lag phase during the early period this defined as two stage second order kinetics using a delayed chick watson model cho et al 2003 2004 in our previous research a study of toxin release under permanganation li et al 2014 in the present study the results indicated that the turning points occurred at 0 060 m s and 0 096 m s in the presence of 2 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 kmno4 respectively regarding to the data obtained using free chlorine and ozone fig 1b and c no lag phase was observed and the log value of cell viability decreased linearly function with the oxidant exposure meanwhile the reaction rates under chlorine and ozone exposure were significantly faster than those under permanganate several theories were previously developed to explain the inactivation under chlorine virto et al found that membrane damage is not a vital factor in the disinfection process and hurst proposed that damage to the electron transport chain and enzymes is the key to cell inactivation hurst et al 1991 virto et al 2005 however dukan suggested that a change in the membrane permeability during chlorination causes cell lysis and the release of iom such as proteins and dna dukan and touati 1996 zamyadi et al 2013 according to the current results the inactivation mechanism could be explained as follows as cyanobacteria cells carry negative charges on the conventional water treatment conditions hclo produced by naclo can permeate the cell with little hindrance because of its neutral and micromolecular properties ou et al 2011 then this permeated hclo can damage either the membrane or the enzyme system thereby decreasing the cell viability thus the mucilage does not function as a protectant and inactivation occurs immediately as a result the rate constants of chlorination were about five times faster than those of kmno4 exposure the reaction pattern of inactivation under ozonation is similar to that under chlorination but with significantly higher reaction rate due to the much higher oxidation potential of ozone 3 2 kinetics of 2 mib degradation to illustrate the change in the 2 mib concentration in an algae solution during oxidation models with second order kinetics were developed based on our previous research li et al 2014 the model for the variation in 2 mib was expressed in eq 6 which was derived from eq 1 6 d 2 mib e dt k d 2 mib e oxidant k r 2 mib i oxidant where 2 mibe 2 mibi and oxidant are the concentrations of extracellular 2 mib intracellular 2 mib and oxidant respectively at certain reaction times k d and k r are degradation and release constants of 2 mib which would highly impact the dominant reaction k d and k r can be calculated individually as discussed below according to the approaches provided in the methodology section the oxidation of 2 mib was performed in both an aom background and milli q water under kmno4 naclo and o3 exposure to calculate the degradation constants 2 mib was eliminated by less than 10 in aom solution with kmno4 and chlorine however as illustrated in fig 2 ozone removed 98 9 of the 2 mib in the aom solution with a rate of 258 67 m 1 s 1 which was only slightly slower than the rate of 284 10 m 1 s 1 obtained in milli q water several studies have discussed the mechanism for ozonation direct function by ozone molecule as well as indirect function by hydroxyl radicals oh von gunten 2003 the second order rate constants during oxidation of 2 mib by ozone molecule and oh have been estimated ko3 1 0 m 1 s 1 kho 5 1 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 glaze et al 1990 peter and von 2007 wert et al 2014 consequently oh played a major role in the ozonation of 2 mib for this study here the attained constant k 284 1 m 1 s 1 the removal rates of 2 mib was basically consistent with other studies which reported as 13 and 10 by kmno4 3 mg l 1 120 min contact time and hclo 3 mg l 1 120 min contact time respectively while the removal rate could reach 83 at an ozone dosage of 0 2 mg l min glaze et al 1990 in another study over 90 of both 2 mib and geosmin were removed after ozonation 4 19 mg l 1 20 min contact time yuan et al 2013 nonetheless lalezary et al reported that o3 was inefficiency for the removal of 2 mib and geosmin using dosages of up to 33 mg l 1 lalezary et al 1986 the different results for the removal rate could be that degradation of 2 mib depends on various parameters including oxidant dosages contact time ph initial 2 mib concentrations and the existence of nom 3 3 kinetics of intracellular 2 mib release the total and extracellular 2 mib concentrations were monitored under exposure to the various oxidants to determine the release of intracellular 2 mib as illustrated in fig 3 overall the total 2 mib decreased insignificantly during permanganation and chlorination in all cases indicating that both the two oxidants were inefficiency to degrade 2 mib the extracellular 2 mib increased with increasing exposure time during permanganation and chlorination except in the case of a low kmno4 dose 1 0 mg l 1 showing the occurrence of cell lysis the figures also indicated that most of the total 2 mib after permanganation was retained inside and cells kept integrity until the turning point i e critical value then abrupt cell lysis occurred which matched well with the previous discussion that cell viability decreased dramatically since the oxidants exposure reached ct y as shown in fig 1a however the variations in the total 2 mib concentrations exhibited different trends during ozonation with different initial o3 concentrations the removal rate of total 2 mib increased with increasing initial o3 concentration 53 4 under 0 5 mg l 1 88 4 under 1 0 mg l 1 in addition the extracellular 2 mib concentration increased remarkably at the beginning period implying that cells were damaged and that iom was released from the cells which was consistent with the results reported by xie et al in which less than 1 integral cells were left after 10 min ozonation at ozone dosages of 0 4 2 0 mg l 1 xie et al 2013 of note no obvious variations in either the total or extracellular 2 mib concentration were observed for the 0 2 mg l 1 o3 dose because the oxidant was rapidly depleted upon addition into the system thus no oxidant was available to destroy the cells these results were in accordance with previous investigation in which the o3 concentration decayed rapidly in the initial 30 s and was completely consumed within 5 min even with a dose of 4 or 6 mg l 1 fan et al 2013 this result implied that a minimum o3 dose was required for the treatment of water containing odor producing algae and the production of ozonation by products should be taken into consideration papageorgiou et al 2017 plummer and edzwald 2001 the ratio of extracellular total 2 mib ultimately increased from 0 35 to 0 90 and from 0 31 to 0 99 after 360 mins in the presence of kmno4 concentrations of 2 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 respectively and all the ratios of extracellular total 2 mib under the different initial naclo concentrations surpassed 0 7 within 30 min under ozonation 0 5 and 1 0 mg l 1 intracellular 2 mib was virtually undetected after 5 min indicating that complete destruction of the algae cell walls occurred consistent with the cell inactivation results as discussed in previous section the kinetics of 2 mib release during oxidation were proposed to fit the following second order kinetic model as expressed in eqs 7 9 7 d 2 mib i dt k r 2 mib i oxidant 8 2 mib i c t 2 mib i 0 e k r c t 9 k r ln 2 mib i c t 2 mib i 0 c t where 2 mibi ct is the intracellular 2 mib concentration at exposure of ct and the other parameters are the same as in eq 6 the modeling fitting is shown in fig 4 with the detailed fitting parameters listed in table 2 the unique modeling pattern of kmno4 was ascribed to the fact that as discussed in last section of note the ct r value of 2 mib was similar to ct y 0 068 and 0 094 m s compared to 0 060 and 0 096 m s table 1 which implied that 2 mib was released as soon as the cell wall collapsed the release rate constants under all the three oxidants exposures followed the same order as inactivation rates ozonation ky 2 69 104 m 1 s 1 kr 2 91 104 m 1 s 1 chlorination ky 152 92 m 1 s 1 kr 280 3 m 1 s 1 permanganation ky 35 88 m 1 s 1 kr 39 77 m 1 s 1 the kinetic constant under naclo exposure was 7 times faster than that under permanganation while the rate of intracellular 2 mib release by ozone was three orders of magnitude faster than that by the other two oxidants based on the results above it is reasonable to conclude that 2 mib release happened simultaneously with cell inactivation 3 4 eem evolution during oxidation the eem of aom is shown in si fig s1 pigments mostly phycoerythrin in this study have an intense fluorescence peak at an ex em wavelength of 500 580 540 620 nm which are unique substances that exist only inside cells thus pigments are a more precise indicator of cell lysis than the proteins or humic acid like matters monitored before chen et al 2003 li et al 2012 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 zhang et al 2014 in addition calculations of the peak intensity were conducted to quantify the extent of cell lysis during oxidation by combining the kinetics of both cell deactivation and 2 mib release the eem spectra of pigments in the extracellular solution during the reactions by three oxidants are shown in si fig s2 s10 as shown in si fig s3 and s4 a remarkable increase in the pigments concentrations of the extracellular solution occurred between 120 and 150 min corresponding exposure between 0 059 and 0 071 m s and between 60 and 90 min corresponding exposure between 0 097 and 0 143 m s under the kmno4 concentration of 2 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 respectively the behaviors match very well with cell photosynthetic capacity decrease ct y values were 0 060 m s and 0 096 m s respectively and 2 mib release ct r values were 0 068 and 0 094 m s respectively as illustrated in sections 3 2 and 3 3 similarly the rapid increase of the pigments intensities was also observed in the presence of both chlorine and ozone as illustrated in si fig s5 s10 which agreed with the pattern as shown in fig 3 as well of note the pigments peaks did not appear in the extracellular solution exposed to 1 0 mg l 1 kmno4 and 0 2 mg l 1 o3 for as long as the end of the experiment 120 min as shown in si fig s2 and s8 which confirmed that the cell integrity was maintained under low oxidants exposure where the oxidants decayed upon addition into the system and were depleted rapidly by the dissolved and cell bound organic matters the results agreed well with cell inactivation and the release of intracellular 2 mib in sections 3 2 and 3 3 in addition we observed that the pigments signal intensity weakened with increasing reaction time suggesting that the pigments would be easily oxidized by the oxidants residual after release this was also reported by other researchers korak et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 to sum up the eems of eom can be applied to explain the cell integrity and 2 mib release under different oxidants exposures it is a powerful approach to exam the cell lysis and therefore to predict the intracellular organic material release 4 conclusions kmno4 naclo and o3 are three of the mostly used agents for drinking water pre oxidation intracellular 2 mib release was observed during the reaction with all the three oxidants except under 1 0 mg l 1 kmno4 and 0 2 mg l 1 o3 exposures because the oxidant was quickly consumed upon addition into the system this study developed kinetic models for cell inactivation and 2 mib release and results showed that the reaction patterns during permanganation were different from that during chlorination and ozonation both the cell viability and 2 mib release fit to a two stage second order kinetic model with a threshold of kmno4 exposure ct while the reaction patterns followed straight line models under naclo and o3 exposures additionally eem spectra observed in this study turned out to support the results that iom was released much faster in the presence of o3 and the peak intensity became weakened with increasing reaction time in all three oxidation processes kmno4 is the most controllable one as its moderate reaction rate with the algae cells as regard to naclo the rates of cell lysis and release of intracellular organic matters including 2 mib were extremely rapid even under low exposure dosage such as 0 5 mg l 1 for 30 min contact according to this study what is worse naclo is not able to degrade 2 mib as its low oxidizing potential under ozonation the released 2 mib can be further degraded by residual o3 if the initial concentration is greater than 1 0 mg l 1 overall the types and dosages of oxidants should be deliberately selected for treating algae containing raw water acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation

measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer inesa instrument china the concentration of free chlorine during the oxidation was detected by the portal residual chlorine detector hach usa and the indigo method was used to measure residual ozone in the water according to bader h bader 1981 the suspensions were generated after filtration through 0 45 μm ptfe filter membrane anpel china for the measurement of total 2 mib permanganate free chlorine ozone and fluorescence index in the whole experiment in general all the experiments were performed at least in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of pseudoanabaena sp inactivation during the pre oxidation study the following three doses of each oxidant were chosen based on the real values applied in water treatment plants kmno4 doses of 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 naclo as chlorine doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg l 1 and o3 doses of 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 mg l 1 since the variations in the concentrations of the oxidants were not negligible pseudo second order equations were adopted and are expressed by eqs 3 5 3 d φ dt k y φ oxidant 4 φ ct φ 0 e k y ct 5 k y ln φ ct φ 0 ct where φct is photosynthetic capacity under a certain exposure value ct φ0 is the initial photosynthetic capacity of algae cells and k y is the second order decreasing rate of effective quantum yield i e inactivation rate the obtained inactivation rates followed the order ozonation chlorination permanganation fig 1 shows the experimental results of cell inactivation under exposure to the various oxidants the curves looked like a shoulder type exhibiting a lag phase during the early period this defined as two stage second order kinetics using a delayed chick watson model cho et al 2003 2004 in our previous research a study of toxin release under permanganation li et al 2014 in the present study the results indicated that the turning points occurred at 0 060 m s and 0 096 m s in the presence of 2 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 kmno4 respectively regarding to the data obtained using free chlorine and ozone fig 1b and c no lag phase was observed and the log value of cell viability decreased linearly function with the oxidant exposure meanwhile the reaction rates under chlorine and ozone exposure were significantly faster than those under permanganate several theories were previously developed to explain the inactivation under chlorine virto et al found that membrane damage is not a vital factor in the disinfection process and hurst proposed that damage to the electron transport chain and enzymes is the key to cell inactivation hurst et al 1991 virto et al 2005 however dukan suggested that a change in the membrane permeability during chlorination causes cell lysis and the release of iom such as proteins and dna dukan and touati 1996 zamyadi et al 2013 according to the current results the inactivation mechanism could be explained as follows as cyanobacteria cells carry negative charges on the conventional water treatment conditions hclo produced by naclo can permeate the cell with little hindrance because of its neutral and micromolecular properties ou et al 2011 then this permeated hclo can damage either the membrane or the enzyme system thereby decreasing the cell viability thus the mucilage does not function as a protectant and inactivation occurs immediately as a result the rate constants of chlorination were about five times faster than those of kmno4 exposure the reaction pattern of inactivation under ozonation is similar to that under chlorination but with significantly higher reaction rate due to the much higher oxidation potential of ozone 3 2 kinetics of 2 mib degradation to illustrate the change in the 2 mib concentration in an algae solution during oxidation models with second order kinetics were developed based on our previous research li et al 2014 the model for the variation in 2 mib was expressed in eq 6 which was derived from eq 1 6 d 2 mib e dt k d 2 mib e oxidant k r 2 mib i oxidant where 2 mibe 2 mibi and oxidant are the concentrations of extracellular 2 mib intracellular 2 mib and oxidant respectively at certain reaction times k d and k r are degradation and release constants of 2 mib which would highly impact the dominant reaction k d and k r can be calculated individually as discussed below according to the approaches provided in the methodology section the oxidation of 2 mib was performed in both an aom background and milli q water under kmno4 naclo and o3 exposure to calculate the degradation constants 2 mib was eliminated by less than 10 in aom solution with kmno4 and chlorine however as illustrated in fig 2 ozone removed 98 9 of the 2 mib in the aom solution with a rate of 258 67 m 1 s 1 which was only slightly slower than the rate of 284 10 m 1 s 1 obtained in milli q water several studies have discussed the mechanism for ozonation direct function by ozone molecule as well as indirect function by hydroxyl radicals oh von gunten 2003 the second order rate constants during oxidation of 2 mib by ozone molecule and oh have been estimated ko3 1 0 m 1 s 1 kho 5 1 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 glaze et al 1990 peter and von 2007 wert et al 2014 consequently oh played a major role in the ozonation of 2 mib for this study here the attained constant k 284 1 m 1 s 1 the removal rates of 2 mib was basically consistent with other studies which reported as 13 and 10 by kmno4 3 mg l 1 120 min contact time and hclo 3 mg l 1 120 min contact time respectively while the removal rate could reach 83 at an ozone dosage of 0 2 mg l min glaze et al 1990 in another study over 90 of both 2 mib and geosmin were removed after ozonation 4 19 mg l 1 20 min contact time yuan et al 2013 nonetheless lalezary et al reported that o3 was inefficiency for the removal of 2 mib and geosmin using dosages of up to 33 mg l 1 lalezary et al 1986 the different results for the removal rate could be that degradation of 2 mib depends on various parameters including oxidant dosages contact time ph initial 2 mib concentrations and the existence of nom 3 3 kinetics of intracellular 2 mib release the total and extracellular 2 mib concentrations were monitored under exposure to the various oxidants to determine the release of intracellular 2 mib as illustrated in fig 3 overall the total 2 mib decreased insignificantly during permanganation and chlorination in all cases indicating that both the two oxidants were inefficiency to degrade 2 mib the extracellular 2 mib increased with increasing exposure time during permanganation and chlorination except in the case of a low kmno4 dose 1 0 mg l 1 showing the occurrence of cell lysis the figures also indicated that most of the total 2 mib after permanganation was retained inside and cells kept integrity until the turning point i e critical value then abrupt cell lysis occurred which matched well with the previous discussion that cell viability decreased dramatically since the oxidants exposure reached ct y as shown in fig 1a however the variations in the total 2 mib concentrations exhibited different trends during ozonation with different initial o3 concentrations the removal rate of total 2 mib increased with increasing initial o3 concentration 53 4 under 0 5 mg l 1 88 4 under 1 0 mg l 1 in addition the extracellular 2 mib concentration increased remarkably at the beginning period implying that cells were damaged and that iom was released from the cells which was consistent with the results reported by xie et al in which less than 1 integral cells were left after 10 min ozonation at ozone dosages of 0 4 2 0 mg l 1 xie et al 2013 of note no obvious variations in either the total or extracellular 2 mib concentration were observed for the 0 2 mg l 1 o3 dose because the oxidant was rapidly depleted upon addition into the system thus no oxidant was available to destroy the cells these results were in accordance with previous investigation in which the o3 concentration decayed rapidly in the initial 30 s and was completely consumed within 5 min even with a dose of 4 or 6 mg l 1 fan et al 2013 this result implied that a minimum o3 dose was required for the treatment of water containing odor producing algae and the production of ozonation by products should be taken into consideration papageorgiou et al 2017 plummer and edzwald 2001 the ratio of extracellular total 2 mib ultimately increased from 0 35 to 0 90 and from 0 31 to 0 99 after 360 mins in the presence of kmno4 concentrations of 2 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 respectively and all the ratios of extracellular total 2 mib under the different initial naclo concentrations surpassed 0 7 within 30 min under ozonation 0 5 and 1 0 mg l 1 intracellular 2 mib was virtually undetected after 5 min indicating that complete destruction of the algae cell walls occurred consistent with the cell inactivation results as discussed in previous section the kinetics of 2 mib release during oxidation were proposed to fit the following second order kinetic model as expressed in eqs 7 9 7 d 2 mib i dt k r 2 mib i oxidant 8 2 mib i c t 2 mib i 0 e k r c t 9 k r ln 2 mib i c t 2 mib i 0 c t where 2 mibi ct is the intracellular 2 mib concentration at exposure of ct and the other parameters are the same as in eq 6 the modeling fitting is shown in fig 4 with the detailed fitting parameters listed in table 2 the unique modeling pattern of kmno4 was ascribed to the fact that as discussed in last section of note the ct r value of 2 mib was similar to ct y 0 068 and 0 094 m s compared to 0 060 and 0 096 m s table 1 which implied that 2 mib was released as soon as the cell wall collapsed the release rate constants under all the three oxidants exposures followed the same order as inactivation rates ozonation ky 2 69 104 m 1 s 1 kr 2 91 104 m 1 s 1 chlorination ky 152 92 m 1 s 1 kr 280 3 m 1 s 1 permanganation ky 35 88 m 1 s 1 kr 39 77 m 1 s 1 the kinetic constant under naclo exposure was 7 times faster than that under permanganation while the rate of intracellular 2 mib release by ozone was three orders of magnitude faster than that by the other two oxidants based on the results above it is reasonable to conclude that 2 mib release happened simultaneously with cell inactivation 3 4 eem evolution during oxidation the eem of aom is shown in si fig s1 pigments mostly phycoerythrin in this study have an intense fluorescence peak at an ex em wavelength of 500 580 540 620 nm which are unique substances that exist only inside cells thus pigments are a more precise indicator of cell lysis than the proteins or humic acid like matters monitored before chen et al 2003 li et al 2012 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 zhang et al 2014 in addition calculations of the peak intensity were conducted to quantify the extent of cell lysis during oxidation by combining the kinetics of both cell deactivation and 2 mib release the eem spectra of pigments in the extracellular solution during the reactions by three oxidants are shown in si fig s2 s10 as shown in si fig s3 and s4 a remarkable increase in the pigments concentrations of the extracellular solution occurred between 120 and 150 min corresponding exposure between 0 059 and 0 071 m s and between 60 and 90 min corresponding exposure between 0 097 and 0 143 m s under the kmno4 concentration of 2 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 respectively the behaviors match very well with cell photosynthetic capacity decrease ct y values were 0 060 m s and 0 096 m s respectively and 2 mib release ct r values were 0 068 and 0 094 m s respectively as illustrated in sections 3 2 and 3 3 similarly the rapid increase of the pigments intensities was also observed in the presence of both chlorine and ozone as illustrated in si fig s5 s10 which agreed with the pattern as shown in fig 3 as well of note the pigments peaks did not appear in the extracellular solution exposed to 1 0 mg l 1 kmno4 and 0 2 mg l 1 o3 for as long as the end of the experiment 120 min as shown in si fig s2 and s8 which confirmed that the cell integrity was maintained under low oxidants exposure where the oxidants decayed upon addition into the system and were depleted rapidly by the dissolved and cell bound organic matters the results agreed well with cell inactivation and the release of intracellular 2 mib in sections 3 2 and 3 3 in addition we observed that the pigments signal intensity weakened with increasing reaction time suggesting that the pigments would be easily oxidized by the oxidants residual after release this was also reported by other researchers korak et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 to sum up the eems of eom can be applied to explain the cell integrity and 2 mib release under different oxidants exposures it is a powerful approach to exam the cell lysis and therefore to predict the intracellular organic material release 4 conclusions kmno4 naclo and o3 are three of the mostly used agents for drinking water pre oxidation intracellular 2 mib release was observed during the reaction with all the three oxidants except under 1 0 mg l 1 kmno4 and 0 2 mg l 1 o3 exposures because the oxidant was quickly consumed upon addition into the system this study developed kinetic models for cell inactivation and 2 mib release and results showed that the reaction patterns during permanganation were different from that during chlorination and ozonation both the cell viability and 2 mib release fit to a two stage second order kinetic model with a threshold of kmno4 exposure ct while the reaction patterns followed straight line models under naclo and o3 exposures additionally eem spectra observed in this study turned out to support the results that iom was released much faster in the presence of o3 and the peak intensity became weakened with increasing reaction time in all three oxidation processes kmno4 is the most controllable one as its moderate reaction rate with the algae cells as regard to naclo the rates of cell lysis and release of intracellular organic matters including 2 mib were extremely rapid even under low exposure dosage such as 0 5 mg l 1 for 30 min contact according to this study what is worse naclo is not able to degrade 2 mib as its low oxidizing potential under ozonation the released 2 mib can be further degraded by residual o3 if the initial concentration is greater than 1 0 mg l 1 overall the types and dosages of oxidants should be deliberately selected for treating algae containing raw water acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation

19261,the high volume of flowback water fw generated during shale gas exploitation is highly saline and contains complex organics iron heavy metals and sulfate thereby posing a significant challenge for the environmental management of the unconventional natural gas industry herein the treatment of fw in a sulfur cycle mediated microbial fuel cell mfc is reported simultaneous removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand cod and total iron from a synthetic fw was achieved at 72 7 and 90 6 8 7 respectively with power generation of 2667 529 mw m3 in a closed circuit mfc cc mfc however much lower iron removal 38 5 4 5 occurred in the open circuit mfc oc mfc where the generated fes fine did not precipitate because of sulfide supersaturation enrichment of both sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob namely helicobacteraceae in the anolyte and the electricity producing bacteria namely desulfuromonadales on the anode likely accelerated the sulfur cycle through the biological and bioelectrochemical oxidation of sulfide in the anodic chamber and effectively increased the molar ratio of total iron to sulfide thus alleviating sulfide supersaturation in the closed circuitry enrichment of sob in the anolyte might be attributed to the formation of fes electricity wire and likely contributed to the stable high power generation bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi enriched in the anodic chamber were responsible for degrading complex organics in the fw the treatment of real fw in the sulfur cycle mediated mfc also achieved high efficiency this research provides a promising approach for the treatment of wastewater containing organic matters heavy metals and sulfate by using a sulfur cycle mediated mfc graphical abstract image 1 keywords flowback water treatment simultaneous removal of cod and iron microbial fuel cell sulfur cycle sulfur oxidizing bacteria 1 introduction shale gas a more environment friendly and renewable natural gas has been widely exploited due to the application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technique however this technique consumes significant quantities of water during hydraulic fracturing process subsequently producing large volumes of flowback water fw vidic et al 2013 fw is wastewater that characterized by high salinity and hardness and various pollutants such as suspended solids and metals complex organic matters from hydraulic fracturing fluid and shale formations and naturally occurring radioactive materials luek and gonsior 2017 vidic et al 2013 owing to the minerals dissolution from geologic formations the salinity of fw increases over time kondash et al 2017 this wastewater typically contains 10 200 mg l irons estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 and 0 3663 mg l sulfate alley et al 2011 accidental spill out or improper treatment of the effluent fw will cause serious pollution of aquatic environments vidic et al 2013 reuse of fw after adequate pretreatment is the preferable treatment estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 u s epa 2016 but the organic matter in fw can cause proliferation of sulfate reducing bacteria srb which results in clogging and reservoir souring and promotes microbe induced corrosion in storage tanks or pipeline jain et al 2017 iron concentration above 10 mg l can lead to over crosslinking and temperature instability and may limit the reuse of fw in hydraulic fracturing oetjen et al 2018 in addition microbial growth iron based and other mineral scaling also can easily induce membrane fouling during the desalination process which is required for the reuse or surface discharge of fw and can cause significant economic losses to the industry shaffer et al 2013 therefore the organic matters and commonly existed iron in fw required intensive removal generally the removals of partial organic matters and iron as low as 1 100 mg l can be realized via physical and chemical methods but are ineffective or expensive abourached et al 2014 estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 conventional biological treatment is also infeasible because of the complex constituents high tds and sulfate moieties of fw jain et al 2017 notably microbial fuel cells mfcs in which exoelectrogens generate electricity from organic wastes is more advantageous in the pretreatment of fw because of simultaneous energy recovery and pollutant removal under high salinity monzon et al 2015 treatments of hypersaline produced water from hydraulic fracturing by the mfc and the microbial capacitive deionization cell have been investigated and reached high power densities and fine cod remove efficiencies monzon et al 2017 shrestha et al 2018 the high salinity in the water significantly cuts down the ohmic resistance in mfcs which is an important criterion for scale up and subsequent commercial applicability but owning to the existence of sulfate in fw biological sulfate reduction and sulfur cycle will easily occur in the anodic chamber jain et al 2017 however the role of sulfur cycle in treating fw via mfcs has not been studied the biological sulfate reduction in the anodic chamber mainly producing sulfide can help to degrade complex organics in mfc daghio et al 2015 sulfide can be oxidized by sob mainly colonizing on the anode and the anode producing electricity rabaey et al 2006 sun et al 2010 the produced sulfide can also be used to remove heavy metals by forming insoluble metal sulfides producing minimal secondary sludge in the mfc for instance with a little amount of sulfate and lactate in the electrolyte cd zn and cu could be effectively removed mainly via sulfide precipitation and biosorption in the anodic chamber of mfcs abourached et al 2014 miran et al 2017 as the same iron can also be removed by reacting with sulfide and forming insoluble iron sulfides kiran et al 2017 nevertheless for anaerobic fermentation which also occurs in the anodic chamber srikanth and mohan 2012 the heavy metal removal efficiency was dramatically reduced with the presence of excessive sulfide hs and h2s especially when the molar ratio of metal to sulfide was below 1 6 in a synthetic sulfide system or below 1 0 in a biological system mokone et al 2012 the reason is that small metal sulfide particles also called fines with poor solid liquid separation characteristics were generated during that process mokone et al 2012 villa gomez et al 2011 notably sulfide can be biologically or electrochemically oxidized to sulfur on the anode in bio electrochemical systems rabaey et al 2006 which may help to reduce sulfide concentration and alleviate sulfide supersaturation in the anolyte however the treatment of fw by a sulfur cycle mediated mfc has not been studied how sulfide converts when a larger amount of sulfate is reduced in the anodic chamber is still unknown furthermore the removal efficiency of iron from fw in the anodic chamber of mfcs remains unclear when the sulfide concentration is excessive in this study a sulfur cycle mediated mfc was first used for the simultaneous removal of organic matter and iron from fw as well as power generation the mechanism of iron removal from fw with the presence of excessive sulfide was proposed furthermore the microbial community was studied to illuminate the superiority of simultaneous removal of complex organics and iron in this mfc sob enrichment in the anolyte and electricity producing bacteria domination on the anode likely accelerated the sulfur cycle thus contributing to the efficient iron removal and stable power generation the results show the potential of treating fw with sulfur cycle mediated mfcs the efficient alleviation of sulfide oversaturation in this research also provides an important reference for heavy metal removal in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc construction the air breathing mfc was composed of two 50 ml chambers separated by a nafion 117 proton exchange membrane fuel cell store us anodic and cathodic electrodes of the mfcs were prepared from a circular 1071 hcb carbon felt and wet proofed carbon cloth fuel cell store us respectively and each had the projected surface area of 12 56 cm2 the air breathing cathode was coated with 0 5 mg cm2 platinum a labeled photo of the mfc was shown in fig s1a 2 2 source of inoculum and wastewater the sludge for inoculation was collected in an anaerobic digestion tank with total dissolved solids concentration of 13 1 g l from a wastewater treatment plant anodic effluent from a mature mfc in our laboratory was also used as the anodic inoculum the synthetic fw used as anodic influent contained 1348 112 mg cod l 247 5 23 0 mg so4 2 l 13000 mg salinity l and 24 9 2 4 mg fe3 l and had a ph of 7 0 0 1 organic constituents in the synthetic fw were based on the disclosed industry formulas of hydraulic fracturing fluid stringfellow et al 2014 glutaraldehyde methanol anionic polyacrylamide with a molecular weight of 12 million dalton guar gum citric acid acetic acid ethylene glycol isopropanol were added to synthetic fw as the typical biocide corrosion inhibitor friction reducer gelling agent iron control ph adjusting agent scale inhibitor and surfactant respectively and the inorganic ions mainly containing na mg2 fe3 k ca2 cl so4 2 were referenced from the literature lester et al 2015 and analysis results of real fw from our laboratory data not shown the detailed information of those components in synthetic fw was shown in table s1 and s2 this synthetic fw was clear and stable after the placement at ambient temperature for 10 days fig s2 the total iron concentration was stable likely owing to the additives of iron control scale inhibitor and surfactant in the synthetic fw the real fw used in this research contained 1137 138 mg cod l 154 4 15 7 mg so4 2 l 27 2 4 2 mg fe3 l and 18899 1172 mg tds l and had a ph of 7 1 0 2 a mineral mixture 10 ml and a vitamin mixture 10 ml zhang et al 2013 were added into 1 l of fw a phosphate buffer ph 7 2 containing 0 1 g nacl l was used as the catholyte 2 3 mfc setup and operation the mfcs were initially seeded with the sludge at 20 v v of the anode chamber volume and 5 ml anodic effluent two mfcs worked in closed circuitry designated as cc 1 and cc 2 while the other two mfcs worked in open circuitry designated as oc 1 and oc 2 to simulate anaerobic fermentation after inoculation the anolyte was purged with a gas mixture of n2 co2 80 20 for 30 min before the anodic chamber was sealed to maintain an anaerobic microenvironment the electrical style schematics of cc and oc mfcs were shown in fig s1 the mfcs were operated in fed batch mode under ambient conditions for a long duration 256 days which consisted of four phases in the first three phases the mfcs were all fed with synthetic fw whereas in phase 4 the real fw from a well in china drilled for shale gas exploitation 1 hf was injected into cc 1 and oc 1 the anodic chamber was feed with 45 ml of anolyte the effluent was removed by using a syringe gas collecting bags full of n2 were used to keep pressure balancing in reactors from phase 2 when the anolyte was refreshed all precipitates and anodic effluents were discharged first then 20 anodic effluent from cc 2 was reinjected into both open and closed circuit anode chambers separately as inoculum for subsequent operations the hydraulic retention time hrt was prolonged from 10 to 20 days in phase 2 but it reverted to 10 days in phases 3 and 4 the ratios of real fw in the influent for the five cycles during phase 4 were 25 33 50 100 and 100 respectively 2 4 mfc calculations and chemical analysis the cell voltage over a fixed 1000 ω external resistor was recorded by a usb 1608fs data acquisition device measurement computing corporation us at 0 02 hz frequency the power density was calculated based on the volume of the anodic chamber non turnover cyclic voltammetry cv was conducted using an ivium n stat multi channel electrochemical workstation ivium netherlands with the anode as the working electrode ag agcl reference electrode was also employed in the anodic chamber the cvs were conducted with a scan rate of 1 mv s and a scan range from 1 2 to 1 4 v all potentials reported and referred to in this study were versus she cod was determined by an improved measurement for fw cardona et al 2016 total iron in the anodic effluents was measured using phenanthroline spectrophotometry harvey et al 1955 for total iron analysis samples were acidified to ph 1 using hcl the concentrations of sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate anions in the anodic effluent following 0 45 μm filtration were detected with a dionex ics 5000 ion chromatograph the soluble sulfide concentrations hs and h2s in the filtered effluent sample were measured using the methylene blue method lee et al 2014 and total sulfide concentrations in the unfiltered samples collected during the cycle were measured according to cord ruwisch 1985 the removal efficiencies of cod total iron and sulfate were calculated based on the absolute changes of concentrations during a cycle in the anodic compartment surface elements of the used and clean anodes were analyzed employing jeol jsm 7800f scanning electron microscope sem coupled with an energy dispersive x ray edx detector respectively sangcharoen et al 2015 precipitate compositions were studied via an x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi by mainly recording iron and sulfur xps spectra the valences of sulfur accumulating on the used anode were also determined by recording the sulfur xps spectra 2 5 16s rdna library construction and microbial population characterization the microbial community of the anode attaching microorganisms cc and oc a and planktonic microorganisms in the anolyte cc and oc p from cc and oc mfcs were determined using v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene this region was amplified using bacterial primers 338f and 806r 16s rrna gene libraries were constructed with these purified amplicons as templates and then sequenced using the hiseq2500 pe250 sequencing platform the details for the construction of 16s rrna gene library and bioinformatics analysis were shown in supplementary material 3 results and discussions 3 1 cod and iron removal and power generation based on mfc performance organic compounds in fw were effectively removed in those two types of mfcs fig 1 a from phases 1 to 3 stable cod removal efficiencies in cc mfcs were 72 7 73 3 and 72 6 respectively which were a slightly lower than a previous study shrestha et al 2018 probably because of the different characteristic of the wastewater the efficiencies in oc mfcs were almost identical to those in cc mfcs which were likely attributable to the high concentrations of sulfate in the anolyte acting as an electron acceptor for srb sun et al 2010 when the power generation sharply decreased during the 7th cycle the removal efficiency still stabilized fig 1a suggesting that bacteria in the suspension may contribute substantially to the cod removal similar changes in cod concentrations during a typical cycle at the beginning of phase 3 also indicated the organic compound oxidation at the anode did not seem to be the main mechanism for cod removal fig s3a but the cod behavior during a latter cycle showed that more organics were removed in the first half of the cycle with a bit higher removal efficiency in closed circuitry fig s3b thus the exoelectrogens likely increasingly contributed to organics oxidation during the latter cycles microbial communities were further studied in section 3 5 in addition the similar cod removal during phase 2 with a prolonged hrt indicated that the remaining cod was likely non biodegradable this probably benefit the fw reuse as the effluent may subsequently reduce the biocide dosage in wastewater preservation and alleviate membrane fouling during desalination a superiority in iron removal was attained in cc mfcs shown in fig 1b in the first two cycles during phase 1 total iron was effectively removed from both anodic chambers with efficiencies of 96 7 1 0 and 94 0 10 4 in cc and oc mfcs respectively the soluble sulfide concentrations in the effluent were both lower than 1 37 0 33 mg l black particles precipitated in the bottom of the chambers making the effluent almost clear however during the 3th cycle when the sulfide concentration reached 4 28 0 42 mg l in oc mfcs the black particles did not disappear and thus reduced the removal efficiency to 42 3 0 6 whereas lower sulfide concentrations were still produced in cc mfcs concomitantly with much higher removal efficiency during this time in phase 2 the discharge of black precipitates and the prolonged hrt likely benefited the total iron removal but sulfide rapidly accumulated again only in oc mfcs accompanied with a decreased iron removal thus the soluble sulfide concentration of the effluent showed a largely negative effect on iron removal differential sulfur conversion likely occurred between cc and oc mfcs in phase 3 after changing the hrt back the removal efficiency in oc mfcs sharply decreased to 38 5 4 5 the effluent was black fig s4 as sulfide concentration increased to 5 13 0 32 mg l this high concentration might be resulted from srb enrichment and the slow sulfide conversion in oc mfc however a high and stable efficiency of 90 6 8 7 was maintained in cc mfcs accompanied with much less sulfide production 0 13 0 20 mg l and clear effluent the sulfur cycle in the cc mfc should play an important role in the enhancement of total iron removal the ph values of the effluents were 6 9 0 1 and 7 1 0 1 from closed and open circuitry respectively thus the efficient iron removal could not be attributed to the formation of hydroxide precipitates the xps results certificated that black precipitates mainly were ferric sulfide and the iron removal mechanism was further studied in section 3 2 power density in cc mfcs rapidly increased to 1685 370 mw m3 in phase 1 fig 1d which suggested fast formation of electricity producing biofilm the density kept increasing during phase 2 except for the 7th cycle which might be caused by the prolonged hrt at the previous cycle it gradually stabilized to 2636 476 mw m3 in phase 3 the bio electrochemical oxidation of the produced sulfide on the anode likely also contributed to the power generation rabaey et al 2006 as shown in the non turnover cyclic voltammetry analysis fig s5 the wide oxidative peak at 0 59 v from cc mfc indicated irreversible metabolism on the anode regarding the combined oxidation of polysulfide and sulfide to sulfur lin et al 2016 the voltammetry of cc mfc also showed an obvious redox couple with a wide oxidative peak at 0 47 v and a reductive peak at 0 94 v this couple may be related to the reversible oxidation reduction of a ferredoxin with a 4fe 4s cluster heering et al 1995 rabus et al 2013 and contribute to transferring electrons to the anode furthermore the produced fes in the anolyte may benefit the electron transfer from the planktonic bacteria to the anode kondo et al 2015 moreover the stable high power density during the long period differed from a previous study that its voltage rapidly decreased after two weeks because of the serious accumulation of elemental sulfur on the anode sangcharoen et al 2015 thus the microbial community in the current anodic chamber likely played an important role in stabilizing the output power 3 2 mechanism for total iron removal the xps spectra of fe 2p a and s 2p b region of precipitates in those two kinds of mfcs were shown in fig 2 the characteristic peaks at 710 7 ev and 724 6 ev were corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 peaks of fe2 respectively the peak at 708 6 ev and 712 2 ev indicated the existence of fe2 in fes2 and a little amount of fe3 respectively fig 2a fan et al 2018 yamashita and hayes 2008 the peaks at 161 4 and 162 4 ev were both assigned to s 2p of s2 the peak at 163 9 ev was corresponding to disulfide s2 2 peaks at 168 60 ev 164 8 ev and 163 1 ev were assigned to s 2p of surface bound so4 2 elemental sulfur s0 and polysulfide sn 2 respectively fig 2b fan et al 2018 therefore the majority of iron was likely removed during the formation of insoluble fes as the iron in the anolyte of both mfcs was all in the form of fe2 on day 3 and 10 of one cycle data not shown the little amount of fe3 may result from the oxidizing of fes on the surface during the preparation of the sample for analysis these different forms of sulfur on the surface were consistent with previous researches microbial generated hs ion was oxidized at the fes surface yielding s0 then s0 partly reacted with hs to form polysulfide mostly in the form of s2 2 in ph 5 10 which was associated with microorganisms kiran et al 2017 kondo et al 2015 sulfidization was reported to be a force in ferric reduction even in low sulfate systems flynn et al 2014 hansel et al 2015 as reported ferrihydrite reduction did not precede sulfate reduction under neutral ph conditions despite low sulfate concentrations and regardless of iron oxides substrates hansel et al 2015 because microbial substrate preference was dictated by energy demand rather than supply amenabar et al 2017 yan et al 2012 also reported no suppress in sulfate reduction with combination of fe3 addition and electrode employment in the reactor furthermore total iron was effectively removed mainly in the form of fes in this sulfur cycle mediated mfc with low fe3 concentration about 0 45 mm this differed to the previous research that biological fe3 reduction rate elevated with the increase of fe3 concentration and was only 15 5 at 3 mm wu et al 2013 thus the sulfide produced by biological sulfate reduction was likely the dominant force to reduce ferric iron forming ferrous sulfide in this study a typical process of total iron removal in one cycle confirmed that sulfide supersaturation occurred in both mfcs during the cycle fig 3 the molar ratios of iron to sulfide in the anolyte from cc and oc mfcs were 0 66 and 0 32 respectively on day 3 and 0 61 and 0 60 respectively on day 7 but the supersaturation was gradually alleviated in cc mfcs as the ratio increased to 3 09 on day 10 while it only increased to 1 00 in oc mfcs the increasing ratio was likely attributed to sulfide conversion in the anodic chamber the decrease in sulfide concentration from day 7 10 in oc mfcs did not promote iron removal fig 3 which might be caused by the remaining supersaturation and the major formation of polysulfide with comparison the removal efficiency in the cc mfc was much higher since the 3rd day though the ratios were far less than 1 bioprecipitation by srb biomass may affect total iron removal in both oc and cc mfcs abourached et al 2014 but actually the sulfur cycle in the anodic chamber shown in section 3 3 from cc mfcs made a major contribution to the efficient removal 3 3 sulfate and sulfide behaviors sulfate reduction tended to be increased for both cc and oc mfcs in phases1 and 3 table s3 yet the reduction slowed down during phase 2 which might be caused by the drainage of precipitates attaching to anaerobic biomass kiran et al 2017 in phase 3 the efficiency gradually increased to 90 7 1 6 and 61 1 3 7 in the oc and cc mfc respectively which confirmed the function of sulfate acting as the electron acceptor for organic compounds oxidation the sulfate removal processes during the first and the last cycle of phase 3 further confirmed the increasing sulfate removal efficiency in both cc and oc mfcs and the notably higher efficiency in oc mfcs fig 4 from the removal process the sulfate concentration slightly increased during the second half of the cycle but the increase was more obvious in cc mfcs during the last cycle fig 4 this may also contribute to the low sulfate removal efficiency during phase 2 furthermore no sulfite was found in either cc or oc mfcs thiosulfate was only detected in the oc mfc which likely meant a quick conversion of it in the cc mfc lee et al 2014 the change in sulfide concentration likely responded to that increase as it peaked on the first two days and then decreased especially a little faster during the second half of the cycle fig 4c this finding was in line with the previous observation supposing a back oxidation of sulfide to sulfate on the anode matturro et al 2017 sob capable of oxidizing sulfide sulfur and thiosulfate yamamoto et al 2010 might contributed to the sulfate increase in those mfcs in addition the surface analysis via sem eds and xps fig s6a showed that some s0 was also accumulated on the anode surface of the cc mfc accompanied with a little s2 2 which concurred with the previous study rabaey et al 2006 the back oxidation in the anode chamber may contribute to alleviating severe s0 accumulation whereas almost no s0 or s2 2 was detected on the anode in the oc mfc suggesting that these produced sulfur compounds attached on precipitates were likely the main reason for sulfide removal in the oc mfc this result coincided with the lower molar ratios of sulfide produced to sulfate removed rsp sr in the effluent from the cc mfcs table s3 therefore the cc mfc could accelerate heavy metal removal because the produced sulfide was also partially channeled to the electricity production through anodic oxidation and oxidized to sulfate which likely increased the molar ratio of iron to sulfide and changed the surface charge of the fines 3 4 treatment of real fw real fw was injected into the cc 1 and oc 1 during phase 4 the biodegradable cod in the real wastewater was calculated as reported before lagarde et al 2005 and accounted for only 20 of total cod fig s7 to promote the adaptability of the microbial community we gradually increased the ratio of real fw in influent from 25 to 100 fig 5 finally when 100 real fw was used the cod removal efficiency reached 72 in the cc mfc and 64 in the oc mfc the long term domestication may contribute to this fine removal output power density gradually increased and finally maximized at 4057 mw m3 which could be attributed to the high salinity of the real fw liu et al 2005 and the fine adaptability of electricity producing bacteria sulfate reduction also caused sulfide supersaturation in the anolyte of the oc mfc with molar ratios of iron to sulfide 0 61 fig s8 but the supersaturation was obviously alleviated in the closed circuitry with the molar ratios far more than 1 fig s8 the iron removal efficiency gradually increased maximizing at 97 5 in the cc mfc but sharply decreased to 33 in the oc mfc this might be caused by the microbiological inadaptability to the sulfide conversion in the open circuitry when treating real fw therefore the sulfur cycle mediated mfc is highly capable of treating real fw 3 5 microbial community analysis over 37 700 effective sequences for each sample were obtained table 1 rarefaction curves showed that the sequence volumes reasonably represented the microbial communities fig s9 information concerning the 16s rrna gene clone library analysis was shown in table 1 compared with the oc mfc the community richness decreased in both the anode and anolyte of the cc mfc but the community diversity from the anode slightly increased the principal component analysis pca based on otus fig 6 showed that the communities in the cc mfc obviously differed to those in the oc mfc the population on the anode also showed significant difference to those in the anolyte of the cc mfc but they were relatively close to each other in the oc mfc therefore the different operation mode of the mfc have significant impact on microbial community composition and the communities from different sections especially in the cc mfc may play different roles in mfc performance 3 5 1 microbial communities from the anode in cc and oc mfcs bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteria and chloroflexi shown in fig s10 dominated on the anode at phylum level their abundances in the cc mfc were 22 7 27 5 16 0 15 4 and 6 7 respectively which were obviously different from those in the oc mfc 53 6 10 8 7 8 1 5 and 8 7 respectively the front three phyla were reported to constitute a large part of the bacterial community in real fw bacteroidetes and firmicutes also dominated in the mfc treating raw landfill leachate kumar et al 2017 bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria always link to fermentation and hydrolysis some members in bacteroidetes and firmicutes were reported to produce electricity and degrade complex organics kumar et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 the more abundant firmicutes in the cc mfc might help to stabilize the mfc performance when treating real fw as this phylum was reported to survive under various conditions by producing endospores zhang et al 2013 the community analysis at family level fig 7 showed that the fermentative families prolixibacteraceae 49 7 within bacteroidetes and carnobacteriaceae 21 7 within firmicutes were the most abundant in the oc and cc mfc respectively coriobacteriaceae an anaerobic fermentative bacteria within actinobacteria specially localized on the anode in closed circuity 11 9 it might contribute to the electricity production because of its c type cytochrome and monomethylmenaquinone 6 its major respiratory quinone clavel et al 2014 generally proteobacteria contains anode respiring bacteria srb and sob muyzer and stams 2008 as predicted a large amount of unclassified desulfuromonadales 8 0 belonging to proteobacteria was specially accumulated on the anode of the cc mfc and likely made major contribution to electricity production in this research fig 7 this family is more competitive in colonizing the anode and producing electricity bond et al 2002 desulfuromonadales is also known for its capacity to use deposited s0 as mediator oxidizing acetate in bioelectrochemical system dutta et al 2009 desulfuromonas species within desulfuromonadales contain ferredoxins that can donate electrons for some reductases catalyzing subsequent sulfur reduction rabus et al 2013 it was concurred with the nonturnover cv results fig s5 meanwhile regarding to sulfate reduction chloroflexi and synergistaceaev can also make contributions rabus et al 2013 in closed circuitry 6 7 unclassified chloroflexi 0 8 desulfuromonadaceae and 0 6 synergistaceae were likely critical for sulfate reduction srb also were reported to colonize the anode in the previous research sangcharoen et al 2015 while srb in the oc mfc were much more abundant including 8 7 chloroflexi 4 6 synergistaceae 4 4 desulfobacteraceae 1 0 desulfobulbaceae and 0 7 peptococcaceae and played significantly important role in its higher sulfate removal efficiency desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae and rhodocyclaceae 1 1 in cc a are also complex organics degrader daghio et al 2015 besides anaerolineaceae around 5 7 in both cc and oc mfcs within chloroflexi can also degrade complex organics the co existence of fermentative bacteria with srb and exoelectrogens likely formed a syntrophic association and benefited the stability and survival of the community rabaey et al 2005 sun et al 2010 small molecule organic compounds produced by fermentative bacteria could be oxidized by both srb and exoelectrogens which likely played an important role in the efficient complex organics removal and electricity production in this study 1 4 ectothiorhodospiraceae and 0 38 pseudomonas within proteobacteria were specifically accumulated on the anode in the cc mfc fig 7 they can oxidize a diverse set of sulfur compounds friedrich et al 2001 some desulfuromonadales genera were also reported to effectively oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfate using the anode as the sole electron acceptor zhang et al 2014 which may also contribute to the alleviation of severe elemental sulfur accumulation therefore those enriched sob likely contributed to the existence of elemental sulfur on the anode as well as the increase of sulfate concentration in the second half of the cycle whereas there was almost no sob on the anode from the oc mfc 3 5 2 microbial communities from the anolyte in cc and oc mfcs communities in the anolyte were also dominated by those five phyla mentioned above shown in fig s10 prolixibacteraceae 16 4 and propionibacteriaceae 25 6 were the most abundant families in the oc and cc mfc respectively fig 7 the latter can produce lactate propionate and acetate through fermentation which may benefit the metabolism of desulfuromonadales in the cc mfc rabus et al 2013 ruminococcaceae accumulated in the anolyte of the cc 7 2 and oc mfc 3 5 respectively besides rhodocyclaceae 4 3 in oc p xanthobacteraceaewas 0 95 in cc p and anaerolineaceae 8 0 in the anolyte of both mfcs are important complex organics degraders those enriched bacteria likely also significantly contributed to the efficient cod removal from fw families contributing to sulfate reduction in anolyte were more abundant than on anodes and mainly contained 7 5 chloroflexi 2 2 synergistaceae and 0 6 desulfobacteraceae in cc mfc srb abundances in the oc mfc were much higher including 8 5 chloroflexi 5 0 synergistaceae 4 9 desulfobacteraceae and 1 6 desulfobulbaceae they were likely the major reason for sulfate removal in both cc and oc mfcs noticeably a large amount of sob within proteobacteria friedrich et al 2001 nakagawa et al 2007 were specially found in the cc mfc fig 7 including 10 4 helicobacteraceae 0 95 xanthobacteraceae 0 9 halothiobacillacae and 0 6 ectothiorhodospiraceae while only 2 9 ectothiorhodospiraceae was enriched in the oc mfc helicobacteraceae mainly contained the chemolithoautotrophic genera of sulfurovum in this study this genera can oxidize certain sulfur containing compounds e g s0 s2 and s2o3 2 as energy resources producing sulfate nakagawa et al 2007 yamamoto et al 2010 therefore the dominant sulfurovum and the other sob likely played a very important role in biological sulfide removal and the increase in sulfate concentration during the operational cycle and thus accelerated the sulfur cycle in cc mfcs the enriched sob may also benefit the stable and long term high electricity production in this mfc because the oxidation of elemental sulfur and sulfide by sob would avoid severe elemental sulfur accumulation on the anode and alleviate the toxicity of high sulfide concentration to exoelectricigen the slight increase in sulfate in the oc mfc may result from the activity of ectothiorhodospiraceae the formation of fes in our research likely benefited the metabolism of sob in the anolyte fes is confirmed to act as naturally occurring electrical wires that mediate long distance extracellular electron transfer and bridge spatially discrete redox environments kondo et al 2015 motile biominerals which were formed from metal precipitation on bacterial cells during biological sulfate reduction could be used to maintain metabolism and electron transfer reactions ntarlagiannis et al 2005 nakamura et al 2010a cells have also been demonstrated to form an interconnected network through the produced biogenic minerals nakamura et al 2010a electrons transported from hydrothermal fluids via iron sulfides can also be directly used by chemolithotrophic microbes nakamura et al 2010b sulfurovum is known to contain the polysulfide reductase psr this reductase locates on the cytoplasmic membrane of sulfurovum and is capable of oxidizing sulfide and reducing menaquinone yamamoto et al 2010 psr was supposed as a key reductase to mediate sulfur respiratory system where electrons produced during the oxidation of sulfide on the fes surface could be transported to the distant anode through the extracellular fes matrix kondo et al 2015 meanwhile a cytochrome c in the membrane of sulfurovum responsible for its thiosulfate oxidizing activity might also specifically interact with the biogenic fes to facilitate extracellular electron transport from bacterial cells to the distant anode surface nakamura et al 2010a yamamoto et al 2010 therefore the transport of electrons from sob to the anode via fes matrix was likely the main reason for the enrichment of sulfurovum especially in the anolyte of closed circuitry sob were also reported to be enriched in the anolyte of mfc in a previous research with high concentrations of iron and sulfate in the influent kumar et al 2017 besides the available nitrogen source from hpam in closed circuitry which could effectively degraded hpam cui et al 2015 probably also benefited the sob growth in closed circuitry furthermore fe 3 might also be an advantage to the existence of sulfurovum in both closed and open circuitry nakagawa et al 2007 but need to be further investigated because of the large amount of sulfide in the anolyte based on these results and those of the earlier studies rabus et al 2013 kumar et al 2017 miran et al 2017 proposed mechanisms of simultaneous removal of complex organics and iron from fw by the sulfur cycle mediated mfc were schematically shown in fig 8 this sulfur cycle mediated mfc provides an alternative approach for the treatment of fw from fracturing of shale gas simultaneously removing complex organics and iron to enable the reuse and or discharge of treated effluent the pretreatment for suspended solid removal and the post treatment for desalination is required however more challenges still need to be addressed to fw desalination 4 conclusions simultaneous removal of cod and iron from the synthetic fw was realized in a sulfur cycle mediated mfc with the removal efficiencies of 90 6 8 7 for iron and 72 6 for cod and a power density of 2636 476 mw m3 furthermore real fw was more effectively treated with higher total iron removal efficiency and power generation the dominant microorganisms of sulfurovum and unclassified desulfuromonadales in the anolyte and on the anode respectively played essential roles in biological and electrochemical oxidation of sulfide to sulfate thus accelerating the sulfur cycle and improving iron removal sob enrichment in the anolyte contributed to stable and long term high power generation through avoiding severe elemental sulfur accumulation on the anode bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi which were enriched in this sulfur cycle mediated mfc were responsible for the efficient removal of complex organics

19261,the high volume of flowback water fw generated during shale gas exploitation is highly saline and contains complex organics iron heavy metals and sulfate thereby posing a significant challenge for the environmental management of the unconventional natural gas industry herein the treatment of fw in a sulfur cycle mediated microbial fuel cell mfc is reported simultaneous removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand cod and total iron from a synthetic fw was achieved at 72 7 and 90 6 8 7 respectively with power generation of 2667 529 mw m3 in a closed circuit mfc cc mfc however much lower iron removal 38 5 4 5 occurred in the open circuit mfc oc mfc where the generated fes fine did not precipitate because of sulfide supersaturation enrichment of both sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob namely helicobacteraceae in the anolyte and the electricity producing bacteria namely desulfuromonadales on the anode likely accelerated the sulfur cycle through the biological and bioelectrochemical oxidation of sulfide in the anodic chamber and effectively increased the molar ratio of total iron to sulfide thus alleviating sulfide supersaturation in the closed circuitry enrichment of sob in the anolyte might be attributed to the formation of fes electricity wire and likely contributed to the stable high power generation bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi enriched in the anodic chamber were responsible for degrading complex organics in the fw the treatment of real fw in the sulfur cycle mediated mfc also achieved high efficiency this research provides a promising approach for the treatment of wastewater containing organic matters heavy metals and sulfate by using a sulfur cycle mediated mfc graphical abstract image 1 keywords flowback water treatment simultaneous removal of cod and iron microbial fuel cell sulfur cycle sulfur oxidizing bacteria 1 introduction shale gas a more environment friendly and renewable natural gas has been widely exploited due to the application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technique however this technique consumes significant quantities of water during hydraulic fracturing process subsequently producing large volumes of flowback water fw vidic et al 2013 fw is wastewater that characterized by high salinity and hardness and various pollutants such as suspended solids and metals complex organic matters from hydraulic fracturing fluid and shale formations and naturally occurring radioactive materials luek and gonsior 2017 vidic et al 2013 owing to the minerals dissolution from geologic formations the salinity of fw increases over time kondash et al 2017 this wastewater typically contains 10 200 mg l irons estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 and 0 3663 mg l sulfate alley et al 2011 accidental spill out or improper treatment of the effluent fw will cause serious pollution of aquatic environments vidic et al 2013 reuse of fw after adequate pretreatment is the preferable treatment estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 u s epa 2016 but the organic matter in fw can cause proliferation of sulfate reducing bacteria srb which results in clogging and reservoir souring and promotes microbe induced corrosion in storage tanks or pipeline jain et al 2017 iron concentration above 10 mg l can lead to over crosslinking and temperature instability and may limit the reuse of fw in hydraulic fracturing oetjen et al 2018 in addition microbial growth iron based and other mineral scaling also can easily induce membrane fouling during the desalination process which is required for the reuse or surface discharge of fw and can cause significant economic losses to the industry shaffer et al 2013 therefore the organic matters and commonly existed iron in fw required intensive removal generally the removals of partial organic matters and iron as low as 1 100 mg l can be realized via physical and chemical methods but are ineffective or expensive abourached et al 2014 estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 conventional biological treatment is also infeasible because of the complex constituents high tds and sulfate moieties of fw jain et al 2017 notably microbial fuel cells mfcs in which exoelectrogens generate electricity from organic wastes is more advantageous in the pretreatment of fw because of simultaneous energy recovery and pollutant removal under high salinity monzon et al 2015 treatments of hypersaline produced water from hydraulic fracturing by the mfc and the microbial capacitive deionization cell have been investigated and reached high power densities and fine cod remove efficiencies monzon et al 2017 shrestha et al 2018 the high salinity in the water significantly cuts down the ohmic resistance in mfcs which is an important criterion for scale up and subsequent commercial applicability but owning to the existence of sulfate in fw biological sulfate reduction and sulfur cycle will easily occur in the anodic chamber jain et al 2017 however the role of sulfur cycle in treating fw via mfcs has not been studied the biological sulfate reduction in the anodic chamber mainly producing sulfide can help to degrade complex organics in mfc daghio et al 2015 sulfide can be oxidized by sob mainly colonizing on the anode and the anode producing electricity rabaey et al 2006 sun et al 2010 the produced sulfide can also be used to remove heavy metals by forming insoluble metal sulfides producing minimal secondary sludge in the mfc for instance with a little amount of sulfate and lactate in the electrolyte cd zn and cu could be effectively removed mainly via sulfide precipitation and biosorption in the anodic chamber of mfcs abourached et al 2014 miran et al 2017 as the same iron can also be removed by reacting with sulfide and forming insoluble iron sulfides kiran et al 2017 nevertheless for anaerobic fermentation which also occurs in the anodic chamber srikanth and mohan 2012 the heavy metal removal efficiency was dramatically reduced with the presence of excessive sulfide hs and h2s especially when the molar ratio of metal to sulfide was below 1 6 in a synthetic sulfide system or below 1 0 in a biological system mokone et al 2012 the reason is that small metal sulfide particles also called fines with poor solid liquid separation characteristics were generated during that process mokone et al 2012 villa gomez et al 2011 notably sulfide can be biologically or electrochemically oxidized to sulfur on the anode in bio electrochemical systems rabaey et al 2006 which may help to reduce sulfide concentration and alleviate sulfide supersaturation in the anolyte however the treatment of fw by a sulfur cycle mediated mfc has not been studied how sulfide converts when a larger amount of sulfate is reduced in the anodic chamber is still unknown furthermore the removal efficiency of iron from fw in the anodic chamber of mfcs remains unclear when the sulfide concentration is excessive in this study a sulfur cycle mediated mfc was first used for the simultaneous removal of organic matter and iron from fw as well as power generation the mechanism of iron removal from fw with the presence of excessive sulfide was proposed furthermore the microbial community was studied to illuminate the superiority of simultaneous removal of complex organics and iron in this mfc sob enrichment in the anolyte and electricity producing bacteria domination on the anode likely accelerated the sulfur cycle thus contributing to the efficient iron removal and stable power generation the results show the potential of treating fw with sulfur cycle mediated mfcs the efficient alleviation of sulfide oversaturation in this research also provides an important reference for heavy metal removal in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc construction the air breathing mfc was composed of two 50 ml chambers separated by a nafion 117 proton exchange membrane fuel cell store us anodic and cathodic electrodes of the mfcs were prepared from a circular 1071 hcb carbon felt and wet proofed carbon cloth fuel cell store us respectively and each had the projected surface area of 12 56 cm2 the air breathing cathode was coated with 0 5 mg cm2 platinum a labeled photo of the mfc was shown in fig s1a 2 2 source of inoculum and wastewater the sludge for inoculation was collected in an anaerobic digestion tank with total dissolved solids concentration of 13 1 g l from a wastewater treatment plant anodic effluent from a mature mfc in our laboratory was also used as the anodic inoculum the synthetic fw used as anodic influent contained 1348 112 mg cod l 247 5 23 0 mg so4 2 l 13000 mg salinity l and 24 9 2 4 mg fe3 l and had a ph of 7 0 0 1 organic constituents in the synthetic fw were based on the disclosed industry formulas of hydraulic fracturing fluid stringfellow et al 2014 glutaraldehyde methanol anionic polyacrylamide with a molecular weight of 12 million dalton guar gum citric acid acetic acid ethylene glycol isopropanol were added to synthetic fw as the typical biocide corrosion inhibitor friction reducer gelling agent iron control ph adjusting agent scale inhibitor and surfactant respectively and the inorganic ions mainly containing na mg2 fe3 k ca2 cl so4 2 were referenced from the literature lester et al 2015 and analysis results of real fw from our laboratory data not shown the detailed information of those components in synthetic fw was shown in table s1 and s2 this synthetic fw was clear and stable after the placement at ambient temperature for 10 days fig s2 the total iron concentration was stable likely owing to the additives of iron control scale inhibitor and surfactant in the synthetic fw the real fw used in this research contained 1137 138 mg cod l 154 4 15 7 mg so4 2 l 27 2 4 2 mg fe3 l and 18899 1172 mg tds l and had a ph of 7 1 0 2 a mineral mixture 10 ml and a vitamin mixture 10 ml zhang et al 2013 were added into 1 l of fw a phosphate buffer ph 7 2 containing 0 1 g nacl l was used as the catholyte 2 3 mfc setup and operation the mfcs were initially seeded with the sludge at 20 v v of the anode chamber volume and 5 ml anodic effluent two mfcs worked in closed circuitry designated as cc 1 and cc 2 while the other two mfcs worked in open circuitry designated as oc 1 and oc 2 to simulate anaerobic fermentation after inoculation the anolyte was purged with a gas mixture of n2 co2 80 20 for 30 min before the anodic chamber was sealed to maintain an anaerobic microenvironment the electrical style schematics of cc and oc mfcs were shown in fig s1 the mfcs were operated in fed batch mode under ambient conditions for a long duration 256 days which consisted of four phases in the first three phases the mfcs were all fed with synthetic fw whereas in phase 4 the real fw from a well in china drilled for shale gas exploitation 1 hf was injected into cc 1 and oc 1 the anodic chamber was feed with 45 ml of anolyte the effluent was removed by using a syringe gas collecting bags full of n2 were used to keep pressure balancing in reactors from phase 2 when the anolyte was refreshed all precipitates and anodic effluents were discharged first then 20 anodic effluent from cc 2 was reinjected into both open and closed circuit anode chambers separately as inoculum for subsequent operations the hydraulic retention time hrt was prolonged from 10 to 20 days in phase 2 but it reverted to 10 days in phases 3 and 4 the ratios of real fw in the influent for the five cycles during phase 4 were 25 33 50 100 and 100 respectively 2 4 mfc calculations and chemical analysis the cell voltage over a fixed 1000 ω external resistor was recorded by a usb 1608fs data acquisition device measurement computing corporation us at 0 02 hz frequency the power density was calculated based on the volume of the anodic chamber non turnover cyclic voltammetry cv was conducted using an ivium n stat multi channel electrochemical workstation ivium netherlands with the anode as the working electrode ag agcl reference electrode was also employed in the anodic chamber the cvs were conducted with a scan rate of 1 mv s and a scan range from 1 2 to 1 4 v all potentials reported and referred to in this study were versus she cod was determined by an improved measurement for fw cardona et al 2016 total iron in the anodic effluents was measured using phenanthroline spectrophotometry harvey et al 1955 for total iron analysis samples were acidified to ph 1 using hcl the concentrations of sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate anions in the anodic effluent following 0 45 μm filtration were detected with a dionex ics 5000 ion chromatograph the soluble sulfide concentrations hs and h2s in the filtered effluent sample were measured using the methylene blue method lee et al 2014 and total sulfide concentrations in the unfiltered samples collected during the cycle were measured according to cord ruwisch 1985 the removal efficiencies of cod total iron and sulfate were calculated based on the absolute changes of concentrations during a cycle in the anodic compartment surface elements of the used and clean anodes were analyzed employing jeol jsm 7800f scanning electron microscope sem coupled with an energy dispersive x ray edx detector respectively sangcharoen et al 2015 precipitate compositions were studied via an x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi by mainly recording iron and sulfur xps spectra the valences of sulfur accumulating on the used anode were also determined by recording the sulfur xps spectra 2 5 16s rdna library construction and microbial population characterization the microbial community of the anode attaching microorganisms cc and oc a and planktonic microorganisms in the anolyte cc and oc p from cc and oc mfcs were determined using v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene this region was amplified using bacterial primers 338f and 806r 16s rrna gene libraries were constructed with these purified amplicons as templates and then sequenced using the hiseq2500 pe250 sequencing platform the details for the construction of 16s rrna gene library and bioinformatics analysis were shown in supplementary material 3 results and discussions 3 1 cod and iron removal and power generation based on mfc performance organic compounds in fw were effectively removed in those two types of mfcs fig 1 a from phases 1 to 3 stable cod removal efficiencies in cc mfcs were 72 7 73 3 and 72 6 respectively which were a slightly lower than a previous study shrestha et al 2018 probably because of the different characteristic of the wastewater the efficiencies in oc mfcs were almost identical to those in cc mfcs which were likely attributable to the high concentrations of sulfate in the anolyte acting as an electron acceptor for srb sun et al 2010 when the power generation sharply decreased during the 7th cycle the removal efficiency still stabilized fig 1a suggesting that bacteria in the suspension may contribute substantially to the cod removal similar changes in cod concentrations during a typical cycle at the beginning of phase 3 also indicated the organic compound oxidation at the anode did not seem to be the main mechanism for cod removal fig s3a but the cod behavior during a latter cycle showed that more organics were removed in the first half of the cycle with a bit higher removal efficiency in closed circuitry fig s3b thus the exoelectrogens likely increasingly contributed to organics oxidation during the latter cycles microbial communities were further studied in section 3 5 in addition the similar cod removal during phase 2 with a prolonged hrt indicated that the remaining cod was likely non biodegradable this probably benefit the fw reuse as the effluent may subsequently reduce the biocide dosage in wastewater preservation and alleviate membrane fouling during desalination a superiority in iron removal was attained in cc mfcs shown in fig 1b in the first two cycles during phase 1 total iron was effectively removed from both anodic chambers with efficiencies of 96 7 1 0 and 94 0 10 4 in cc and oc mfcs respectively the soluble sulfide concentrations in the effluent were both lower than 1 37 0 33 mg l black particles precipitated in the bottom of the chambers making the effluent almost clear however during the 3th cycle when the sulfide concentration reached 4 28 0 42 mg l in oc mfcs the black particles did not disappear and thus reduced the removal efficiency to 42 3 0 6 whereas lower sulfide concentrations were still produced in cc mfcs concomitantly with much higher removal efficiency during this time in phase 2 the discharge of black precipitates and the prolonged hrt likely benefited the total iron removal but sulfide rapidly accumulated again only in oc mfcs accompanied with a decreased iron removal thus the soluble sulfide concentration of the effluent showed a largely negative effect on iron removal differential sulfur conversion likely occurred between cc and oc mfcs in phase 3 after changing the hrt back the removal efficiency in oc mfcs sharply decreased to 38 5 4 5 the effluent was black fig s4 as sulfide concentration increased to 5 13 0 32 mg l this high concentration might be resulted from srb enrichment and the slow sulfide conversion in oc mfc however a high and stable efficiency of 90 6 8 7 was maintained in cc mfcs accompanied with much less sulfide production 0 13 0 20 mg l and clear effluent the sulfur cycle in the cc mfc should play an important role in the enhancement of total iron removal the ph values of the effluents were 6 9 0 1 and 7 1 0 1 from closed and open circuitry respectively thus the efficient iron removal could not be attributed to the formation of hydroxide precipitates the xps results certificated that black precipitates mainly were ferric sulfide and the iron removal mechanism was further studied in section 3 2 power density in cc mfcs rapidly increased to 1685 370 mw m3 in phase 1 fig 1d which suggested fast formation of electricity producing biofilm the density kept increasing during phase 2 except for the 7th cycle which might be caused by the prolonged hrt at the previous cycle it gradually stabilized to 2636 476 mw m3 in phase 3 the bio electrochemical oxidation of the produced sulfide on the anode likely also contributed to the power generation rabaey et al 2006 as shown in the non turnover cyclic voltammetry analysis fig s5 the wide oxidative peak at 0 59 v from cc mfc indicated irreversible metabolism on the anode regarding the combined oxidation of polysulfide and sulfide to sulfur lin et al 2016 the voltammetry of cc mfc also showed an obvious redox couple with a wide oxidative peak at 0 47 v and a reductive peak at 0 94 v this couple may be related to the reversible oxidation reduction of a ferredoxin with a 4fe 4s cluster heering et al 1995 rabus et al 2013 and contribute to transferring electrons to the anode furthermore the produced fes in the anolyte may benefit the electron transfer from the planktonic bacteria to the anode kondo et al 2015 moreover the stable high power density during the long period differed from a previous study that its voltage rapidly decreased after two weeks because of the serious accumulation of elemental sulfur on the anode sangcharoen et al 2015 thus the microbial community in the current anodic chamber likely played an important role in stabilizing the output power 3 2 mechanism for total iron removal the xps spectra of fe 2p a and s 2p b region of precipitates in those two kinds of mfcs were shown in fig 2 the characteristic peaks at 710 7 ev and 724 6 ev were corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 peaks of fe2 respectively the peak at 708 6 ev and 712 2 ev indicated the existence of fe2 in fes2 and a little amount of fe3 respectively fig 2a fan et al 2018 yamashita and hayes 2008 the peaks at 161 4 and 162 4 ev were both assigned to s 2p of s2 the peak at 163 9 ev was corresponding to disulfide s2 2 peaks at 168 60 ev 164 8 ev and 163 1 ev were assigned to s 2p of surface bound so4 2 elemental sulfur s0 and polysulfide sn 2 respectively fig 2b fan et al 2018 therefore the majority of iron was likely removed during the formation of insoluble fes as the iron in the anolyte of both mfcs was all in the form of fe2 on day 3 and 10 of one cycle data not shown the little amount of fe3 may result from the oxidizing of fes on the surface during the preparation of the sample for analysis these different forms of sulfur on the surface were consistent with previous researches microbial generated hs ion was oxidized at the fes surface yielding s0 then s0 partly reacted with hs to form polysulfide mostly in the form of s2 2 in ph 5 10 which was associated with microorganisms kiran et al 2017 kondo et al 2015 sulfidization was reported to be a force in ferric reduction even in low sulfate systems flynn et al 2014 hansel et al 2015 as reported ferrihydrite reduction did not precede sulfate reduction under neutral ph conditions despite low sulfate concentrations and regardless of iron oxides substrates hansel et al 2015 because microbial substrate preference was dictated by energy demand rather than supply amenabar et al 2017 yan et al 2012 also reported no suppress in sulfate reduction with combination of fe3 addition and electrode employment in the reactor furthermore total iron was effectively removed mainly in the form of fes in this sulfur cycle mediated mfc with low fe3 concentration about 0 45 mm this differed to the previous research that biological fe3 reduction rate elevated with the increase of fe3 concentration and was only 15 5 at 3 mm wu et al 2013 thus the sulfide produced by biological sulfate reduction was likely the dominant force to reduce ferric iron forming ferrous sulfide in this study a typical process of total iron removal in one cycle confirmed that sulfide supersaturation occurred in both mfcs during the cycle fig 3 the molar ratios of iron to sulfide in the anolyte from cc and oc mfcs were 0 66 and 0 32 respectively on day 3 and 0 61 and 0 60 respectively on day 7 but the supersaturation was gradually alleviated in cc mfcs as the ratio increased to 3 09 on day 10 while it only increased to 1 00 in oc mfcs the increasing ratio was likely attributed to sulfide conversion in the anodic chamber the decrease in sulfide concentration from day 7 10 in oc mfcs did not promote iron removal fig 3 which might be caused by the remaining supersaturation and the major formation of polysulfide with comparison the removal efficiency in the cc mfc was much higher since the 3rd day though the ratios were far less than 1 bioprecipitation by srb biomass may affect total iron removal in both oc and cc mfcs abourached et al 2014 but actually the sulfur cycle in the anodic chamber shown in section 3 3 from cc mfcs made a major contribution to the efficient removal 3 3 sulfate and sulfide behaviors sulfate reduction tended to be increased for both cc and oc mfcs in phases1 and 3 table s3 yet the reduction slowed down during phase 2 which might be caused by the drainage of precipitates attaching to anaerobic biomass kiran et al 2017 in phase 3 the efficiency gradually increased to 90 7 1 6 and 61 1 3 7 in the oc and cc mfc respectively which confirmed the function of sulfate acting as the electron acceptor for organic compounds oxidation the sulfate removal processes during the first and the last cycle of phase 3 further confirmed the increasing sulfate removal efficiency in both cc and oc mfcs and the notably higher efficiency in oc mfcs fig 4 from the removal process the sulfate concentration slightly increased during the second half of the cycle but the increase was more obvious in cc mfcs during the last cycle fig 4 this may also contribute to the low sulfate removal efficiency during phase 2 furthermore no sulfite was found in either cc or oc mfcs thiosulfate was only detected in the oc mfc which likely meant a quick conversion of it in the cc mfc lee et al 2014 the change in sulfide concentration likely responded to that increase as it peaked on the first two days and then decreased especially a little faster during the second half of the cycle fig 4c this finding was in line with the previous observation supposing a back oxidation of sulfide to sulfate on the anode matturro et al 2017 sob capable of oxidizing sulfide sulfur and thiosulfate yamamoto et al 2010 might contributed to the sulfate increase in those mfcs in addition the surface analysis via sem eds and xps fig s6a showed that some s0 was also accumulated on the anode surface of the cc mfc accompanied with a little s2 2 which concurred with the previous study rabaey et al 2006 the back oxidation in the anode chamber may contribute to alleviating severe s0 accumulation whereas almost no s0 or s2 2 was detected on the anode in the oc mfc suggesting that these produced sulfur compounds attached on precipitates were likely the main reason for sulfide removal in the oc mfc this result coincided with the lower molar ratios of sulfide produced to sulfate removed rsp sr in the effluent from the cc mfcs table s3 therefore the cc mfc could accelerate heavy metal removal because the produced sulfide was also partially channeled to the electricity production through anodic oxidation and oxidized to sulfate which likely increased the molar ratio of iron to sulfide and changed the surface charge of the fines 3 4 treatment of real fw real fw was injected into the cc 1 and oc 1 during phase 4 the biodegradable cod in the real wastewater was calculated as reported before lagarde et al 2005 and accounted for only 20 of total cod fig s7 to promote the adaptability of the microbial community we gradually increased the ratio of real fw in influent from 25 to 100 fig 5 finally when 100 real fw was used the cod removal efficiency reached 72 in the cc mfc and 64 in the oc mfc the long term domestication may contribute to this fine removal output power density gradually increased and finally maximized at 4057 mw m3 which could be attributed to the high salinity of the real fw liu et al 2005 and the fine adaptability of electricity producing bacteria sulfate reduction also caused sulfide supersaturation in the anolyte of the oc mfc with molar ratios of iron to sulfide 0 61 fig s8 but the supersaturation was obviously alleviated in the closed circuitry with the molar ratios far more than 1 fig s8 the iron removal efficiency gradually increased maximizing at 97 5 in the cc mfc but sharply decreased to 33 in the oc mfc this might be caused by the microbiological inadaptability to the sulfide conversion in the open circuitry when treating real fw therefore the sulfur cycle mediated mfc is highly capable of treating real fw 3 5 microbial community analysis over 37 700 effective sequences for each sample were obtained table 1 rarefaction curves showed that the sequence volumes reasonably represented the microbial communities fig s9 information concerning the 16s rrna gene clone library analysis was shown in table 1 compared with the oc mfc the community richness decreased in both the anode and anolyte of the cc mfc but the community diversity from the anode slightly increased the principal component analysis pca based on otus fig 6 showed that the communities in the cc mfc obviously differed to those in the oc mfc the population on the anode also showed significant difference to those in the anolyte of the cc mfc but they were relatively close to each other in the oc mfc therefore the different operation mode of the mfc have significant impact on microbial community composition and the communities from different sections especially in the cc mfc may play different roles in mfc performance 3 5 1 microbial communities from the anode in cc and oc mfcs bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteria and chloroflexi shown in fig s10 dominated on the anode at phylum level their abundances in the cc mfc were 22 7 27 5 16 0 15 4 and 6 7 respectively which were obviously different from those in the oc mfc 53 6 10 8 7 8 1 5 and 8 7 respectively the front three phyla were reported to constitute a large part of the bacterial community in real fw bacteroidetes and firmicutes also dominated in the mfc treating raw landfill leachate kumar et al 2017 bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria always link to fermentation and hydrolysis some members in bacteroidetes and firmicutes were reported to produce electricity and degrade complex organics kumar et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 the more abundant firmicutes in the cc mfc might help to stabilize the mfc performance when treating real fw as this phylum was reported to survive under various conditions by producing endospores zhang et al 2013 the community analysis at family level fig 7 showed that the fermentative families prolixibacteraceae 49 7 within bacteroidetes and carnobacteriaceae 21 7 within firmicutes were the most abundant in the oc and cc mfc respectively coriobacteriaceae an anaerobic fermentative bacteria within actinobacteria specially localized on the anode in closed circuity 11 9 it might contribute to the electricity production because of its c type cytochrome and monomethylmenaquinone 6 its major respiratory quinone clavel et al 2014 generally proteobacteria contains anode respiring bacteria srb and sob muyzer and stams 2008 as predicted a large amount of unclassified desulfuromonadales 8 0 belonging to proteobacteria was specially accumulated on the anode of the cc mfc and likely made major contribution to electricity production in this research fig 7 this family is more competitive in colonizing the anode and producing electricity bond et al 2002 desulfuromonadales is also known for its capacity to use deposited s0 as mediator oxidizing acetate in bioelectrochemical system dutta et al 2009 desulfuromonas species within desulfuromonadales contain ferredoxins that can donate electrons for some reductases catalyzing subsequent sulfur reduction rabus et al 2013 it was concurred with the nonturnover cv results fig s5 meanwhile regarding to sulfate reduction chloroflexi and synergistaceaev can also make contributions rabus et al 2013 in closed circuitry 6 7 unclassified chloroflexi 0 8 desulfuromonadaceae and 0 6 synergistaceae were likely critical for sulfate reduction srb also were reported to colonize the anode in the previous research sangcharoen et al 2015 while srb in the oc mfc were much more abundant including 8 7 chloroflexi 4 6 synergistaceae 4 4 desulfobacteraceae 1 0 desulfobulbaceae and 0 7 peptococcaceae and played significantly important role in its higher sulfate removal efficiency desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae and rhodocyclaceae 1 1 in cc a are also complex organics degrader daghio et al 2015 besides anaerolineaceae around 5 7 in both cc and oc mfcs within chloroflexi can also degrade complex organics the co existence of fermentative bacteria with srb and exoelectrogens likely formed a syntrophic association and benefited the stability and survival of the community rabaey et al 2005 sun et al 2010 small molecule organic compounds produced by fermentative bacteria could be oxidized by both srb and exoelectrogens which likely played an important role in the efficient complex organics removal and electricity production in this study 1 4 ectothiorhodospiraceae and 0 38 pseudomonas within proteobacteria were specifically accumulated on the anode in the cc mfc fig 7 they can oxidize a diverse set of sulfur compounds friedrich et al 2001 some desulfuromonadales genera were also reported to effectively oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfate using the anode as the sole electron acceptor zhang et al 2014 which may also contribute to the alleviation of severe elemental sulfur accumulation therefore those enriched sob likely contributed to the existence of elemental sulfur on the anode as well as the increase of sulfate concentration in the second half of the cycle whereas there was almost no sob on the anode from the oc mfc 3 5 2 microbial communities from the anolyte in cc and oc mfcs communities in the anolyte were also dominated by those five phyla mentioned above shown in fig s10 prolixibacteraceae 16 4 and propionibacteriaceae 25 6 were the most abundant families in the oc and cc mfc respectively fig 7 the latter can produce lactate propionate and acetate through fermentation which may benefit the metabolism of desulfuromonadales in the cc mfc rabus et al 2013 ruminococcaceae accumulated in the anolyte of the cc 7 2 and oc mfc 3 5 respectively besides rhodocyclaceae 4 3 in oc p xanthobacteraceaewas 0 95 in cc p and anaerolineaceae 8 0 in the anolyte of both mfcs are important complex organics degraders those enriched bacteria likely also significantly contributed to the efficient cod removal from fw families contributing to sulfate reduction in anolyte were more abundant than on anodes and mainly contained 7 5 chloroflexi 2 2 synergistaceae and 0 6 desulfobacteraceae in cc mfc srb abundances in the oc mfc were much higher including 8 5 chloroflexi 5 0 synergistaceae 4 9 desulfobacteraceae and 1 6 desulfobulbaceae they were likely the major reason for sulfate removal in both cc and oc mfcs noticeably a large amount of sob within proteobacteria friedrich et al 2001 nakagawa et al 2007 were specially found in the cc mfc fig 7 including 10 4 helicobacteraceae 0 95 xanthobacteraceae 0 9 halothiobacillacae and 0 6 ectothiorhodospiraceae while only 2 9 ectothiorhodospiraceae was enriched in the oc mfc helicobacteraceae mainly contained the chemolithoautotrophic genera of sulfurovum in this study this genera can oxidize certain sulfur containing compounds e g s0 s2 and s2o3 2 as energy resources producing sulfate nakagawa et al 2007 yamamoto et al 2010 therefore the dominant sulfurovum and the other sob likely played a very important role in biological sulfide removal and the increase in sulfate concentration during the operational cycle and thus accelerated the sulfur cycle in cc mfcs the enriched sob may also benefit the stable and long term high electricity production in this mfc because the oxidation of elemental sulfur and sulfide by sob would avoid severe elemental sulfur accumulation on the anode and alleviate the toxicity of high sulfide concentration to exoelectricigen the slight increase in sulfate in the oc mfc may result from the activity of ectothiorhodospiraceae the formation of fes in our research likely benefited the metabolism of sob in the anolyte fes is confirmed to act as naturally occurring electrical wires that mediate long distance extracellular electron transfer and bridge spatially discrete redox environments kondo et al 2015 motile biominerals which were formed from metal precipitation on bacterial cells during biological sulfate reduction could be used to maintain metabolism and electron transfer reactions ntarlagiannis et al 2005 nakamura et al 2010a cells have also been demonstrated to form an interconnected network through the produced biogenic minerals nakamura et al 2010a electrons transported from hydrothermal fluids via iron sulfides can also be directly used by chemolithotrophic microbes nakamura et al 2010b sulfurovum is known to contain the polysulfide reductase psr this reductase locates on the cytoplasmic membrane of sulfurovum and is capable of oxidizing sulfide and reducing menaquinone yamamoto et al 2010 psr was supposed as a key reductase to mediate sulfur respiratory system where electrons produced during the oxidation of sulfide on the fes surface could be transported to the distant anode through the extracellular fes matrix kondo et al 2015 meanwhile a cytochrome c in the membrane of sulfurovum responsible for its thiosulfate oxidizing activity might also specifically interact with the biogenic fes to facilitate extracellular electron transport from bacterial cells to the distant anode surface nakamura et al 2010a yamamoto et al 2010 therefore the transport of electrons from sob to the anode via fes matrix was likely the main reason for the enrichment of sulfurovum especially in the anolyte of closed circuitry sob were also reported to be enriched in the anolyte of mfc in a previous research with high concentrations of iron and sulfate in the influent kumar et al 2017 besides the available nitrogen source from hpam in closed circuitry which could effectively degraded hpam cui et al 2015 probably also benefited the sob growth in closed circuitry furthermore fe 3 might also be an advantage to the existence of sulfurovum in both closed and open circuitry nakagawa et al 2007 but need to be further investigated because of the large amount of sulfide in the anolyte based on these results and those of the earlier studies rabus et al 2013 kumar et al 2017 miran et al 2017 proposed mechanisms of simultaneous removal of complex organics and iron from fw by the sulfur cycle mediated mfc were schematically shown in fig 8 this sulfur cycle mediated mfc provides an alternative approach for the treatment of fw from fracturing of shale gas simultaneously removing complex organics and iron to enable the reuse and or discharge of treated effluent the pretreatment for suspended solid removal and the post treatment for desalination is required however more challenges still need to be addressed to fw desalination 4 conclusions simultaneous removal of cod and iron from the synthetic fw was realized in a sulfur cycle mediated mfc with the removal efficiencies of 90 6 8 7 for iron and 72 6 for cod and a power density of 2636 476 mw m3 furthermore real fw was more effectively treated with higher total iron removal efficiency and power generation the dominant microorganisms of sulfurovum and unclassified desulfuromonadales in the anolyte and on the anode respectively played essential roles in biological and electrochemical oxidation of sulfide to sulfate thus accelerating the sulfur cycle and improving iron removal sob enrichment in the anolyte contributed to stable and long term high power generation through avoiding severe elemental sulfur accumulation on the anode bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi which were enriched in this sulfur cycle mediated mfc were responsible for the efficient removal of complex organics

temperature the pilot was started on february 28th 2017 and was operated for a period of 420 days the water temperature was less than 2 c until april and progressively increased up to 20 c in june the water temperature was above 20 c from june to september before slowly declining to less than 4 c in november it remained at 4 c for the rest of the project which ended in april 2018 the biex column was regenerated in january 31st 2018 after 331 days of operation following the regeneration of biex pilot performance was monitored for an additional 90 days 3 2 natural organic matter removal source water and effluent doc concentrations as well as uv absorbance of the four columns operated in parallel were assessed through time fig 2 and fig 3 while the distribution of doc measurements prior to biex regeneration 331 days was used to summarize the overall performance of each media type fig 4 the source water doc was fairly stable with an average of 7 1 mg c l during the study doc removal of the bac filter was marginal 0 48 mg c l or 7 while the gac only provided significant removals during the first two weeks of operation after approximately 200 days of operation the gac was fully exhausted and provided the same performance as the bac p 0 05 the iex column offered the highest performance as the effluent doc in was sustained in the low range of 1 2 mg c l i e an average 80 doc removal the biex gave an equivalent performance to iex for the first 50 days after this period the biex effluent doc concentration progressively rose to a maximum of 4 0 mg c l after 90 days interestingly as the water temperature rose above 15 c the biex effluent doc concentration progressively decreased an indication that biodegradation most likely became a significant doc removal mechanism as water temperature declined below 15 c in fall after 250 days the biex effluent doc concentration started to rise again suggesting that a large part of doc removal during summer may have been due to biological activity after 331 days of operation january 23rd 2018 the biex was regenerated and its performance proved to be equivalent to the performance of the iex column i e 1 8 2 0 mg c l for the 30 days following biex regeneration throughout the study doc profiles through the filter bed performed after 7 19 and 35 weeks of operation fig s1 indicated that most of the doc removal by biex and iex was achieved in less than 10 15 min of empty bed contact time therefore we suggest that an operation with an ebct of 15 min should be considered for a biex filter design in order to reduce capital costs the impact of temperature on doc removal was assessed by calculating the activation energies e a for the bac the biex and the iex columns activation energies can be calculated by plotting a linear regression between ln k vs 1 t where t is the water temperature in kelvins and k is the apparent kinetic constant calculated for each sampling campaign k was approximated as δdoc ebct for the biex only removal data after 100 days of operation were used in order to retain performance under the suspected biological mode the results fig 5 indicate that the activation energies are respectively 20 5 30 4 and 30 8 kj mole for the iex biex and bac filters the bac data should be interpreted with caution due to the very low doc removals measured for this media which explains the poorer fit the biex filter was more sensitive to variations in water temperature as opposed to the iex filter the activation energies of bac filters have been reported as 54 kj mol in the chabrol model calculated using data from laurent et al 1999 or 45 ozonated waters and 55 kj mol non ozonated waters calculated using data from terry and summers 2017 3 3 exhaustion of ion exchange capacity in order to better distinguish the mechanisms responsible for nom removal the chloride release in the biex and iex effluents were assessed along with the doc removal fig 6 the chloride release from iex varied from 21 to 34 mg l from week to week fig 6a the chloride release from the iex filter was constant and not related to the doc removal performance doc doc0 which was high doc doc0 0 25 throughout the year in contrast chloride release from biex progressively declined from 15 mg l to zero after 90 days fig 6b which coincided exactly with the doc breakthrough observed in the biex effluent this result suggests that the primary iex capacity i e due to chloride was exhausted at that time which corresponds to 4320 bed volumes bv however it is possible that nom displaced other anions on the media after this period e g sulfate or bicarbonate finally biex regeneration at 331 days of operation resumed chloride release showing a value similar to iex at the same period ion exchange capacity within biex and iex was also quantified by recovering media from different column depths and measuring the residual iex capacity fig 7 and fig s3 for profiles the iex capacity for fresh resin was measured in the lab as equal to 0 68 meq ml of resin results for the iex filter fig 7a indicates that the weekly regenerations were efficient as the iex capacities in the middle 50 cm and bottom 90 cm of the filter were stable and very high in contrast the iex capacity inside the biex declined below 0 1 meq ml of resin after 10 weeks of operation the regeneration after 48 weeks increased the iex capacity to values similar to that of the iex at the same period to understand the mechanism of doc removal a carbon mass balance was calculated for biex and iex using the influent effluent doc concentrations as well as the doc measured in the brine recovered after biex and iex regenerations table 2 out of the 543 g of carbon removed by biex in 331 days 68 5 was due to ion exchange and the remainder was probably due to biodegradation as expected doc removal in the iex filter is essentially due to ion exchange 99 4 3 4 biomass measurement on colonized media biomass measurements were performed on the bac biex and iex filters after 7 and 19 weeks of operation april and july 2017 fig 8 a and b presents the atp profiles through the depth of the columns for these two sampling campaigns in general atp amounts were higher in the bac filter except for the sample at the top of the biex filter recovered in april the biomass density was not a significant predictor of biex performance compared to the bac filter the average biomasses based on the profiles were calculated as 7 0 6 8 18 18 and 27 11 ng cm3 of iex biex and bac media respectively however we suspect that atp measurements were not providing an accurate evaluation of the biomass we observed that a schmutzdecke was developing in the upper portion of the biex filter as opposed to the other filters breaking down this layer with air injection during the first step of the backwash bw was important to properly clean the media during backwash it was also observed that the biex filter required a longer ripening time for turbidity compared to iex and bac when the filters were put back in service see fig 7c this excess turbidity most likely results from the biomass sloughing during backwash as such behavior i e long ripening after bw was not observed on the iex filter which was not observed to develop a schmutzdecke therefore atp measurements may have been inadequate to characterize the biofilm density found in the upper layer of the biex filter due to the difficulty to correctly sample the schmutzdecke the average effluent turbidities during the study were 4 0 5 5 5 8 and 5 9 ntu for the biex bac gac and iex filters respectively the biex filter was therefore providing slightly higher retention of particulate matter although these filters are not designed for this specific water treatment objective the biex filter also exhibited higher headloss data not shown 12 higher than iex than the other columns 3 5 nitrification microbial activity was assessed by monitoring ammonia removal by the columns ammonium a cation is not expected to be efficiently removed by anion exchange resins however nitrate an anion is expected to be efficiently removed for biex it is expected that nitrifying microorganisms will convert ammonia to nitrate which may or may not be removed depending on the degree of exhaustion of the biex media fig 9 a and b presents the performance of the four media types to remove ammonia during the first 140 days of operation one last sampling campaign was performed after 340 days at cold temperatures 4 c during the first 50 days of operation the bac was the only filter to reduce ammonia below 10 μg n l as the media was already biologically active at the onset of the study sampled from the wtp after two years of use the gac and biex eventually achieved performance equivalent to the bac filter following an acclimation period of 50 and 78 days respectively throughout the study the iex column offered the lowest ammonia removal an observation suggesting that the weekly brine regeneration was negatively impacting the population of nitrifiers nitrate and nitrite profiles were measured across the media after 7 and 35 weeks of operation fig 9c and d after 7 weeks of operation ion exchange was still prevalent within the biex as can be noted by the increase of nitrate in the upper portion of the column this phenomenon was also observed within the iex column which evidenced that anion displacement was occurring in these media fig 9c after 35 weeks of operation ammonia removal was low in the iex filter while it was close to 100 in the bac and biex filters for these two filters the ammonia was converted into nitrate fig 9d which was not removed by neither bac nor biex whose iex capacity had vanished only iex efficiently removed nitrate by ion exchange at that time potential nitrifying activity was only detected in the upper media layer 5 cm of the bac 1 82 μg n cm3 h and the biex filter 4 51 μg n cm3 h 3 6 removal of thm and haa precursors the removal of thm and haa5 precursors was monitored for the first 120 days of operation fig 10 as expected the removals were consistent with the effluent doc concentrations the iex filter provided the lowest average thm ufc 45 μg l and haa5 ufc 41 μg l concentrations the thm and haa precursors in the biex effluent reached a peak at 92 days of operation which corresponded to the doc breakthrough after this event the concentrations of thm ufc and haa5 ufc declined during the summer to averages of 88 and 51 μg l respectively after 19 weeks of operation july 2017 a sampling campaign was performed to compare the removal of thm precursors in the iex biex and bac effluents as opposed to the unit treatment processes in place at the full scale wtp fig s2 interestingly the iex column provided a lower concentration of thm precursors 29 μg l than the full scale plant 35 μg l which included ballasted flocculation inter ozonation and dual media sand bac filtration in contrast the performance of the biex 72 μg l was similar to the effluent from the clarifier 77 μg l this was an impressive performance considering that the biex column had been in operation for 135 days 6480 bv without regeneration 4 discussion bac filtration can typically remove 5 20 of nom depending on the characteristics of the source water ebct and water temperature terry and summers 2017 the performance of our bac filter fell within this range on the contrary the biex filter provided a largely superior performance after ion exchange exhaustion of biex based on chloride release doc removals as high as 64 were observed during summer a performance comparable with the lab scale pilots that we reported in 2017 2018 fed with a different surface water 5 mg doc l and a 30 min ebct biex filter schulz et al 2017 winter et al 2018 the mechanisms responsible for the superior performance of biex compared to bac have not yet been fully elucidated theoretical iex breakthrough was estimated to occur after59 days based on i the average sulfate 0 19 meq and doc concentrations 5 mg c l removed 0 05 meq assuming a charge density of 10 meq g c at ph 7 ii the fresh iex capacity in the column 5 4 eq iii the condition of operation 2 bv h and iv neglecting other anions bicarbonate nitrate differences in performance of the biex and iex were first observed after 51 days of operation which is consistent with the estimated capacity of the bed therefore we conclude that iex was not the sole mechanism at play to explain the long term performance of the biex column in the studied source water humic substances compose approximately 75 of the doc to achieve high doc removal this nom fraction reputed to be very difficult to biodegrade catalán et al 2017 must therefore be partially removed using lc ocd analysis of various surface waters it has been shown by catalán et al 2017 that 20 50 of aquatic nom can biodegraded our organic carbon mass balance indicates that 31 of the doc was probably biodegraded as anion exchange resins have a superior capacity to sorb nom compared to gac it is speculated that iex resins offer a more favorable environment for microbial growth than activated carbon the higher nom loading present on the media the high macroporosity of resins and the weak electrostatic bonding of nom to its surface may favour biodegradation activity which in turn would liberate new sorption sites for additional reaction as suggested in the concept of bioregeneration el gamal et al 2018 under such scenario the biex filter would be best described as a process with simultaneous ion exchange and bioregeneration the organic carbon mass balance indicates that most of the doc in the biex filter 69 is removed by ion exchange while this value is over 99 for the iex filter the activation energy that we calculated for biex was also more consistent to an iex filter than a bac filter important nom removal on biex was observed after doc breakthrough even though chloride release from the media was negligible apart from biodegradation secondary ion exchange mechanisms e g displacement of sulfate by nom may also be responsible for the long term performance of biex additional investigations will be needed to assess the role of secondary ion exchange on nom removal it is anticipated that such phenomenon would be highly source water specific i e mineralization biomass development on anionic resins is currently considered as a nuisance by resins suppliers many suppliers will recommend not to extend regeneration intervals beyond 48 72 h in order to control biomass growth during this project we were interested in promoting microbial growth heterotrophic and nitrifying biomasses were measured on the biex media at amounts that were not largely different from the bac filter the measured biomass densities on both media fall in the low range of reported values in the literature for bac filters gibert et al 2013 velten et al 2007 2011 zhang et al 2017 however the observed formation of a dense and difficult to break up biological layer schmutzdecke in the upper portion of the biex is clearly an issue that will require more attention given that the low density of anion exchange resins makes the backwashing process more challenging than for other denser granular media biomass is thought to potentially reduce regeneration efficacy however in an earlier study a biex filter operated for 60 days 2600 bv was shown to be effectively regenerated with any of the three different tested strategies of regeneration brine caustic plus brine or peracetic acid prior to regeneration with caustic and brine winter et al 2018 during the present study the biex filter also recovered its ion exchange performance after a regular regeneration following one year 47 weeks of sustained operation 15 840 bv nevertheless the resins morphology color and size were impacted by this extreme scenario of operation pictures are provided in fig s4 which also failed to provide the desired effluent water quality doc 2 mg l during the entire period therefore the recommended strategy would be to perform the regeneration of the biex column when breakthrough of doc is noted in the effluent as opposed to the common strategy based on a very low fixed number of bed volumes in addition systems in nordic climates like canada would benefit from a regeneration before the cold water season due to the adverse impact of lower temperature on biodegradation and to a lower extent ion exchange these recommendations would lead to an important reduction in salt usage which will make iex a more sustainable treatment alternative 5 conclusion four parallel pilot filtration columns were fed with surface water with a high doc and low mineralization for a one year period the iex column regenerated weekly presented the best performance for doc removal but the lowest for ammonia removal the biex filter provided a largely superior performance to the bac filter with respect to nom removal but similar nitrification capacities the following biex performance was noted effluent doc concentrations of biex were below the treatment goal of 2 mg c l for 64 days 3072 bv rose to 4 0 mg c l after breakthrough stabilized at 2 5 mg c l in warm water conditions 3072 6768 bv and finally rose again up to 5 4 mg c l under winter conditions 4 c after 141 days of operation 6768 bv the biex was still able to lower toc from 7 1 to 2 5 mg c l october 2017 although its residual anion exchange capacity was below detection the performance for doc removal of biex in warm waters 62 was similar to the one observed at lab scale 56 in a previous study using a different surface water winter et al 2018 in both cases bac performance for doc removal was significantly lower 5 15 thm and haa precursors were also significantly lower in the biex than in the bac effluent most doc removal in the biex occurred in the first 15 min ebct most of the doc removal in the biex filter 69 was due to ion exchange after one year of operation the biex column was successfully regenerated after ion exchange resin exhaustion the biex column was observed to support heterotrophic biomass considering the difficulty to biodegrade humic substances we speculate that the media is being regenerated biologically further studies are ongoing to discriminate the role of biodegradation and ion exchange in the removal of nom

ion exchange and activated carbon and biological treatment for small water systems in remote areas selecting an appropriate process is challenging as the issues of cost and complexity of operation are

temperature the pilot was started on february 28th 2017 and was operated for a period of 420 days the water temperature was less than 2 c until april and progressively increased up to 20 c in june the water temperature was above 20 c from june to september before slowly declining to less than 4 c in november it remained at 4 c for the rest of the project which ended in april 2018 the biex column was regenerated in january 31st 2018 after 331 days of operation following the regeneration of biex pilot performance was monitored for an additional 90 days 3 2 natural organic matter removal source water and effluent doc concentrations as well as uv absorbance of the four columns operated in parallel were assessed through time fig 2 and fig 3 while the distribution of doc measurements prior to biex regeneration 331 days was used to summarize the overall performance of each media type fig 4 the source water doc was fairly stable with an average of 7 1 mg c l during the study doc removal of the bac filter was marginal 0 48 mg c l or 7 while the gac only provided significant removals during the first two weeks of operation after approximately 200 days of operation the gac was fully exhausted and provided the same performance as the bac p 0 05 the iex column offered the highest performance as the effluent doc in was sustained in the low range of 1 2 mg c l i e an average 80 doc removal the biex gave an equivalent performance to iex for the first 50 days after this period the biex effluent doc concentration progressively rose to a maximum of 4 0 mg c l after 90 days interestingly as the water temperature rose above 15 c the biex effluent doc concentration progressively decreased an indication that biodegradation most likely became a significant doc removal mechanism as water temperature declined below 15 c in fall after 250 days the biex effluent doc concentration started to rise again suggesting that a large part of doc removal during summer may have been due to biological activity after 331 days of operation january 23rd 2018 the biex was regenerated and its performance proved to be equivalent to the performance of the iex column i e 1 8 2 0 mg c

biex and iex was achieved in less than 10 15 min of empty bed contact time therefore we suggest that an operation with an ebct of 15 min should be considered for a biex filter design in order to reduce capital costs the impact of temperature on doc removal was assessed by calculating the activation energies e a for the bac the biex and the iex columns activation energies can be calculated by plotting a linear regression between ln k vs 1 t where t is the water temperature in kelvins and k is the apparent kinetic constant calculated for each sampling campaign k was approximated as δdoc ebct for the biex only removal data after 100 days of operation were used in order to retain performance under the suspected biological mode the results fig 5 indicate that the activation energies are respectively 20 5 30 4 and 30 8 kj mole for the iex biex and bac filters the bac data should be interpreted with caution due to the very low doc removals measured for this media which explains the poorer fit the biex filter was more sensitive to variations in water temperature as opposed to the iex filter the activation energies of bac filters have been reported as 54 kj mol in the chabrol model calculated using data from laurent et al 1999 or 45 ozonated waters and 55 kj mol non ozonated waters calculated using data from terry and summers 2017 3 3 exhaustion of ion exchange capacity in order to better distinguish the mechanisms responsible for nom removal the chloride release in the biex and iex effluents were assessed along with the doc removal fig 6 the chloride release from iex varied from 21 to 34 mg l from week to week fig 6a the chloride release from the iex filter was constant and not related to the doc removal performance doc doc0 which was high doc doc0 0 25 throughout the year in contrast chloride release from biex progressively declined from 15 mg l to zero after 90 days fig 6b which coincided exactly with the doc breakthrough observed in the biex effluent this result suggests that the primary iex capacity i e due to chloride was exhausted at that time which corresponds to 4320 bed volumes bv however it is possible that nom displaced other anions on the media after this period e g sulfate or bicarbonate finally biex regeneration at 331 days of operation resumed chloride release showing a value similar to iex at the same period ion exchange capacity within biex and iex was also quantified by recovering media from different column depths and measuring the residual iex capacity fig 7 and fig s3 for profiles the iex capacity for fresh resin was measured in the lab as equal to 0 68 meq ml of resin results for the iex filter fig 7a indicates that the weekly regenerations were efficient as the iex capacities in the middle 50 cm and bottom 90 cm of the filter were stable and very high in contrast the iex capacity inside the biex declined below 0 1 meq ml of resin after 10 weeks of operation the regeneration after 48 weeks increased the iex capacity to values similar to that of the iex at the same period to understand the mechanism of doc removal a carbon mass balance was calculated for biex and iex using the influent effluent doc concentrations as well as the doc measured in the brine recovered after biex and iex regenerations table 2 out of the 543 g of carbon removed by biex in 331 days 68 5 was due to ion exchange and the remainder was probably due to biodegradation as expected doc removal in the iex filter is essentially due to ion exchange 99 4 3 4 biomass measurement on colonized media biomass measurements were performed on the bac biex and iex filters after 7 and 19 weeks of operation april and july 2017 fig 8 a and b presents the atp profiles through the depth of the columns for these two sampling campaigns in general atp amounts were higher in the bac filter except for the sample at the top of the biex filter recovered in april the biomass density was not a significant predictor of biex performance compared to the bac filter the average biomasses based on the profiles were calculated as 7 0 6 8 18 18 and 27 11 ng cm3 of iex biex and bac media respectively however we suspect that atp measurements were not providing an accurate evaluation of the biomass we observed that a schmutzdecke was developing in the upper portion of the biex filter as opposed to the other filters breaking down this layer with air injection during the first step of the backwash bw was important to properly clean the media during backwash it was also observed that the biex filter required a longer ripening time for turbidity compared to iex and bac when the filters were put back in service see fig 7c this excess turbidity most likely results from the biomass sloughing during backwash as such behavior i e long ripening after bw was not observed on the iex filter which was not observed to develop a schmutzdecke therefore atp measurements may have been inadequate to characterize the biofilm density found in the upper layer of the biex filter due to the difficulty to correctly sample the schmutzdecke the average effluent turbidities during the study were 4 0 5 5 5 8 and 5 9 ntu for the biex bac gac and iex filters respectively the biex filter was therefore providing slightly higher retention of particulate matter although these filters are not designed for this specific water treatment objective the biex filter also exhibited higher headloss data not shown 12 higher than iex than the other columns 3 5 nitrification microbial activity was assessed by monitoring ammonia removal by the columns ammonium a cation is not expected to be efficiently removed by anion exchange resins however nitrate an anion is expected to be efficiently removed for biex it is expected that nitrifying microorganisms will convert ammonia to nitrate which may or may not be removed depending on the degree of exhaustion of the biex media fig 9 a and b presents the performance of the four media types to remove ammonia during the first 140 days of operation one last sampling campaign was performed after 340 days at cold temperatures 4 c during the first 50 days of operation the bac was the only filter to reduce ammonia below 10 μg n l as the media was already biologically active at the onset of the study sampled from the wtp after two years of use the gac and biex eventually achieved performance equivalent to the bac filter following an acclimation period of 50 and 78 days respectively throughout the study the iex column offered the lowest ammonia removal an observation suggesting that the weekly brine regeneration was negatively impacting the population of nitrifiers nitrate and nitrite profiles were measured across the media after 7 and 35 weeks of operation fig 9c and d after 7 weeks of operation ion exchange was still prevalent within the biex as can be noted by the increase of nitrate in the upper portion of the column this phenomenon was also observed within the iex column which evidenced that anion displacement was occurring in these media fig 9c after 35 weeks of operation ammonia removal was low in the iex filter while it was close to 100 in the bac and biex filters for these two filters the ammonia was converted into nitrate fig 9d which was not removed by neither bac nor biex whose iex capacity had vanished only iex efficiently removed nitrate by ion exchange at that time potential nitrifying activity was only detected in the upper media layer 5 cm of the bac 1 82 μg n cm3 h and the biex filter 4 51 μg n cm3 h 3 6 removal of thm and haa precursors the removal of thm and haa5 precursors was monitored for the first 120 days of operation fig 10 as expected the removals were consistent with the effluent doc concentrations the iex filter provided the lowest average thm ufc 45 μg l and haa5 ufc 41 μg l concentrations the thm and haa precursors in the biex effluent reached a peak at 92 days of operation which corresponded to the doc breakthrough after this event the concentrations of thm ufc and haa5 ufc declined during the summer to averages of 88 and 51 μg l respectively after 19 weeks of operation july 2017 a sampling campaign was performed to compare the removal of thm precursors in the iex biex and bac effluents as opposed to the unit treatment processes in place at the full scale wtp fig s2 interestingly the iex column provided a lower concentration of thm precursors 29 μg l than the full scale plant 35 μg l which included ballasted flocculation inter ozonation and dual media sand bac filtration in contrast the performance of the biex 72 μg l was similar to the effluent from the clarifier 77 μg l this was an impressive performance considering that the biex column had been in operation for 135 days 6480 bv without regeneration 4 discussion bac filtration can typically remove 5 20 of nom depending on the characteristics of the source water ebct and water temperature terry and summers 2017 the performance of our bac filter fell within this range on the contrary the biex filter provided a largely superior performance after ion exchange exhaustion of biex based on chloride release doc removals as high as 64 were observed during summer a performance comparable with the lab scale pilots that we reported in 2017 2018 fed with a different surface water 5 mg doc l and a 30 min ebct biex filter schulz et al 2017 winter et al 2018 the mechanisms responsible for the superior performance of biex compared to bac have not yet been fully elucidated theoretical iex breakthrough was estimated to occur after59 days based on i the average sulfate 0 19 meq and doc concentrations 5 mg c l removed 0 05 meq assuming a charge density of 10 meq g c at ph 7 ii the fresh iex capacity in the column 5 4 eq iii the condition of operation 2 bv h and iv neglecting other anions bicarbonate nitrate differences in performance of the biex and iex were first observed after 51 days of operation which is consistent with the estimated capacity of the bed therefore we conclude that iex was not the sole mechanism at play to explain the long term performance of the biex column in the studied source water humic substances compose approximately 75 of the doc to achieve high doc removal this nom fraction reputed to be very difficult to biodegrade catalán et al 2017 must therefore be partially removed using lc ocd analysis of various surface waters it has been shown by catalán et al 2017 that 20 50 of aquatic nom can biodegraded our organic carbon mass balance indicates that 31 of the doc was probably biodegraded as anion exchange resins have a superior capacity to sorb nom compared to gac it is speculated that iex resins offer a more favorable environment for microbial growth than activated carbon the higher nom loading present on the media the high macroporosity of resins and the weak electrostatic bonding of nom to its surface may favour biodegradation activity which in turn would liberate new sorption sites for additional reaction as suggested in the concept of bioregeneration el gamal et al 2018 under such scenario the biex filter would be best described as a process with simultaneous ion exchange and bioregeneration the organic carbon mass balance indicates that most of the doc in the biex filter 69 is removed by ion exchange while this value is over 99 for the iex filter the activation energy that we calculated for biex was also more consistent to an iex filter than a bac filter important nom removal on biex was observed after doc breakthrough even though chloride release from the media was negligible apart from biodegradation secondary ion exchange mechanisms e g displacement of sulfate by nom may also be responsible for the long term performance of biex additional investigations will be needed to assess the role of secondary ion exchange on nom removal it is anticipated that such phenomenon would be highly source water specific i e mineralization biomass development on anionic resins is currently considered as a nuisance by resins suppliers many suppliers will recommend not to extend regeneration intervals beyond 48 72 h in order to control biomass growth during this project we were interested in promoting microbial growth heterotrophic and nitrifying biomasses were measured on the biex media at amounts that were not largely different from the bac filter the measured biomass densities on both media fall in the low range of reported values in the literature for bac filters gibert et al 2013 velten et al 2007 2011 zhang et al 2017 however the observed formation of a dense and difficult to break up biological layer schmutzdecke in the upper portion of the biex is clearly an issue that will require more attention given that the low density of anion exchange resins makes the backwashing process more challenging than for other denser granular media biomass is thought to potentially reduce regeneration efficacy however in an earlier study a biex filter operated for 60 days 2600 bv was shown to be effectively regenerated with any of the three different tested strategies of regeneration brine caustic plus brine or peracetic acid prior to regeneration with caustic and brine winter et al 2018 during the present study the biex filter also recovered its ion exchange performance after a regular regeneration following one year 47 weeks of sustained operation 15 840 bv nevertheless the resins morphology color and size were impacted by this extreme scenario of operation pictures are provided in fig s4 which also failed to provide the desired effluent water quality doc 2 mg l during the entire period therefore the recommended strategy would be to perform the regeneration of the biex column when breakthrough of doc is noted in the effluent as opposed to the common strategy based on a very low fixed number of bed volumes in addition systems in nordic climates like canada would benefit from a regeneration before the cold water season due to the adverse impact of lower temperature on biodegradation and to a lower extent ion exchange these recommendations would lead to an important reduction in salt usage which will make iex a more sustainable treatment alternative 5 conclusion four parallel pilot filtration columns were fed with surface water with a high doc and low mineralization for a one year period the iex column regenerated weekly presented the best performance for doc removal but the lowest for ammonia removal the biex filter provided a largely superior performance to the bac filter with respect to nom removal but similar nitrification capacities the following biex performance was noted effluent doc concentrations of biex were below the treatment goal of 2 mg c l for 64 days 3072 bv rose to 4 0 mg c l after breakthrough stabilized at 2 5 mg c l in warm water conditions 3072 6768 bv and finally rose again up to 5 4 mg c l under winter conditions 4 c after 141 days of operation 6768 bv the biex was still able to lower toc from 7 1 to 2 5 mg c l october 2017 although its residual anion exchange capacity was below detection the performance for doc removal of biex in warm waters 62 was similar to the one observed at lab scale 56 in a previous study using a different surface water winter et al 2018 in both cases bac performance for doc removal was significantly lower 5 15 thm and haa precursors were also significantly lower in the biex than in the bac effluent most doc removal in the biex occurred in the first 15 min ebct most of the doc removal in the biex filter 69 was due to ion exchange after one year of operation the biex column was successfully regenerated after ion exchange resin exhaustion the biex column was observed to support heterotrophic biomass considering the difficulty to biodegrade humic substances we speculate that the media is being regenerated biologically further studies are ongoing to discriminate the role of biodegradation and ion exchange in the removal of nom

19263,the formation of odorous aldehydes and n chloraldimines and also nitriles which are potentially hazardous to human health was investigated in studies of the chlorination of amino acids aas in both operational drinking water treatment plants and laboratory based experiments in the drinking water treatment plants studied the concentration of total free aas did not significantly change after treatment even though good removal of doc was observed however free aas still contributed less than 3 of total nitrogen in the treated drinking waters and no aldehydes n chloraldimines or nitriles of interest were detected in the treated waters presumably due to the low concentrations of the precursor aas in these water samples laboratory formation potential experiments showed that carboxylic acids can form from the degradation of aldehydes and nitriles volatile carboxylic acids could result in odour issues and some carboxylic acids may be of potential health concern therefore carboxylic acids should also be considered as potential by products of interest in distribution systems with long contact times of 7days a higher proportion of nitrile formation and promotion of carboxylic acid formation was observed when the chlorine to aa ratio was greater than 4 compared to when this ratio was 2 8 indicating that the cl aa ratio is an important factor in dbp formation pathways this suggests that results from laboratory formation studies undertaken at these low cl aa ratios cannot be directly applied to real water systems which typically have cl aa ratios that are orders of magnitude higher than 4 laboratory formation potential experiments also showed that the short term rate of formation of aldehydes and n chloraldimines was reduced in the presence of ammonia although formation over longer timescales e g 7 days was not significantly different between chlorination and chloramination experiments therefore the use of chloramination instead of chlorination does not appear to reduce the formation of these by products from aas graphical abstract image 1 keywords amino acids chlorination disinfection by products organic chloramines odour drinking water 1 introduction disinfection by products dbps result from reactions of organic and inorganic precursors present in source waters with disinfectants such as chlorine disinfection by products are potentially harmful to human health nakamura et al 1993 richardson et al 2007 and can also result in off flavours bruchet et al 1992 freuze et al 2005 hrudey et al 1988 off flavours in drinking waters are a major concern for water utilities as consumers often use aesthetic properties to judge the quality and safety of their drinking water mcguire 1995 amino acids aas are ubiquitous in most natural waters and are reported to be major constituents of dissolved organic nitrogen contributing up to 75 in surface waters hagedorn et al 2000 as shown in fig 1 adapted from conyers and scully 1993 how et al 2017 yu and reckhow 2015 and kimura et al 2015 aas produce a number of different dbps after chlorination while free aas reportedly constitute a relatively small fraction of the total aas chinn and barrett 2000 dotson and westerhoff 2009 thurman 1985 low molecular weight compounds like free aas are poorly removed in many water treatment processes for example only 50 of free aas were reported to be removed during biological filtration in drinking water treatment prevost 1998 and only 25 of free aas were reported to be removed in drinking water after chemical pre treatment either traditional oxidation or advanced oxidation sedimentation and filtration dotson and westerhoff 2009 free aa concentrations have even been observed to increase after sand filtration suggested to result from in situ cellular lysis or the presence of cellular metabolites le cloirec et al 1986 free aas and short peptides can also pass through nanofiltration membranes escobar et al 2000 thus even though the concentration of free aas is typically much lower than the concentration of combined aas greater proportions of free aas are likely to reach the disinfection step in a drinking water treatment process resulting in the formation of dbps like n chloroamino acids conyers and scully 1993 how et al 2016 n chloropeptides huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 keefe et al 1997 and halonitroalkanes halonitriles and haloamides shah and mitch 2012 two dbps that form from aas that have already been identified in chlorinated water are the aldehydes iv in fig 1 and n chloraldimines vi freuze et al 2005 hrudey et al 1988 typically aldehydes and n chloraldimines formed from aas have low odour threshold concentrations of 0 9 30 μg l 1 table 1 in particular aldehydes and n chloraldimines formed from isoleucine leucine phenylalanine and valine have previously been detected in chlorinated drinking waters in concentrations greater than their odour threshold concentrations hrudey et al 1988 table 1 non halogenated nitriles are also formed during the chlorination of aas viii fig 1 however they typically have a much higher odour threshold concentration up to 1000 times higher than the odour threshold concentration of the corresponding aldehyde table 1 to date only six different non halogenated nitriles have been detected in drinking waters liew et al 2012 including 3 methylbutyronitrile and benzyl cyanide while non halogenated nitriles are non odorous they have been found to be more toxic than the corresponding aldehydes due to liberation of hydrogen cyanide during metabolisation tanii and hashimoto 1984 therefore nitriles formed from the chlorination of aas in drinking water are still potentially harmful to human health to date there have been limited studies brosillon et al 2009 hrudey et al 1988 of the presence of dbps which can be derived from the chlorination of amino acids in operational drinking water treatment plants in this study we measured aldehydes n chloraldimines

amino acids volatile carboxylic acids have also been found to be odorous ábalos et al 2000 with odour thresholds ranging from 0 007 to 0 27 mm salo 1970 finally the impact of the presence of ammonia

acid was used to quench samples for analysis of aas and dbps as recommended by kristiana et al 2014 sodium sulphite was used to quench samples for analysis of doc and tdn as ascorbic acid contains

isoleucine leucine and valine were added to selected drinking water samples before undertaking fp experiments such that the added concentration of each aa was 30 μm and the combined doc concentration of all three aas was 6 12 mg l 1 as c 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and removal of doc and free amino acids in drinking water treatment plants the concentrations of doc tdn individual aas and total free aas in each dwtp inlet and outlet on a number of sampling occasions are presented in table 3 the aa concentrations are reported above the loq 10 signal to noise ratio while only tdn was measured for each dwtp in this study previous studies have shown that ammonia contributes more than 65 of tdn in raw waters for both groundwater treatment plants dwtp 1 and 2 but is not detected after treatment and disinfection liew et al 2016 in dwtp 3 more than 80 of tdn in the raw surface water was previously found to be organic nitrogen liew et al 2016 with most doc being high molecular weight material of very hydrophobic character garbin et al 2010 therefore free aas which are low molecular weight and hydrophilic should only contribute a very small amount of doc in dwtp 3 in dwtp 4 the inlet water is a mix of treated groundwater desalinated water and surface water with the total doc concentration maintained below 2 mg l 1 as c the high tdn in the outlet of dwtp 4 was due to the use of inorganic monochloramine as the disinfectant the total concentrations of free aas in raw waters were between 0 7 and 2 8 μg l 1 as n contributing between 0 06 and 2 of the total dissolved nitrogen the total free aa concentrations were comparable to previous studies of surface waters where the concentrations of free aas were found to be between 0 7 and 4 μg l 1 as n chinn and barrett 2000 dotson and westerhoff 2009 considering all dwtps the average total free aa concentration in the raw water 1 9 0 6 μg l 1 as n 1σ was statistically the same as the concentration in the treated water 1 7 1 μg l 1 as n 1σ although generally concentrations decreased slightly after treatment the most frequently detected aas leucine proline tryptophan and phenylalanine table 3 were detected in both raw water and treated water in all sampling events the least frequently detected aas lysine histidine and methionine were only detected in dwtp 3 apr 15 table 3 the target aas isoleucine leucine phenylalanine and valine table 3 contributed an average 60 of the total concentration of free aas in the raw waters suggesting that the dbps from the target aas would be the most likely to have an impact on the treated water quality valine was the most abundant aa 48 95 in eight of the 16 samples while glycine 48 73 and alanine 46 64 were the most abundant aas in four and three samples respectively one sample dwtp 1 outlet apr 15 had serine as the most abundant aa 48 but the total aa concentration in this sample was very low 0 18 μg l 1 as n the high relative abundance of valine compared to other aas in the waters measured supports its choice as a target aa in this study which was based on a previous chlorination pathway study mccormick et al 1993 and studies of aldehydes and n chloraldimines brosillon et al 2009 freuze et al 2005 while odorous dbp formation from glycine has not been studied we have previously identified chlorinated glycine n chloroglycine to be the n chloramino acid of highest health risk how et al 2016 based on the reaction pathways between amino acids and free chlorine fig 1 alanine would be converted to acetonitrile which has been found to be potentially harmful to human health in drinking water nrc 1982 changes in the aa concentration before and after drinking water treatment were variable and without an obvious pattern for example the concentration of valine generally decreased after treatment but was observed to remain constant for two sampling events dwtp 1 and 3 nov 15 table 3 there were also examples of aas detected in treated water but not raw water at the same sampling event for example in two sampling events glycine was not detected in raw water for dwtp 4 but was the major contributor to the total aas concentration in the treated water the change in aas concentration and contribution to total aas may be influenced by doc removal but may also be influenced by disinfection as the disinfectant chlorine or inorganic monochloramine will have a different relative reactivity with each aa how et al 2016 which would result in a higher proportion of less reactive aas remaining in the treated water in addition the chlorination of more complex organic matter can result in the formation of simpler compounds richardson and postigo 2012 in this case the oxidation of proteins might result in the formation of additional free aas the change in aa concentrations can also result from other treatment steps such as sand filtration after release of free aas from the lysis of bacterial or algal cells le cloirec et al 1986 or changes in aa concentrations in the raw water over time in this study treated water samples were collected within an hour of the collection of the raw water samples and therefore will not capture changes in aa concentrations in the raw source water the use of composite sampling instead of grab sampling could correct for changes in aa concentration over time but could still be impacted by ongoing cell lysis or disinfection reactions doc concentrations also varied between water sources with the highest doc concentrations measured in dwtp 2 groundwater and dwtp 3 surface water the doc concentration in the raw water of dwtp 1 was variable resulting from the use of varying groundwater bore combinations for the source water the lowest doc concentrations were measured in dwtp 4 source water which includes previously treated groundwater and desalinated seawater both of which have relatively low doc concentrations some seasonal effects were seen for surface water dwtp 3 where the doc concentration was lower in autumn april than in spring november which may be related to natural organic matter nom inputs during winter rainfall garbin et al 2010 in contrast the total free aa concentration was higher in autumn than in spring which may reflect increased algal activity in summer autumn the doc removal efficiencies of all dwtps ranged between 0 and 90 the lowest removal efficiencies 0 and 24 were recorded for dwtp 4 which had the lowest source water doc concentration and contains water that has been previously treated for nom removal the doc removal efficiency was correlated with doc raw water concentration raw waters with high doc concentration also had high doc removal for 6 out of the 8 sampling events the doc concentration was reduced to below 2 mg l 1 as c after treatment regardless of the initial doc concentration indicating the presence in all source waters of a fraction of doc which is not removed by conventional nom removal techniques 3 2 potential for disinfection by product formation in drinking water all of the dbps that were analysed by hs spme gc ms i e aldehydes n chloroaldimines and nitriles were below their respective lods 0 001 0 04 μm in the treated and disinfected drinking waters results not shown this is probably due to the low concentrations of free aas detected in the raw drinking waters table 3 based on the 30 yield of aa transformation to the targeted dbps observed in our previous laboratory studies how et al 2017 the concentrations of target aas measured in the raw waters 0 001 0 1 μm are estimated to produce between 0 0003 and 0 03 μm of the analysed dbps most of these estimated concentrations are below lod 0 001 0 04 μm although these estimations ignore the potential for changes in aa concentrations during drinking water treatment in order to investigate the maximum dbp formation from one of these raw waters a fp experiment was conducted using dwtp 1 apr 15 raw water adding aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution to achieve a targeted residual free chlorine concentration of 10 mg l 1 as cl2 0 139 mm after 7 days the concentrations of aldehydes nitriles and n chloraldimines were measured after 1 and 7 days table 4 little or none of these dbps were detected consistent again with the low concentrations of the precursor free aas measured in this raw water in contrast similar formation potential studies conducted in our research group using wastewater with higher aa concentrations found formation of all targeted odorous compounds in all samples after 7 days how 2016 to confirm that the lack of formation of the three classes of dbps was due to low precursor aa concentrations and not due to an unknown interference a second fp of the dwtp 1 apr 15 raw water sample was undertaken after addition of isoleucine leucine and valine 30 μm each the concentrations of dbps formed after 1 and 7 days are presented in table 4 for comparison a fp experiment using ultrapure water with the same aas added was also conducted table 4 to ensure that the two fp experiments were comparable and that sufficient chlorine was present to react with the added aas the target chlorine residual after 7 days was again 10 mg l 1 as cl2 0 139 mm overall the concentrations of aldehydes n chloroaldimines and nitriles measured in these fp samples with aas added were much higher than those measured in the raw water without added aas table 4 confirming that very low dbp concentrations were the result of very low precursor aa concentrations in the raw water however comparison of concentrations of dbps after day 1 and day 7 showed that the concentrations of aldehydes and nitriles increased in the raw water sample with added aas but decreased in the ultrapure water with added aas the reduction in aldehyde and nitrile concentrations in the ultrapure water with added aas over 7 days was expected as the same behaviour was observed in our previous study of dbp formation from valine how et al 2017 from that study we hypothesized that over time n chloroisobutyraldimine would transform to isobutyraldehyde and isobutyronitrile while isobutyraldehyde and isobutyronitrile would transform to isobutyric acid a carboxylic acid fig 1 these reactions are likely to occur with isoleucine and leucine as well as seen in table 4 the increase in aldehyde and nitrile concentrations observed over time for the raw water with added aas might be due to degradation of proteins and peptides in the raw water and corresponding production of more free aas resulting from the high chlorine dose 42 mg l 1 as cl2 0 583 mm while the concentrations of aldehydes and nitriles measured in the fp experiments from the raw water with added aas and the ultrapure water with added aas were similar table 4 higher concentrations of n chloraldimines were formed from the raw water with added aas than the ultrapure water with added aas this enhancement in concentration might be due to the presence of nom either through an increase in n chloraldimine stability or an alteration to the reaction pathways to favour the formation of n chloraldimines further study is required to understand this enhancement in concentration 3 3 formation of additional by products from aldehyde and nitrile transformations to confirm the hypothesis that the reduction in aldehyde and nitrile concentrations observed over time in the fp experiments using aas in ultrapure water table 4 was the result of the formation of the corresponding carboxylic acid e g isobutyric acid from valine additional experiments were conducted using valine 4 mm in which the chlorine to valine ratio was varied as 1 2 or 3 4 8 or 12 mm of chlorine the reaction mixtures were then analysed for the presence of isobutyric acid after 7 days using hs spme gc ms with quantification using lc uv no isobutyric acid was detected for the sample with a chlorine to valine ratio of 1 table 5 for chlorine to valine ratios of 2 and 3 isobutyric acid was measured as 0 27 0 02 mm and 0 36 0 03 mm respectively equal to molar yields of 7 and 9 from valine we have previously shown that at a chlorine to valine ratio of 1 only n monochlorovaline ii fig 1 forms which degrades to isobutyraldehyde how et al 2017 n n dichlorovaline v and isobutyronitrile viii are formed when the chlorine to valine ratio is 1 and their formation increases with increasing chlorine to valine ratio how et al 2017 however more information is required to clarify by which pathway isobutyric acid xii forms in these experiments as it is expected that most of the chlorine added would react with the valine rather than be available to oxidise either the aldehyde or nitrile to the carboxylic acid due to the higher reactivity of chlorine with the amino acid rather than with the aldehyde or nitrile to determine if the formation of isobutyric acid is predominantly from the isobutyraldehyde or isobutyronitrile pathway individual solutions of isobutyraldehyde and isobutyronitrile 4 mm were treated with chlorine at a cl precursor molar ratio of 1 1 after 7 days isobutyric acid was quantified using lc uv and identified using hs spme gc ms in these experiments isobutyric acid was detected from chlorination of isobutyraldehyde 0 27 0 03 mm 7 yield but not from the chlorination of isobutyronitrile table 5 suggesting that conversion of isobutyronitrile to n chloroisobutyramide viii x in fig 1 is unlikely in order to further confirm this finding additional studies were undertaken with isobutyramide xi in fig 1 which is formed through the partial hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile and can potentially form isobutyric acid either through chlorination xi x xii or direct hydrolysis xi xii chlorination of isobutyramide at a cl precursor molar ratio of 1 1 produced 1 0 0 4 mm 25 yield of isobutyric acid much higher than formation of isobutyric acid from either isobutyraldehyde or isobutyronitrile however analysis of a control solution of isobutyramide without addition of chlorine after 7 days also showed significant isobutyric acid formation 0 6 mm 15 yield showing that the major pathway for isobutyric acid formation was from the direct hydrolysis of isobutyramide xi xii rather than by chlorination xi x xii however it is not possible to determine whether the addition of cl promoted the chlorination pathway or induced further acid hydrolysis of isobutyramide therefore the formation of isobutyric acid is likely to be limited by the slow hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile to isobutyramide the results from the isobutyric acid fp experiments from the aldehyde isobutyronitrile and isobutyramide suggested that the isobutyric acid observed from the chlorination of valine was predominantly formed from the oxidation of isobutyraldehyde to isobutyric acid iv xii therefore no isobutyric acid was formed when the chlorine to valine ratio was 1 table 5 due to insufficient chlorine available for the oxidation of the aldehyde in addition the higher yields of isobutyric acid observed for experiments with higher chlorine to valine ratios table 5 strongly suggest that isobutyric acid formation was influenced by the oxidant concentration 3 4 effect of ammonia in water and chloramination on the formation of odorous disinfection by products the effect of addition of ammonia at various concentrations on the chlorination of the target aas was investigated by treatment of valine 30 μm with a fixed concentration of free chlorine 10 mg l 1 as cl2 0 139 mm cl val 4 4 in the presence of ammonia with ammonia concentrations chosen to simulate chlorination above breakpoint chlorination at breakpoint chlorination and below breakpoint chlorination 1 25 2 and 4 mg l 1 as n additionally chloramination of valine 30 μm was conducted with preformed inorganic monochloramine 10 mg l 1 as cl2 see si text s2 for preparation details odorous dbps were analysed at 3 h and after 7 days and the concentrations are presented in table 6 after 3 h higher dbp concentrations were formed when chlorine alone was used compared to the experiments with ammonia present for example the concentration of isobutyronitrile was 19 μm after chlorination but only 1 μm after chloramination however by day 7 168 h more comparable concentrations of dbps were formed in all experiments table 6 thus it appears that while the presence of ammonia may influence short term rates of dbp formation overall it doesn t seem to affect longer term formation therefore the use of chloramination instead of chlorination does not appear to reduce the formation of these dbps from aas the presence of ammonia might affect the formation of the n n dichloramino acid ii v in fig 1 due to the competitive reaction of chlorine with ammonia to form inorganic monochloramine instead of reaction with the n monochloramino acid ii which would particularly affect the concentrations of isobutyronitrile viii r propane and n chloroisobutyraldimine vi r propane formed however the presence of inorganic monochloramine could also promote alternative reaction pathways such as the chloramination of the aldehyde iv to form the n chloramino alcohol ix which provides an alternative pathway for the formation of n chloroisobutyraldimine vi and isobutyronitrile viii from valine more studies are required to investigate the reaction rates of these proposed alternative pathways to confirm that these could explain the differences in dbp concentrations from chlorination and chloramination at 3 h and the similarities in concentrations after 7 days 3 5 comparison of laboratory formation studies and real systems at cl aa 4 4 the conversions of valine to isobutyraldehyde isobutyronitrile and n chloroisobutyraldimine were 5 55 and 10 respectively based on the results in table 6 ammonia to chlorine ratio 0 0 these results were slightly different to our previous study how et al 2017 where the conversions of valine to isobutyraldehyde isobutyronitrile and n chloroisobutyraldimine at cl aa 2 8 were 5 35 and 30 respectively indicating that the concentration and species of dbps formed from the chlorination of amino acids is affected by the chlorine to amino acid ratio in most real systems the chlorine to precursor individual aa ratio is likely to be two or three orders of magnitude higher than the ratio used in our laboratory formation studies for example at dwtp 1 the initial chlorine concentration required to achieve 2 mg l 1 free cl2 residual during the november 2015 sampling event would be around 6 mg l 1 as cl2 85 μm based on the chlorine demand experiment conducted assuming that the valine concentration in the pre chlorinated water was the same as that measured in the raw water 2 0 μg l 1 as n or 0 14 μm the chlorine to valine ratio would be approximately 600 1 given that valine was the aa measured in the highest concentration in the raw water and that this estimation assumes that no free aas were removed or added before chlorination the cl aa ratio of other aas will be even higher in the fp experiments investigating dbp formation from raw drinking water with added aas table 4 and the impact of ammonia on dbp formation from ultrapure water with added aas table 6 the chlorine to valine ratio is at least 4 4 and only 5 10 of valine was observed to convert to n chloroisobutyraldimine the lower conversion would result from higher chlorine to valine ratios either suppressing the conversion of n n dichlorovaline v fig 1 to n chloroisobutyraldimine vi or enhancing the degradation of n chloroisobutyraldimine vi to isobutyronitrile viii since the formation of isobutyraldehyde which we previously proposed to predominantly result from the degradation of n monochlorovaline how et al 2017 was similar in both the previous how et al 2017 and current studies 5 in both studies the formation of n monochlorovaline and consequently n n dichlorovaline should also be similar in both studies therefore the lower measured yield of n chloroisobutyraldimine from valine in this study 10 compared to 30 is more likely to be due to its enhanced degradation into isobutyronitrile vi viii rather than suppressed formation from the degradation of n n dichlorovaline in addition since the oxidation of isobutyraldehyde to isobutryic acid would be dependent on the chlorine concentration higher chlorine concentrations would result in faster oxidation of isobutyraldehyde to isobutyric acid increasing the rate of isobutyraldehyde oxidation to isobutyric acid also indirectly increases the rate of n chloroisobutyraldimine degradation as equilibrium would favour further n chloroisobutyraldimine degradation into both isobutyraldehyde and isobutyronitrile in contrast to chlorine oxidation reactions the rate of hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile i e viii to xi in fig 1 is only dependent on the ph and does not increase with increasing chlorine concentration given the ph was 7 5 for both our previous how et al 2017 and current studies the rate of hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile should be similar in both studies and any additional degradation of n chloroisobutyraldimine would result in the accumulation of isobutyronitrile this agrees with the higher yield of isobutyronitrile from valine observed in this study 55 than measured in our previous study 35 4 conclusions although good removal of doc was generally observed in the drinking water treatment plants studied the concentrations of free aas were not significantly reduced however these free aas contributed only a small fraction of don or tdn and odorous dbps listed in table 4 were not detected in the drinking water systems a study of total aas including proteins and peptides is required to better understand the impact of all forms of aas on water treatment however the formation potential experiments undertaken conclusively showed that isobutyric acid can be formed from the chlorination of valine therefore if the distributed water is expected to have a long retention time in the system 7 days the formation of carboxylic acids from the degradation of aldehydes and nitriles themselves derived from aas should also be considered and measured as volatile carboxylic acids have been found to be odorous although carboxylic acids generally have low chronic health effects leung and paustenbach 1990 the toxicity has not been tested for all carboxylic acids and thus some carboxylic acids may still be of human health concern dbp formation potential experiments with chlorine in the presence of different ammonia concentrations showed that while the presence of ammonia changed the short term rate of formation of the odorous dbps overall there was little impact on the final concentration of these dbps chlorination studies conducted for valine at cl aa ratios 4 4 showed that the proportion of aldehydes nitriles and n chloraldimines formed was dissimilar to the chlorination experiments undertaken with valine at cl aa 2 8 indicating that the cl aa ratio is an important factor in dbp formation pathways to date most studies of dbp formation from aas have been undertaken at low cl aa ratios additional experiments with conditions that are closer to those of real water systems where generally high cl aa ratios of 100 exist will improve understanding of the formation of these dbps in

19263,the formation of odorous aldehydes and n chloraldimines and also nitriles which are potentially hazardous to human health was investigated in studies of the chlorination of amino acids aas in both operational drinking water treatment plants and laboratory based experiments in the drinking water treatment plants studied the concentration of total free aas did not significantly change after treatment even though good removal of doc was observed however free aas still contributed less than 3 of total nitrogen in the treated drinking waters and no aldehydes n chloraldimines or nitriles of interest were detected in the treated waters presumably due to the low concentrations of the precursor aas in these water samples laboratory formation potential experiments showed that carboxylic acids can form from the degradation of aldehydes and nitriles volatile carboxylic acids could result in odour issues and some carboxylic acids may be of potential health concern therefore carboxylic acids should also be considered as potential by products of interest in distribution systems with long contact times of 7days a higher proportion of nitrile formation and promotion of carboxylic acid formation was observed when the chlorine to aa ratio was greater than 4 compared to when this ratio was 2 8 indicating that the cl aa ratio is an important factor in dbp formation pathways this suggests that results from laboratory formation studies undertaken at these low cl aa ratios cannot be directly applied to real water systems which typically have cl aa ratios that are orders of magnitude higher than 4 laboratory formation potential experiments also showed that the short term rate of formation of aldehydes and n chloraldimines was reduced in the presence of ammonia although formation over longer timescales e g 7 days was not significantly different between chlorination and chloramination experiments therefore the use of chloramination instead of chlorination does not appear to reduce the formation of these by products from aas graphical abstract image 1 keywords amino acids chlorination disinfection by products organic chloramines odour drinking water 1 introduction disinfection by products dbps result from reactions of organic and inorganic precursors present in source waters with disinfectants such as chlorine disinfection by products are potentially harmful to human health nakamura et al 1993 richardson et al 2007 and can also result in off flavours bruchet et al 1992 freuze et al 2005 hrudey et al 1988 off flavours in drinking waters are a major concern for water utilities as consumers often use aesthetic properties to judge the quality and safety of their drinking water mcguire 1995 amino acids aas are ubiquitous in most natural waters and are reported to be major constituents of dissolved organic nitrogen contributing up to 75 in surface waters hagedorn et al 2000 as shown in fig 1 adapted from conyers and scully 1993 how et al 2017 yu and reckhow 2015 and kimura et al 2015 aas produce a number of different dbps after chlorination while free aas reportedly constitute a relatively small fraction of the total aas chinn and barrett 2000 dotson and westerhoff 2009 thurman 1985 low molecular weight compounds like free aas are poorly removed in many water treatment processes for example only 50 of free aas were reported to be removed during biological filtration in drinking water treatment prevost 1998 and only 25 of free aas were reported to be removed in drinking water after chemical pre treatment either traditional oxidation or advanced oxidation sedimentation and filtration dotson and westerhoff 2009 free aa concentrations have even been observed to increase after sand filtration suggested to result from in situ cellular lysis or the presence of cellular metabolites le cloirec et al 1986 free aas and short peptides can also pass through nanofiltration membranes escobar et al 2000 thus even though the concentration of free aas is typically much lower than the concentration of combined aas greater proportions of free aas are likely to reach the disinfection step in a drinking water treatment process resulting in the formation of dbps like n chloroamino acids conyers and scully 1993 how et al 2016 n chloropeptides huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 keefe et al 1997 and halonitroalkanes halonitriles and haloamides shah and mitch 2012 two dbps that form from aas that have already been identified in chlorinated water are the aldehydes iv in fig 1 and n chloraldimines vi freuze et al 2005 hrudey et al 1988 typically aldehydes and n chloraldimines formed from aas have low odour threshold concentrations of 0 9 30 μg l 1 table 1 in particular aldehydes and n chloraldimines formed from isoleucine leucine phenylalanine and valine have previously been detected in chlorinated drinking waters in concentrations greater than their odour threshold concentrations hrudey et al 1988 table 1 non halogenated nitriles are also formed during the chlorination of aas viii fig 1 however they typically have a much higher odour threshold concentration up to 1000 times higher than the odour threshold concentration of the corresponding aldehyde table 1 to date only six different non halogenated nitriles have been detected in drinking waters liew et al 2012 including 3 methylbutyronitrile and benzyl cyanide while non halogenated nitriles are non odorous they have been found to be more toxic than the corresponding aldehydes due to liberation of hydrogen cyanide during metabolisation tanii and hashimoto 1984 therefore nitriles formed from the chlorination of aas in drinking water are still potentially harmful to human health to date there have been limited studies brosillon et al 2009 hrudey et al 1988 of the presence of dbps which can be derived from the chlorination of amino acids in operational drinking water treatment plants in this study we measured aldehydes n chloraldimines and nitriles which can be derived from the reaction of chlorine with four aas that we have previously studied how et al 2017 isoleucine leucine phenylalanine and valine table 1 in four drinking water treatment plants dwtps in order to understand how the presence of aas influenced the formation of these dbps the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn and free aas in all water samples were also measured this field study was augmented with laboratory formation potential studies for confirmation of the formation of carboxylic acids from the chlorination of amino acids volatile carboxylic acids have also been found to be odorous ábalos et al 2000 with odour thresholds ranging from 0 007 to 0 27 mm salo 1970 finally the impact of the presence of ammonia and of varying the chlorine to aa ratio were also examined using formation potential experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemicals used in this study are listed in table s1 in the

bottles as grab samples in multiple sampling events dates of sampling are listed in table 3 as n chloraldimines are destroyed upon quenching how et al 2017 kimura et al 2015 all chlorinated or chloraminated samples were collected in triplicate with two of the triplicate samples being quenched using two different quenching agents and the third triplicate sample being left unquenched ascorbic acid was used to quench samples for analysis of aas and dbps as recommended by kristiana et al 2014 sodium sulphite was used to quench samples for analysis of doc and tdn as ascorbic acid contains organic carbon which would contribute to the doc concentration sample bottles were filled with no headspace and kept cool in an ice box during transport to the laboratory all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membrane filter pall life science michigan usa samples were then stored at 4 c until analysis which was typically within 24 h especially for the dbp analysis trip and field blanks containing ultrapure water and quenching agents were also prepared for each sampling trip to identify if there was any contamination through the sampling process transport and storage

then transferred to the gc injector port for thermal desorption at 300 c for 3 min the operating conditions for the agilent 6890n gas chromatograph agilent victoria australia coupled with an agilent

australia with isocratic elution using 60 25 mm phosphate buffer at ph 2 5 and 40 acetonitrile at 0 5 ml min 1 for 7 min 2 7 formation potential experiments all formation potential fp experiments were conducted by addition of aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution to filtered 0 45 μm drinking water samples from dwtp 1 apr 15 sample the initial chlorine concentration required for each fp experiment was determined from a chlorine demand experiment as per standard method 2350 b apha et al 2005 the residual free chlorine concentration was determined using the dpd colorimetric method as per standard method 4500 cl g apha et al 2005 formation potential samples 500 ml were chlorinated in duplicate mixed thoroughly and then subsampled into duplicate 60 ml vials with no headspace for each time point the vials were stored in the dark at room temperature 20 25 c until analysis as the fp samples were not quenched except for the samples used to test formation of isobutyric acid they were analysed by hs spme gc ms immediately after the required length of reaction time the samples used to test for the formation of isobutyric acid were quenched with ascorbic acid and analysed within 24 h amino acids isoleucine leucine and valine were added to selected drinking water samples before undertaking fp experiments such that the added concentration of each aa was 30 μm and the combined doc concentration of all three aas was 6 12 mg l 1 as c 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and removal of doc and free amino acids in drinking water treatment plants the concentrations of doc tdn individual aas and total free aas in each dwtp inlet and outlet on a number of sampling occasions are presented in table 3 the aa concentrations are reported above the loq 10 signal to noise ratio while only tdn was measured for each dwtp in this study previous studies have shown that ammonia contributes more than 65 of tdn in raw waters for both groundwater treatment plants dwtp 1 and 2 but is not detected after treatment and disinfection liew et al 2016 in dwtp 3 more than 80 of tdn in the raw surface water was previously found to be organic nitrogen liew et al 2016 with most doc being high molecular weight material of very hydrophobic character garbin et al 2010 therefore free aas which are low molecular weight and hydrophilic should only contribute a very small amount of doc in dwtp 3 in dwtp 4 the inlet water is a mix of treated groundwater desalinated water and surface water with the total doc concentration maintained below 2 mg l 1 as c the high tdn in the outlet of dwtp 4 was due to the use of inorganic monochloramine as the disinfectant the total concentrations of free aas in raw waters were between 0 7 and 2 8 μg l 1 as n contributing between 0 06 and 2 of the total dissolved nitrogen the total free aa concentrations were comparable to previous studies of surface waters where the concentrations of free aas were found to be between 0 7 and 4 μg l 1 as n chinn and barrett 2000 dotson and westerhoff 2009 considering all dwtps the average total free aa concentration in the raw water 1 9 0 6 μg l 1 as n 1σ was statistically the same as the concentration in the treated water 1 7 1 μg l 1 as n 1σ although generally concentrations decreased slightly after treatment the most frequently detected aas leucine proline tryptophan and phenylalanine table 3 were detected in both raw water and treated water in all sampling events the least frequently detected aas lysine histidine and methionine were only detected in dwtp 3 apr 15 table 3 the target aas isoleucine leucine phenylalanine and valine table 3 contributed an average 60 of the total concentration of free aas in the raw waters suggesting that the dbps from the target aas would be the most likely to have an impact on the treated water quality valine was the most abundant aa 48 95 in eight of the 16 samples while glycine 48 73 and alanine 46 64 were the most abundant aas in four and three samples respectively one sample dwtp 1 outlet apr 15 had serine as the most abundant aa 48 but the total aa concentration in this sample was very low 0 18 μg l 1 as n the high relative abundance of valine compared to other aas in the waters measured supports its choice as a target aa in this study which was based on a previous chlorination pathway study mccormick et al 1993 and studies of aldehydes and n chloraldimines brosillon et al 2009 freuze et al 2005 while odorous dbp formation from glycine has not been studied we have previously identified chlorinated glycine n chloroglycine to be the n chloramino acid of highest health risk how et al 2016 based on the reaction pathways between amino acids and free chlorine fig 1 alanine would be converted to acetonitrile which has been found to be potentially harmful to human health in drinking water nrc 1982 changes in the aa concentration before and after drinking water treatment were variable and without an obvious pattern for example the concentration of valine generally decreased after treatment but was observed to remain constant for two sampling events dwtp 1 and 3 nov 15 table 3 there were also examples of aas detected in treated water but not raw water at the same sampling event for example in two sampling events glycine was not detected in raw water for dwtp 4 but was the major contributor to the total aas concentration in the treated water the change in aas concentration and contribution to total aas may be influenced by doc removal but may also be influenced by disinfection as the disinfectant chlorine or inorganic monochloramine will have a different relative reactivity with each aa how et al 2016 which would result in a higher proportion of less reactive aas remaining in the treated water in addition the chlorination of more complex organic matter can result in the formation of simpler compounds richardson and postigo 2012 in this case the oxidation of proteins might result in the formation of additional free aas the change in aa concentrations can also result from other treatment steps such as sand filtration after release of free aas from the lysis of bacterial or algal cells le cloirec et al 1986 or changes in aa concentrations in the raw water over time in this study treated water samples were collected within an hour of the collection of the raw water samples and therefore will not capture changes in aa concentrations in the raw source water the use of composite sampling instead of grab sampling could correct for changes in aa concentration over time but could still be impacted by ongoing cell lysis or disinfection reactions doc concentrations also varied between water sources with the highest doc concentrations measured in dwtp 2 groundwater and dwtp 3 surface water the doc concentration in the raw water of dwtp 1 was variable resulting from the use of varying groundwater bore combinations for the source water the lowest doc concentrations were measured in dwtp 4 source water which includes previously treated groundwater and desalinated seawater both of which have relatively low doc concentrations some seasonal effects were seen for surface water dwtp 3 where the doc concentration was lower in autumn april than in spring november which may be related to natural organic matter nom inputs during winter rainfall garbin et al 2010 in contrast the total free aa concentration was higher in autumn than in spring which may reflect increased algal activity in summer autumn the doc removal efficiencies of all dwtps ranged between 0 and 90 the lowest removal efficiencies 0 and 24 were recorded for dwtp 4 which had the lowest source water doc concentration and contains water that has been previously treated for nom removal the doc removal efficiency was correlated with doc raw water concentration raw waters with high doc concentration also had high doc removal for 6 out of the 8 sampling events the doc concentration was reduced to below 2 mg l 1 as c after treatment regardless of the initial doc concentration indicating the presence in all source waters of a fraction of doc which is not removed by conventional nom removal techniques 3 2 potential for disinfection by product formation in drinking water all of the dbps that were analysed by hs spme gc ms i e aldehydes n chloroaldimines and nitriles were below their respective lods 0 001 0 04 μm in the treated and disinfected drinking waters results not shown this is probably due to the low concentrations of free aas detected in the raw drinking waters table 3 based on the 30 yield of aa transformation to the targeted dbps observed in our previous laboratory studies how et al 2017 the concentrations of target aas measured in the raw waters 0 001 0 1 μm are estimated to produce between 0 0003 and 0 03 μm of the analysed dbps most of these estimated concentrations are below lod 0 001 0 04 μm although these estimations ignore the potential for changes in aa concentrations during drinking water treatment in order to investigate the maximum dbp formation from one of these raw waters a fp experiment was conducted using dwtp 1 apr 15 raw water adding aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution to achieve a targeted residual free chlorine concentration of 10 mg l 1 as cl2 0 139 mm after 7 days the concentrations of aldehydes nitriles and n chloraldimines were measured after 1 and 7 days table 4 little or none of these dbps were detected consistent again with the low concentrations of the precursor free aas measured in this raw water in contrast similar formation potential studies conducted in our research group using wastewater with higher aa concentrations found formation of all targeted odorous compounds in all samples after 7 days how 2016 to confirm that the lack of formation of the three classes of dbps was due to low precursor aa concentrations and not due to an unknown interference a second fp of the dwtp 1 apr 15 raw water sample was undertaken after addition of isoleucine leucine and valine 30 μm each the concentrations of dbps formed after 1 and 7 days are presented in table 4 for comparison a fp experiment using ultrapure water with the same aas added was also conducted table 4 to ensure that the two fp experiments were comparable and that sufficient chlorine was present to react with the added aas the target chlorine residual after 7 days was again 10 mg l 1 as cl2 0 139 mm overall the concentrations of aldehydes n chloroaldimines and nitriles measured in these fp samples with aas added were much higher than those measured in the raw water without added aas table 4 confirming that very low dbp concentrations were the result of very low precursor aa concentrations in the raw water however comparison of concentrations of dbps after day 1 and day 7 showed that the concentrations of aldehydes and nitriles increased in the raw water sample with added aas but decreased in the ultrapure water with added aas the reduction in aldehyde and nitrile concentrations in the ultrapure water with added aas over 7 days was expected as the same behaviour was observed in our previous study of dbp formation from valine how et al 2017 from that study we hypothesized that over time n chloroisobutyraldimine would transform to isobutyraldehyde and isobutyronitrile while isobutyraldehyde and isobutyronitrile would transform to isobutyric acid a carboxylic acid fig 1 these reactions are likely to occur with isoleucine and leucine as well as seen in table 4 the increase in aldehyde and nitrile concentrations observed over time for the raw water with added aas might be due to degradation of proteins and peptides in the raw water and corresponding production of more free aas resulting from the high chlorine dose 42 mg l 1 as cl2 0 583 mm while the concentrations of aldehydes and nitriles measured in the fp experiments from the raw water with added aas and the ultrapure water with added aas were similar table 4 higher concentrations of n chloraldimines were formed from the raw water with added aas than the ultrapure water with added aas this enhancement in concentration might be due to the presence of nom either through an increase in n chloraldimine stability or an alteration to the reaction pathways to favour the formation of n chloraldimines further study is required to understand this enhancement in concentration 3 3 formation of additional by products from aldehyde and nitrile transformations to confirm the hypothesis that the reduction in aldehyde and nitrile concentrations observed over time in the fp experiments using aas in ultrapure water table 4 was the result of the formation of the corresponding carboxylic acid e g isobutyric acid from valine additional experiments were conducted using valine 4 mm in which the chlorine to valine ratio was varied as 1 2 or 3 4 8 or 12 mm of chlorine the reaction mixtures were then analysed for the presence of isobutyric acid after 7 days using hs spme gc ms with quantification using lc uv no isobutyric acid was detected for the sample with a chlorine to valine ratio of 1 table 5 for chlorine to valine ratios of 2 and 3 isobutyric acid was measured as 0 27 0 02 mm and 0 36 0 03 mm respectively equal to molar yields of 7 and 9 from valine we have previously shown that at a chlorine to valine ratio of 1 only n monochlorovaline ii fig 1 forms which degrades to isobutyraldehyde how et al 2017 n n dichlorovaline v and isobutyronitrile viii are formed when the chlorine to valine ratio is 1 and their formation increases with increasing chlorine to valine ratio how et al 2017 however more information is required to clarify by which pathway isobutyric acid xii forms in these experiments as it is expected that most of the chlorine added would react with the valine rather than be available to oxidise either the aldehyde or nitrile to the carboxylic acid due to the higher reactivity of chlorine with the amino acid rather than with the aldehyde or nitrile to determine if the formation of isobutyric acid is predominantly from the isobutyraldehyde or isobutyronitrile pathway individual solutions of isobutyraldehyde and isobutyronitrile 4 mm were treated with chlorine at a cl precursor molar ratio of 1 1 after 7 days isobutyric acid was quantified using lc uv and identified using hs spme gc ms in these experiments isobutyric acid was detected from chlorination of isobutyraldehyde 0 27 0 03 mm 7 yield but not from the chlorination of isobutyronitrile table 5 suggesting that conversion of isobutyronitrile to n chloroisobutyramide viii x in fig 1 is unlikely in order to further confirm this finding additional studies were undertaken with isobutyramide xi in fig 1 which is formed through the partial hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile and can potentially form isobutyric acid either through chlorination xi x xii or direct hydrolysis xi xii chlorination of isobutyramide at a cl precursor molar ratio of 1 1 produced 1 0 0 4 mm 25 yield of isobutyric acid much higher than formation of isobutyric acid from either isobutyraldehyde or isobutyronitrile however analysis of a control solution of isobutyramide without addition of chlorine after 7 days also showed significant isobutyric acid formation 0 6 mm 15 yield showing that the major pathway for isobutyric acid formation was from the direct hydrolysis of isobutyramide xi xii rather than by chlorination xi x xii however it is not possible to determine whether the addition of cl promoted the chlorination pathway or induced further acid hydrolysis of isobutyramide therefore the formation of isobutyric acid is likely to be limited by the slow hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile to isobutyramide the results from the isobutyric acid fp experiments from the aldehyde isobutyronitrile and isobutyramide suggested that the isobutyric acid observed from the chlorination of valine was predominantly formed from the oxidation of isobutyraldehyde to isobutyric acid iv xii therefore no isobutyric acid was formed when the chlorine to valine ratio was 1 table 5 due to insufficient chlorine available for the oxidation of the aldehyde in addition the higher yields of isobutyric acid observed for experiments with higher chlorine to valine ratios table 5 strongly suggest that isobutyric acid formation was influenced by the oxidant concentration 3 4 effect of ammonia in water and chloramination on the formation of odorous disinfection by products the effect of addition of ammonia at various concentrations on the chlorination of the target aas was investigated by treatment of valine 30 μm with a fixed concentration of free chlorine 10 mg l 1 as cl2 0 139 mm cl val 4 4 in the presence of ammonia with ammonia concentrations chosen to simulate chlorination above breakpoint chlorination at breakpoint chlorination and below breakpoint chlorination 1 25 2 and 4 mg l 1 as n additionally chloramination of valine 30 μm was conducted with preformed inorganic monochloramine 10 mg l 1 as cl2 see si text s2 for preparation details odorous dbps were analysed at 3 h and after 7 days and the concentrations are presented in table 6 after 3 h higher dbp concentrations were formed when chlorine alone was used compared to the experiments with ammonia present for example the concentration of isobutyronitrile was 19 μm after chlorination but only 1 μm after chloramination however by day 7 168 h more comparable concentrations of dbps were formed in all experiments table 6 thus it appears that while the presence of ammonia may influence short term rates of dbp formation overall it doesn t seem to affect longer term formation therefore the use of chloramination instead of chlorination does not appear to reduce the formation of these dbps from aas the presence of ammonia might affect the formation of the n n dichloramino acid ii v in fig 1 due to the competitive reaction of chlorine with ammonia to form inorganic monochloramine instead of reaction with the n monochloramino acid ii which would particularly affect the concentrations of isobutyronitrile viii r propane and n chloroisobutyraldimine vi r propane formed however the presence of inorganic monochloramine could also promote alternative reaction pathways such as the chloramination of the aldehyde iv to form the n chloramino alcohol ix which provides an alternative pathway for the formation of n chloroisobutyraldimine vi and isobutyronitrile viii from valine more studies are required to investigate the reaction rates of these proposed alternative pathways to confirm that these could explain the differences in dbp concentrations from chlorination and chloramination at 3 h and the similarities in concentrations after 7 days 3 5 comparison of laboratory formation studies and real systems at cl aa 4 4 the conversions of valine to isobutyraldehyde isobutyronitrile and n chloroisobutyraldimine were 5 55 and 10 respectively based on the results in table 6 ammonia to chlorine ratio 0 0 these results were slightly different to our previous study how et al 2017 where the conversions of valine to isobutyraldehyde isobutyronitrile and n chloroisobutyraldimine at cl aa 2 8 were 5 35 and 30 respectively indicating that the concentration and species of dbps formed from the chlorination of amino acids is affected by the chlorine to amino acid ratio in most real systems the chlorine to precursor individual aa ratio is likely to be two or three orders of magnitude higher than the ratio used in our laboratory formation studies for example at dwtp 1 the initial chlorine concentration required to achieve 2 mg l 1 free cl2 residual during the november 2015 sampling event would be around 6 mg l 1 as cl2 85 μm based on the chlorine demand experiment conducted assuming that the valine concentration in the pre chlorinated water was the same as that measured in the raw water 2 0 μg l 1 as n or 0 14 μm the chlorine to valine ratio would be approximately 600 1 given that valine was the aa measured in the highest concentration in the raw water and that this estimation assumes that no free aas were removed or added before chlorination the cl aa ratio of other aas will be even higher in the fp experiments investigating dbp formation from raw drinking water with added aas table 4 and the impact of ammonia on dbp formation from ultrapure water with added aas table 6 the chlorine to valine ratio is at least 4 4 and only 5 10 of valine was observed to convert to n chloroisobutyraldimine the lower conversion would result from higher chlorine to valine ratios either suppressing the conversion of n n dichlorovaline v fig 1 to n chloroisobutyraldimine vi or enhancing the degradation of n chloroisobutyraldimine vi to isobutyronitrile viii since the formation of isobutyraldehyde which we previously proposed to predominantly result from the degradation of n monochlorovaline how et al 2017 was similar in both the previous how et al 2017 and current studies 5 in both studies the formation of n monochlorovaline and consequently n n dichlorovaline should also be similar in both studies therefore the lower measured yield of n chloroisobutyraldimine from valine in this study 10 compared to 30 is more likely to be due to its enhanced degradation into isobutyronitrile vi viii rather than suppressed formation from the degradation of n n dichlorovaline in addition since the oxidation of isobutyraldehyde to isobutryic acid would be dependent on the chlorine concentration higher chlorine concentrations would result in faster oxidation of isobutyraldehyde to isobutyric acid increasing the rate of isobutyraldehyde oxidation to isobutyric acid also indirectly increases the rate of n chloroisobutyraldimine degradation as equilibrium would favour further n chloroisobutyraldimine degradation into both isobutyraldehyde and isobutyronitrile in contrast to chlorine oxidation reactions the rate of hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile i e viii to xi in fig 1 is only dependent on the ph and does not increase with increasing chlorine concentration given the ph was 7 5 for both our previous how et al 2017 and current studies the rate of hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile should be similar in both studies and any additional degradation of n chloroisobutyraldimine would result in the accumulation of isobutyronitrile this agrees with the higher yield of isobutyronitrile from valine observed in this study 55 than measured in our previous study 35 4 conclusions although good removal of doc was generally observed in the drinking water treatment plants studied the concentrations of free aas were not significantly reduced however these free aas contributed only a small fraction of don or tdn and odorous dbps listed in table 4 were not detected in the drinking water systems a study of total aas including proteins and peptides is required to better understand the impact of all forms of aas on water treatment however the formation potential experiments undertaken conclusively showed that isobutyric acid can be formed from the chlorination of valine therefore if the distributed water is expected to have a long retention time in the system 7 days the formation of carboxylic acids from the degradation of aldehydes and nitriles themselves derived from aas should also be considered and measured as volatile carboxylic acids have been found to be odorous although carboxylic acids generally have low chronic health effects leung and paustenbach 1990 the toxicity has not been tested for all carboxylic acids and thus some carboxylic acids may still be of human health concern dbp formation potential experiments with chlorine in the presence of different ammonia concentrations showed that while the presence of ammonia changed the short term rate of formation of the odorous dbps overall there was little impact on the final concentration of these dbps chlorination studies conducted for valine at cl aa ratios 4 4 showed that the proportion of aldehydes nitriles and n chloraldimines formed was dissimilar to the chlorination experiments undertaken with valine at cl aa 2 8 indicating that the cl aa ratio is an important factor in dbp formation pathways to date most studies of dbp formation from aas have been undertaken at low cl aa ratios additional experiments with conditions that are closer to those of real water systems where generally high cl aa ratios of 100 exist will improve understanding of the formation of these dbps in

19264,anaerobic digestion ad has been widely used in sludge treatment for biogas recovery organic fraction stabilization and sludge reduction however after ad sludge filterability is extremely deteriorated due to the release of biopolymers and the formation of fine particles ad sludge is generally rich in nutrients mainly ammonium nitrogen and phosphates that result from biopolymer degradation we designed a conditioning process that combines the in situ crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate map as a skeleton builder with organic polymer flocculation we show that crystallized map can bind with extracellular polymeric substance fractions to increase sludge floc density the molecular structure and electrical charge of organic polymers importantly influence sludge particle flocculation and aggregation we found that cationic polyacrylamides form flocs that aggregate with branching structures which are characterized by a larger size and a more compact structure simultaneous crystallization and flocculation produced by a magnesium organic polymer gel improved ad dewaterability more than the separate addition of magnesium ions and organic polymers the method of sludge conditioning that we propose was tested by extensive use in different ad sludge conditioning protocols the method reduces the ammonium nitrogen load in ad liquor and increases the suitability of the biosolids for use as land fertilizer graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion sludge cationic organic polymers dewaterability floc morphology in situ magnesium ammonium phosphate crystallization 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the major byproduct of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and disposing of it is increasingly challenging standards governing effluent treatment have become more stringent and population growth and industrial expansion have increased the quantity of wastewater that must be treated annual production of sludge cake with moisture content of 80 had exceeded 30 million tons in china by 2015 and is expected to reach 50 million tons by 2020 sludge must be disposed of cost effectively and safely sludge management accounts for 30 60 of the total operating cost of a wwtp zhao and kugel 1996 zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 which makes it important to develop effective methods to recover energy and useful nutrients from sludge in order to reduce operating costs and increase the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment tay and show 1997 tay et al 2000 activated sludge is a heterogeneous colloidal system that consists mainly of microbial cells extracellular polymeric substances eps and inorganic minerals eps are produced by microorganisms and account for 60 80 of total sludge mass liu and fang 2003 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 eps are complex high molecular weight polymers and include polysaccharides proteins humic substances and nucleic acids eps can form gelatinous networks to which microorganisms adhere and which increase water retention and protect microorganisms against harmful pollutants eps are conducive to floc formation and increase flocculation of sludge particles cetin and erdincler 2004 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 the eps fraction influences floc stability settleability and dewaterability sludge particles are always negatively charged due to the ionization of anionic functional groups such as phosphate and carboxyl groups in eps which results in electrostatic repulsion between sludge particles and maintains the stability of the colloidal system many studies have demonstrated the crucial effects of eps on sludge dewaterability higgins and novak 1997 showed that sludge dewaterability was strongly influenced by the proportions of protein and polysaccharides in eps proteins exerted a more significant influence on sludge dewaterability than polysaccharides and a high protein polysaccharide ratio was detrimental to dewaterability this observation agreed with murthy and novak s 1999 findings eps in sludge were characterized by regionalization the outer eps fraction had a loose structure loosely bound eps lb eps and the inner eps fraction had a more compact structure tightly bound eps tb eps li and yang 2007 showed that a higher lb eps content weakened the bonds between cells resulting in poor settleability and dewaterability the higher protein content of lb eps also adversely affected sludge dewaterability yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 found that the composition of soluble eps s eps and lb eps changed over time while tb eps and pellets mainly composed of protein like substances were more stable sludge filtration performance is related to s eps while bound water content is primarily affected by bound eps a higher concentration of bound eps is related to an increase in bound water yuan et al 2017 anaerobic digestion ad has been used to treat biosolids for more than a century it has the advantages of reducing solids stabilizing the organic fraction and producing biogas over half the wwtps in the european union use anaerobic digestion in sludge treatment and china has recently encouraged large and medium wwtps to preferentially use ad wu et al 2014 there are typically four stages of ad solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis solubilization of biopolymers is widely accepted as the rate limiting stage of ad because of poor biodegradability due to the biofilm that protects eps and the cell walls or membranes zhao et al 2015 peng et al 2016 extensive thermal mechanical chemical and biological methods of hydrolysis have been developed to accelerate the ad rate wang et al 2013 li et al 2016 lee et al 2014 eps sludge floc morphology and sludge chemistry change greatly after ad proteins and polysaccharides are released into the sludge during hydrolysis and are then converted into methane carbon dioxide and humic substances the ammonium nitrogen and phosphate content of the sludge liquor dramatically increases due to the conversion of biopolymers in addition anaerobic digestion liquor can be highly alkaline degradation of eps can decrease flocculation activity and reduce the size of sludge particles thus in most cases sludge dewaterability and filterability will deteriorate after ad various technologies have been developed to improve sludge dewaterability including photo fenton fenton oxidation technology liu et al 2013 tokumura et al 2007 thermal hydrolysis acid and alkali treatment zhu et al 2013 heat treatment neyens et al 2004 enzymatic treatment chen et al 2015 thomas et al 1993 and combinations of these processes these technologies can give good dewaterability but most of them are difficult to use in practice deep dewatering has been widely used in china to reduce sludge volume and to alleviate the pressure on wwtps caused by the rapid increase in sludge production deep dewatering requires chemical conditioning of the sludge and high pressure filter press equipment such as a plate and frame filter press or a diaphragm filter press inorganic coagulants aluminum salts and iron salts are used as chemical conditioners in high pressure filter press deep dewatering because they bind with the eps fraction through electrostatic neutralization and the hydrolysis products of inorganic coagulants increase floc strength through skeleton building cao et al 2016 however both aluminum salts and iron salts greatly reduce the alkalinity of the sludge through the hydrolytic reaction which is unfavorable for the subsequent use of the anammox process to treat filtrates containing high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and adversely affect subsequent sludge disposal such as land use ad sludge bulk is characterized by high levels of ammonium nitrogen and phosphates this observation led us to design an innovative sustainable conditioning process which combines the in situ crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate map as a skeleton builder and organic polymer flocculation without reducing alkalinity we monitored floc formation and cake morphology under chemical conditioning and optimized this conditioning process the distribution and chemical composition of eps in ad sludge were investigated to provide an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of in situ crystallization and cationic organic polymer

samples were analyzed by a nicolet 8700 ft ir spectrometer to identify the various functional groups in bound eps samples all spectra were in the scanning range 500 4000 cm 1 2 3 4 other indicators dissolved organic carbon doc content was determined using a toc l total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu inc japan other sludge parameters including total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 the ph was measured by a phs 3c ph meter shanghai china each treatment sample was measured in triplicate and the relative deviations for all analyses were calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of map crystallization on sludge properties 3 1 1 effect of map treatment on sludge dewaterability the concentrations of both po4 3 and nh4 drop to a relatively low level at ph 8 fig s1 suggesting that the map reaction is favored near this ph level accordingly the experiment was carried out at raw sludge ph of 7 88 as shown in fig 1 at molar ratios of mg p that are greater than 1 1 5 the srf and cstn of the sludge decreased as the ratio of mg2 nh4 increased by adding mgcl2 which indicates that the formation of map crystals improved sludge dewaterability at a molar ratio of mg p of 1 1 5 dewaterability initially increased and then gradually reduced as the mg2 dosage increased which was likely due to the formation of mg3 po4 2 rather than map the solubility product constant of mg3 po4 2 ksp 6 31 10 26 was much lower than that of mgnh4po3 ksp 2 5 10 13 and mg3 po4 2 would preferentially precipitate at a high po4 3 concentration mg3 po4 2 precipitate has a small particle size and easily blocks cake pores and the filtration medium thereby decreasing sludge dewaterability although map treatment improves sludge dewaterability the minimum moisture content was still high so chemical flocculation is needed to further enhance ad sludge dewaterability 3 1 2 changes in water quality of sludge liquor under map formation changes in sludge liquid constituents after map treatment are shown in fig 2 a and c residual nh4 decreased as the mg2 and po4 3 dosages increased indicating that a map reaction occurred and nh4 n was recovered with a maximum recovery efficiency of 46 05 at the same mg2 nh4 molar ratio the concentration of nh4 did not reach the minimum at the mg p molar ratio of 1 15 fig 2a which might be due to the competing reaction of mg3 po4 2 precipitation more mg2 was converted into mg3 po4 2 at a high po4 3 content and the proportion of mg2 available for map was reduced resulting in a decrease in nh4 removal as shown in fig 2b for mg p molar ratios of less than 1 1 2 po4 3 concentration increased significantly as mg2 concentration increased indicating that most po4 3 was not involved in the reaction at mg2 nh4 molar ratios of less than 0 25 there was no significant change in po4 3 content as the mg2 nh4 molar ratio increased indicating that most po4 3 was removed the mg2 concentration in the liquid increased gradually as the mg2 nh4 molar ratio increased residual mg2 in sludge liquor tended to decrease at lower mg p molar ratios fig 2c fig s2 shows that the consumption of nh4 po4 3 and mg2 increases as the po4 3 and mg2 dosages increase removal of nh4 in the sludge liquor is mainly related to map crystallization so nh4 consumption directly reflects map production sludge dewaterability and map yield are well correlated except when the molar ratio of mg p is 1 1 5 table s2 some proportion of consumed po4 3 was converted to map and some formed mg3 po4 2 the main reaction equations are 5 mg2 nh4 hpo4 3 mgnh4po4 h 6 3mg2 2hpo4 3 mg3 po4 2 2h the difference between po4 3 consumption and nh4 consumption indicates the production of mg3 po4 2 fig 2d shows the relative proportions of map and mg3 po4 2 at a certain mg2 nh4 molar ratio the proportion of mg3 po4 2 in the product increases as the po4 3 dosage increases this observation indicates that a high concentration of po4 3 leads to the generation of a high quantity of mg3 po4 2 which blocks the passage of water release and reduces sludge dewaterability thus sludge dewaterability was influenced by competition for reaction with po4 3 between map and mg3 po4 2 the reaction kinetics curves fig s3 show rapid crystallization of map after 3 min reaction the concentration of po4 3 reached an equilibrium at 22 1 mg l although mg2 was consumed rapidly there was a continuing slow decrease until 20 min possibly because mg2 chelates with organic compounds to form metal organic complexes in the sludge thus mg2 not only induces the map crystallization reaction but also functions as a coagulant to bind with eps fractions in the sludge 3 1 3 effect of map treatment on microstructure of sludge flocs fig 3 shows changes in floc morphology for different ph values the floc surface became rougher and more pores developed after the map treatment the wedge shaped struvite crystals with sizes of 5 8 μm at ph 6 5 and 10 15 μm at ph 8 covered the sludge surface and became embedded in the flocs struvite crystals in the sludge flocs build skeletal support for floc structures the crystals substantially disappeared at ph 9 5 indicating that high ph prevented map formation 3 1 4 effect of map treatment on soluble eps the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem method is widely used for the characterization of natural organic matter in various water bodies henderson et al 2009 the fluorescent intensity of eem can be used to measure eps content if doc content 10 mg l sheng and yu 2006 three distinct peaks peak a λex em 285nm 350 nm peak b λex em 235nm 375 nm and peak c λex em 320nm 290 nm were observed in the 3d eem profile of ad sludge filtrate fig 4 the peaks respectively indicate the presence of soluble microbial by products proteins and humic acid and fulvic acid substances chen et al 2003 fig s4 shows that the eps fluorescent intensity of the treated sludge was weaker than for the raw sludge in the ph range 6 5 7 5 but it became more intense as ph increased this result shows that map formed during crystallization adsorbed biopolymers and that deprotonation of the biopolymer anionic functional groups at high ph increased biopolymer solubilization zhang et al 2016 3 2 effect of map combined with pam flocculation 3 2 1 effects of pam molecular structure on sludge dewaterability three pams were chosen for further sludge conditioning fig 5 cpam npam and apam pams capture and agglomerate fine sludge particles through adsorption and hydrogen bond interactions cstn decreased after conditioning by different pams and cpam most improved sludge dewaterability further reducing the moisture content to 83 23 sludge flocs usually have a net negative charge sobeck and higgins 2002 so electrical neutralization reduces the electrostatic repulsion among sludge particles and improves flocculation performance zhao et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 3 2 2 floc morphology under combined conditioning fig 6 a shows that sludge floc size increased after flocculation with different pams especially cpam changes in particle size showed significant correlation with changes in srf and cstn and larger particle size was related to better dewaterability the fractal dimension d f after cpam flocculation fig 6b noticeably increased which indicates the formation of a more compact floc structure jarvis et al 2005 wang et al 2009 according to the dlvo theory the high positive charge density of cpam causes compression of the electric double layer of colloidal sludge particles which results in a denser eps structure and more compact floc structure hermansson 1999 esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 fig 8 shows confirmation of this densification as the content of eps extracted from sludge flocs decreases with the increase in cpam dosage it is also clear that cpam has a branched structure fig s5 while apam and npam are chain molecules the branching enhances the bridging effects significantly benefiting subsequent floc growth wu et al 2016 the larger flocs formed by cpam result in lower surface tension so some of the water adsorbed on the floc surface is released urbain et al 1993 sludge flocs formed from chemical conditioning are likely to be broken up by the pumping process because there is little active flocculation of ad sludge particles we conducted a floc aggregation breakage reaggregation experiment see fig 7 floc particle size increased rapidly and reached a plateau within 5 min of the addition of cpam which indicates a rapid flocculation reaction the flocs were sensitive to mechanical shearing faster rotation during the breakage period led to greater breakage and a lower recovery factor table s2 thus in practice mechanical stirring in flocculation must be finely controlled 3 2 3 effects of combined conditioning process on eps fig 8 shows that the total eps that can be extracted slightly decreased with the increase in cpam dosage which might be related to a compressed eps structure the s eps fraction gradually decreased as cpam dosage increased while lb eps and tb eps fractions initially increased and then decreased this result indicates that s eps was converted into lb eps and tb eps at a low cpam dosage while the residual negatively charged eps was offset by compression of the double counterion layer resulting in further reduction of lb eps and tb eps yu et al 2008 showed that s eps was an important influence on sludge filterability and that sludge dewaterability was improved when soluble polymers were firmly trapped and compressed in inner layers compression of lb eps and tb eps also results in a more compact floc structure and the partial release of interstitial water more compact flocs act as a framework in the filter cake formed by filtration and maintain interstitial channels for permeability 3 3 effects of chemical conditioning with mg cpam gel on sludge properties 3 3 1 characterization of mg cpam gel scanning electron microscopy analysis fig s5 shows that there are clear differences in molecular structure between cpam and mg cpam gel cpam shows a slenderer branching structure having a diameter of 5 μm while the branches of mg cpam gel are thicker with a diameter of 20 μm thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric curves fig s6 show that pyrolysis of cpam and of mg cpam gel differ the molecular chain of pam changes from a stretched state to a compressed state in high salt so decreased viscosity was detected in pam data not shown after the pam solution was diluted the molecular chains gradually changed from the compressed state to a stretched state which increased flocculation zheng et al 2007 3 3 2 effects of mg cpam gel conditioning on sludge dewaterability mg cpam gels were prepared with different mgcl2 concentrations 1 2 5 and 7 and the sludge conditioning efficiency was evaluated fig 9 as the mg cpam gel dosage in terms of cpam dosage increased cstn decreased in contrast to the conditioning with 1 mg cpam gel cstn was more significantly reduced by the 2 5 and 7 mg cpam gels which indicates that a higher mg cpam ratio improves the effectiveness of sludge conditioning the mg cpam gel showed greater reduction in srf and cstn than did map crystallization followed by cpam flocculation srf and cstn were reduced to 6 21 1012 m kg and 0 96 s l g at a dosage of 0 0042 g pam g tss for sludge conditioning with 7 mg cpam gel but srf and cstn reached 6 48 1012 m kg and 1 94 s l g at a dosage of 0 004 g pam g tss the moisture content was reduced to 85 35 for mg cpam gel and to 87 27 for map crystallization followed by cpam flocculation it seems likely that mg cpam gel conditioning simultaneously caused crystallization and flocculation which improved flocculation and led to a more compact floc structure resulting in better dewaterability after mg cpam gel conditioning the alkalinity of the sludge filtrate was only slightly reduced and remained at a high level fig s7 which meets the requirements for further anammox treatment 3 3 3 effect of mg cpam gel conditioning on floc morphology fig 10 shows that floc size increased after the sludge was conditioned with 2 5 and 7 mg pam gels the mg cpam gels had a very good synergistic effect in improving sludge dewaterability as described above molecular chains of cpam shrink in a high salt solution fig s5 these compressed molecules diffuse more easily in ad sludge and the molecular chains gradually stretch as the salt concentration around the cpam molecules decreases during diffusion which improves flocculation zheng et al 2007 this effect was more apparent at a higher gel dosage map is negatively charged in neutral and alkaline conditions and thus map crystals could interact with cpam and increase flocculation by capturing sludge flocs through electrostatic interaction other studies have shown that map crystals can adsorb organic compounds foletto et al 2013 this adsorption of s eps and lb eps helps to form a compact floc structure thereby reducing sludge cake compressibility mg2 may also be active in sludge particle bridging overall there is an improvement in sludge dewaterability 3 3 4 effects of mg cpam gel conditioning on sludge cake microstructure the sludge surface became rougher and pores were well developed after conditioning with mg pam gels and these features can serve as water releasing channels fig 11 a d at higher mg cpam ratios the diameter of the surface pore channels gradually increased a cluster of granular crystalline particles with a diameter of 4 μm can be seen fig 11d these crystalline particles can function as a skeleton to support the sludge floc which will increase its structural strength and facilitate dewatering 3 3 5 effects of mg pam gel conditioning on sludge cake chemical composition the xrd patterns of sludge before and after mg cpam gel conditioning fig 12 a were obtained and analyzed by comparing with the standard jcpds database the peaks of raw sludge in the xrd pattern were similar to the peak of quartz pdf card 01 0649 probably from the siliceous minerals in sludge new peaks of sludge after conditioning that appeared in the xrd pattern were associated with map struvite international centre for diffraction data pdf card 03 0240 which is consistent with the crystals observed in fig 11d various characteristic peaks were found on the ft ir spectrum of raw sludge fig 12b the peaks from 2925 to 2935 cm 1 and 2850 2860 cm 1 showed the existence of aliphatic chains of polysaccharides proteins and humic substances sheng et al 2006 wang et al 2014 the absorption of wavelengths between 2930 and 1650 cm 1 was related to humic acids stretching vibrations of c c chai et al 2007 the absorption band between 1635 and 1655 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibrations of c o and c n of amide i of the protein sun et al 2012 tapia et al 2009 the band from 1445 to 1455 cm 1 was due to the deformation of the ch3 and ch2 groups of amide iii the spectral band observed from 1015 to 1045 cm 1 stretching vibration of o h groups was a characteristic absorption region of eps polysaccharides sun et al 2012 tapia et al 2009 omoike and chorover 2004 in summary ir analysis was consistent with the existence of proteins polysaccharides and humic substances in the sludge however after mg cpam gel conditioning the absorption intensities of peaks at 1016 1455 and 1646 cm 1 were weakened and the absorption peaks at 2924 2857 cm 1 almost disappeared this result shows that the protein and humic substances in sludge eps were covered by map which agrees with the eps analysis 4 conclusion this paper describes the design of a novel conditioning process for anaerobic digestion sludge the process consists of in situ magnesium ammonium phosphate map crystallization as a skeleton combined with organic polymer flocculation the process improves the dewaterability of anaerobic digestion sludge without reducing its alkalinity and reduces the burden of treating ammonium nitrogen in the subsequent anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process it also makes the sludge a more effective land fertilizer cpam was shown to be a better flocculant than npam or apam indicating that ionic neutralization is an important component conditioning with mg cpam gels had a synergistic effect in improving ad sludge dewaterability the simultaneous crystallization and flocculation resulting from mg cpam gel conditioning improves flocculation and forms a more compact and less compressible floc structure resulting in better ad sludge dewaterability the novel conditioning process proposed in this study will significantly improve the management production and disposal of

19264,anaerobic digestion ad has been widely used in sludge treatment for biogas recovery organic fraction stabilization and sludge reduction however after ad sludge filterability is extremely deteriorated due to the release of biopolymers and the formation of fine particles ad sludge is generally rich in nutrients mainly ammonium nitrogen and phosphates that result from biopolymer degradation we designed a conditioning process that combines the in situ crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate map as a skeleton builder with organic polymer flocculation we show that crystallized map can bind with extracellular polymeric substance fractions to increase sludge floc density the molecular structure and electrical charge of organic polymers importantly influence sludge particle flocculation and aggregation we found that cationic polyacrylamides form flocs that aggregate with branching structures which are characterized by a larger size and a more compact structure simultaneous crystallization and flocculation produced by a magnesium organic polymer gel improved ad dewaterability more than the separate addition of magnesium ions and organic polymers the method of sludge conditioning that we propose was tested by extensive use in different ad sludge conditioning protocols the method reduces the ammonium nitrogen load in ad liquor and increases the suitability of the biosolids for use as land fertilizer graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion sludge cationic organic polymers dewaterability floc morphology in situ magnesium ammonium phosphate crystallization 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the major byproduct of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and disposing of it is increasingly challenging standards governing effluent treatment have become more stringent and population growth and industrial expansion have increased the quantity of wastewater that must be treated annual production of sludge cake with moisture content of 80 had exceeded 30 million tons in china by 2015 and is expected to reach 50 million tons by 2020 sludge must be disposed of cost effectively and safely sludge management accounts for 30 60 of the total operating cost of a wwtp zhao and kugel 1996 zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 which makes it important to develop effective methods to recover energy and useful nutrients from sludge in order to reduce operating costs and increase the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment tay and show 1997 tay et al 2000 activated sludge is a heterogeneous colloidal system that consists mainly of microbial cells extracellular polymeric substances eps and inorganic minerals eps are produced by microorganisms and account for 60 80 of total sludge mass liu and fang 2003 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 eps are complex high molecular weight polymers and include polysaccharides proteins humic substances and nucleic acids eps can form gelatinous networks to which microorganisms adhere and which increase water retention and protect microorganisms against harmful pollutants eps are conducive to floc formation and increase flocculation of sludge particles cetin and erdincler 2004 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 the eps fraction influences floc stability settleability and dewaterability sludge particles are always negatively charged due to the ionization of anionic functional groups such as phosphate and carboxyl groups in eps which results in electrostatic repulsion between sludge particles and maintains the stability of the colloidal system many studies have demonstrated the crucial effects of eps on sludge dewaterability higgins and novak 1997 showed that sludge dewaterability was strongly influenced by the proportions of protein and polysaccharides in eps proteins exerted a more significant influence on sludge dewaterability than polysaccharides and a high protein polysaccharide ratio was detrimental to dewaterability this observation agreed with murthy and novak s 1999 findings eps in sludge were characterized by regionalization the outer eps fraction had a loose structure loosely bound eps lb eps and the inner eps fraction had a more compact structure tightly bound eps tb eps li and yang 2007 showed that a higher lb eps content weakened the bonds between cells resulting in poor settleability and dewaterability the higher protein content of lb eps also adversely affected sludge dewaterability yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 found that the composition of soluble eps s eps and lb eps changed over time while tb eps and pellets mainly composed of protein like substances were more stable sludge filtration performance is related to s eps while bound water content is primarily affected by bound eps a higher concentration of bound eps is related to an increase in bound water yuan et al 2017 anaerobic digestion ad has been used to treat biosolids for more than a century it has the advantages of reducing solids stabilizing the organic fraction and producing biogas over half the wwtps in the european union use anaerobic digestion in sludge treatment and china has recently encouraged large and medium wwtps to preferentially use ad wu et al 2014 there are typically four stages of ad solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis solubilization of biopolymers is widely accepted as the rate limiting stage of ad because of poor biodegradability due to the biofilm that protects eps and the cell walls or membranes zhao et al 2015 peng et al 2016 extensive thermal mechanical chemical and biological methods of hydrolysis have been developed to accelerate the ad rate wang et al 2013 li et al 2016 lee et al 2014 eps sludge floc morphology and sludge chemistry change greatly after ad proteins and polysaccharides are released into the sludge during hydrolysis and are then converted into methane carbon dioxide and humic substances the ammonium nitrogen and phosphate content of the sludge liquor dramatically increases due to the conversion of biopolymers in addition anaerobic digestion liquor can be highly alkaline degradation of eps can decrease flocculation activity and reduce the size of sludge particles thus in most cases sludge dewaterability and filterability will deteriorate after ad various technologies have been developed to improve sludge dewaterability including photo fenton fenton oxidation technology liu et al 2013 tokumura et al 2007 thermal hydrolysis acid and alkali treatment zhu et al 2013 heat treatment neyens et al 2004 enzymatic treatment chen et al 2015 thomas et al 1993 and combinations of these processes these technologies can give good dewaterability but most of them are difficult to use in practice deep dewatering has been widely used in china to reduce sludge volume and to alleviate the pressure on wwtps caused by the rapid increase in sludge production deep dewatering requires chemical conditioning of the sludge and high pressure filter press equipment such as a plate and frame filter press or a diaphragm filter press inorganic coagulants aluminum salts and iron salts are used as chemical conditioners in high pressure filter press deep dewatering because they bind with the eps fraction through electrostatic neutralization and the hydrolysis products of inorganic coagulants increase floc strength through skeleton building cao et al 2016 however both aluminum salts and iron salts greatly reduce the alkalinity of the sludge through the hydrolytic reaction which is unfavorable for the subsequent use of the anammox process to treat filtrates containing high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and adversely affect subsequent sludge disposal such as land use ad sludge bulk is characterized by high levels of ammonium nitrogen and phosphates this observation led us to design an innovative sustainable conditioning process which combines the in situ crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate map as a skeleton builder and organic polymer flocculation without reducing alkalinity we monitored floc formation and cake morphology under chemical conditioning and optimized this conditioning process the distribution and chemical composition of eps in ad sludge were investigated to provide an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of in situ crystallization and cationic organic polymer flocculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of anaerobic digestion sludge and reagents anaerobic digestion sludge was obtained from the xiaohongmen wwtp in beijing which reclaims 600 000 tonne d

provides rapid reproducible analysis of the particle size distribution of digested sludge with no effect on the shear strength of the floc structure floc size fractal dimension d f breakage factor b f and recovery factor r f were used to characterize and compare flocs a higher value of d f normally corresponds to a more compact interior floc structure sheng and yu 2006 wang et al 2009 for

1 extraction of eps we categorized eps as bound eps the fraction that is bound tightly to cell surfaces and soluble eps seps characterized by free movement between sludge flocs and the surrounding liquor rosenberger and kraume 2002 the bound eps have a double layered structure loosely bound eps lb eps diffused from the tightly bound eps tb eps surrounding the cells wingender et al 1999 liu and fang 2003 sludge cells in the outer region of flocs are entangled by weak interactions through lb eps tb eps adhere to cells and attach to the inner floc structure through strong interactions wingender et al 1999 eps fractions seps lb eps and tb eps of ad sludge were extracted by centrifugation and ultrasonication hongwei et al 2008 the raw sludge sample was centrifuged in a 50 ml tube at 3000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected as s eps slime the sludge pellet in the tube was resuspended into 50 ml of 0 05 nacl sonicated at 20 khz for 20 min shaken horizontally at 150 rpm for 10 min and sonicated again for 2 min the liquor was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min to separate solids and supernatant the supernatant was collected as lb eps the residue was transferred and heated for 30 min in a 60 c water bath the extracted solution was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and separated as tb eps the particulates present in the two eps fractions were removed by polytetrafluoroethylene membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm before organic analysis 2 3 3 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3 deem fluorescence technique is widely used to characterize natural organic matter in a water body it is highly sensitive and very accurate henderson et al 2009 a hitachi f 4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation range 200 400 nm and an emission range 220 550 nm was used for spectral analysis spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 12 000 nm min using excitation and emission slit bandwidths of 5 nm eps sample dilutions are noted in the figures 2 3 3 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy sludge samples were freeze dried under vacuum at 60 c for 72 h the samples were analyzed by a nicolet 8700 ft ir spectrometer to identify the various functional groups in bound eps samples all spectra were in the scanning range 500 4000 cm 1 2 3 4 other indicators dissolved organic carbon doc content was determined using a toc l total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu inc japan other sludge parameters including total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 the ph was measured by a phs 3c ph meter shanghai china each treatment sample was measured in triplicate and the relative deviations for all analyses were calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of map crystallization on sludge properties 3 1 1 effect of map treatment on sludge dewaterability the concentrations of both po4 3 and nh4 drop to a relatively low level at ph 8 fig s1 suggesting that the map reaction is favored near this ph level accordingly the experiment was carried out at raw sludge ph of 7 88 as shown in fig 1 at molar ratios of mg p that are greater than 1 1 5 the srf and cstn of the sludge decreased as the ratio of mg2 nh4 increased by adding mgcl2 which indicates that the formation of map crystals improved sludge dewaterability at a molar ratio of mg p of 1 1 5 dewaterability initially increased and then gradually reduced as the mg2 dosage increased which was likely due to the formation of mg3 po4 2 rather than map the solubility product constant of mg3 po4 2 ksp 6 31 10 26 was much lower than that of mgnh4po3 ksp 2 5 10 13 and mg3 po4 2 would preferentially precipitate at a high po4 3 concentration mg3 po4 2 precipitate has a small particle size and easily blocks cake pores and the filtration medium thereby decreasing sludge dewaterability although map treatment improves sludge dewaterability the minimum moisture content was still high so chemical flocculation is needed to further enhance ad sludge dewaterability 3 1 2 changes in water quality of sludge liquor under map formation changes in sludge liquid constituents after map treatment are shown in fig 2 a and c residual nh4 decreased as the mg2 and po4 3 dosages increased indicating that a map reaction occurred and nh4 n was recovered with a maximum recovery efficiency of 46 05 at the same mg2 nh4 molar ratio the concentration of nh4 did not reach the minimum at the mg p molar ratio of 1 15 fig 2a which might be due to the competing reaction of mg3 po4 2 precipitation more mg2 was converted into mg3 po4 2 at a high po4 3 content and the proportion of mg2 available for map was reduced resulting in a decrease in nh4 removal as shown in fig 2b for mg p molar ratios of less than 1 1 2 po4 3 concentration increased significantly as mg2 concentration increased indicating that most po4 3 was not involved in the reaction at mg2 nh4 molar ratios of less than 0 25 there was no significant change in po4 3 content as the mg2 nh4 molar ratio increased indicating that most po4 3 was removed the mg2 concentration in the liquid increased gradually as the mg2 nh4 molar ratio increased residual mg2 in sludge liquor tended to decrease at lower mg p molar ratios fig 2c fig s2 shows that the consumption of nh4 po4 3 and mg2 increases as the po4 3 and mg2 dosages increase removal of nh4 in the sludge liquor is mainly related to map crystallization so nh4 consumption directly reflects map production sludge dewaterability and map yield are well correlated except when the molar ratio of mg p is 1 1 5 table s2 some proportion of consumed po4 3 was converted to map and some formed mg3 po4 2 the main reaction equations are 5 mg2 nh4 hpo4 3 mgnh4po4 h 6 3mg2 2hpo4 3 mg3 po4 2 2h the difference between po4 3 consumption and nh4 consumption indicates the production of mg3 po4 2 fig 2d shows the relative proportions of map and mg3 po4 2 at a certain mg2 nh4 molar ratio the proportion of mg3 po4 2 in the product increases as the po4 3 dosage increases this observation indicates that a high concentration of po4 3 leads to the generation of a high quantity of mg3 po4 2 which blocks the passage of water release and reduces sludge dewaterability thus sludge dewaterability was influenced by competition for reaction with po4 3 between map and mg3 po4 2 the reaction kinetics curves fig s3 show rapid crystallization of map after 3 min reaction the concentration of po4 3 reached an equilibrium at 22 1 mg l although mg2 was consumed rapidly there was a continuing slow decrease until 20 min possibly because mg2 chelates with organic compounds to form metal organic complexes in the sludge thus mg2 not only induces the map crystallization reaction but also functions as a coagulant to bind with eps fractions in the sludge 3 1 3 effect of map treatment on microstructure of sludge flocs fig 3 shows changes in floc morphology for different ph values the floc surface became rougher and more pores developed after the map treatment the wedge shaped struvite crystals with sizes of 5 8 μm at ph 6 5 and 10 15 μm at ph 8 covered the sludge surface and became embedded in the flocs struvite crystals in the sludge flocs build skeletal support for floc structures the crystals substantially disappeared at ph 9 5 indicating that high ph prevented map formation 3 1 4 effect of map treatment on soluble eps the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem method is widely used for the characterization of natural organic matter in various water bodies henderson et al 2009 the fluorescent intensity of eem can be used to measure eps content if doc content 10 mg l sheng and yu 2006 three distinct peaks peak a λex em 285nm 350 nm peak b λex em 235nm 375 nm and peak c λex em 320nm 290 nm were observed in the 3d eem profile of ad sludge filtrate fig 4 the peaks respectively indicate the presence of soluble microbial by products proteins and humic acid and fulvic acid substances chen et al 2003 fig s4 shows that the eps fluorescent intensity of the treated sludge was weaker than for the raw sludge in the ph range 6 5 7 5 but it became more intense as ph increased this result shows that map formed during crystallization adsorbed biopolymers and that deprotonation of the biopolymer anionic functional groups at high ph increased biopolymer solubilization zhang et al 2016 3 2 effect of map combined with pam flocculation 3 2 1 effects of pam molecular structure on sludge dewaterability three pams were chosen for further sludge conditioning fig 5 cpam npam and apam pams capture and agglomerate fine sludge particles through adsorption and hydrogen bond interactions cstn decreased after conditioning by different pams and cpam most improved sludge dewaterability further reducing the moisture content to 83 23 sludge flocs usually have a net negative charge sobeck and higgins 2002 so electrical neutralization reduces the electrostatic repulsion among sludge particles and improves flocculation performance zhao et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 3 2 2 floc morphology under combined conditioning fig 6 a shows that sludge floc size increased after flocculation with different pams especially cpam changes in particle size showed significant correlation with changes in srf and cstn and larger particle size was related to better dewaterability the fractal dimension d f after cpam flocculation fig 6b noticeably increased which indicates the formation of a more compact floc structure jarvis et al 2005 wang et al 2009 according to the dlvo theory the high positive charge density of cpam causes compression of the electric double layer of colloidal sludge particles which results in a denser eps structure and more compact floc structure hermansson 1999 esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 fig 8 shows confirmation of this densification as the content of eps extracted from sludge flocs decreases with the increase in cpam dosage it is also clear that cpam has a branched structure fig s5 while apam and npam are chain molecules the branching enhances the bridging effects significantly benefiting subsequent floc growth wu et al 2016 the larger flocs formed by cpam result in lower surface tension so some of the water adsorbed on the floc surface is released urbain et al 1993 sludge flocs formed from chemical conditioning are likely to be broken up by the pumping process because there is little active flocculation of ad sludge particles we conducted a floc aggregation breakage reaggregation experiment see fig 7 floc particle size increased rapidly and reached a plateau within 5 min of the addition of cpam which indicates a rapid flocculation reaction the flocs were sensitive to mechanical shearing faster rotation during the breakage period led to greater breakage and a lower recovery factor table s2 thus in practice mechanical stirring in flocculation must be finely controlled 3 2 3 effects of combined conditioning process on eps fig 8 shows that the total eps that can be extracted slightly decreased with the increase in cpam dosage which might be related to a compressed eps structure the s eps fraction gradually decreased as cpam dosage increased while lb eps and tb eps fractions initially increased and then decreased this result indicates that s eps was converted into lb eps and tb eps at a low cpam dosage while the residual negatively charged eps was offset by compression of the double counterion layer resulting in further reduction of lb eps and tb eps yu et al 2008 showed that s eps was an important influence on sludge filterability and that sludge dewaterability was improved when soluble polymers were firmly trapped and compressed in inner layers compression of lb eps and tb eps also results in a more compact floc structure and the partial release of interstitial water more compact flocs act as a framework in the filter cake formed by filtration and maintain interstitial channels for permeability 3 3 effects of chemical conditioning with mg cpam gel on sludge properties 3 3 1 characterization of mg cpam gel scanning electron microscopy analysis fig s5 shows that there are clear differences in molecular structure between cpam and mg cpam gel cpam shows a slenderer branching structure having a diameter of 5 μm while the branches of mg cpam gel are thicker with a diameter of 20 μm thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric curves fig s6 show that pyrolysis of cpam and of mg cpam gel differ the molecular chain of pam changes from a stretched state to a compressed state in high salt so decreased viscosity was detected in pam data not shown after the pam solution was diluted the molecular chains gradually changed from the compressed state to a stretched state which increased flocculation zheng et al 2007 3 3 2 effects of mg cpam gel conditioning on sludge dewaterability mg cpam gels were prepared with different mgcl2 concentrations 1 2 5 and 7 and the sludge conditioning efficiency was evaluated fig 9 as the mg cpam gel dosage in terms of cpam dosage increased cstn decreased in contrast to the conditioning with 1 mg cpam gel cstn was more significantly reduced by the 2 5 and 7 mg cpam gels which indicates that a higher mg cpam ratio improves the effectiveness of sludge conditioning the mg cpam gel showed greater reduction in srf and cstn than did map crystallization followed by cpam flocculation srf and cstn were reduced to 6 21 1012 m kg and 0 96 s l g at a dosage of 0 0042 g pam g tss for sludge conditioning with 7 mg cpam gel but srf and cstn reached 6 48 1012 m kg and 1 94 s l g at a dosage of 0 004 g pam g tss the moisture content was reduced to 85 35 for mg cpam gel and to 87 27 for map crystallization followed by cpam flocculation it seems likely that mg cpam gel conditioning simultaneously caused crystallization and flocculation which improved flocculation and led to a more compact floc structure resulting in better dewaterability after mg cpam gel conditioning the alkalinity of the sludge filtrate was only slightly reduced and remained at a high level fig s7 which meets the requirements for further anammox treatment 3 3 3 effect of mg cpam gel conditioning on floc morphology fig 10 shows that floc size increased after the sludge was conditioned with 2 5 and 7 mg pam gels the mg cpam gels had a very good synergistic effect in improving sludge dewaterability as described above molecular chains of cpam shrink in a high salt solution fig s5 these compressed molecules diffuse more easily in ad sludge and the molecular chains gradually stretch as the salt concentration around the cpam molecules decreases during diffusion which improves flocculation zheng et al 2007 this effect was more apparent at a higher gel dosage map is negatively charged in neutral and alkaline conditions and thus map crystals could interact with cpam and increase flocculation by capturing sludge flocs through electrostatic interaction other studies have shown that map crystals can adsorb organic compounds foletto et al 2013 this adsorption of s eps and lb eps helps to form a compact floc structure thereby reducing sludge cake compressibility mg2 may also be active in sludge particle bridging overall there is an improvement in sludge dewaterability 3 3 4 effects of mg cpam gel conditioning on sludge cake microstructure the sludge surface became rougher and pores were well developed after conditioning with mg pam gels and these features can serve as water releasing channels fig 11 a d at higher mg cpam ratios the diameter of the surface pore channels gradually increased a cluster of granular crystalline particles with a diameter of 4 μm can be seen fig 11d these crystalline particles can function as a skeleton to support the sludge floc which will increase its structural strength and facilitate dewatering 3 3 5 effects of mg pam gel conditioning on sludge cake chemical composition the xrd patterns of sludge before and after mg cpam gel conditioning fig 12 a were obtained and analyzed by comparing with the standard jcpds database the peaks of raw sludge in the xrd pattern were similar to the peak of quartz pdf card 01 0649 probably from the siliceous minerals in sludge new peaks of sludge after conditioning that appeared in the xrd pattern were associated with map struvite international centre for diffraction data pdf card 03 0240 which is consistent with the crystals observed in fig 11d various characteristic peaks were found on the ft ir spectrum of raw sludge fig 12b the peaks from 2925 to 2935 cm 1 and 2850 2860 cm 1 showed the existence of aliphatic chains of polysaccharides proteins and humic substances sheng et al 2006 wang et al 2014 the absorption of wavelengths between 2930 and 1650 cm 1 was related to humic acids stretching vibrations of c c chai et al 2007 the absorption band between 1635 and 1655 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibrations of c o and c n of amide i of the protein sun et al 2012 tapia et al 2009 the band from 1445 to 1455 cm 1 was due to the deformation of the ch3 and ch2 groups of amide iii the spectral band observed from 1015 to 1045 cm 1 stretching vibration of o h groups was a characteristic absorption region of eps polysaccharides sun et al 2012 tapia et al 2009 omoike and chorover 2004 in summary ir analysis was consistent with the existence of proteins polysaccharides and humic substances in the sludge however after mg cpam gel conditioning the absorption intensities of peaks at 1016 1455 and 1646 cm 1 were weakened and the absorption peaks at 2924 2857 cm 1 almost disappeared this result shows that the protein and humic substances in sludge eps were covered by map which agrees with the eps analysis 4 conclusion this paper describes the design of a novel conditioning process for anaerobic digestion sludge the process consists of in situ magnesium ammonium phosphate map crystallization as a skeleton combined with organic polymer flocculation the process improves the dewaterability of anaerobic digestion sludge without reducing its alkalinity and reduces the burden of treating ammonium nitrogen in the subsequent anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process it also makes the sludge a more effective land fertilizer cpam was shown to be a better flocculant than npam or apam indicating that ionic neutralization is an important component conditioning with mg cpam gels had a synergistic effect in improving ad sludge dewaterability the simultaneous crystallization and flocculation resulting from mg cpam gel conditioning improves flocculation and forms a more compact and less compressible floc structure resulting in better ad sludge dewaterability the novel conditioning process proposed in this study will significantly improve the management production and disposal of
