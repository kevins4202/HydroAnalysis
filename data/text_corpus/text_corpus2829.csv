14145,produced water pw is one of the main sources of oil pollution and it represents the most important environmental concern associated to the oil industry in this work microemulsion systems were used to remove dispersed oil from pw the systems used in the experiments were composed by pw as aqueous phase kerosene as oil phase isoamyl alcohol as co surfactant and dissolvan or lipesa as surfactant an experimental design was applied for process optimization experiments were performed according to scheffé net and showed oil removal efficiencies re between 24 99 the microemulsion extraction point used for the process optimization was composed by 60 wt pw 5 wt kerosene and 35 wt co surfactant surfactant ratio c s ratio 9 the effects of c s ratio microemulsion load capacity oil removal kinetics temperature and speed of phase separation were evaluated from these tests it was possible to achieve 100 oil removal using c s 9 t 25 min t 50 60 c demonstrating the feasibility of the systems evaluated keywords petroleum produced water surfactant microemulsion oil removal 1 introduction during petroleum extraction from the reservoir an aqueous effluent produced water pw is created its volume exceeds hydrocarbon production and comprises connate water chemicals and injected water 1 4 the chemical composition of the pw varies according to a broad range of factors and it depends mainly on the geological characteristics of the reservoir 5 it may contain solid particles dissolved organic materials and inorganic substances the presence of a high content of harmful substances in pw can hinder its disposal reuse and injection 6 8 after treatment approximately 90 of the pw volume is re injected into the reservoir or disposed into water bodies however injection in deep reservoirs becomes costly and may lead to seismic events 9 11 therefore the treatment of this effluent has a significant value for the gas oil and water market due to the growth of environmental concerns and presence of rigid legislations on the pw disposal along with the fact that this water has the potential of becoming a source of freshwater for some countries 12 13 although the pw treatment is technically promising and feasible state of the art technologies have high operating costs or limited capability to remove dispersed elements 14 18 currently the flotation has been the technique used for the treatment of this type of effluent but it can generate hazardous wastes to the environment such as the oily sludge from flotation 19 in recent decades the petroleum industry has given great emphasis to the study of surfactants and microemulsion systems mes especially regarding its use in petroleum production and treatment of solid and liquid wastes 19 21 microemulsions are thermodynamically stable systems with high interfacial area and the ability to solubilize both polar and nonpolar substances they are formed by two immiscible fluids usually oil and water stabilized by surfactant molecules in combination or not with a co surfactant that can be a short chain alcohol 22 winsor 24 proposed a classification that comprises four types of microemulsion systems winsor i wi is characterized by a lower oil in water o w microemulsion phase in equilibrium with excess of oil winsor ii wii is formed by an upper water in oil w o microemulsion phase in equilibrium with excess of water winsor iii wiii comprises an intermediate bicontinuous microemulsion in equilibrium with an upper oil phase and a lower water phase at last winsor iv wiv is formed by only a microemulsion phase in a previous work 23 the authors investigated the use of microemulsions for the simultaneous removal of metals from produced water in this research new microemulsion systems mes were developed as an alternative method to remove dispersed oil from produced water pw their main advantage when compared with the flotation method is the absence of solid waste generation the surfactants used in the systems were nonionic commercial demulsifiers employed common in the oil industry for process optimization some operational parameters were evaluated such as co surfactant c surfactant s ratio microemulsion load capacity oil removal kinetics and speed of phase separation a scheffé mixture model was used to perform the experiments in different mass proportions 2 materials and methods 2 1 real produced water this study used a synthetic produced water made based on samples of real effluent collected after a three phase separation process in a wastewater treatment plant of a refinery rio grande do norte brazil the real produced water presented high concentration of sodium and low concentrations of other metals ni 2 fe 2 pb 2 cd 2 cu 2 ag zn 2 ca 2 k mg 2 0 001 mg l oil and grease content ogc was 150 mg l being named as oily produced water opw to reproduce the synthetic sample accurately some physical and chemical properties of opw were obtained including ph conductivity turbidity dissolved metals and ogc all methods used to determine the parameters followed the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 24 oil removal experiments were carried out using synthetic opw since the real opw sample had its composition modified due the storage time to avoid this problem with the synthetic sample it was prepared on the same day of the analyses 2 2 oil removal experiments two mes were used in this study and were formulated with the following components aqueous phase xap synthetic oily produced water opw oil phase xop aviation kerosene and active matter phase xc s in a constant relationship of c s 9 chosen based on previous work 25 the authors used two commercial demulsifiers dissolvan 970 clariant and lipesa 1393 clariant as surfactant s iso amyl alcohol p a 2 pentanol vetec 98 5 was used as co surfactant c because it presents a short chain molecule and has the ability to modify surfactant packaging providing stability to the microemulsions and increasing their solubilization power consequently its use increased the microemulsion area inside the pseudo ternary phase diagram 26 the winsor ii region was chosen to remove the oil from the opw a volumetric titration methodology was used to obtain winsor ii areas wii in the pseudo ternary phase diagrams 23 first the maximum solubility point of active matter c s in the aqueous phase was determined in a glass vial the active matter 4 g was titrated dropwise with the aqueous phase until reaching the transition from cloudy to clear appearance the vial was weighed and the amount of aqueous solution added to the system was determined this point was called titration endpoint nine mixtures of oil phase active matter phase 10 to 90 wt and nine of aqueous phase oil phase 10 to 90 wt were titrated with this solution the titration endpoint was determined by the appearing of two phases clout to clear and after the formation of two phases the vials containing the systems were weighed and the amount of titrant was determined the winsor ii area in a pseudo ternary phase diagram was obtained by plotting the amounts wt of aqueous phase oil phase and surfactant co surfactant phase used in each experiment to perform oil removal from a synthetic opw 10 points inside the wii area were obtained according to an experimental design scheffé mixture model 27 the scheffé net variables evaluated in oil removal efficiency re were xap g xop g and xc s g the mass proportion wt of each compound was added to a glass vial and the system was stirred 5 min and centrifuged 3000 rpm 5 min to separate the microemulsion loaded with oil from the treated opw the oil removal experiments were performed at 27 c room temperature and had a ph 8 40 the change in ph value of produced water 7 62 is related to the presence of surfactant in the middle responsible for alkalinization of the system after each experimental run the microemulsion phase was withdrawn with the aid of a syringe to quantify the ogc present in the aqueous phase treated opw 2 g of aqueous samples were mixed with 1 g of n hexane synth 100 the samples were manually stirred during 2 min thus an upper organic phase comprising the n hexane and the remaining oil present in opw was formed this organic phase was withdrawn using a syringe and anhydrous sodium sulfate sigma aldrich 99 0 was added to eliminate any water that could be present 28 the ogc was quantified using an infracal analyzer wilks enterprise corp model hatr t2 tog tph the tests were made in duplicate and oil removal efficiencies re were calculated using eq 1 29 1 r e o g c o p w o g c t o p w o g c o p w 100 where o g c t o p w is the ogc of the treated aqueous phase and o g c o p w is the ogc of the initial opw sample o g c o p w 150 mg l the statsoft statistica 7 0 software was used for the calculation of estimated effects analysis of variance and determination of the response surfaces the significance of the three variables and their interactions were evaluated by the hypothesis test p value having a confidence level of 95 the special cubic model was applied for data interpretation values of coefficient of determination r² were calculated using eq 2 2 r 2 k 1 n y k y 2 k 1 n y k y 2 where y represents the experimental values y represents the calculated values k is the mean of the experimental values and n is the number of experimental values 2 3 determination of the optimal microemulsion system the optimal point was chosen based on the distribution of compounds in microemulsion composition and the maximum oil removal efficiency a point with greater amount of opw xap and lower xop and xc s was adopted the following operational and compositional conditions on the system were evaluated c s ratio mes load capacity oil removal kinetics temperature influence and speed of phase separation 2 3 1 c s ratio influence since the optimal point used a c s ratio 9 based on a previous work 25 different c s ratios c s 1 2 and 4 were evaluated to decrease the amount of co surfactant used the experiments were performed with 5 min of stirring time 3000 rpm at 27 c 2 3 2 microemulsion load capacity microemulsion phase obtained after the first extraction was stirred with a new opw sample 5 min 3000 rpm and 27 c then this new microemulsion phase was removed with the aid of a syringe being added to a new opw volume to verify its ability to remove oil in total 10 extractions were made the proportions used in each extraction were 33 3 microemulsion to 66 7 opw 2 3 3 kinetic study a differential model of order p was tested to describe the kinetics of oil removal as shown in eq 3 30 3 d o g c d t k o g c p where ogc is the oil and grease content of the aqueous phase after the removal time mg l k is the kinetic constant t is the removal time min p is the order of the kinetic model the data observed in this study were correlated with an order p kinetic model see eq 3 since the p value was not known the kinetic constant and p order for the treatment systems were estimated 2 3 4 temperature effect the effect of temperature on the microemulsion removal ability was evaluated from room temperature 27 c to 70 c the systems were manually stirred during 5 min it is important to point out that the centrifugation step was not used and the samples were capable to separate the aqueous and microemulsion phases spontaneously 2 3 5 evaluation of the phase separation speed the centrifugation speed used to promote phase separation varied from 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 rpm the experiments were performed using 5 min of stirring time c s ratio 9 and 27 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 real opw characterization the physicochemical properties of the real opw are shown in table 1 one can observe that the percentage of metals and ogc are lower than the values found in an average produced water 17 31 34 the sample was called as oily produced water due to its low ogc value 150 ppm from these data the synthetic opw was formulated based on physicochemical parameters such as salinity nacl vetec 99 ogc crude oil petrobras and ph conductivity and turbidity were measured however they were not controlled other constituents in low concentrations were not added to the synthetic sample 3 2 analysis of oil removal the wii areas inside the pseudo ternary phase diagrams are shown in fig 1 a dissolvan and b lipesa these figures also present the scheffé net a j that was placed near to the water rich side of the pseudo ternary diagram table 2 shows the ogc results for the treated aqueous phase and oil removal efficiency re of the assays point f for both surfactants had the lowest re the surfactants used had a hydrophilic character which allowed the excess surfactant to migrate to the aqueous phase in addition the concentration of surfactant s in the composition of point f 15 71 g l was above the critical micelle concentration c m c 2 8 10 2 g ml for dissolvan and 2 5 10 2 g ml for lipesa with the migration of the surfactant to the aqueous phase the formation of micellar aggregates direct micelles occurred trapping the oil droplets inside and preventing the migration of these droplets to the microemulsion phase in general the systems formulated with lipesa were more effective than those containing dissolvan since dissolvan had a higher hydrophilic character eqs 4 and 5 were obtained to predict the behavior of oil removal efficiency re for dissolvan and lipesa being the significant variables in bold 4 re 84 414xap 96 318xop 81

both systems indicating that the models are statistically significant and re was correctly predicted by the experimental data all coefficients selected except xapxop for dissolvan were statistically significant at a 95 confidence level obtaining values of r2 0 90 for dissolvan and r2 0 92 for the lipesa iso response surfaces for re of each model were obtained as shown in fig 2 one can observe that both systems had re 90 point a 60 wt xap 5 wt xop and 35 wt xc s was chosen as the optimal microemulsion system due to the high content of aqueous phase in its composition 3 3 study of oil removal using the optimal system the optimal microemulsion system was used to evaluate the influences of c s ratio microemulsion load capacity removal kinetics temperature and speed of phase separation 3 3 1 c s ratio influence fig 3 shows plots for oil and grease contents in the treated aqueous phases ogc and oil removal efficiency re as a function of c s ratio one can observe that the increase in co surfactant content contributes to an increase in oil removal efficiency increase in c s ratio according to the literature co surfactants have several roles in microemulsion applications for oil displacement including reduction of interfacial tension increase in the mobility of surfactant hydrocarbon tail allowing greater penetration of the oil phase into this region and influencing solubility properties of aqueous and oleic phases due to partitioning between phases 35 36 systems with lipesa showed greater oil removal efficiency when compared to dissolvan ones dissolvan presented a strong hydrophilic character and part of the surfactant remained in the aqueous phase of the system forming direct micelles around the oil droplets on the other hand the lipesa had a less hydrophilic character and as a consequence the dispersed oil phase was attracted by the surfactant tail group and was dragged to the oil continuous phase of the microemulsion the c s ratio 9 presented the best results for both systems a result consistent with other studies 25 despite this result the authors do not recommend the application of the co surfactant alone since that the stability of microemulsion can be compromised after some time 37 38 with that the surfactant would act as a stabilizer in the interface preventing its breakdown 3 3 2 microemulsion load capacity according to table 4 there are small variations in the results of re for the 10 extractions performed with the same microemulsion obtaining oil removals above 95 for both systems however the microemulsion volume decreased continuously after each extraction as shown in fig 4 a and c which depict first and last extraction of the system with dissolvan for system formulated with lipesa the reduction in volume is observed in fig 4 b and d this fact can be associated to the transport of water molecules from the microemulsion to the aqueous phase as opposed to the behavior of oil droplets that are displaced to the microemulsion phase this phenomenon occurs due to the increase in salt content at each removal test as new volumes of opw are added as a result the surfactants become more hydrophobic although the effect of salts in nonionic surfactants is less pronounced this may be related to the release of the hydration water of the polar head groups of the nonionic surfactant it is expected that the nacl in the w o microemulsion is dispersed in the core of w o structures and the addition of more salt leads to a decrease on the hydration of surfactant molecules resulting in water release salting out effect 39 42 3 3 3 kinetic study fig 5 shows the kinetic curves for both microemulsion systems high values of coefficient of determination r2 0 99 were found demonstrating that the model orders were close to 2 a value compatible with the results found by other authors in kinetic studies for oil removal by using different treatment methods 43 44 values at 25 min presented an ogc higher than the assays in previous times this can be associated to a longer centrifugation time that can unbalance the microemulsion phase releasing part of the oil phase to the aqueous phase therefore the maximum centrifugation time used was 25 min 3 3 4 temperature effect fig 6 shows how the increase in temperature enhanced the oil removal obtaining re 100 an increase in temperature leads to a reduction in surfactant hydrophilicity releasing the aqueous phase from the microemulsion in addition an increase in oil removal efficiency is observed due to the increase in affinity of the surfactant by the oil droplets it is also important to consider the effect of salt once cl ions dehydrate the ether oxygen of the surfactant ethylene oxide making the surfactant less hydrophilic salting out effect 45 46 system containing lipesa obtained re 100 at lower temperatures 50 c since dissolvan is more hydrophilic and required higher temperatures 60 c to display more lipophilic characteristics 3 3 5 evaluation of the phase separation speed fig 7 shows the behavior of oil extraction versus phase separation speed it is possible to observe that for the system formulated with dissolvan a speed up to 1500 rpm resulted in a 100 oil removal however above this speed the extraction started to drop out quickly reaching oil removal values 90 the increase in speed imbalances the microemulsion phase resulting in oil release to the aqueous phase a different behavior was observed in the system containing lipesa the increase in the speed favored the separation of phases and consequently the oil removal was increased with a speed up to 2500 rpm reaching a 100 oil removal considering the optimal centrifugation speeds values bellow 1500 rpm are recommended for dissolvan system and between 2000 2500 rpm for lipesa these values are in accordance with the ones recommended for microemulsion system stability since literature presents values bellow 3000 rpm 47 49 4 conclusions experiments using microemulsion systems for the treatment of oily produced water allow the following conclusions 1 real produced water presented high concentration of sodium and low concentrations of other metals ni 2 fe 2 pb 2 cd 2 cu 2 ag zn 2 ca 2 k mg 2 0 001 mg l 2 optimal microemulsion point comprised 60 aqueous phase 5 oil phase and 35 co surfactant surfactant c s phase 3 increasing c s ratio favored the removal of the dispersed oil 4 the same microemulsion phase could be used 10 times and was capable of extracting more than 95 of the oil present in each experimental run 5 the best process conditions used 25 min of stirring time t 50 c and 60 c for lipesa and dissolvan respectively and centrifugation speed 3000 rpm 6 the microemulsion treatment methodology mes developed in this work is a promising technology for the treatment of petroleum waste since it does not generate solid waste 7 the recovery of the oil phase from the liquid residue is possible by using a winsor i system by reducing the temperature the oil phase of the oil rich microemulsion is released forming an oil phase in excess this is a later stage of our study declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors

the best results for both systems a result consistent with other studies 25 despite this result the authors do not recommend the application of the co surfactant alone since that the stability of microemulsion can be compromised after some time 37 38 with that the surfactant would act as a stabilizer in the interface preventing its breakdown 3 3 2 microemulsion load capacity according to table 4 there are small variations in the results of re for the 10 extractions performed with the same microemulsion obtaining oil removals above 95 for both systems however the microemulsion volume decreased continuously after each extraction as shown in fig 4 a and c which depict first and last extraction of the system with dissolvan for system formulated with lipesa the reduction in volume is observed in fig 4 b and d this fact can be associated to the transport of water molecules from the microemulsion to the aqueous phase as opposed to the behavior of oil droplets that are displaced to the microemulsion phase this phenomenon occurs due to the increase in salt content at each removal test as new volumes of opw are added as a result the surfactants become more hydrophobic although the effect of salts in nonionic surfactants is less pronounced this may be related to the release of the hydration water of the polar head groups of the nonionic surfactant it is expected that the nacl in the w o microemulsion is dispersed in the core of w o structures and the addition of more salt leads to a decrease on the hydration of surfactant molecules resulting in water release salting out effect 39 42 3 3 3 kinetic study fig 5 shows the kinetic curves for both microemulsion systems high values of coefficient of determination r2 0 99 were found demonstrating that the model orders were close to 2 a value compatible with the results found by other authors in kinetic studies for oil removal by using different treatment methods 43 44 values at 25 min presented an ogc higher than the assays in previous times this can be associated to a longer centrifugation time that can unbalance the microemulsion phase releasing part of the oil phase to the aqueous phase therefore the maximum centrifugation time used was 25 min 3 3 4 temperature effect fig 6 shows how the increase in temperature enhanced the oil removal obtaining re 100 an increase in temperature leads to a reduction in surfactant hydrophilicity releasing the aqueous phase from the microemulsion in addition an increase in oil removal efficiency is observed due to the increase in affinity of the surfactant by the oil droplets it is also important to consider the effect of salt once cl ions dehydrate the ether oxygen of the surfactant ethylene oxide making the surfactant less hydrophilic salting out effect 45 46 system containing lipesa obtained re 100 at lower temperatures 50 c since dissolvan is more hydrophilic and required higher temperatures 60 c to display more lipophilic characteristics 3 3 5 evaluation of the phase separation speed fig 7 shows the behavior of oil extraction versus phase separation speed it is possible to observe that for the system formulated with dissolvan a speed up to 1500 rpm resulted in a 100 oil removal however above this speed the extraction started to drop out quickly reaching oil removal values 90 the increase in speed imbalances the microemulsion phase resulting in oil release to the aqueous phase a different behavior was observed in the system containing lipesa the increase in the speed favored the separation of phases and consequently the oil removal was increased with a speed up to 2500 rpm reaching a 100 oil removal considering the optimal centrifugation speeds values bellow 1500 rpm are recommended for dissolvan system and between 2000 2500 rpm for lipesa these values are in accordance with the ones recommended for microemulsion system stability since literature presents values bellow 3000 rpm 47 49 4 conclusions experiments using

14146,progresses on development of forward osmosis fo membrane should be accompanied with development of acceptable fo modules most flat sheet fo membranes are assembled into the modified spiral wound module by introduction of an internal baffle which results in a u shape flow path that allows flow uneven distribution this study assesses the flow uneven distribution and its impact on a u shape flow path and compares it with a straight flow path i shape like the one in the plate and frame module the flow distribution was visualized through the salt tracing test dye tracing computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation and particle image velocimetry piv the performance of a bench scale module of i shape and u shape was then assessed results from all visualization methods demonstrate large spatial flow variations in the u shape flow path however it does not really affect the overall flux the u shape flow path benefits over the ishape when operated at equal volumetric velocities the i shape path only shows higher fluxes by 21 and 3 when operated under equal cross flow velocities under active layer facing feed solution and active layer facing draw solution modes respectively the low fluxes in the u shape flow path occur in the dead zones the flux variations in the u shape flow path does not significantly affect the short term membrane fouling but is expected to be more intense in the larger modules a simple approach to combat flow uneven distribution via inclusion of internal baffle can reduce uneven distribution of flow keywords forward osmosis plate and frame modified spiral wound concentration polarization flow uneven distribution membrane fouling 1 introduction in forward osmosis fo water transport is driven by osmotic pressure difference between a concentrated draw solution and a diluted feed solution and salt is transported diffusively to the opposite direction the fo process results in concentration of the feed stream and dilution of the draw stream fo has emerges as a promising alternative for various applications because of its several key advantages it has a low and more reversible membrane fouling 1 4 it does not require hydraulic pressure except for pumping to offer a lower energy consumption 5 and is suitable for concentrating emerging contaminants in wastewater 6 7 most works on fo focus on membrane developments draw solution screenings and most recently membrane fouling 5 8 9 one of the critical factors in fo membrane development is to lower membrane s structural parameter these efforts have resulted in the development of highly performing commercial fo membranes such as oasys aquaporin porifera etc such high performing membranes must be assembled into a membrane module i e modified spiral wound hollow fiber or plate and frame to be functional in performing filtration the main objective on fo module design is to maintain the performance very close to the one obtained in the lab scale which is quite challenging and can become the limiting factor 10 13 studies demonstrate that fo flux is significantly lowered when tested batch wise in large area 14 15 this phenomenon is a result of combined effect of feed solution concentration draw solution dilution and accumulation of reverse diffused draw solutes in the feed solution 16 the effects of those phenomena are enhanced by the inherent problems of spatial variation in osmotic pressure flow velocity and concentration over a large membrane area 17 those issues are essential since a sustainable flux depends on both intrinsic membrane properties and fluid hydrodynamic within the membrane module 13 module development mainly addresses those problems and is a step forward toward a full scale fo implementation and is also thought to be critical in restricting the fo applications 17 common modified spiral wound module for fo includes a baffle inside the leave normally in the draw solution side that facilitates two flow streams instead of a typically one stream in the spiral wound module for reverse osmosis the internal baffle also acts as flow distributor the inclusion of the internal baffle however potentially promotes flow uneven distribution and spatial flux variations higher fluxes on the area with high cross flow velocities and vice versa high cross flow velocities help to disturb boundary layer often referred to external concentration polarization and thus promotes higher mass transfer coefficient on the other hand too low cross flow velocities promote severe external concentration polarization that lowers the mass transport coefficient under this condition the advantage of superior fo membrane can be overshadowed by the operational limitations we hypothesise that the flow uneven distribution contributes greatly in lowering module performance especially in long term operation when membrane fouling issue comes to the fore membrane fouling issue leads to more complex operation due to the need of membrane cleaning and the use of chemical for intensive cleaning in this study we performed fo tests using two filtration cells with different flow paths straight denoted as i shape and u shape the former represents a flow in a module with a good distribution such as in the plate and frame while the latter represents the flow path in the baffle side of the modified spiral wound module the flow distribution was visualized using computerized fluid dynamics cfds to help understand in greater detail of the flow the impact of flow uneven distribution on spatial flux variation and membrane fouling was then assessed later we propose several internal baffle configurations that can facilitate homogeneous flow distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation three different set ups were used in this study the first one was used to characterize the fo membrane in term of the pure water permeability coefficient a l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the solute permeability coefficient b l m 2 h 1 and s mm the lab scale fo set ups had the filtration chamber dimensions of 8 7 cm length 4 2 cm width and 0 25 cm depth corresponding to an effective membrane area of 36 54 cm2 the cell was operated counter currently two peristaltic pumps longer pump yz1515x china were used to drive the flow of feed and draw solutions in closed loops at a constant cross flow velocity of 4 6 cm s 1 the set up was placed in a room with a constant temperature of 24 0 5 c the water flux jw was determined by monitoring the rate of change in weight of the feed solution measured using a digital weighing balance kern 572 germany at 1 min interval solute concentration in the feed was measured at 1 min intervals with a conductivity meter orion star a212 thermo scientific usa the salt flux js was determined by applying mass balance of the water and the solute the feed concentration and the jw data were logged once the jw had stabilized nacl was chosen as the draw solute because i it is highly rejected by the fo membranes ii it is capable of generating high osmotic pressure iii it largely obeys the van t hoff equation and v its concentration can be quantified from conductivity data for calculating js 18 19 two larger set ups were used to perform experiments to assess the impact of flow uneven distribution on fo module performance fig 1 for the cell with the i shape flow pattern the width depth and length of flow chamber were 30 cm 0 17 cm and 30 cm respectively the flow channel was equipped with a flow equalizer connected into four inlets and four outlets lines for the cell with the u shape flow path the width depth and length of the flow channel were 15 cm 0 17 cm and 60 cm equivalent length respectively notice that the u shape flow path had a half the width of the straight flow path but had quadruple in length to has a similar total area the cell with the u shape flow path only existed on one side which is assigned for draw solution in this study while the other feed side was identical to the i shape flow path the detailed dimensions of the u shape flow channel can be seen in fig 1 for both filtration cells gear pumps longer pump were used to drive the flow of the feed and the draw solutions in a closed loop at various cross flow velocities in addition to performing fo tests both set ups were also used in detail for flow uneven distribution study 2 2 fo membranes the asymmetric cellulose triacetate membranes from hydration technology innovations hti albany or usa was used for all experiments to avoid variations among different membrane sheets similar membrane sheet was employed for all fo tests one sheet of membrane sample was used to investigate the hydraulic performance using di as feed solution and another sheet for the fouling tests the membrane coupons were stored wet in a cold room of 4 c when not in use 2 3 fo experiment 2 3 1 determination of a b and s the multiple filtration method was applied to characterize the fo membrane parameters 20 the experimental data of jw and js from a lab scale tests were obtained using variable solute concentrations used as the draw solutions 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 m and by using demineralised di water as the feed the fo tests were conducted under active layer facing feed solution alfs also known as fo mode and active layer facing draw solution alds also known as pro mode each filtration was run for 30 min after reaching the steady flow and stable flux to minimize the dilution and concentration effects associated with a batch test each test was performed using pristine membranes totalling of 10 coupons the flux data were obtained as the average values over the testing duration the algorithm used for calculating a b and s is similar to the one used elsewhere 19 from the mass transport models jw and js can be obtained numerically by solving the mass transfer equation 21 the estimated values of jw and js estimates were fitted to the experimental data by least squares non linear fitting using a b and s as regression parameters with the objective function of minimizing global error between estimates and experimental data 2 3 2 experiment using i and u shape flow channels the fo tests were performed in both alfs and alds modes using the i and u shape cells the solute in the draw solute was nacl dissolved in di water at concentrations of 0 5 1 and 2 m the feed solution cross flow velocities were set to 1 95 3 91 and 5 86 cm s 1 notice the difference in cross flow velocities to accommodate the shape of the flow paths both the feed and the draw solution were set at 5 l and each filtration was run for maximum 30 min each test was performed using similar membrane coupon to avoid the impact of membrane sample variations in between fo tests membrane was flushed for 30 min with tap water followed by di water 5 min at 5 86 cm s 1 to clean the membrane the fouling experiments were performed for both cells using 2 m nacl as the draw solution and tap water as the feed for background and 2 g l 1 of bovine serum albumin bsa solution in di water as the feed the filtrations were run batch wise until about 75 of the feed permeating into the draw solution 2 4 flow visualization 2 4 1 computational fluid dynamics the cfd simulations were performed to visualize the flow and to extract near wall cross flow velocity for manual transport calculation no mass transport through membrane was involved in the cfd the simulation was set for incompressible fluid and at steady state flow and by applying the governing equations of continuity and motions eqs 1 4 22 a pure substance of liquid water was specified as the fluid the species mass transport and the gravity effects were ignored the fluid is assumed to be isothermal and at constant density 1 u 0 2 ρ v u p x μ 2 u 3 ρ v v p y μ 2 v 4 ρ v w p z μ 2 w given that the permeation velocities of water and solute across the membrane are a few orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk cross flow velocity mass transfer across the membrane has a minimal effect on the main flow condition and wall shear 23 to further simplify the simulation a non slip wall condition was used as the membrane boundary condition in the i and u shape cells the filtration cells illustrated in fig 1 were simulated using cfd dimensions of the cell model were set accordingly the test cells were divided in x y z 3d meshes using the finite element method for most of the simulations the domain was divided by approximately 1 170 000 cells all presented results are independent of grid size i e the simulation results do not change with the increase of grid resolution the simple algorithm was used as the numerical solution method of governing equations 24 all the simulations were implemented in a commercial code fluent inc for the cfd visualization the cross flow velocities were set at 5 cm s and 10 cm s for the i shape and u shape flow paths respectively 2 4 2 dye tracing and particle image velocimetry piv test the red dye concentrate cole palmer at stock solution concentration of 1 mg l 1 was used to visualize the flow in both the i and the u shape flow paths about 2 ml dye solution was injected in the inlet tubing just before the liquid enter the filtration cell the observations were done visually and was recorded using a video camera the tests were performed at cross flow velocities of 5 cm s and 10 cm s for the i shape and u shape flow paths respectively 2 4 3 salts tracing salt tracing was used as quantitative approach applied to detect the flow uneven distribution a 2 m of nacl solution was pulsed at a point nearby the module entrance the conductivity of the exiting fluid was measured at interval of 5 s the profile of conductivity was then captured and used to analyse the flow distribution and the flow types the histogram of the conductivity data was fit to the analytical formula proposed elsewhere 25 to define average cross flow velocity and dispersion coefficient d the details of flow specifications for these tests are depicted in table 1 2 5 estimation of fluxes variation because of complex nature of mass transport in a fo module several assumptions were adopted for simplification in estimating the spatial flux variation 1 the flow is assumed homogeneous across the channel height because of the channel height is very small compare to the channel width and 2 module area was divided into segments each segment was calculated individually often consecutively to account for local conditions i e the outlet of one segment become the inlet of other segment and so on this segmentation allowed for assigning different conditions for each segment as results of transport form to the others for instance there were variations in cross flow velocity and solute concentration as a function of location because of jw s that dilutes the draw solution and concentrates the feed solution the cross flow velocities on every areal segment near the membrane surface was obtained from the cfd simulation results 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow visualization and analyses the u shape flow pattern promotes severe flow uneven distribution as shown from dye tracing tests and cfd simulations fig 2 as well as from residence time distribution analysis fig 3 in contrary relatively well distributed flow is shown in the i shape flow path the results were consistent from four independent analyses cfd dye tracing salt tracing analysis and the vip supplementary information they show a relatively homogeneous flow in the i shape flow path and poorly distributed in the u shape in the u shape flow path preferences of the flow are located along the path of the shortest distance from the inlet and the outlet of the cell corresponding to the smallest resistance pressure drop for the u shape the intensity of dye was much higher nearby the baffle upon entering the cell and after crossing the baffle the flow had straight direction into the flow distributor near the exit line this flow path left large cell area of low cross flow velocity around the corners despite having the flow distributor near the cell entrance the traces of flows through the four inlets in the i shape cell are still visible fig 2 the cfd visualization was generated from spacer free flow channel while the dye tracing and piv visualizations were performed in the spacer filled flow channel incorporating spacer into cfd simulation was not possible because of the large number meshing required to incorporate the details of spacer s geometry exclusion of spacer in cdf is justified by the agreement of cfd data with the results of the visualizations that incorporated the spacer it is worth mentioning that the spacer has proven to largely affect the flow which often is beneficial for increasing mass transfer coefficient the typical conductivity profiles to gauge the residence time distribution during salt tracing response tests are shown in fig 3 only profiles of two velocities are shown and the full extent of the test results are summarized in table 1 since the salt solution was spiked in the inlet streams an ideal homogeneous flow would result in similar spike pattern however the f left skewed bell curve shapes pointed out on the flow uneven distribution and poor mixing inside the flow channel the longer the tail indicates the poorer flow more uneven distribution of the flow the extent of flow uneven distribution is more profound at lower velocity due to lower mixing the long tail of the curve represents dead zones salt tracing analysis results show the laminar flow regime over the entire tested cross flow velocities table 1 the inclusion of spacer in the flow channel reduces the residence time because of space occupied by it leading to smaller free volume for liquid to flow spacer also promotes mixing by lowering dispersion coefficient d by about half of the one without spacer this role of spacer makes it a promising parameter for further optimization to enhance mass transport coefficient by helping to break the concentration polarization 26 27 3 2 impact of flow path on fluxes 3 2 1 equal volumetric velocity the comparison between the jw s obtained in i and u shape flow paths is shown in fig 4 a in general the jw s of the u shape are slightly larger about 4 7 from 18 pairs of tests than the i shape as shown in the linear linear plot in which most data points are located above the y x line to fairly account the impact of flow uneven distribution it is important to discuss the practical implication of introducing a baffle on the cross flow velocity as shown in fig 1 the width of flow channel in a flow cell for the u shape flow path 15 cm is a half of the i shape flow path 30 cm but its path length is double the flow path in the i shape is identical for both cells straight from end to end therefore if both systems are run under similar volumetric velocity the average cross flow velocity of the u shape path is twice of the i shape the coverage of dead zones in the u shape flow path maybe higher than in the ishape but they are compensated by other area having much higher cross flow velocities to lever the number because of this flow leveraging one can expect a much larger flux span in the u shape flow channel we limit our scope on impact of flow uneven distribution exclusively on spatial flux variation its implications on pressure drop and concentration polarization are also important as discussed elsewhere 9 28 and will be address as follow up of this study 3 2 2 equal cross flow velocity to envisage the effect of flow uneven distribution a series of tests were run to compare the hydraulic performance of the u and i shape flow paths under equal cross flow velocities 1 95 3 91 and 5 86 cm s 1 as shown in fig 5 substantial advantage in jw average of 12 higher is shown by the i shape flow path under this condition flow leveraging in the u shape flow path for compensating the dead zone is not enough to leverage the flux as shown from dye tracing analysis fig 2 large fractions of the flow channel had very low cross flow velocities ascribed by poor access coverage of dye particularly around the edges and the corners ones can therefore expect a very poor flux under this area due to dominant effect of external concentration polarization in dictating the mass transport the impact of flow uneven distribution in the u shape flow path is more profound for the alfs mode than the alds modes in the alfs mode the i shape flow path has 21 higher jw and in the alds mode the i shape flow path has only 3 higher in jw in the alfs mode the draw solution stream flows in the baffle side and in contact with the substrate side of the fo membrane external concentration polarization is typically more severe under this mode despite showing a better fouling resistance 9 this finding is important since fo operation require intricate optimization of feed to draw pressure drop cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure between the draw and the feed sides 29 this limitation implies that high cross flow velocity cannot be applied in the draw side to minimize pressure drop that may worsen the effect of flow uneven distribution in lowering the overall flux substantial efforts should thus be required to reduce the extent of flow uneven distribution in a flow channel with the u shape flow path 3 2 3 justification of flux variations to account for the impact of flow uneven distribution on the flux we run simplified simulations for estimating fluxes the 30 30 cm2 of effective membrane surface area of the cell was split into 100 smaller segments of 0 3 0 3 cm the flux of each cell was calculated using cross flow velocity data near the wall obtained from the cfd flow simulation in fig 2 under corresponding flow conditions to exclusively demonstrate the effect of flow uneven distribution the effects of the draw dilution and the feed concentration were ignored this assumption indeed leads into overestimation of fluxes to perform the estimation the intrinsic characteristics of the hti membranes were first characterized we performed our own characterization because of large discrepancy of data on the reported hti membrane parameters in literature 19 21 30 fig 6 shows the good fit of experimental data with estimates from the mass transport models indicates good accuracy of the characterization resulting in a b and s value of 0 52 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 0 55 g m 2 h 1 and 0 30 mm respectively fig 7 demonstrates that the flow uneven distribution leads to spatial flux variations for the i shape flow path low fluxes were obtained in the cells next to the inlet and outlet nearby the flow distributors while practically similar fluxes were shown in the rest of the area for the u shape flow path large variations of fluxes is observed low fluxes occur in the areas around far end corners and behind the baffle and inlet and outlet within the flow distributor near those are the locations where the cross flow velocities are low fig 2 it is worth mentioning that the average fluxes of the u shape are higher than the i shape because both cells were run under similar feed and draw volumetric velocities see fig 5 the impact of the flow uneven distribution can be seen from the distinctive ranges of flux variations in the u shape flow path fig 7 for the alfs mode the average fluxes and their ranges are 13 81 l m 2 h 1 and 0 56 and 14 17 and 17 91 for i and u shape flow paths respectively whereas for alds the average fluxes and their ranges are 21 59 l m 2 h 1 and 1 02 and 24 15 l m 2 h 1 37 47 for the i shape and the u shape flow paths respectively those values correspond to higher jw s for the u shape flow path than the i shape flow path of 2 6 and 11 9 for alfs and alds modes respectively as discussed earlier leveraging of the cross flow velocity between the dead zones and the high velocity zones facilitates high average flux in the u shape flow path however spatial distribution of mass transport loading over membrane area may worsen the membrane fouling propensity since flux generally dictates fouling rates 31 32 3 3 effect of flow uneven distribution on membrane fouling rate to assess the impact of flow uneven distribution on fo membrane fouling propensity several background and fouling filtration tests were run the background filtrations were fed using tap water and the fouling filtrations were fed using 2 g l 1 bsa solution fig 8 shows a small advantage in jw for the u shape flow path in the early stage of fouling filtration the flux rapidly diminishes suggesting detrimental effect of spatial flux variations such effect will likely be more profound in a larger module size in which flux uneven distribution is more profound 32 the effect fouling in diminishing fo filtration performance is only obvious in the alds mode but only minimal in the alfs mode because of the lower fouling propensity of the alfs the rate of fouling in this batch filtration is demonstrated by the difference of fluxes between the tests using background feed and the ones with the fouling feed the decline trend of fluxes as a function of time or in our case water recovery is mostly due to dilution of the draw solution and concentration of the feed solution an inherent nature of batch process in all alfs tests the fluxes data are overlapping each others indicating almost no fouling occurred during the test the low impact of the flow paths on membrane fouling maybe due to the small membrane area tested in this study 30 30 cm the cell dimension is still indeed far smaller than a full scale sheet of spiral wound envelope however as proven in our results in section 3 2 2 the negative impact of uneven flow distribution is obvious shown by a much lower jw for u shape flow path of merely 79 of the i shape flow path when operating under alfs mode fig 5a which then justifies the dimension of cells used in this study the impact is expected to escalate when a much larger membrane area is used like the standardized fo modules of 4040 or 4080 on the other hand appreciable degree of membrane fouling was shown in the alds mode for both u and i shape flow paths u shape flow path shows a rapid decline in flux in the initial stage but reaches about similar value with the i shape after about 25 of water recovery beyond that no significant difference is observed small difference in fouling propensity is also expected since the feed side is on the i shape flow path irrespective of operational modes and modules the differences on the flow path are only for the draw solution side as is the case for real fo set ups rapid decrease of jw in the initial filtration test diminishes the advantage of higher cross flow velocity of the u shape flow path as shown in section 3 2 this means that the flow uneven distribution causes detrimental effect to membrane fouling propensity in the alds mode it is worth noting here that there are two competing effects higher jw means more severe fouling but higher cross flow velocity means less fouling due to greater shear force that limit the extent of fouling 9 13 under this case the fouling effect is more profound therefore when opting for a module design with u shape flow path such as in the modified spiral wound the flow uneven distribution problem must be addressed properly it is worth noting that the importance of flow uneven distribution is only remarkable in the alds mode 3 4 practical implementation on fo module development membrane fouling problem due to flow uneven distribution will escalate at larger membrane area full scale module membrane fouling is more profound over the filtration time when treating a fouling prone feed over the dead zones since most flat sheet fo membranes are assembled into modified spiral wound detrimental impact of flow uneven distribution should be anticipated a simplified approach to reduce flow uneven distribution can be done by inclusion of internal baffle s of different types within the flow channel without altering the module geometry fig 9 visualizes the flow patterns in a flow channel incorporated with 10 shapes of internal baffles the positive impact of internal baffles is judged by its capability to minimize dead zone defined as count of area with count of less than 5 cm s 1 a threshold arbitrarily chosen below an average value of 6 7 cm s 1 among the ten internal baffles 5 are treated as the reference without internal baffle baffles shapes of 1 2 8 9 and 10 show significant reduction of dead zones all of them are involving multiple flow distributors in form of flow barriers the most effective baffle is a simple y shape 10 that can easily be integrated into a spiral wound flow channel the area occupied by an internal baffle must be minimized to maintain the effective membrane area apart from that a detailed study on the pressure drop must also be conducted because a baffle also resists the liquid flow in addition to modifying internal baffle many attempts in literature have shown that developing smart spacer can be the future direction of modified spiral wound module developments especially with emergence of 3d printing technology with help of advanced cfds 33 4 conclusions the presence of baffle in modified spiral wound module type leads to a u shape flow path and promotes uneven spatial flow distribution as demonstrated by cfd dye tracing piv and salt tracing residence time distribution analysis however results show that the flow uneven distribution only slightly affect the jw when operated under equal cross flow velocity baffle introduction in the u shape flow path leads to slightly higher jw than the i shape path when operated under equal cross flow velocities the extents of the jw variations between the u shape and i shape flow paths are quite alarming 17 91 vs 0 56 for the alfs mode and 37 47 vs 1 02 for the alds mode however the shapes of flow path only have minor effect on the hydraulic performance as well as membrane fouling high fouling propensity from high flux in the zones with high cross flow velocity is compensated by better cleaning effect due to the flow itself nonetheless a simple y shape internal baffle is proposed to combat flow uneven distribution declaration of competing interest all authors have no conflict of interests to

restricting the fo applications 17 common modified spiral wound module for fo includes a baffle inside the leave normally in the draw solution side that facilitates two flow streams instead of a typically one stream in the spiral wound module for reverse osmosis the internal baffle also acts as flow distributor the inclusion of the internal baffle however potentially promotes flow uneven distribution and spatial flux variations higher fluxes on the area with high cross flow velocities and vice versa high cross flow velocities help to disturb boundary layer often referred to external concentration polarization and thus promotes higher mass transfer coefficient on the other hand too low cross flow velocities promote severe external concentration polarization that lowers the mass transport coefficient under this condition the advantage of superior fo membrane can be overshadowed by the operational limitations we hypothesise that the flow uneven distribution contributes greatly in lowering module performance especially in long term operation when membrane fouling issue comes to the fore membrane fouling issue leads to more complex operation due to the need of membrane cleaning and the use of chemical for intensive cleaning in this study we performed fo tests using two filtration cells with different flow paths straight denoted as i shape and u shape the former represents a flow in a module with a good distribution such as in the plate and frame while the latter represents the flow path in the baffle side of the modified spiral wound module the flow distribution was visualized using computerized fluid dynamics cfds to help understand in greater detail of the flow the impact of flow uneven distribution on spatial flux variation and membrane fouling was then assessed later we propose several internal baffle configurations that can facilitate homogeneous flow distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation three different set ups were used in this study the first one was used to characterize the fo membrane in term of the pure water permeability coefficient a l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the solute permeability coefficient b l m 2 h 1 and s mm the lab scale fo set ups had the filtration chamber dimensions of 8 7 cm length 4 2 cm width and 0 25 cm depth corresponding to an effective membrane area of 36 54 cm2 the cell was operated counter currently two peristaltic pumps longer pump yz1515x china were used to drive the flow of feed and draw solutions in closed loops at a constant cross flow velocity of 4 6 cm s 1 the set up was placed in a room with a constant temperature of 24 0 5 c the water flux jw was determined by monitoring the rate of change in weight of the feed solution measured using a digital weighing balance kern 572 germany at 1 min interval solute concentration in the feed was measured at 1 min intervals with a conductivity meter orion star a212 thermo scientific usa the salt flux js was determined by applying mass balance of the water and the solute the feed concentration and the jw data were logged once the jw had stabilized nacl was chosen as the draw solute because i it is highly rejected by the fo membranes ii it is capable of generating high osmotic pressure iii it largely obeys the van t hoff equation and v its concentration can be quantified from conductivity data for calculating js 18 19 two larger set ups were used to perform experiments to assess the impact of flow uneven distribution on fo module performance fig 1 for the cell with the i shape flow pattern the width depth and length of flow chamber were 30 cm 0 17 cm and 30 cm respectively the flow channel was equipped with a flow equalizer connected into four inlets and four outlets lines for the cell with the u shape flow path the width depth and length of the flow channel were 15 cm 0 17 cm and 60 cm equivalent length respectively notice that the u shape flow path had a half the width of the straight flow path but had quadruple in length to has a similar total area the cell with the u shape flow path only existed on one side which is assigned for draw solution in this study while the other feed side was identical to the i shape flow path the detailed dimensions of the u shape flow channel can be seen in fig 1 for both filtration cells gear pumps longer pump were used to drive the flow of the feed and the draw solutions in a closed loop at various cross flow velocities in addition to performing fo tests both set ups were also used in detail for flow uneven distribution study 2 2 fo membranes the asymmetric cellulose triacetate membranes from hydration technology innovations hti albany or usa was used for all experiments to avoid variations among different membrane sheets similar membrane sheet was employed for all fo tests one sheet of membrane sample was used to investigate the hydraulic performance using di as feed solution and another sheet for the fouling tests the membrane coupons were stored wet in a cold room of 4 c when not in use 2 3 fo experiment 2 3 1 determination of a b and s the multiple filtration method was applied to characterize the fo membrane parameters 20 the experimental data of jw and js from a lab scale tests were obtained using variable solute concentrations used as the draw solutions 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 m and by using demineralised di water as the feed the fo tests were conducted under active layer facing feed solution alfs also known as fo mode and active layer facing draw solution alds also known as pro mode each filtration was run for 30 min after reaching the steady flow and stable flux to minimize the dilution and concentration effects associated with a batch test each test was performed using pristine membranes totalling of 10 coupons the flux data were obtained as the average values over the testing duration the algorithm used for calculating a b and s is similar to the one used elsewhere 19 from the mass transport models jw and js can be obtained numerically by solving the mass transfer equation 21 the estimated values of jw and js estimates were fitted to the experimental data by least squares non linear fitting using a b and s as regression parameters with the objective function of minimizing global error between estimates and experimental data 2 3 2 experiment using i and u shape flow channels the fo tests were performed in both alfs and alds modes using the i and u shape cells the solute in the draw solute was nacl dissolved in di water at concentrations of 0 5 1 and 2 m the feed solution cross flow velocities were set to 1 95 3 91 and 5 86 cm s 1 notice the difference in cross flow velocities to accommodate the shape of the flow paths both the feed and the draw solution were set at 5 l and each filtration was run for maximum 30 min each test was performed using similar membrane coupon to avoid the impact of membrane sample variations in between fo tests membrane was flushed for 30 min with tap water followed by di water 5 min at 5 86 cm s 1 to clean the membrane the fouling experiments were performed for both cells using 2 m nacl as the draw solution and tap water as the feed for background and 2 g l 1 of bovine serum albumin bsa solution in di water as the feed the filtrations were run batch wise until about 75 of the feed permeating into the draw solution 2 4 flow visualization 2 4 1 computational fluid dynamics the cfd simulations were performed to visualize the flow and to extract near wall cross flow velocity for manual transport calculation no mass transport through membrane was involved in the cfd the simulation was set for incompressible fluid and at steady state flow and by applying the governing equations of continuity and motions eqs 1 4 22 a pure substance of liquid water was specified as the fluid the species mass transport and the gravity effects were ignored the fluid is assumed to be isothermal and at constant density 1 u 0 2 ρ v u p x μ 2 u 3 ρ v v p y μ 2 v 4 ρ v w p z μ 2 w given that the permeation velocities of water and solute across the membrane are a few orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk cross flow velocity mass transfer across the membrane has a minimal effect on the main flow condition and wall shear 23 to further simplify the simulation a non slip wall condition was used as the membrane boundary condition in the i and u shape cells the filtration cells illustrated in fig 1 were simulated using cfd dimensions of the cell model were set accordingly the test cells were divided in x y z 3d meshes using the finite element method for most of the simulations the domain was divided by approximately 1 170 000 cells all presented results are independent of grid size i e the simulation results do not change with the increase of grid resolution the simple algorithm was used as the numerical solution method of governing equations 24 all the simulations were implemented in a commercial code fluent inc for the cfd visualization the cross flow velocities were set at 5 cm s and 10 cm s for the i shape and u shape flow paths respectively 2 4 2 dye tracing and particle image velocimetry piv test the red dye concentrate cole palmer at stock solution concentration of 1 mg l 1 was used to visualize the flow in both the i and the u shape flow paths about 2 ml dye solution was injected in the inlet tubing just before the liquid enter the filtration cell the observations were done visually and was recorded using a video camera the tests were performed at cross flow velocities of 5 cm s and 10 cm s for the i shape and u shape flow paths respectively 2 4 3 salts tracing salt tracing was used as quantitative approach applied to detect the flow uneven distribution a 2 m of nacl solution was pulsed at a point nearby the module entrance the conductivity of the exiting fluid was measured at interval of 5 s the profile of conductivity was then captured and used to analyse the flow distribution and the flow types the histogram of the conductivity data was fit to the analytical formula proposed elsewhere 25 to define average cross flow velocity and dispersion coefficient d the details of flow specifications for these tests are depicted in table 1 2 5 estimation of fluxes variation because of complex nature of mass transport in a fo module several assumptions were adopted for simplification in estimating the spatial flux variation 1 the flow is assumed homogeneous across the channel height because of the channel height is very small compare to the channel width and 2 module area was divided into segments each segment was calculated individually often consecutively to account for local conditions i e the outlet of one segment become the inlet of other segment and so on this segmentation allowed for assigning different conditions for each segment as results of transport form to the others for instance there were variations in cross flow velocity and solute concentration as a function of location because of jw s that dilutes the draw solution and concentrates the feed solution the cross flow velocities on every areal segment near the membrane surface was obtained from the cfd simulation results 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow visualization and analyses the u shape flow pattern promotes severe flow uneven distribution as shown from dye tracing tests and cfd simulations fig 2 as well as from residence time distribution analysis fig 3 in contrary relatively well distributed flow is shown in the i shape flow path the results were consistent from four independent analyses cfd dye tracing salt tracing analysis and the vip supplementary information they show a relatively homogeneous flow in the i shape flow path and poorly distributed in the u shape in the u shape flow path preferences of the flow are located along the path of the shortest distance from the inlet and the outlet of the cell corresponding to the smallest resistance pressure drop for the u shape the intensity of dye was much higher nearby the baffle upon entering the cell and after crossing the baffle the flow had straight direction into the flow distributor near the exit line this flow path left large cell area of low cross flow velocity around the corners despite having the flow distributor near the cell entrance the traces of flows through the four inlets in the i shape cell are still visible fig 2 the cfd visualization was generated from spacer free flow channel while the dye tracing and piv visualizations were performed in the spacer filled flow channel incorporating spacer into cfd simulation was not possible because of the large number meshing required to incorporate the details of spacer s geometry exclusion of spacer in cdf is justified by the agreement of cfd data with the results of the visualizations that incorporated the spacer it is worth mentioning that the spacer has proven to largely affect the flow which often is beneficial for increasing mass transfer coefficient the typical conductivity profiles to gauge the residence time distribution during salt tracing response tests are shown in fig 3 only profiles of two velocities are shown and the full extent of the test results are summarized in table 1 since the salt solution was spiked in the inlet streams an ideal homogeneous flow would result in similar spike pattern however the f left skewed bell curve shapes pointed out on the flow uneven distribution and poor mixing inside the flow channel the longer the tail indicates the poorer flow more uneven distribution of the flow the extent of flow uneven distribution is more profound at lower velocity due to lower mixing the long tail of the curve represents dead zones salt tracing analysis results show the laminar flow regime over the entire tested cross flow velocities table 1 the inclusion of spacer in the flow channel reduces the residence time because of space occupied by it leading to smaller free volume for liquid to flow spacer also promotes mixing by lowering dispersion coefficient d by about half of the one without spacer this role of spacer makes it a promising parameter for further optimization to enhance mass transport coefficient by helping to break the concentration polarization 26 27 3 2 impact of flow path on fluxes 3 2 1 equal volumetric velocity the comparison between the jw s obtained in i and u shape flow paths is shown in fig 4 a in general the jw s of the u shape are slightly larger about 4 7 from 18 pairs of tests than the i shape as shown in the linear linear plot in which most data points are located above the y x line to fairly account the impact of flow uneven distribution it is important to discuss the practical implication of introducing a baffle on the cross flow velocity as shown in fig 1 the width of flow channel in a flow cell for the u shape flow path 15 cm is a half of the i shape flow path 30 cm but its path length is double the flow path in the i shape is identical for both cells straight from end to end therefore if both systems are run under similar volumetric velocity the average cross flow velocity of the u shape path is twice of the i shape the coverage of dead zones in the u shape flow path maybe higher than in the ishape but they are compensated by other area having much higher cross flow velocities to lever the number because of this flow leveraging one can expect a much larger flux span in the u shape flow channel we limit our scope on impact of flow uneven distribution exclusively on spatial flux variation its implications on pressure drop and concentration polarization are also important as discussed elsewhere 9 28 and will be address as follow up of this study 3 2 2 equal cross flow velocity to envisage the effect of flow uneven distribution a series of tests were run to compare the hydraulic performance of the u and i shape flow paths under equal cross flow velocities 1 95 3 91 and 5 86 cm s 1 as shown in fig 5 substantial advantage in jw average of 12 higher is shown by the i shape flow path under this condition flow leveraging in the u shape flow path for compensating the dead zone is not enough to leverage the flux as shown from dye tracing analysis fig 2 large fractions of the flow channel had very low cross flow velocities ascribed by poor access coverage of dye particularly around the edges and the corners ones can therefore expect a very poor flux under this area due to dominant effect of external concentration polarization in dictating the mass transport the impact of flow uneven distribution in the u shape flow path is more profound for the alfs mode than the alds modes in the alfs mode the i shape flow path has 21 higher jw and in the alds mode the i shape flow path has only 3 higher in jw in the alfs mode the draw solution stream flows in the baffle side and in contact with the substrate side of the fo membrane external concentration polarization is typically more severe under this mode despite showing a better fouling resistance 9 this finding is important since fo operation require intricate optimization of feed to draw pressure drop cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure between the draw and the feed sides 29 this limitation implies that high cross flow velocity cannot be applied in the draw side to minimize pressure drop that may worsen the effect of flow uneven distribution in lowering the overall flux substantial efforts should thus be required to reduce the extent of flow uneven distribution in a flow channel with the u shape flow path 3 2 3 justification of flux variations to account for the impact of flow uneven distribution on the flux we run simplified simulations for estimating fluxes the 30 30 cm2 of effective membrane surface area of the cell was split into 100 smaller segments of 0 3 0 3 cm the flux of each cell was calculated using cross flow velocity data near the wall obtained from the cfd flow simulation in fig 2 under corresponding flow conditions to exclusively demonstrate the effect of flow uneven distribution the effects of the draw dilution and the feed concentration were ignored this assumption indeed leads into overestimation of fluxes to perform the estimation the intrinsic characteristics of the hti membranes were first characterized we performed our own characterization because of large discrepancy of data on the reported hti membrane parameters in literature 19 21 30 fig 6 shows the good fit of experimental data with estimates from the mass transport models indicates good accuracy of the characterization resulting in a b and s value of 0 52 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 0 55 g m 2 h 1 and 0 30 mm respectively fig 7 demonstrates that the flow uneven distribution leads to spatial flux variations for the i shape flow path low fluxes were obtained in the cells next to the inlet and outlet nearby the flow distributors while practically similar fluxes were shown in the rest of the area for the u shape flow path large variations of fluxes is observed low fluxes occur in the areas around far end corners and behind the baffle and inlet and outlet within the flow distributor near those are the locations where the cross flow velocities are low fig 2 it is worth mentioning that the average fluxes of the u shape are higher than the i shape because both cells were run under similar feed and draw volumetric velocities see fig 5 the impact of the flow uneven distribution can be seen from the distinctive ranges of flux variations in the u shape flow path fig 7 for the alfs mode the average fluxes and their ranges are 13 81 l m 2 h 1 and 0 56 and 14 17 and 17 91 for i and u shape flow paths respectively whereas for alds the average fluxes and their ranges are 21 59 l m 2 h 1 and 1 02 and 24 15 l m 2 h 1 37 47 for the i shape and the u shape flow paths respectively those values correspond to higher jw s for the u shape flow path than the i shape flow path of 2 6 and 11 9 for alfs and alds modes respectively as discussed earlier leveraging of the cross flow velocity between the dead zones and the high velocity zones facilitates high average flux in the u shape flow path however spatial distribution of mass transport loading over membrane area may worsen the membrane fouling propensity since flux generally dictates fouling rates 31 32 3 3 effect of flow uneven distribution on membrane fouling rate to assess the impact of flow uneven distribution on fo membrane fouling propensity several background and fouling filtration tests were run the background filtrations were fed using tap water and the fouling filtrations were fed using 2 g l 1 bsa solution fig 8 shows a small advantage in jw for the u shape flow path in the early stage of fouling filtration the flux rapidly diminishes suggesting detrimental effect of spatial flux variations such effect will likely be more profound in a larger module size in which flux uneven distribution is more profound 32 the effect fouling in diminishing fo filtration performance is only obvious in the alds mode but only minimal in the alfs mode because of the lower fouling propensity of the alfs the rate of fouling in this batch filtration is demonstrated by the difference of fluxes between the tests using background feed and the ones with the fouling feed the decline trend of fluxes as a function of time or in our case water recovery is mostly due to dilution of the draw solution and concentration of the feed solution an inherent nature of batch process in all alfs tests the fluxes data are overlapping each others indicating almost no fouling occurred during the test the low impact of the flow paths on membrane fouling maybe due to the small membrane area tested in this study 30 30 cm the cell dimension is still indeed far smaller than a full scale sheet of spiral wound envelope however as proven in our results in section 3 2 2 the negative impact of uneven flow distribution is obvious shown by a much lower jw for u shape flow path of merely 79 of the i shape flow path when operating under alfs mode fig 5a which then justifies the dimension of cells used in this study the impact is expected to escalate when a much larger membrane area is used like the standardized fo modules of 4040 or 4080 on the other hand appreciable degree of membrane fouling was shown in the alds mode for both u and i shape flow paths u shape flow path shows a rapid decline in flux in the initial stage but reaches about similar value with the i shape after about 25 of water recovery beyond that no significant difference is observed small difference in fouling propensity is also expected since the feed side is on the i shape flow path irrespective of operational modes and modules the differences on the flow path are only for the draw solution side as is the case for real fo set ups rapid decrease of jw in the initial filtration test diminishes the advantage of higher cross flow velocity of the u shape flow path as shown in section 3 2 this means that the flow uneven distribution causes detrimental effect to membrane fouling propensity in the alds mode it is worth noting here that there are two competing effects higher jw means more severe fouling but higher cross flow velocity means less fouling due to greater shear force that limit the extent of fouling 9 13 under this case the fouling effect is more profound therefore when opting for a module design with u shape flow path such as in the modified spiral wound the flow uneven distribution problem must be addressed properly it is worth noting that the importance of flow uneven distribution is only remarkable in the alds mode 3 4 practical implementation on fo module development membrane fouling problem due to flow uneven distribution will escalate at larger membrane area full scale module membrane fouling is more profound over the filtration time when treating a fouling prone feed over the dead zones since most flat sheet fo membranes are assembled into modified spiral wound detrimental impact of flow uneven distribution should be anticipated a simplified approach to reduce flow uneven distribution can be done by inclusion of internal baffle s of different types within the flow channel without altering the module geometry fig 9 visualizes the flow patterns in a flow channel incorporated with 10 shapes of internal baffles the positive impact of internal baffles is judged by its capability to minimize dead zone defined as count of area with count of less than 5 cm s 1 a threshold arbitrarily chosen below an average value of 6 7 cm s 1 among the ten internal baffles 5 are treated as the reference without internal baffle baffles shapes of 1 2 8 9 and 10 show significant reduction of dead zones all of them are involving multiple flow distributors in form of flow barriers the most effective baffle is a simple y shape 10 that can easily be integrated into a spiral wound flow channel the area occupied by an internal baffle must be minimized to maintain the effective membrane area apart from that a detailed study on the pressure drop must also be conducted because a baffle also resists the liquid flow in addition to modifying internal baffle many attempts in literature have shown that developing smart spacer can be the future direction of modified spiral wound module developments especially with emergence of 3d printing technology with help of advanced cfds 33 4 conclusions the presence of baffle in modified spiral wound module type leads to a u shape flow path and promotes uneven spatial flow distribution as demonstrated by cfd dye tracing piv and salt tracing residence time distribution analysis however results show that the flow uneven distribution only slightly affect the jw when operated under equal cross flow velocity baffle introduction in the u shape flow path leads to slightly higher jw than the i shape path when operated under equal cross flow velocities the extents of the jw variations between the u shape and i shape flow paths are quite alarming 17 91 vs 0 56 for the alfs mode and 37 47 vs 1 02 for the alds mode however the shapes of flow path only have minor effect on the hydraulic performance as well as membrane fouling high fouling propensity from high flux in the zones with high cross flow velocity is compensated by better cleaning effect due to the flow itself nonetheless a simple y shape internal baffle is proposed to combat flow uneven distribution declaration of competing interest all authors have no conflict of interests to

water bodies is the utmost area of research because they not only pollute water but also imbalance the aquatic ecosystem water pollution becomes a global issue and major concern worldwide because it affects our biosphere therefore there is an urgent need to pay attention to the problem of how to remove effectively the hazardous contaminants of water bodies many industries such as textile paper plastics cosmetics rubber food and printing industries use synthetic dyes 1 as coloring material which are very toxic carcinogenic and teratogenic in nature 2 3 these contaminants present in even low

indirect transitions it was found that n1z1 and n3z2 exhibit a flat band at 3 29 ev and 3 58 ev due to presence of nio and 3 14 ev and 3 18 ev due to zno further on increasing the molar ratio of nio in composites it has been observed that the band gap shifts toward lower wavelength which is ensured by absorbance spectra fig 5a tauc plots of nio and zno and nanocomposites n1z4 n2z3 and n4z1 are shown in fig s7 and the results are compiled in table 1 3 4 xps studies the surface profiles of nio zno nanocomposites nio and zno have been investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy survey

bet results indicate nio zno nanocomposites having average pore radius approx 23 45 å the specific surface area m2 g 1 pore volume cc g 1 average pore radius å are also compiled in table 2 3 6 ft ir spectroscopic studies ft ir spectra of nio zno nanocomposites nio and zno are shown in fig s14 the stretching frequencies at 3400 1620 and 1405 cm 1 are attributed to the adsorbed water in the prepared samples inter atomic vibrations of metal oxide generally appear below 1000 cm 1 the intense broad band at 510 530 cm 1 is assigned to both ν zn o and ν ni o vibrational modes as it is overlapped in nio zno nanocomposites a peak at 479 cm 1 and 515 cm 1 corresponds to ν ni o and ν zn o vibrations in nio and zno respectively 52 53 in each spectrum there is slight shift in ir bands due to compositional variation of synthesized nio zno nanocomposites 3 7 adsorption studies of congo red the comparison of congo red cr removal efficiency was performed to know the best adsorption catalyst among the studied nanocomposites adsorption experiments with all nio zno nanocomposites i e n1z4 n2z3 n1z1 n3z2 n4z1 nio and zno for same concentration of cr 60 ppm in aqueous solution have been carried out spectrophotometrically fig 8 all the uv vis absorbance spectra are available in supporting information s15 s17 the removal efficiency for various composites is as follows n3z2 n2z3 n1z1 n4z1 n1z4 nio zno 94 9 88 9 86 5 67 9 57 4 52 3 and 22 8 respectively in duration of 60 min table s4 this study concluded that n3z2 is the best catalyst among all nanocomposites further other detailed adsorption studies i e adsorption kinetics diffusion analysis adsorption isotherm were performed with only n3z2 and nio and zno were used for comparison 3 8 adsorption kinetics to investigate which adsorption mechanism has been followed we tried to simulate the kinetics data of cr onto n3z2 nio and zno by using pseudo first order eq 4 and pseudo second order models eq 5 equations of these models are given below for pseudo first order kinetics 4 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t for pseudo second order kinetics 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g 1 are the adsorption capacities at equilibrium and at any interval t min k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively for pseudo first order model log qe qt is plotted against t values of k1 and qe are calculated from slope and intercept respectively fig 9 a for pseudo second order model t qt is plotted against t values of qe and k2 are calculated from slope and intercept respectively fig 9b higher values of correlation coefficient r2 and calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity values qe cal are more consistent with measured values qe exp for pseudo second order kinetic model than pseudo first order kinetic model table 3 the results indicate that adsorption of cr on n3z2 follows the pseudo second order kinetics kinetic plots of first and second order model with values of qe k1 and k2 for nio and zno are also given in supporting information figs s18 a b and s19 a b tables s5 and s6 n3z2 is capable of removing higher concentration of cr as shown in bar graph fig 9f figs s18 f and s19 f show similar bar graphs for nio and zno respectively fig 10 a shows the change in the amount of cr adsorbed qt onto n3z2 for different concentration of cr 20 to 100 ppm for interval of 60 min further it has been observed that adsorption rates are faster for initial 10 min and then gradually decrease with the time fig s20 a and s20 c depict similar experimental data for nio and zno respectively 3 9 intra particle diffusion analysis the properties of both adsorbate and adsorbent play prime role in adsorption of any organic dye the adsorption process follows three successive steps a the adsorbate diffuses from the bulk solution to the periphery layer of solution surrounding adsorbent particles b adsorbate diffuses into the liquid surface surrounding the adsorbent particles c intra particle diffusion occurs as adsorbent carries pores which increase the surface area and consequently increase the surface diffusion process 54 55 one or more of these processes can be involved for the adsorption and rate is controlled by the slowest one kinetics based model developed by weber and morris explains time dependent intra particle diffusion of adsorbate 54 equation of this model is given below eq 6 6 q t k i n t c where qt mg g 1 adsorption capacity at time t kin mg g 1 min 1 2 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and c mg g 1 is the intercept which gives the idea about the thickness of periphery layer greater the value of c more will be the contribution of the surface adsorption in the rate controlling step fig 10b shows a plot of qt versus t1 2 for different concentrations of cr the whole adsorption process of cr is divided into two linear stages using n3z2 56 from plot qt versus t1 2 kin intra particle diffusion rate constant is calculated from the slope and c from the intercept for both linear stages and the values are given in table 4 the diffusion rates were higher in the first stage and slow in second stage correlating with the values of slope as presented in table 4 for nio and zno intra particle diffusion kinetics parameters are given in tables s8 and s9 respectively fig s20 b 20 d 3 10 adsorption isotherm to evaluate the adsorption capacity of n3z2 nanocomposite for cr adsorption isotherm studies were performed at various equilibrium concentrations fig 9e experiments were done by varying concentrations of cr for the fixed amount 10 mg of adsorbent to investigate adsorption isotherm the most widely utilized models are used langmuir and freundlich isotherm models langmuir model deals with adsorption of homogenous systems langmuir model explains the relationship between amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium and equilibrium solute concentration the equation eq 7 for langmuir model is 7 c e q e c e q m a x 1 q m a x b where qmax mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and b l mg 1 is the langmuir equilibrium constant ce mg l 1 equilibrium cr concentration fig 9d shows langmuir isotherm model for n3z2 with correlation coefficient value i e 0 99 the freundlich isotherm model deals with the adsorption of heterogeneous systems the equation eq 8 for the freundlich model is 8 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where kf l g 1 is freundlich constant defines the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n is the freundlich exponent related to the adsorption intensity log qe is plotted against log ce to calculate the values of kf and n fig 9c shows results of curve fitting giving correlation coefficient value 0 949 of n3z2 whereas the values of kf and n are 72 52 and 3 27 respectively based on the comparison of correlation coefficient values of both the models for cr removal using n3z2 nio and zno langmuir isotherm model can better describe the experimental data than freundlich isotherm model according to langmuir equation adsorption capacity of n3z2 nio and zno are 169 77 72 41 27 37 mg g 1 respectively based on the fitting results of langmuir model n3z2 have much superior adsorption capacity in comparison to nio and zno detailed parameters of freundlich and langmuir isotherm models for n3z2 nio and zno are listed in table s7 it has been observed that n3z2 among all the studied nanocomposites is the most efficient adsorbent for congo red its removal efficiency for 20 40 60 80 100 ppm of congo red are 99 97 9 94 9 86 8 and 82 7 respectively in duration of 60 min see uv vis absorbance spectra in supplementary figs s15 s17 while in literature hierarchical porous zno nio hollow microspheres with molar ratio of 1 1 ni zn showed adsorption of 10 100 ppm cr dye in duration of 12 h 11 hierarchical c nio zno nanocomposite fibers with molar ratio of 2 1 ni zn showed adsorption of 10 100 ppm cr dye in duration of 24 h 57 therefore studied n3z2 is better adsorbent than the previously reported composites for the removal of cr 3 11 adsorption mechanism of cr generally two reasons are considered for the adsorption of dye 1 opposite charge of the adsorbent and dye and 2 high surface area of adsorbent 58 zeta potential analysis has been performed to investigate the surface charge of nio zno nanocomposites nio and zno in aqueous solution ph 7 15 zeta potential values of n1z4 n2z3 n1z1 n3z2 n4z1 nio and zno were 16 8 14 4 15 7 15 3 20 0 3 4 and 6 75 mv respectively from the positive values of zeta potential we infer that electrostatic attractions can be the reason for adsorption of cr onto the nanocomposites as cr is negatively charged dye owing to the presence of so3 group 3 considering other aspect surface area 118 8 m2 g 1 n3z2 exhibits the highest adsorption towards cr among all nanocomposites therefore we conclude that synergistic effect of positive surface charge and high surface area of n3z2 together is responsible for its highest adsorption efficiency towards cr 3 12 catalytic reduction of 4 nitrophenol 4 np by different nio zno nanocomposites the catalytic reduction of 4 np to 4 aminophenol 4 ap was chosen to investigate the catalytic activity of all the prepared nio zno nanocomposites nio and zno absorption band of 4 np appears at 317 nm on addition of freshly prepared nabh4 solution light yellow color of 4 np changes to bright yellow due to formation of 4 nitrophenolate ion and absorption band shifts to 400 nm as the reduction of 4 nitrophenolate starts the intensity of band at 400 nm decreases with the appearance of a new band at 295 nm due to 4 ap further 4 np is not reduced by nabh4 in the absence of catalyst as depicted from uv vis spectra fig s21 n1z4 n2z3 n3z2 n4z1 and zno do not reduce 4 np only n1z1 and nio show the activity for the reduction of 4 np fig 11 a shows n1z1 composite gives complete reduction of 4 np within 9 min whereas nio takes 30 min fig 11 b since an excess amount of nabh4 was used in these experiments hence the reaction is independent of the concentration of sodium borohydride kinetics data fit according to the first order rate equation for n1z1 and nio fig 11c and straight lines are obtained by plotting ln ct c0 versus time and its slope provides value of the rate constant fig 11d the rate constant for nio and n1z1 are 0 17 min 1 and 0 512 min 1 respectively the possible catalytic reduction mechanism of 4 np by using nabh4 over nio zno nanocomposite occurring in 4 steps 59 in the first step bh4 releases hydride ions in aqueous medium that attached to the surface of n1z1 nanocomposite in step 2 hydrogen is covalently bonded to nio or zno in n1z1 surface rate determining step adsorption of nitro groups on the surface of n1z1 step 3 further adsorbed 4 np and bonded hydrogen atoms interact strongly hydride ion attacks the adsorbed nitro groups transfer of electron occurs from donor bh4 to the acceptor 4 np which is followed by desorption of 4 ap in the aqueous medium 3 13 reusability and stability of n3z2 and n1z1 for practical applications of catalyst recyclability is one of the most important factor reusability of n3z2 for removal of cr by adsorption was checked upto 5 cycles and reduction of 4 np for 3 cycles by using n1z1 n3z2 adsorbs 91 of cr in 5th cycle and n1z1 showed 100 reduction for 3 cycles but with variation in reduction time from 9 to 11 min fig 13 c d the stability of the catalysts was confirmed by pxrd fig 12 and fe sem fig 13 a b after the reusability experiments the results indicate that xrd pattern and morphology of the catalyst remain same after the recyclability experiment therefore these stable composites can be effectively used for the removal of hazardous pollutants in water and can provide a solution for purification of water for several cycles 4 conclusion in summary a facile sol gel method followed by calcination has been developed to synthesize nio zno nanocomposites with various molar ratio elemental as well as morphological characterizations have been investigated successfully n3z2 exhibits excellent and much higher adsorption capacity than nio and zno n3z2 has been proven as promising adsorbent for cr due to its surface area and positive zeta potential with adsorption capacity of 169 77 mg g 1 as deduced from langmuir adsorption plot furthermore n1z1 works selectively for reduction of 4 np in the presence of nabh4 with rate constant 0 512 min 1 which is much higher than that of nio moreover n3z2 and n1z1 demonstrate good recyclability and reusability in this way these stable nanocomposites have opened a new room for removing the pollutants from wastewater under ambient conditions and be utilized for several cycles

water bodies is the utmost area of research because they not only pollute water but also imbalance the aquatic ecosystem water pollution becomes a global issue and major concern worldwide because it affects our biosphere therefore there is an urgent need to pay attention to the problem of how to remove effectively the hazardous contaminants of water bodies many industries such as textile paper plastics cosmetics rubber food and printing industries use synthetic dyes 1 as coloring material which are very toxic carcinogenic and teratogenic in nature 2 3 these contaminants present in even low concentration can lead to numerous side effects on human health removal of these dyes is one of the major concerns of today s world cr congo red dye widely used in textile industry is considered to be very toxic and hazardous to many species of aquatic life apart from dyes there is other class of organic pollutants viz phenol derivatives which are soluble in water and also carcinogenic in nature 4 nitrophenol 4 np is listed by us environmental protection agencies as priority pollutant which is effluent discharge of many industries is easily reduced to 4 aminophenol 4 ap 4 5 further the 4 ap reduction product of 4 np is important to many industries because it is an intermediate for many analgesics and antipyretic drugs and used as photographic developer and dyes 6 7 many traditional physical and advanced oxidation methods have been used for removal of effluents from wastewater i e photocatalysis membrane filtration biodegradation chemical treatment ion exchange and incineration but with their limited utilization due to high cost and high energy demand 8 among various technologically developed remedy methods adsorption technology has many advantages due to the ease of its operation economical and high efficiency 9 10 furthermore mixed metal oxide based nanocomposites have gained great attention due to their unique and superior properties such as high specific surface

zno nanocomposites by employing sol gel method using acetic acid and deionized water as solvent which is green solvent and low cost more sustainable as compared to the reported methods as cited above for the first time zinc 2 4 pentanedionate monohydrate has been used as precursor for the synthesis of nio zno nanocomposites scheme 1 to achieve controlled and homogeneous size distribution of

chelate complex compared to other precursors having monodendate ligands such as metal alkoxides or metal halides provides more controlled particle growth during nucleation resulting in homogenous reasonable size distribution of nanoparticles 49 50 further nio zno nanocomposites have been utilized as efficient adsorbents for the removal of organic pollutant such as congo red cr dye and as

the optical properties of the prepared materials have been examined with the help of uv drs spectral studies tauc plots of n1z1 and n3z2 are shown in fig 5 b and c respectively which represent the indirect transitions it was found that n1z1 and n3z2 exhibit a flat band at 3 29 ev and 3 58 ev due to presence of nio and 3 14 ev and 3 18 ev due to zno further on increasing the molar ratio of nio in composites it has been observed that the band gap shifts toward lower wavelength which is ensured by absorbance spectra fig 5a tauc plots of nio and zno and nanocomposites n1z4 n2z3 and n4z1 are shown in fig s7 and the results are compiled in table 1 3 4 xps studies the surface profiles of nio zno nanocomposites nio and zno have been investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy survey

and 1043 7 ev for n3z2 respectively indicating zn2 chemical state of zinc fig 6 c and g the binding energy of zn 2p for nio zno nanocomposites showed shifts compared to corresponding values of pure

tabulated in table s3 3 5 specific surface area analysis bet to determine the specific surface area and average pore radius n2 adsorption desorption isotherms have been investigated as shown in fig 7 see figs s12 and s13 in supporting information for n1z4 n2z3 n4z1 nio and zno n3z2 has surface area 118 6 m2 g 1 which is highest among all nanocomposites with 41 41 å pore radius due to that this composite shows best adsorption results n1z4 has lowest surface area 26 04 m2 g 1 among all nanocomposites with pore radius 23 19 å nio and zno have surface area 200 m2 g 1 and 12 m2 g 1 respectively bet results indicate nio zno nanocomposites having average pore radius approx 23 45 å the specific surface area m2 g 1 pore volume cc g 1 average pore radius å are also compiled in table 2 3 6 ft ir spectroscopic studies ft ir spectra of nio zno nanocomposites nio and zno are shown in fig s14 the stretching frequencies at 3400 1620 and 1405 cm 1 are attributed to the adsorbed water in the prepared samples inter atomic vibrations of metal oxide generally appear below 1000 cm 1 the intense broad band at 510 530 cm 1 is assigned to both ν zn o and ν ni o vibrational modes as it is overlapped in nio zno nanocomposites a peak at 479 cm 1 and 515 cm 1 corresponds to ν ni o and ν zn o vibrations in nio and zno respectively 52 53 in each spectrum there is slight shift in ir bands due to compositional variation of synthesized nio zno nanocomposites 3 7 adsorption studies of congo red the comparison of congo red cr removal efficiency was performed to know the best adsorption catalyst among the studied nanocomposites adsorption experiments with all nio zno nanocomposites i e n1z4 n2z3 n1z1 n3z2 n4z1 nio and zno for same concentration of cr 60 ppm in aqueous solution have been carried out spectrophotometrically fig 8 all the uv vis absorbance spectra are available in supporting information s15 s17 the removal efficiency for various composites is as follows n3z2 n2z3 n1z1 n4z1 n1z4 nio zno 94 9 88 9 86 5 67 9 57 4 52 3 and 22 8 respectively in duration of 60 min table s4 this study concluded that n3z2 is the best catalyst among all nanocomposites further other detailed adsorption studies i e adsorption kinetics diffusion analysis adsorption isotherm were performed with only n3z2 and nio and zno were used for comparison 3 8 adsorption kinetics to investigate which adsorption mechanism has been followed we tried to simulate the kinetics data of cr onto n3z2 nio and zno by using pseudo first order eq 4 and pseudo second order models eq 5 equations of these models are given below for pseudo first order kinetics 4 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t for pseudo second order kinetics 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g 1 are the adsorption capacities at equilibrium and at any interval t min k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively for pseudo first order model log qe qt is plotted against t values of k1 and qe are calculated from slope and intercept respectively fig 9 a for pseudo second order model t qt is plotted against t values of qe and k2 are calculated from slope and intercept respectively fig 9b higher values of correlation coefficient r2 and calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity values qe cal are more consistent with measured values qe exp for pseudo second order kinetic model than pseudo first order kinetic model table 3 the results indicate that adsorption of cr on n3z2 follows the pseudo second order kinetics kinetic plots of first and second order model with values of qe k1 and k2 for nio and zno are also given in supporting information figs s18 a b and s19 a b tables s5 and s6 n3z2 is capable of removing higher concentration of cr as shown in bar graph fig 9f figs s18 f and s19 f show similar bar graphs for nio and zno respectively fig 10 a shows the change in the amount of cr adsorbed qt onto n3z2 for different concentration of cr 20 to 100 ppm for interval of 60 min further it has been observed that adsorption rates are faster for initial 10 min and then gradually decrease with the time fig s20 a and s20 c depict similar experimental data for nio and zno respectively 3 9 intra particle diffusion analysis the properties of both adsorbate and adsorbent play prime role in adsorption of any organic dye the adsorption process follows three successive steps a the adsorbate diffuses from the bulk solution to the periphery layer of solution surrounding adsorbent particles b adsorbate diffuses into the liquid surface surrounding the adsorbent particles c intra particle diffusion occurs as adsorbent carries pores which increase the surface area and consequently increase the surface diffusion process 54 55 one or more of these processes can be involved for the adsorption and rate is controlled by the slowest one kinetics based model developed by weber and morris explains time dependent intra particle diffusion of adsorbate 54 equation of this model is given below eq 6 6 q t k i n t c where qt mg g 1 adsorption capacity at time t kin mg g 1 min 1 2 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and c mg g 1 is the intercept which gives the idea about the thickness of periphery layer greater the value of c more will be the contribution of the surface adsorption in the rate controlling step fig 10b shows a plot of qt versus t1 2 for different concentrations of cr the whole adsorption process of cr is divided into two linear stages using n3z2 56 from plot qt versus t1 2 kin intra particle diffusion rate constant is calculated from the slope and c from the intercept for both linear stages and the values are given in table 4 the diffusion rates were higher in the first stage and slow in second stage correlating with the values of slope as presented in table 4 for nio and zno intra particle diffusion kinetics parameters are given in tables s8 and s9 respectively fig s20 b 20 d 3 10 adsorption isotherm to evaluate the adsorption capacity of n3z2 nanocomposite for cr adsorption isotherm studies were performed at various equilibrium concentrations fig 9e experiments were done by varying concentrations of cr for the fixed amount 10 mg of adsorbent to investigate adsorption isotherm the most widely utilized models are used langmuir and freundlich isotherm models langmuir model deals with adsorption of homogenous systems langmuir model explains the relationship between amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium and equilibrium solute concentration the equation eq 7 for langmuir model is 7 c e q e c e q m a x 1 q m a x b where qmax mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and b l mg 1 is the langmuir equilibrium constant ce mg l 1 equilibrium cr concentration fig 9d shows langmuir isotherm model for n3z2 with correlation coefficient value i e 0 99 the freundlich isotherm model deals with the adsorption of heterogeneous systems the equation eq 8 for the freundlich model is 8 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where kf l g 1 is freundlich constant defines the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n is the freundlich exponent related to the adsorption intensity log qe is plotted against log ce to calculate the values of kf and n fig 9c shows results of curve fitting giving correlation coefficient value 0 949 of n3z2 whereas the values of kf and n are 72 52 and 3 27 respectively based on the comparison of correlation coefficient values of both the models for cr removal using n3z2 nio and zno langmuir isotherm model can better describe the experimental data than freundlich isotherm model according to langmuir equation adsorption capacity of n3z2 nio and zno are 169 77 72 41 27 37 mg g 1 respectively based on the fitting results of langmuir model n3z2 have much superior adsorption capacity in comparison to nio and zno detailed parameters of freundlich and langmuir isotherm models for n3z2 nio and zno are listed in table s7 it has been observed that n3z2 among all the studied nanocomposites is the most efficient adsorbent for congo red its removal efficiency for 20 40 60 80 100 ppm of congo red are 99 97 9 94 9 86 8 and 82 7 respectively in duration of 60 min see uv vis absorbance spectra in supplementary figs s15 s17 while in literature hierarchical porous zno nio hollow microspheres with molar ratio of 1 1 ni zn showed adsorption of 10 100 ppm cr dye in duration of 12 h 11 hierarchical c nio zno nanocomposite fibers with molar ratio of 2 1 ni zn showed adsorption of 10 100 ppm cr dye in duration of 24 h 57 therefore studied n3z2 is better adsorbent than the previously reported composites for the removal of cr 3 11 adsorption mechanism of cr generally two reasons are considered for the adsorption of dye 1 opposite charge of the adsorbent and dye and 2 high surface area of adsorbent 58 zeta potential analysis has been performed to investigate the surface charge of nio zno nanocomposites nio and zno in aqueous solution ph 7 15 zeta potential values of n1z4 n2z3 n1z1 n3z2 n4z1 nio and zno were 16 8 14 4 15 7 15 3 20 0 3 4 and 6 75 mv respectively from the positive values of zeta potential we infer that electrostatic attractions can be the reason for adsorption of cr onto the nanocomposites as cr is negatively charged dye owing to the presence of so3 group 3 considering other aspect surface area 118 8 m2 g 1 n3z2 exhibits the highest adsorption towards cr among all nanocomposites therefore we conclude that synergistic effect of positive surface charge and high surface area of n3z2 together is responsible for its highest adsorption efficiency towards cr 3 12 catalytic reduction of 4 nitrophenol 4 np by different nio zno nanocomposites the catalytic reduction of 4 np to 4 aminophenol 4 ap was chosen to investigate the catalytic activity of all the prepared nio zno nanocomposites nio and zno absorption band of 4 np appears at 317 nm on addition of freshly prepared nabh4 solution light yellow color of 4 np changes to bright yellow due to formation of 4 nitrophenolate ion and absorption band shifts to 400 nm as the reduction of 4 nitrophenolate starts the intensity of band at 400 nm decreases with the appearance of a new band at 295 nm due to 4 ap further 4 np is not reduced by nabh4 in the absence of catalyst as depicted from uv vis spectra fig s21 n1z4 n2z3 n3z2 n4z1 and zno do not reduce 4 np only n1z1 and nio show the activity for the reduction of 4 np fig 11 a shows n1z1 composite gives complete reduction of 4 np within 9 min whereas nio takes 30 min fig 11 b since an excess amount of nabh4 was used in these experiments hence the reaction is independent of the concentration of sodium borohydride kinetics data fit according to the first order rate equation for n1z1 and nio fig 11c and straight lines are obtained by plotting ln ct c0 versus time and its slope provides value of the rate constant fig 11d the rate constant for nio and n1z1 are 0 17 min 1 and 0 512 min 1 respectively the possible catalytic reduction mechanism of 4 np by using nabh4 over nio zno nanocomposite occurring in 4 steps 59 in the first step bh4 releases hydride ions in aqueous medium that attached to the surface of n1z1 nanocomposite in step 2 hydrogen is covalently bonded to nio or zno in n1z1 surface rate determining step adsorption of nitro groups on the surface of n1z1 step 3 further adsorbed 4 np and bonded hydrogen atoms interact strongly hydride ion attacks the adsorbed nitro groups transfer of electron occurs from donor bh4 to the acceptor 4 np which is followed by desorption of 4 ap in the aqueous medium 3 13 reusability and stability of n3z2 and n1z1 for practical applications of catalyst recyclability is one of the most important factor reusability of n3z2 for removal of cr by adsorption was checked upto 5 cycles and reduction of 4 np for 3 cycles by using n1z1 n3z2 adsorbs 91 of cr in 5th cycle and n1z1 showed 100 reduction for 3 cycles but with variation in reduction time from 9 to 11 min fig 13 c d the stability of the catalysts was confirmed by pxrd fig 12 and fe sem fig 13 a b after the reusability experiments the results indicate that xrd pattern and morphology of the catalyst remain same after the recyclability experiment therefore these stable composites can be effectively used for the removal of hazardous pollutants in water and can provide a solution for purification of water for several cycles 4 conclusion in summary a facile sol gel method followed by calcination has been developed to synthesize nio zno nanocomposites with various molar ratio elemental as well as morphological characterizations have been investigated successfully n3z2 exhibits excellent and much higher adsorption capacity than nio and zno n3z2 has been proven as promising adsorbent for cr due to its surface area and positive zeta potential with adsorption capacity of 169 77 mg g 1 as deduced from langmuir adsorption plot furthermore n1z1 works selectively for reduction of 4 np in the presence of nabh4 with rate constant 0 512 min 1 which is much higher than that of nio moreover n3z2 and n1z1 demonstrate good recyclability and reusability in this way these stable nanocomposites have opened a new room for removing the pollutants from wastewater under ambient conditions and be utilized for several cycles

which are a combination of membrane and activated sludge processes have been actively employed for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment due to its unique characteristics and distinct advantages such as high quality effluent and smaller sludge production and compactness 1 3 however as the major drawback membrane fouling has known to be the main hinder of mbrs widespread commercialisation membrane fouling resulted from membrane pore clogging and or sludge cake deposition on the surface of the membrane leads to either reduced permeate flux or increased transmembrane pressure tmp depending on the operation mode 4 5 fouling mitigation has been studied since the early days of the research and application of mbrs to address the practical problems of such processes membrane composition membrane module mixed liquor sludge and feed water characteristics as well as the operational conditions have been among the most prominent factors affecting the membrane performance in terms of fouling accordingly interactions among such influencing factors that have not been yet well characterized have made fouling process complicated and hard to control in mbrs 3 6 in general three main approaches including membrane characteristics improvement optimizing the operating parameters and modification of the mixed liquor characteristics have been introduced to control and manipulate the membrane fouling 7 with respect to the mixed liquor characteristics it has been widely recognized that the soluble and colloidal particles within the mixed liquor could possibly penetrate into the membrane pores thereby irreversibly and profoundly lowering the availed pore space to fluid flow throughout the porous structure 8 9 due to the major impacts that extracellular polymeric substances epss and soluble microbial products smps could have on membrane fouling huge amount of efforts have also been made to verify the mechanisms by which such substances affect the laboratory scale mbr performances 10 12 however there is still contention in the literature regarding the effect of smp and eps compounds on the membrane fouling and their direct and indirect contributions on the reduced membrane efficiency 12 13 aiming to achieve filtration process of advance performance various strategies have been introduced to modify the properties of the mixed liquor such endeavors can be classified into two main groups of optimization of operating conditions 14 and application of different additives including the coagulants adsorbents oxidants or even biofilm carriers 15 21 besides the optimization of operating conditions coagulants have been widely used in practice as economic and efficient additives to manipulate and control the membrane fouling however it should be not that although the process can be conveniently conducted highly effective coagulants such as inorganic monomeric polymeric or organic synthetic polymeric coagulants would be required to meet the desired improvements in filtration process efficiency in this context common commercial iron and aluminum salts including ferric chloride fecl3 and aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 have been already employed in practice and their influences have been assessed as conventional inorganic coagulants 22 however studies have shown that enhanced filtration could be expected when inorganic coagulants were employed in mixed liquor treatment 23 several commercially applied coagulants have been studied and it has been concluded that the performance of fecl3 in sludge filterability enhancement i e mitigation of reversible fouling as well as in smp reduction i e mitigation of irreversible fouling was superior to the other coagulants 8 in addition in compared to alum iron based coagulants have shown to have better capabilities in extending the surfaces of the flocs in the bulk phase 23 however although lower membrane fouling would be expected from the larger flocs formed by fecl3 some reports have indicated that the positive charges provided to the surface of the sludge flocs could negatively affect the membrane performance by providing the sludge flocs with net positive charges 24 oxidation can be considered as a practical approach to modify mixed liquor characteristics to manipulate membrane fouling through organic foulants removal and improving the mixed liquor filterability 25 sludge pre oxidation could result in the promotion of flocs aggregation by using the surface charge neutralization of colloids and particles leading to the formation of stronger and larger flocs 26 accordingly pre oxidation has been extensively considered to control the membrane fouling by treating the mixed liquor prior to be filtrated and a number of studies have been conducted to verify suitable pre oxidants according to the literature potassium permanganate 21 ozone 27 and chlorination 28 have shown to have strong capabilities in this regard however most of these additives have shown to have undesirable secondary effects on filtration process ozone could break down the structure of membranes composed of organic polymers chlorine naocl would be associated with the production of halogenated by products and permanganate could increase sludge production 29 to improve its applicability and lower the formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps chlorine has been successfully coupled with coagulation to enhance the removal of pollutants including natural organic matters noms algae and inorganics 30 33 to the best of our knowledge although chlorine has been widely used as a chemical cleaning agent to recover the membrane permeability 28 the direct application of chlorination i e chlorine added to the membrane tank coupled with coagulation has not been studied for modifying mixed liquor properties and membrane fouling mitigation the application of such combined pretreatment for adjusting mixed liquor properties can be considered as a practical cost effective and environment friendly solution as it not only combines the advantages of the constituent treatments but also eliminates the challenges attributed to each as stated thus far although using either coagulation or pre oxidation methods might be beneficial to prolong the membrane performance in many cases such pretreatment processes would not be able to effectively control membrane fouling when used exclusively and thus there is continuing interest in the use of combined method together 29 34 35 the focus of majority of these studies is on the conventional microfiltration or ultrafiltration processes and there is still lack of much research addressing the fouling on mbr since the activated sludge mixed liquor in mbr is generally much more complex than that of the conventional microfiltration or ultrafiltration processes herein coagulation by fecl3 and oxidation using naocl were used simultaneously to modify the effluent in terms of mlvss mlss ratio cod and soluble microbial products of the mixed liquor in batch experiments to do so as membrane fouling would be governed in part by the membrane properties electrospun membranes were fabricated using electrospinning method and their morphology were examined in details during different operational conditions the optimum dosages of both additives were then determined to optimize the performance of the introduced novel pretreatment method and membrane filtration performance was investigated before and after pretreatment subsequently the optimized pretreatment method was further studied in long term experiments in a mbr to assess the fouling behaviour of synthesized membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials daily solutions were prepared by adding a desired amount of naocl sigma aldrich and fecl3 97 sigma aldrich the solutions were then placed on a magnet stirrer and mixing at room temperature to form a clear solution prior to be used in batch experiments solutions were stored at 4 c for up to a week 2 2 membrane fabrication using electrospinning method it would be possible to produce polymeric fibers from nanometers to microns in diameter based on the applied operational conditions to fabricate the electrospun nano fibrous membranes polysulfone psu molecular weight of 60 000 g mol and density of 1 24 kg m3 basf co germany was first dissolved in n n dimethylformamide dmf merck prior to the mbr studies electrospinning parameters including the polymer solution flow rate electric voltage and the gap between the needle tip and collector were then carefully assessed to achieve bead free nano fibers of desired characteristics such optimal conditions were determined to be 22 48 2 8 kv cm and 0 8 ml min for the polymer concentration current density and flowrate respectively the predetermined optimum amount of psu polymer beads were dissolved in dmf and used in electrospinning process after being degassed overnight at room temperature however as the psu polymer could be influenced by the ambient humidity prior to be dissolved the polymer beads were dried overnight at 120 c using a syringe pump 5 ml the obtained polymer solutions were pushed slowly into a high voltage charged spryer while a positive voltage of up to 28 kv was applied to the needle tip separated by 10 cm from the grounded collector by doing so the nanofibers were perfectly collected on a nonwoven support rotating at 600 rpm the electro spinning time was also varied to obtain desired thicknesses being peeled off the collector nanofibers possessed poor mechanical strength and could not be appropriately employed in membrane bioreactor applications therefore to fuse the fibers together and provide the nanofibers with higher structural integrity and enhanced mechanical properties after being fabricated the obtained membranes were placed in an oven at 200 c to keep its temperature above the glass transition i e 185 c and below the melting point of psu host polymer the resulting membranes were then placed between two pieces of glass plates and after being heated for 1 h gradually cooled down to the room temperature and cut to be placed in a cassette with 0 2 m2 effective filtration area the characteristics of the polysulfone psu membrane module has been summarized in table 1 2 3 response surface modeling of batch experiments jar test zag chemi co iran was conducted to determine the optimum dosage of flocculent and oxidant with respect to smp cod and mlvss removal samples containing 500 ml of the freshly mixed liquor suspended solid mlss in the range of 4000 5500 mg l were prepared desired amount of additives was added to each and consequently mixed for 5 min at 50 rpm and then for further 20 min at 20 rpm at the conclusion the mixed liquor samples were collected to be analyzed respectively the central composite design ccd suited for fitting a quadratic surface was employed to investigate the combination of fecl3 coagulation and naclo oxidation to optimize a series of batch experiments the rsm was used to evaluate the interactive effects of two independent variables including fecl3 x1 and naclo x2 while other affecting factors were kept constant the ranges of independent variables and experimental conditions derived from ccd have been summarized in table 2 as demonstrated 13 experiments were conducted consisting of four axial four factorial and five center points details of all the 13 experimental conditions have been shown in table 3 the following second order model eq 1 was used to correlate the removal efficiency expressed in terms of the two independent variables 1 y β 0 i 1 n β i x i i 1 n β i i x i 2 i 1 n j i 1 n β i j x i x j where y represents the predicted response mlvss mlss ratio cod and smp removal xi and xj are the coded independent variable and β0 βi βii and βij are the intercept the first order model coefficient the quadratic coefficient of variable i and the interaction coefficient of variables i and j respectively the fitted model reliability was assessed using the analysis of variance anova and the coefficient of determination r2 the design expert 7 software stat ease inc minneapolis mn usa was used for statistical analysis and to provide and analyze the second order polynomial model using the obtained second order polynomial model optimum solution leading to the maximum response values were finally assessed in terms of the experimental variables xi 2 4 continuous flow experiments for continuous experiments activated sludge was collected from south tehran wastewater treatment plant tehran iran to be adapted the sludge samples were first fed to a sequencing batch reactor sbr and subsequently aerated for 10 days at room temperature to establish an equilibrium condition with respect to the mlss concentration the bioreactor equipped with a spare membrane module was operated for a month the fabricated electrospun membrane module was submerged in the reactor with a working volume of 12 l fig 1 using a float valve the sludge level was adjusted and kept constant in the bioreactor air was distributed using a diffuser at the bottom of the tank to support biomass growth sludge mixing and to prevent particle accumulation on the membrane surface the rate of aeration determined as the volume of air per volume of feed per hour was kept in the range of 18 19 l h l the dissolved oxygen do concentration was measured to be 3 5 0 1 mg l number of measurements n 12 throughout the experiments and a thermostat was employed to keep the bioreactor temperature close to 28 c using a peristaltic pump the permeate flow of the membrane was also set in an intermittent mode with 8 min filtration time and 1 min relaxation interval the trans membrane pressure tmp was measured using a pressure gauge nuova fima the hydraulic retention time hrt of mbr was found to be within the range of 8 10 h the sludge retention time srt was kept at 33 day by discharging sludge during the filtration process the local permeate flux was within 5 6 l m2 h which was less than the measured critical flux of 9 l m2 h three different stages were considered to conduct the continuous flow experiments the first stage stage i was conducted with no chemical additives fecl3 was used in the second stage stage ii and in the third stage stage iii combination of fecl3 and naocl was employed in all the experiments when tmp exceeded 70 kpa the filtration process was terminated biomass characteristics at the beginning of each stage were found to be practically similar all over the experimental studies moreover to be able to verify the impact that chemical additives could have on membrane fouling operating conditions of each stage were also kept identical throughout the experiments except for the first stage at the beginning of the other two stages the chemical additives were instantly added to the sludge to achieve the optimum concentrations that were obtained in batch experiments and then to keep the additives concentrations at the optimum values chemicals were continuously added using a peristaltic pump the mbr was operated by feeding municipal wastewater collected daily from south tehran wastewater treatment plant the characteristics of feed wastewater has been summarized in table 4 2 5 fouling resistance membrane fouling can be expressed in terms of serial resistance as follows 2 r t r f r m where rt rf and rm are the total filtration resistance m 1 the fouling resistance m 1 and the intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 respectively rf can be calculated using darcy s law 3 r f t m p μ j r m where tmp j and μ are the trans membrane pressure pa the permeate flux m3 m2 s and the permeate viscosity pa s respectively rm was estimated by filtering deionized water using a fresh and intact membrane rf is divided into reversible fouling resistance rre and irreversible fouling resistance rir which can be expressed by the following equation 4 r f r r e r i r rir can be calculated by comparing the resistance values obtained by the filtration of distilled water before and after each stage r r e which is mainly resulted from the pore plugging can be practically eliminated by physical chemical cleaning 2 6 analytical methods nitrogen ammonia nh3 n and chemical oxygen demand cod were measured according to the nessler and dichromate method respectively 36 sludge characteristics including mixed liquor suspended solid mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss and sludge volume index svi were determined using the standard methods characterization 36 to measure smp and eps from activated sludge mixed liquor samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min and then the supernatant was decanted for the smp analysis and the remaining thickened sludge was taken for eps analysis total smp was determined as the sum of protein and carbohydrate concentrations protein and carbohydrate were measured using the widely used methods proposed by lowry et al 37 and dubois et al 38 respectively the extraction of eps was based on a method reported by wang et al 39 and the obtained results were normalized as the sum of carbohydrates and proteins using a zetasizer 2000hsa malvern uk the zeta potential of the supernatants were also analyzed for three times and the average values were reported in addition static light scattering sls analysette 22 nano tec fritsch germany method was applied to assess particle size distribution of the samples right after sampling 2 7 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova followed by the tukey s post hoc test lsd p 0 05 was employed to verify statistically significant differences among experimental measurements all statistical analyses were performed using originpro 9 0 0 sr2 software originlab corporation usa the significance level was set at 5 a 0 05 the results were reported with 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development and validation for batch tests a ccd design consisted of 13 experiments was carried out to study the effects of two independent variables on mlvss mlss ratio along with removal percentage of cod and smp the actual responses are represented in table 3 quadratic model was used to derive the regression equations by fitting experimental data for the responses the final mathematical models associated to the response in terms of actual factors after elimination of insignificant terms p 0 05 were expressed as follows eqs 5 7 5 m l v s s m l s s 0 82 0 013 f e c l 3 0 019 n a o c l 9 239 10 3 f e c l 3 2 6 c o d r e m o v a l

was verified through anova table 5 in this case the low probability value for regression model equations p 0 0001 or less revealed that the quadratic models fitted well to the experimental results the lack of fit was calculated from the experimental error pure error and residuals prob f higher than 0 05 in both models confirmed insignificant lack of fit the fitted model was further verified by the correlation coefficient r2 according to the anova results presented in table 5 r2 values were fairly high and found to be close to its corresponding adjusted correlation coefficients adj r2 thereby confirmed that the models were significant the interaction effects of fecl3 x1 and naocl concentrations x2 on the responses are illustrated in fig 2 a as shown the mlvss mlss ratio increased with increasing fecl3 concentration the fecl3 concentration was found to have the strongest effect on mlvss mlss ratio which has also been reflected in eq 5 in addition although no significant contribution was detected for naocl variation the mlvss mlss ratio was found to be increased from 0 8 to 1 while the concentration of fecl3 was increased from 0 6 to 3 4 mg l this implied that the naocl did not disrupt microbial activity in the batch culture the effects of x1 and x2 on the removal of cod is demonstrated in fig 2b clearly it was obvious that cod removal reached a maximum value when the fecl3 concentration was less than 1 93 mg l and at higher concentrations the cod removal was decreased such reduction could be explained by the consumption of naocl by the excess amount of fecl3 in the medium on the other hand the higher usage of naocl caused further degradation of cod the highest cod removal 90 achieved at the concentration of 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 2 mg l naocl fig 2c presents the effects of the additives on the removal of smp the smp removal revealed the same trend as that of the cod removal however the gradual reduction in terms of smp fractions was not as significant as that observed in the cod removal the highest smp removal was achieved when naocl and fecl3 were almost 1 71 and 1 93 mg l respectively overall the optimal conditions leading to the maximum cod and smp removal corresponded to 1 71 mg l naocl and 1 93 mg l fecl3 concentrations based on eqs 6 and 7 cod and smp were calculated to be respectively 90 5 and 18 4 and the eq 5 was resulted in the mlvss mlss ratio of 0 8 the obtained optimal conditions were finally verified experimentally the good agreement obtained between the predicted and observed 91 2 7 for cod and 17 2 4 5 for smp results was certainly a confirmation of the validity of the obtained optimal values 3 2 continuous flow experiments the optimal conditions verified in the batch studies were used to conduct the experiments under continuous flow conditions and fecl3 and naocl were continuously dosed into the bioreactor at the concentrations of 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 1 71 mg l respectively sludge characterization was conducted prior to each stage to similarly evaluate the initial sludge properties throughout the experiments as confirmed by anvoa data not shown negligible differences p 0 05 were detected between the sludge properties of all stages hence it could be concluded that the obtained results were not significantly affected by the initial sludge characteristics 3 2 1 mlss and mlvss mlss ratio mlss and the mlvss mlss ratio assessed in continuous flow experiments have been illustrated in fig 3 a mean mlss concentrations were determined to be 4292 25 mg l n 6 4117 85 mg l n 10 and 4413 296 mg l n 26 in stage i ii and iii respectively as compared to stage i the mlss concentrations did not remarkably change in stage ii p 0 347 and stage iii p 0 510 suggesting that fecl3 and naocl were not able to significantly affect the microbial growth 3 2 2 cod removal fig 3b illustrates cod concentrations measured in the influent and effluent of the bioreactor throughout the operation period of each stage the mean cod removal efficiency in stage i and stage ii were 83 6 0 9 n 6 and 83 4 0 9 n 10 respectively the results which were found to be statistically identical p 0 881 indicated that the inorganic coagulant was not able to significantly influence the heterotrophic bacteria growth alimoradi et al 40 has reported that while the cod reduction could not be hindered by aluminum sulfate the combination of coagulation mbr processes could be considered to significantly improve the cod removal of dairy wastewater however in this study when the oxidant was used along with the coagulant cod removal was increased significantly according to the obtained results 94 2 1 n 26 of cod was removed in stage iii which was statistically higher than those observed in the other two stages cod concentrations in the effluent were also determined as 87 7 5 8 mg l n 6 85 0 2 5 mg l n 10 and 31 4 5 4 mg l n 26 for stages i ii and iii respectively indicating that the employed strategy contributed to the better effluent quality in stage iii 3 2 3 nitrification process the ammonia nitrogen nh3 n concentration in the influent and effluent were assessed to study the effect of employed strategy on nitrifying bacteria as shown in fig 3c nh3 n removal efficiency were found to be as high as 93 2 0 4 n 6 93 6 0 6 n 10 and 98 4 0 6 n 26 for stages i ii and iii respectively compared to stage i p 0 000 and stage ii p 0 000 the statistically significant enhancement in nh3 n removal achieved in stage iii indicated that the conditions were in favor of the nitrifying bacteria in stage iii this implied that 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 1 71 mg l naocl were not able to influence and put a pressure on nitrifying bacteria the most sensitive organism presented in the process 3 2 4 membrane fouling membrane fouling refers to the accumulation or adsorption of microorganisms colloids solutes and cell debris onto the membrane surfaces and or within the membrane pore spaces due to a set of interactions between the membrane surface and different fouling parameters of the feed water fig 4 depicts relatively sharp increase in fouling resistance during short term and long term filtration experiments in all 3 stages in short term experiments carried out for about 4 h initial pore clogging and colloid and organics adsorption onto the membrane surface resulted in rapid and marked increase in initial fouling resistance and consequently fast flux reduction according to fig 4 fouling resistance rates of stage i ii and iii were calculated to be 5 95 1012 4 14 1012 and 1 68 1012 1 m h respectively compared to that of stage i the reduced fouling resistance rates observed in stage ii could be attributed to the additives employed by adding fecl3 soluble foulants could form flocs leading to the formation of protective components preventing membrane pore clogging in addition the presence of fecl3 naocl in stage iii was able to significantly reduce the fouling rate when compared to the other two stages this could also be justified by the enhanced coagulation and oxidization of organic foulants in stage iii following initial adsorption of soluble foulants onto the membrane surface cake layer formation could be initiated and form a dense mature resistive layer in long term experiments as shown in fig 4 fouling rate decreased from 1 83 0 54 1013 1 m day in stage i to 1 14 0 95 1013 1 m day in stage ii such reduction could be attributed in part to the formation of larger flocs in which the organic foulants such as smp could be trapped the mbr system with powder activated carbon pac replenishment also reported to have low fouling propensity and extended ﬁltration agreed well with the discussed fouling rate and resistance analysis 41 in stage iii the addition of fecl3 naocl considerably hindered the cake layer compression and thus the effective filtration period could be increased from 10 days in stage ii to up to 26 days in stage iii this improvement could be in part elucidated by the enhanced sludge filterability and subsequently slow compression of the cake layer it has also been reported in literature that the formation of cake layer could be considered as the major resistance leading to the membrane fouling 26 42 43 the irreversible fouling resistance rir of each stage has been summarized in table 6 as shown the rir was found to be considerably reduced following the addition of fecl3 which could be explained by the formations of particles larger than that of the membrane pores during the flocculation process also as evidenced by the rir values flocculation process triggered when the oxidant was incorporated in stage iii such evolving resistance could be explained by the growth of the microbial cells entrapped within the membrane pore spaces fig 5 a clearly shows that the fabricated membrane possesses a bead free uniform structure as can be seen from fig 5b membrane surface dramatically blocked at stage i in which no additives were used fig 5c demonstrates the fabricated membrane during stage ii where fecl3 was included compared to stage i stage ii demonstrated lower membrane pore blockage which was in line with the results obtained so far for the membrane resistance finally as shown in fig 5d during stage iii the lowest pore blockage was evidenced therefore it could be inferred from the fig 5b to d that fouling could be significantly decreased by adding chemicals to treat and alleviate membrane fouling 3 2 5 smp and eps concentration fig 6 a presents the profile of smp concentration during various stages based on experimental results given total smp concentration in stage i remained practically constant at 63 3 n 6 mg l 49 6 1 n 10 mg l and 25 2 8 8 n 26 mg l for i ii and iii stages respectively also compared to the other two stages p 0 000 the statistically significant change in total smp concentration observed in stage iii moreover as shown in fig 6a the carbohydrate portion of smp decreased significantly after the first day 37 5 in stage iii while the protein fraction was not substantially reduced 10 it was also recorded that in stage iii 22 2 of the total smp was removed after one day unlike that observed in stage ii during the long term filtration smp fraction was gradually reduced in stage iii as smp components contain large number of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups they hold a net negative charge accordingly the reduction of smp concentration in stage iii could reduce cake layer resistance and weaken the electro naturally condition such processes eventually alleviated the membrane fouling problem in stage iii eps components high molecular weight molecules excreted by the cells were also monitored as another influencing factor affecting the membrane performance fig 6b when the membrane surface was covered with such polymeric substances in which the cells are embedded surface physicochemical characteristics including its hydrophobicity charge and polymeric properties would be significantly changed 39 44 such evolving variations in surface characteristics can in turn have major impacts on membrane performance and thus should be considered to better understand mbr process 44 according to the obtained results by the incorporation of fecl3 considerably lower eps secretion 34 8 9 mg l was recorded in stage ii moreover when the medium was supplemented by oxidant even more eps reduction 10 4 1 05 mg l was observed in stage iii the differences observed among eps concentrations obtained in stage i and stage iii and also stage ii and stage iii were all statistically meaningful p 0 000 this implied that the fecl3 naocl combination could be effectively used to manipulate the secretion of eps in the mixed liquor and consequently alleviate the membrane fouling in mbr systems 3 2 6 zeta potential and particle size surface properties of the sludge particles including zeta potential and particle size can affect the membrane fouling behavior 45 fig 7 a demonstrates the zeta potential and the mean particle size of the mixed liquor during the experiments as shown the zeta potential of sludge flocs in stage ii decreased from 19 8 mv to 14 26 mv in terms of absolute value followed by the addition of fecl3 due to the oxidization of colloidal particles by naocl and neutralizing the particles zeta potential in stage iii the negative zeta potential of particles and colloids was neutralized to a greater extent than that observed in stage ii reducing from 17 mv in the first day to 8 mv on day 10 it has been reported that the sludge oxidation could reduce the zeta potential by altering the flocs properties 46 zeta potential of sludge increased from day 10 to day 26 of stage iii which could be attributed in part to sludge aging and the growth of filamentous bacteria 47 the mean particle size of the mixed liquor for each stage has also depicts in fig 7a as shown after the injection of chemicals the mean size of the flocs was increased over a short period of time in stage ii such prompt increment in the particle size as a result of a green bioflocculant addition has also been reported elsewhere 48 as shown in fig 7a the mean particle size was gradually increased in stage ii which could be resulted from the fecl3 added to the bioreactor the size of flocs in stage iii was statistically smaller than that in stage ii p 0 03 and almost remained similar to that of stage i p 0 31 implying the formation of flocs was not negatively affected by fecl3 naocl in stage iii 3 2 7 svi svi has been widely used to characterize the sludge settleability fig 7b presents the evolving svi values determined over each stage of operation as can be seen svi varied from 200 to 227 mg l in stage i by of the incorporation of flocculants in stage ii a gradual decline in svi profile was observed also a sudden rise in svi recorded at the commencement of stage iii and remained constant to the end of the experiment svi in stage iii was statistically higher than that observed in stage ii p 0 000 and was almost the same as that of stage i p 1 these results implied that the settling properties of sludge were not significantly altered in stage iii 3 3 feasibility of fecl3 naocl addition in synthesized membrane to better assess the feasibility of the introduced strategy a commercial membrane fmbr80 rising sun china was employed under identical operational conditions and the results of the membrane fouling and overall process efficiency were compared to those obtained for the synthesized membranes as confirmed experimentally fig 8 as the rate of tmp increase was slower than that of commercial the value of tmp reached its lowest 70 kpa on the seventh day in the commercial membrane while it took up to 26 days to get to such tmp limit in the synthesized membrane 4 conclusions in this study to alleviate the membrane fouling and improving the performance of the mbr system fecl3 and naocl were used as flocculent and oxidant additives to lower the mixed liquor fouling propensity based on the results of the batch experiments 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 1 71 mg l naocl were determined as optimum concentrations leading to the mlvss mlss ratio cod removal and smp removal of 0 8 90 5 and 18 4 respectively continuous flow experiments were then carried out to monitor the membrane fouling in longer terms using the proposed method according to the obtained results following conclusions could be drawn from this study 1 the introduced combined method revealed good performance in reducing nh3 n concentration suggesting that fecl3 naocl addition had no adverse effect on autotrophic nitrifying bacteria cod effluent was decreased from 87 7 5 5 mg l n 6 in stage i to 85 2 5 mg l n 10 and 31 4 5 4 mg l n 26 in stage ii and stage iii respectively in addition mlss and mlvss mlss ratio was almost remained constant throughout the experiments accordingly it could be inferred that while practically keeping the microbial activity intact the introduced method could be considered to improve mbr effluent quality 2 the addition of fecl3 along with naocl could remarkably lower the rate of cake layer compression thereby increasing the operational time of mbr from 6 and 10 days in stage i and ii to 26 days in stage iii 3 practically similar mixed liquor filterability and consequently svi were achieved when the combination of fecl3 and naocl were employed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments the authors appreciate the supports received by national water and wastewater engineering company nwwec tehran iran 
14148,a combination of oxidation and coagulation pretreatment processes was used to reduce membrane fouling naocl and fecl3 were selected as conventional cheap additives to modify the mixed liquor and prolong the operation life of the membranes optimum dosages of 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 1 71 mg l naocl were determined through batch experiments considering mlvss mlss ratio cod and soluble microbial products removal identical studies but under flow condition were then conducted to assess mlss cod removal ammonia removal smp extracellular polymeric substances zeta potential mean particle size and svi experimental results implied that although combination of naocl and fecl3 was able to lower the mean particle size the sludge settling properties were not negatively affected furthermore by employing a commercial membrane it was confirmed that the operating time of the membrane could be increased by 3 7 times when a combination of naocl and fecl3 was used to modify the feed solution

which are a combination of membrane and activated sludge processes have been actively employed for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment due to its unique characteristics and distinct advantages such as high quality effluent and smaller sludge production and compactness 1 3 however as the major drawback membrane fouling has known to be the main hinder of mbrs widespread commercialisation membrane fouling resulted from membrane pore clogging and or sludge cake deposition on the surface of the membrane leads to either reduced permeate flux or increased transmembrane pressure tmp depending on the operation mode 4 5 fouling mitigation has been studied since the early days of the research and application of mbrs to address the practical problems of such processes membrane composition membrane module mixed liquor sludge and feed water characteristics as well as the operational conditions have been among the most prominent factors affecting the membrane performance in terms of fouling accordingly interactions among such influencing factors that have not been yet well characterized have made fouling process complicated and hard to control in mbrs 3 6 in general three main approaches including membrane characteristics improvement optimizing the operating parameters and modification of the mixed liquor characteristics have been introduced to control and manipulate the membrane fouling 7 with respect to the mixed liquor characteristics it has been widely recognized that the soluble and colloidal particles within the mixed liquor could possibly penetrate into the membrane pores thereby irreversibly and profoundly lowering the availed pore space to fluid flow throughout the porous structure 8 9 due to the major impacts that extracellular polymeric substances epss and soluble microbial products smps could have on membrane fouling huge amount of efforts have also been made to verify the mechanisms by which such substances affect the laboratory scale mbr performances 10 12 however there is still contention in the literature regarding the effect of smp and eps compounds on the membrane fouling and their direct and indirect contributions on the reduced membrane efficiency 12 13 aiming to achieve filtration process of advance performance various strategies have been introduced to modify the properties of the mixed liquor such endeavors can be classified into two main groups of optimization of operating conditions 14 and application of different additives including the coagulants adsorbents oxidants or even biofilm carriers 15 21 besides the optimization of operating conditions coagulants have been widely used in practice as economic and efficient additives to manipulate and control the membrane fouling however it should be not that although the process can be conveniently conducted highly effective coagulants such as inorganic monomeric polymeric or organic synthetic polymeric coagulants would be required to meet the desired improvements in filtration process efficiency in this context common commercial iron and aluminum salts including ferric chloride fecl3 and aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 have been already employed in practice and their influences have been assessed as conventional inorganic coagulants 22 however studies have shown that enhanced filtration could be expected when inorganic coagulants were employed in mixed liquor treatment 23 several commercially applied coagulants have been studied and it has been concluded that the performance of fecl3 in sludge filterability enhancement i e mitigation of reversible fouling as well as in smp reduction i e mitigation of irreversible fouling was superior to the other coagulants 8 in addition in compared to alum iron based coagulants have shown to have better capabilities in extending the surfaces of the flocs in the bulk phase 23 however although lower membrane fouling would be expected from the larger flocs formed by fecl3 some reports have indicated that the positive charges provided to the surface of the sludge flocs could negatively affect the membrane performance by providing the sludge flocs with net positive charges 24 oxidation can be considered as a practical approach to modify mixed liquor characteristics to manipulate membrane fouling through organic foulants removal and improving the mixed liquor filterability 25 sludge pre oxidation could result in the promotion of flocs aggregation by using the surface charge neutralization of colloids and particles leading to the formation of stronger and larger flocs 26 accordingly pre oxidation has been extensively considered to control the membrane fouling by treating the mixed liquor prior to be filtrated and a number of studies have been conducted to verify suitable pre oxidants according to the literature potassium permanganate 21 ozone 27 and chlorination 28 have shown to have strong capabilities in this regard however most of these additives have shown to have undesirable secondary effects on filtration process ozone could break down the structure of membranes composed of organic polymers chlorine naocl would be associated with the production of halogenated by products and permanganate could increase sludge production 29 to improve its applicability and lower the formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps chlorine has been successfully coupled with coagulation to enhance the removal of pollutants including natural organic matters noms algae and inorganics 30 33 to the best of our knowledge although chlorine has been widely used as a chemical cleaning agent to recover the membrane permeability 28 the direct application of chlorination i e chlorine added to the membrane tank coupled with coagulation has not been studied for modifying mixed liquor properties and membrane fouling mitigation the application of such combined pretreatment for adjusting mixed liquor properties can be considered as a practical cost effective and environment friendly solution as it not only combines the advantages of the constituent treatments but also eliminates the challenges attributed to each as stated thus far although using either coagulation or pre oxidation methods might be beneficial to prolong the membrane performance in many cases such pretreatment processes would not be able to effectively control membrane fouling when used exclusively and thus there is continuing interest in the use of combined method together 29 34 35 the focus of majority of these studies is on the conventional microfiltration or ultrafiltration processes and there is still lack of much research addressing the fouling on mbr since the activated sludge mixed liquor in mbr is generally much more complex than that of the conventional microfiltration or ultrafiltration processes herein coagulation by fecl3 and oxidation using naocl were used simultaneously to modify the effluent in terms of mlvss mlss ratio cod and soluble microbial products of the mixed liquor in batch experiments to do so as membrane fouling would be governed in part by the membrane properties electrospun membranes were fabricated using electrospinning method and their morphology were examined in details during different operational conditions the optimum dosages of both additives were then determined to optimize the performance of the introduced novel pretreatment method and membrane filtration performance was investigated before and after pretreatment subsequently the optimized pretreatment method was further studied in long term experiments in a mbr to assess the fouling behaviour of synthesized membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials daily solutions were prepared by adding a desired amount of naocl sigma aldrich and fecl3 97 sigma aldrich the solutions were then placed on a magnet stirrer and mixing at room temperature to form a clear solution prior to be used in batch experiments solutions were stored at 4 c for up to a week 2 2 membrane fabrication using electrospinning method it would be possible to produce polymeric fibers from nanometers to microns in diameter based on the applied operational conditions to fabricate the electrospun nano fibrous membranes polysulfone psu molecular weight of 60 000 g mol and density of 1 24 kg m3 basf co germany was first dissolved in n n dimethylformamide dmf merck prior to the mbr studies electrospinning parameters including the polymer solution flow rate electric voltage and the gap between the needle tip and collector were then carefully assessed to achieve bead free nano fibers of desired characteristics such optimal conditions were determined to be 22 48 2 8 kv cm and 0 8 ml min for the polymer concentration current density and flowrate respectively the predetermined optimum amount of psu polymer beads were dissolved in dmf and used in electrospinning process after being degassed overnight at room temperature however as the psu polymer could be influenced by the ambient humidity prior to be dissolved the polymer beads were dried overnight at 120 c using a syringe pump 5 ml the obtained polymer solutions were pushed slowly into a high voltage charged spryer while a positive voltage of up to 28 kv was applied to the needle tip separated by 10 cm from the grounded collector by doing so the nanofibers were perfectly collected on a nonwoven support rotating at 600 rpm the electro spinning time was also varied to obtain desired thicknesses being peeled off the collector nanofibers possessed poor mechanical strength and could not be appropriately employed in membrane bioreactor applications therefore to fuse the fibers together and provide the nanofibers with higher structural integrity and enhanced mechanical properties after being fabricated the obtained membranes were placed in an oven at 200 c to keep its temperature above the glass transition i e 185 c and below the melting point of psu host polymer the resulting membranes were then placed between two pieces of glass plates and after being heated for 1 h gradually cooled down to the room temperature and cut to be placed in a cassette with 0 2 m2 effective filtration area the characteristics of the polysulfone psu membrane module has been summarized in table 1 2 3 response surface modeling of batch experiments jar test zag chemi co iran was conducted to determine the optimum dosage of flocculent and oxidant with respect to smp cod and mlvss removal samples containing 500 ml of the freshly mixed liquor suspended solid mlss in the range of 4000 5500 mg l were prepared desired amount of additives was added to each and consequently mixed for 5 min at 50 rpm and then for further 20 min at 20 rpm at the conclusion the mixed liquor samples were collected to be analyzed respectively the central composite design ccd suited for fitting a quadratic surface was employed to investigate the combination of fecl3 coagulation and naclo oxidation to optimize a series of batch experiments the rsm was used to evaluate the interactive effects of two independent variables including fecl3 x1 and naclo x2 while other affecting factors were kept constant the ranges of independent variables and experimental conditions derived from ccd have been summarized in table 2 as demonstrated 13 experiments were conducted consisting of four axial four factorial and five center points details of all the 13 experimental conditions have been shown in table 3 the following second order model eq 1 was used to correlate the removal efficiency expressed in terms of the two independent variables 1 y β 0 i 1 n β i x i i 1 n β i i x i 2 i 1 n j i 1 n β i j x i x j where y represents the predicted response mlvss mlss ratio cod and smp removal xi and xj

j respectively the fitted model reliability was assessed using the analysis of variance anova and the coefficient of determination r2 the design expert 7 software stat ease inc minneapolis mn usa was used for statistical analysis and to provide and analyze the second order polynomial model using the obtained second order polynomial model optimum solution leading to the maximum response values were finally assessed in terms of the experimental variables xi 2 4 continuous flow experiments for continuous experiments activated sludge was collected from south tehran wastewater treatment plant tehran iran to be adapted the sludge samples were first fed to a sequencing batch reactor sbr and subsequently aerated for 10 days at room temperature to establish an equilibrium condition with respect to the mlss concentration the bioreactor equipped with a spare membrane module was operated for a month the fabricated electrospun membrane module was submerged in the reactor with a working volume of 12 l fig 1 using a float valve the sludge level was adjusted and kept constant in the bioreactor air was distributed using a diffuser at the bottom of the tank to support biomass growth sludge mixing and to prevent particle accumulation on the membrane surface the rate of aeration determined as the volume of air per volume of feed per hour was kept in the range of 18 19 l h l the dissolved oxygen do concentration was measured to be 3 5 0 1 mg l number of measurements n 12 throughout the experiments and a thermostat was employed to keep the bioreactor temperature close to 28 c using a peristaltic pump the permeate flow of the membrane was also set in an intermittent mode with 8 min filtration time and 1 min relaxation interval the trans membrane pressure tmp was measured using a pressure gauge nuova fima the hydraulic retention time hrt of mbr was found to be within the range of 8 10 h the sludge retention time srt was kept at 33 day by discharging sludge during the filtration process the local permeate flux was within 5 6 l m2 h which was less than the measured critical flux of 9 l m2 h three different stages were considered to conduct the continuous flow experiments the first stage stage i was conducted with no chemical additives fecl3 was used in the second stage stage ii and in the third stage stage iii combination of fecl3 and naocl was employed in all the experiments when tmp exceeded 70 kpa the filtration process was terminated biomass characteristics at the beginning of each stage were found to be practically similar all over the experimental studies moreover to be able to verify the impact that chemical additives could have on membrane fouling operating conditions of each stage were also kept identical throughout the experiments except for the first stage at the beginning of the other two stages the chemical additives were instantly added to the sludge to achieve the optimum concentrations that were obtained in batch experiments and then to keep the additives concentrations at the optimum values chemicals were continuously added using a peristaltic pump the mbr was operated by feeding municipal wastewater collected daily from south tehran wastewater treatment plant the characteristics of feed wastewater has been summarized in table 4 2 5 fouling resistance membrane fouling can be expressed in terms of serial resistance as follows 2 r t r f r m where rt rf and rm are the total filtration resistance m 1 the fouling resistance m 1 and the intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 respectively rf can be calculated using darcy s law 3 r f t m p μ j r m where tmp j and μ are the trans membrane pressure pa the permeate flux m3 m2 s and the permeate viscosity pa s respectively rm was estimated by filtering deionized water using a fresh and intact membrane rf is divided into reversible fouling resistance rre and irreversible fouling resistance rir which can be expressed by the following equation 4 r f r r e r i r rir can be calculated by comparing the resistance values obtained by the filtration of distilled water before and after each stage r r e which is mainly resulted from the pore plugging can be practically eliminated by physical chemical cleaning 2 6 analytical methods nitrogen ammonia nh3 n and chemical oxygen demand cod were measured according to the nessler and dichromate method respectively 36 sludge characteristics including mixed liquor suspended solid mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss and sludge volume index svi were determined using the standard methods characterization 36 to measure smp and eps from activated sludge mixed liquor samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min and then the supernatant was decanted for the smp analysis and the remaining thickened sludge was taken for eps analysis total smp was determined as the sum of protein and carbohydrate concentrations protein and carbohydrate were measured using the widely used methods proposed by lowry et al 37 and dubois et al 38 respectively the extraction of eps was based on a method reported by wang et al 39 and the obtained results were normalized as the sum of carbohydrates and proteins using a zetasizer 2000hsa malvern uk the zeta potential of the supernatants were also analyzed for three times and the average values were reported in addition static light scattering sls analysette 22 nano tec fritsch germany method was applied to assess particle size distribution of the samples right after sampling 2 7 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova followed by the tukey s post hoc test lsd p 0 05 was employed to verify statistically significant differences among experimental measurements all statistical analyses were performed using originpro 9 0 0 sr2 software originlab corporation usa the significance level was set at 5 a 0 05 the results were reported with 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development and validation for batch tests a ccd design consisted of 13 experiments was carried out to study the effects of two independent variables on mlvss mlss ratio along with removal percentage of cod and smp the actual responses are represented in table 3 quadratic model was used to derive the regression equations by fitting experimental data for the responses the final mathematical models associated to the response in terms of actual factors after elimination of insignificant terms p 0 05 were expressed as follows eqs 5 7 5 m l v s s m l s s 0 82 0 013 f e c l 3 0 019 n a o c l 9 239 10 3 f e c l 3 2 6 c o d r e m o v a l

was verified through anova table 5 in this case the low probability value for regression model equations p 0 0001 or less revealed that the quadratic models fitted well to the experimental results the lack of fit was calculated from the experimental error pure error and residuals prob f higher than 0 05 in both models confirmed insignificant lack of fit the fitted model was further verified by the correlation coefficient r2 according to the anova results presented in table 5 r2 values were fairly high and found to be close to its corresponding adjusted correlation coefficients adj r2 thereby confirmed that the models were significant the interaction effects of fecl3 x1 and naocl concentrations x2 on the responses are illustrated in fig 2 a as shown the mlvss mlss ratio increased with increasing fecl3 concentration the fecl3 concentration was found to have the strongest effect on mlvss mlss ratio which has also been reflected in eq 5 in addition although no significant contribution was detected for naocl variation the mlvss mlss ratio was found to be increased from 0 8 to 1 while the concentration of fecl3 was increased from 0 6 to 3 4 mg l this implied that the naocl did not disrupt microbial activity in the batch culture the effects of x1 and x2 on the removal of cod is demonstrated in fig 2b clearly it was obvious that cod removal reached a maximum value when the fecl3 concentration was less than 1 93 mg l and at higher concentrations the cod removal was decreased such reduction could be explained by the consumption of naocl by the excess amount of fecl3 in the medium on the other hand the higher usage of naocl caused further degradation of cod the highest cod removal 90 achieved at the concentration of 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 2 mg l naocl fig 2c presents the effects of the additives on the removal of smp the smp removal revealed the same trend as that of the cod removal however the gradual reduction in terms of smp fractions was not as significant as that observed in the cod removal the highest smp removal was achieved when naocl and fecl3 were almost 1 71 and 1 93 mg l respectively overall the optimal conditions leading to the maximum cod and smp removal corresponded to 1 71 mg l naocl and 1 93 mg l fecl3 concentrations based on eqs 6 and 7 cod and smp were calculated to be respectively 90 5 and 18 4 and the eq 5 was resulted in the mlvss mlss ratio of 0 8 the obtained optimal conditions were finally verified experimentally the good agreement obtained between the predicted and observed 91 2 7 for cod and 17 2 4 5 for smp results was certainly a confirmation of the validity of the obtained optimal values 3 2 continuous flow experiments the optimal conditions verified in the batch studies were used to conduct the experiments under continuous flow conditions and fecl3 and naocl were continuously dosed into the bioreactor at the concentrations of 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 1 71 mg l respectively sludge characterization was conducted prior to each stage to similarly evaluate the initial sludge properties throughout the experiments as confirmed by anvoa data not shown negligible differences p 0 05 were detected between the sludge properties of all stages hence it could be concluded that the obtained results were not significantly affected by the initial sludge characteristics 3 2 1 mlss and mlvss mlss ratio mlss and the mlvss mlss ratio assessed in continuous flow experiments have been illustrated in fig 3 a mean mlss concentrations were determined to be 4292 25 mg l n 6 4117 85 mg l n 10 and 4413 296 mg l n 26 in stage i ii and iii respectively as compared to stage i the mlss concentrations did not remarkably change in stage ii p 0 347 and stage iii p 0 510 suggesting that fecl3 and naocl were not able to significantly affect the microbial growth 3 2 2 cod removal fig 3b illustrates cod concentrations measured in the influent and effluent of the bioreactor throughout the operation period of each stage the mean cod removal efficiency in stage i and stage ii were 83 6 0 9 n 6 and 83 4 0 9 n 10 respectively the results which were found to be statistically identical p 0 881 indicated that the inorganic coagulant was not able to significantly influence the heterotrophic bacteria growth alimoradi et al 40 has reported that while the cod reduction could not be hindered by aluminum sulfate the combination of coagulation mbr processes could be considered to significantly improve the cod removal of dairy wastewater however in this study when the oxidant was used along with the coagulant cod removal was increased significantly according to the obtained results 94 2 1 n 26 of cod was removed in stage iii which was statistically higher than those observed in the other two stages cod concentrations in the effluent were also determined as 87 7 5 8 mg l n 6 85 0 2 5 mg l n 10 and 31 4 5 4 mg l n 26 for stages i ii and iii respectively indicating that the employed strategy contributed to the better effluent quality in stage iii 3 2 3 nitrification process the ammonia nitrogen nh3 n concentration in the influent and effluent were assessed to study the effect of employed strategy on nitrifying bacteria as shown in fig 3c nh3 n removal efficiency were found to be as high as 93 2 0 4 n 6 93 6 0 6 n 10 and 98 4 0 6 n 26 for stages i ii and iii respectively compared to stage i p 0 000 and stage ii p 0 000 the statistically significant enhancement in nh3 n removal achieved in stage iii indicated that the conditions were in favor of the nitrifying bacteria in stage iii this implied that 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 1 71 mg l naocl were not able to influence and put a pressure on nitrifying bacteria the most sensitive organism presented in the process 3 2 4 membrane fouling membrane fouling refers to the accumulation or adsorption of microorganisms colloids solutes and cell debris onto the membrane surfaces and or within the membrane pore spaces due to a set of interactions between the membrane surface and different fouling parameters of the feed water fig 4 depicts relatively sharp increase in fouling resistance during short term and long term filtration experiments in all 3 stages in short term experiments carried out for about 4 h initial pore clogging and colloid and organics adsorption onto the membrane surface resulted in rapid and marked increase in initial fouling resistance and consequently fast flux reduction according to fig 4 fouling resistance rates of stage i ii and iii were calculated to be 5 95 1012 4 14 1012 and 1 68 1012 1 m h respectively compared to that of stage i the reduced fouling resistance rates observed in stage ii could be attributed to the additives employed by adding fecl3 soluble foulants could form flocs leading to the formation of protective components preventing membrane pore clogging in addition the presence of fecl3 naocl in stage iii was able to significantly reduce the fouling rate when compared to the other two stages this could also be justified by the enhanced coagulation and oxidization of organic foulants in stage iii following initial adsorption of soluble foulants onto the membrane surface cake layer formation could be initiated and form a dense mature resistive layer in long term experiments as shown in fig 4 fouling rate decreased from 1 83 0 54 1013 1 m day in stage i to 1 14 0 95 1013 1 m day in stage ii such reduction could be attributed in part to the formation of larger flocs in which the organic foulants such as smp could be trapped the mbr system with powder activated carbon pac replenishment also reported to have low fouling propensity and extended ﬁltration agreed well with the discussed fouling rate and resistance analysis 41 in stage iii the addition of fecl3 naocl considerably hindered the cake layer compression and thus the effective filtration period could be increased from 10 days in stage ii to up to 26 days in stage iii this improvement could be in part elucidated by the enhanced sludge filterability and subsequently slow compression of the cake layer it has also been reported in literature that the formation of cake layer could be considered as the major resistance leading to the membrane fouling 26 42 43 the irreversible fouling resistance rir of each stage has been summarized in table 6 as shown the rir was found to be considerably reduced following the addition of fecl3 which could be explained by the formations of particles larger than that of the membrane pores during the flocculation process also as evidenced by the rir values flocculation process triggered when the oxidant was incorporated in stage iii such evolving resistance could be explained by the growth of the microbial cells entrapped within the membrane pore spaces fig 5 a clearly shows that the fabricated membrane possesses a bead free uniform structure as can be seen from fig 5b membrane surface dramatically blocked at stage i in which no additives were used fig 5c demonstrates the fabricated membrane during stage ii where fecl3 was included compared to stage i stage ii demonstrated lower membrane pore blockage which was in line with the results obtained so far for the membrane resistance finally as shown in fig 5d during stage iii the lowest pore blockage was evidenced therefore it could be inferred from the fig 5b to d that fouling could be significantly decreased by adding chemicals to treat and alleviate membrane fouling 3 2 5 smp and eps concentration fig 6 a presents the profile of smp concentration during various stages based on experimental results given total smp concentration in stage i remained practically constant at 63 3 n 6 mg l 49 6 1 n 10 mg l and 25 2 8 8 n 26 mg l for i ii and iii stages respectively also compared to the other two stages p 0 000 the statistically significant change in total smp concentration observed in stage iii moreover as shown in fig 6a the carbohydrate portion of smp decreased significantly after the first day 37 5 in stage iii while the protein fraction was not substantially reduced 10 it was also recorded that in stage iii 22 2 of the total smp was removed after one day unlike that observed in stage ii during the long term filtration smp fraction was gradually reduced in stage iii as smp components contain large number of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups they hold a net negative charge accordingly the reduction of smp concentration in stage iii could reduce cake layer resistance and weaken the electro naturally condition such processes eventually alleviated the membrane fouling problem in stage iii eps components high molecular weight molecules excreted by the cells were also monitored as another influencing factor affecting the membrane performance fig 6b when the membrane surface was covered with such polymeric substances in which the cells are embedded surface physicochemical characteristics including its hydrophobicity charge and polymeric properties would be significantly changed 39 44 such evolving variations in surface characteristics can in turn have major impacts on membrane performance and thus should be considered to better understand mbr process 44 according to the obtained results by the incorporation of fecl3 considerably lower eps secretion 34 8 9 mg l was recorded in stage ii moreover when the medium was supplemented by oxidant even more eps reduction 10 4 1 05 mg l was observed in stage iii the differences observed among eps concentrations obtained in stage i and stage iii and also stage ii and stage iii were all statistically meaningful p 0 000 this implied that the fecl3 naocl combination could be effectively used to manipulate the secretion of eps in the mixed liquor and consequently alleviate the membrane fouling in mbr systems 3 2 6 zeta potential and particle size surface properties of the sludge particles including zeta potential and particle size can affect the membrane fouling behavior 45 fig 7 a demonstrates the zeta potential and the mean particle size of the mixed liquor during the experiments as shown the zeta potential of sludge flocs in stage ii decreased from 19 8 mv to 14 26 mv in terms of absolute value followed by the addition of fecl3 due to the oxidization of colloidal particles by naocl and neutralizing the particles zeta potential in stage iii the negative zeta potential of particles and colloids was neutralized to a greater extent than that observed in stage ii reducing from 17 mv in the first day to 8 mv on day 10 it has been reported that the sludge oxidation could reduce the zeta potential by altering the flocs properties 46 zeta potential of sludge increased from day 10 to day 26 of stage iii which could be attributed in part to sludge aging and the growth of filamentous bacteria 47 the mean particle size of the mixed liquor for each stage has also depicts in fig 7a as shown after the injection of chemicals the mean size of the flocs was increased over a short period of time in stage ii such prompt increment in the particle size as a result of a green bioflocculant addition has also been reported elsewhere 48 as shown in fig 7a the mean particle size was gradually increased in stage ii which could be resulted from the fecl3 added to the bioreactor the size of flocs in stage iii was statistically smaller than that in stage ii p 0 03 and almost remained similar to that of stage i p 0 31 implying the formation of flocs was not negatively affected by fecl3 naocl in stage iii 3 2 7 svi svi has been widely used to characterize the sludge settleability fig 7b presents the evolving svi values determined over each stage of operation as can be seen svi varied from 200 to 227 mg l in stage i by of the incorporation of flocculants in stage ii a gradual decline in svi profile was observed also a sudden rise in svi recorded at the commencement of stage iii and remained constant to the end of the experiment svi in stage iii was statistically higher than that observed in stage ii p 0 000 and was almost the same as that of stage i p 1 these results implied that the settling properties of sludge were not significantly altered in stage iii 3 3 feasibility of fecl3 naocl addition in synthesized membrane to better assess the feasibility of the introduced strategy a commercial membrane fmbr80 rising sun china was employed under identical operational conditions and the results of the membrane fouling and overall process efficiency were compared to those obtained for the synthesized membranes as confirmed experimentally fig 8 as the rate of tmp increase was slower than that of commercial the value of tmp reached its lowest 70 kpa on the seventh day in the commercial membrane while it took up to 26 days to get to such tmp limit in the synthesized membrane 4 conclusions in this study to alleviate the membrane fouling and improving the performance of the mbr system fecl3 and naocl were used as flocculent and oxidant additives to lower the mixed liquor fouling propensity based on the results of the batch experiments 1 93 mg l fecl3 and 1 71 mg l naocl were determined as optimum concentrations leading to the mlvss mlss ratio cod removal and smp removal of 0 8 90 5 and 18 4 respectively continuous flow experiments were then carried out to monitor the membrane fouling in longer terms using the proposed method according to the obtained results following conclusions could be drawn from this study 1 the introduced combined method revealed good performance in reducing nh3 n concentration suggesting that fecl3 naocl addition had no adverse effect on autotrophic nitrifying bacteria cod effluent was decreased from 87 7 5 5 mg l n 6 in stage i to 85 2 5 mg l n 10 and 31 4 5 4 mg l n 26 in stage ii and stage iii respectively in addition mlss and mlvss mlss ratio was almost remained constant throughout the experiments accordingly it could be inferred that while practically keeping the microbial activity intact the introduced method could be considered to improve mbr effluent quality 2 the addition of fecl3 along with naocl could remarkably lower the rate of cake layer compression thereby increasing the operational time of mbr from 6 and 10 days in stage i and ii to 26 days in stage iii 3 practically similar mixed liquor filterability and consequently svi were achieved when the combination of fecl3 and naocl were employed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments the authors appreciate

14149,the current study reduces the issues caused by petroleum based organic solvents which commonly employed in emulsion liquid membrane elm process the waste cooking oil as a low cost easily available nontoxic organic solvent was used in a green elm gelm process without complicated pretreatment stages methyl violet 2b mv dye was chosen as the sample cationic dye for the study of the ability of waste vegetable oil in water decolorization the proposed gelm included span 80 as the surfactant hydrochloric acid as the internal phase and waste vegetable oil as the diluent initially plackett burman screening design was employed for the determination of important influencing parameters in dye removal by gelm afterward to achieve the optimal process conditions box behnken design was used the optimized factors were span 80 concentration of 3 wt internal phase concentration of 1 43 m mv concentration of 24 59 mg l and organic phase to aqueous phase ratio of 2 07 the maximum achieved mv extraction efficiency was found to be 99 1 under the optimized process conditions and without utilizing the carrier agent also the membrane might be recovered for more than seven times keywords waste cooking oil emulsion liquid membrane dye removal optimization green process 1 introduction water plays an important role in the economic development and social stability of the world water conservation and purification have always been the main goals of world politics 1 on the other hand due to the increasing urbanization and industrialization various industrial wastes such as textile paper and printing contain a variety of organic and inorganic substances that cause water pollution 2 synthetic dyes are one of the most important organic compounds that are often found in the environment due to their widespread use in many industries 3 4 the colored wastewater may be leaked or discharged into the surface and underground water colored sewage prevents sunlight from transmitting through the water which reduces the photosynthesis efficiency of the plants 5 7 among the various dye molecules the cationic dyes are more toxic because they have lower lc50 value 8 therefore in recent years to protect and improve the quality of water the removal of dye from industrial wastewater has become more intensively considered different methods are already available for dye removal from wastewater such as membrane filtration 9 11 coagulation 12 adsorption 13 14 catalytic and photocatalytic degredation of dye 15 ozonation 16 and biological methods 17 although these methods may have relatively high efficiency in eliminating contaminants there is not much emphasis on recovering contaminated pollutants which if possible can usually be carried out using specific reagents in a distinct additional unit resulting in extra cost 18 recently the liquid membranes have attracted great attention because they can be used in removing desired substances via isolation of them in a single phase 19 21 the elm process was used by n li in 1968 for the first time to isolate hydrocarbons 22 the advantages of the elm include simple operation high efficiency removal and retrieval of the desired species in one step as well as high selectivity and high contact surface 23 the elm consists of a receiver phase that is stabilized by the surfactant and dispersed in the membrane phase in the form of fine droplets then the liquid membrane or the water in oil w o emulsion forms very small globules in the feed phase 24 during the extraction process the dye or any desired species for separation is transmitted by the concentration difference from the feed phase to the receiving phase in the process of elm the organic phase acts as a barrier or membrane the most conspicuous problem in the elm process is the instability of the emulsion which occurs due to swelling of droplets and leads to the low efficiency of contaminant extraction 25 26 as the elm main component the diluent organic solvent should exhibit low solubility in the aqueous phase low viscosity non toxicity non corrosive properties low cost and high capacity for separating the desired species 27 the typically utilized organic solvents are often based on petroleum ingredients such as kerosene 28 31 heptane 32 and hexane 33 35 which are usually toxic non degradable flammable and volatile although achievable dye extraction percentage could be high using these solvents they are not environmentally friendly and cannot be decomposed normally 36 therefore in order to prevent environmental risks and also to avoid the possible secondary pollution of the treated water it is essential to develop environmentally sustainable methods the application of green substances like edible oils and biosurfactants for elm process is more valuable compared to the traditional toxic materials 37 39 table 1 summarizes the researches that studied the removal of various organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater by elm using edible oils as diluent in some liquid membrane processes a carrier agent is used to facilitate the transfer of the desired species imposing additional process costs 28 in this regard the purpose of the present research is to treat the colored water with low cost waste cooking oil in the absence of the carrier agent the used vegetable oil is widely produced by restaurants household kitchens and food processing facilities for example mcdonald s malaysia produces about 144 000 kg of vegetable oil waste annually 51 52 applying the waste cooking oil for water treatment via elm process might turn into valuable reuse of this high volume food waste based on the literature the waste cooking oil mainly contain free fatty acids some water mono di and triglycerides as well as sodium boron phosphorus 53 55 to the best of our knowledge the potential of waste cooking oil apart from its including components to be used as a diluent in elm process has not been investigated therefore the most important idea of this research is to employ waste cooking oil as a non toxic inexpensive diluent without the use of carriers and special reactants in a gelm process due to contributing several variables in elm process many studies have applied various experimental design methods including screening of more effective parameters and optimization of them 32 56 57 hence in order to deeply study the process conditions to achieve higher dye removal performance along with reduced costs and shorter treatment time the design of experiments was used and the adequacy of the obtained model was examined as well for this purpose the screening design of plackett burman followed by box behnken design was applied for the determination of main influential factors and their optimum values respectively 2 experimental 2 1 materials the waste cooking oil sunflower oil was obtained from a local restaurant and simply filtered using a fine mesh kitchen sieve a stainless steel sieve with 1 mm mesh size to remove solid impurities hydrochloric acid hcl 37 as the internal phase and span 80 montane 80 as the surfactant were purchased from merck germany methyl violet 2b mv was also supplied by merck all the purchased chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received with no further purification distilled water was used when required during the experiments 2 2 gelm preparation the internal phase solution was prepared using hydrochloric acid at different concentrations in distilled water the liquid membrane phase was prepared by dissolving suitable amount of span 80 and 20 ml of the waste cooking oil in a 100 ml beaker to form the gelm the internal phase solution was added dropwise to the oil with the aid of a burette while stirring at 3000 rpm using a home made magnetic stirrer during 10 min the time for emulsification was selected based on few pre tests and the literature which confirmed 10 min as the adequate time 58 60 a fresh milky emulsion was produced with the explained procedure for each individual experiment 2 3 dye extraction the obtained milky homogeneous emulsion was then slowly dispersed in the 200 ml of dye containing feed solution at the stirring speed of 200 600 rpm sampling was started from the process beginning at the specified time intervals using a disposable syringe and the samples were kept stagnant for 20 min 61 the membrane phase was separated automatically due to the gravity difference and the lighter membrane phase was stand as the upper phase the lower phase clear solution was analyzed for remaining dye as the treated water the determination of dye concentration was carried out using a uv vis spectrophotometer pg instruments uk at 589 nm wavelength as λmax the percentage of extraction stripping efficiency breakage of the emulsion and enrichment were calculated using eqs 1 4 62 1 e x t r a c t i o n c e 0 c e c e 0 100 2 s t r i p p i n g e f f i c i e n c y c i v i c e 0

external phase ci is the final concentration of the internal phase ve0 is the initial volume of the external phase ve is the final volume of the external phase vi is the final volume of the internal phase vei is the volume of the emulsion before the extraction and vef is the volume of the emulsion after the extraction in eq 4 cint is the concentration of mv after the demulsification process 2 4 demulsification and membrane recovery in order to recover and reuse the membrane phase the emulsion and the external phase were separated by gravity and settling the emulsion was transferred to another vessel and mixed at 40 c for 10 min the heat assisted breaking of emulsion was occurred and the broken emulsion was divided into organic solvent oil and the aqueous internal phase the recovered membrane phase was emulsified with the fresh internal phase at the optimized concentration subsequent experiments were performed using the recovered stable emulsion to verify the reusability of reproduced gelm 2 5 experimental design in elm process various parameters affect the removal efficiency of the contaminant that might change in a wide range therefore a design of experiments using minitab 17 3 1was planned to reduce the number of experiments and the costs and to evaluate the adequacy of the model initially plackett burman screening design was performed to screen out the most important parameters and to investigate the effect of the parameter levels the plackett burman method is a practical way to reveal the relative importance of important parameters and their optimum values 63 in the current study six effective parameters for the separation of mv cationic dye by gelm were considered the process variables and their levels are represented in table 2 the bound values for each parameter were selected based on previous study 61 and other similar reports 57 64 in the next step the box behnken design was utilized in order to optimize the selected factors and to achieve the highest percentage of dye extraction by the gelm process the response surface methodology rsm is a suitable statistical method for studying various factors and interactions between them by reducing the number of experiments and providing the least error of the experiments 65 the design of experiments by bbd model with five replications and central points for estimating the coefficients of the response function fit the following second order polynomial model given by eq 4 4 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β i i x i 2 i 1 k j 1 k β i j x i x j e 0 here y is the predicted response are coefficients estimated from regression and x and x are independent variables in coded levels 0 k and e 0 are constant coefficient number of factors independent variables and model error respectively conducting some pre tests it was observed that the extraction equilibrium was established after 5 min fig 1 represents extraction variation trend during the first minutes of contact time all the tests represented the same trend of a significant increasing rate of extraction during the first minute and then reaching to the highest amount within 5 min the extraction remained constant after 5 min therefore 5 min was considered as the extraction equilibrium time in the subsequent experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction mechanism the extraction mechanism of the elm process has been discussed in many studies 25 45 66 the most of elm process have commonly used carrier assisted transportation of the target molecule from external aqueous phase into the internal one the target molecule must be dissolved in membrane organic phase and pass through the membrane to enter into the internal phase a carrier molecule would be responsible for dissolving the target in the membrane phase via reacting with the target 25 however this study optimized the gelm for no carrier agent transportation of cationic dye therefore the dye molecule is dissolved adequately in the oil phase as the membrane body and passes through the membrane via simple transport 67 the vegetable oil efficiency in extracting mv in the liquid liquid extraction process have been verified before 68 the scheme of dye diffusion into the internal phase is depicted in fig 2 in fact mv can be dissolved in oil due to having hydrophobic aromatic rings and diffuse to the membrane to reach the internal aqueous phase containing its counterion cl on the other hand the protons leach out toward the external phase to maintain the solution neutrality 45 66 essentially the triglycerides as the main component of applied cooking oil 69 act as the complexing agent 70 to connect to dye molecules and dissolve them during transferring into the internal aqueous phase 3 2 emulsion stability emulsion stability is a crucial characteristic in the gelm process emulsion breakdown leads to a decrease in the extraction efficiency due to the leakage of the internal phase to the external phase the most important parameters affecting the emulsion stability were investigated these parameters include surfactant concentration emulsification rate and emulsification time it is worth mentioning that the stability experiments were conducted for the optimized gelm introduced in section 3 6 3 2 1 effect of surfactant concentration surfactants are widely used to diminish surface tension between liquids for the manufacture of emulsions in various industries surfactants in the gelm process prevent the release of hcl from the internal phase by forming a thin layer at the interface between the internal and external phases 71 72 in fact surfactant is considered as the most important factor in the membrane phase which motives the formation of water in oil w o emulsions by reducing the surface tension between water and oil as well as enhancing emulsion stability 73 surfactants usually contain amphipathic compounds and are soluble in both water and organic solvents 71 span 80 has been used as a surfactant in many studies proving that it is particularly useful at low concentrations for membrane phase stability and high extraction efficiency 71 fig 3 shows the effect of span 80 concentration on emulsion stability time and breakage rate of gelm as the concentration of span 80 increased from 1 to 3 wt the stability time of the emulsion increased from 74 to 116 min but started to decrease with increasing more than 3 wt at concentrations of span 80 higher than 3 due to the swelling phenomenon the emulsion durability is reduced and also the breakage rate is increased 74 on the other hand at low concentrations of span 80 below 3 the surfactant amount is not enough to efficiently surround the internal phase droplets of the membrane phase and results in low emulsion stability and high breakage rate 3 2 2 effect of emulsification time emulsification time has a direct effect on emulsion stability therefore excessive or short emulsification time commonly have negative effects on emulsion stability when the emulsification time is shorter than the suitable time it forms the large size of the internal droplet that leads to their coalescence while long emulsification time increases the rate of water transfer to the internal phase and swelling and eventually breaking of emulsion globules 73 the results of emulsification time evaluation are presented in fig 4 the emulsion stability increased significantly from 20 to 118 min with increasing emulsification time from 3 to 10 min with a sufficient emulsification time the internal droplets well distribute in the membrane phase to create water in oil emulsion with finer droplets which increases the emulsion stability time and reduced breakage rate 50 beyond 10 min the emulsion stability reduced due to the increase in water transfer to the internal phase which accelerate the emulsion swelling and internal phase outflowing 34 the findings of the present study are in agreement with previous research concluding that emulsification time has an important effect on the emulsion stability and water transportation into the internal phase and there is an optimal value 37 hence for the formation of stable emulsions the emulsification time must be 10 min 3 2 3 effect of emulsification speed the emulsification speed affects both the emulsion stability as well as the amount of target substance transfer to the internal phase in the extraction process 61 in fact homogenization is a method in which the internal phase droplets are well and rapidly inserted into the membrane phase a combination of waste oil and span 80 in general emulsification speed plays an effective role in the distribution and size of internal phase droplets in the membrane phase 73 fig 5 shows the emulsion stability time and emulsion breakage rate from 2200 to 3200 according to fig 5 the stability of the emulsion increases by increasing emulsification speed from 2200 to 3000 times as the shear force applied to the emulsion cells increases which improves the transfer of internal phase droplets to the membrane phase 75 on the other hand because of the decrease in emulsion droplet size the breakage rate is reduced from 2 7 to 0 6 because smaller droplets require longer integration time 73 in addition another study verified the increment of the number of emulsion globules in volume units as the emulsification speed increases 49 however the excessive increase in emulsification speed beyond 3000 rpm increases the coagulation of droplets and the emulsion breakage rate therefore the stirring speed of 3000 rpm was considered for all the experiments 3 3 screening significant factors plackett burman design method offered 12 experiments for mv dye extraction the experimental design matrix along with the dye extraction percentage is presented in table 3 all the experiments were repeated twice and the average extraction efficiency was applied for the data analysis in order to identify the important parameters the pareto chart and the normal plot were considered as shown in fig 6 the concentration of span 80 the concentration of hcl in the internal phase the mv concentration in the feed solution and the o a ratio had the greatest effect on the gelm process also in the normal plot fig 7 the aforementioned factors have the greatest distance from the linear axis which indicates the importance of these factors in general the order of parameters influencing the gelm process can be expressed as follows surfactant concentration hcl concentration mv concentration o a ratio vex vem ratio stirring speed using the main effects plot in fig 8 the level of efficiency of each parameter in the extraction rate of mv by the gelm process can be obtained the span 80 concentration hcl concentration in the internal phase mv concentration and the o a ratio highly affect the rate of extraction the stirring speed and the ratio of the feed phase volume to the emulsion had a negative effect on the extraction rate in fact these factors at the lower level cause an increase in the rate of extraction of the dye by increasing the span 80 concentration from 1 to 7 wt the extraction rate increases at low surfactant concentrations it is not possible to form a stable emulsion because the amount of surfactant is insufficient for surrounding all the internal phase this ultimately causes the emulsion breakage 73 hence increasing the concentration of span 80 has a positive effect on extraction efficiency stirring speed is an important factor in the gelm process the excessive stirring speed at the extraction stage results in the breakdown of emulsion and disturbing the extraction process 64 therefore in order to prevent the breakdown of emulsions and increase the rate of extraction the stirring speed of 200 rpm was considered the ratio of the volume of the feed phase to the emulsion plays a very important role in determining the efficiency and cost of the gelm process for the extraction of dye the less the elm consumed the more economical advantages would be earned lower consumption of elm makes it more beneficial than the liquid liquid extraction process 59 the volume ratio of the feed phase to the emulsion controls the specific mass transfer surface increasing the feed phase volume results in the reduction of the specific mass transfer surface required for dye permeation into the internal phase therefore at the volume ratio equal to 10 extraction efficiency decreased accordingly in the later gelm processes the optimal ratio of the feed phase volume to the emulsion was considered equal to 5 3 4 statistical analysis after determining the highly influential parameters by plackett burman design method four factors i e span 80 concentration internal phase concentration mv concentration and the o a ratio were optimized by bbd model the selected factors and their levels are shown in table 4 table 5 demonstrates the experimental runs for examining dye extraction by the gelm as well as the extraction results for the regression analysis the coefficients of eq 4 were obtained the final form of the second order equation for dye extraction could be presented as follows 5 y 85 2 13 8 x 1 129 57 x 2 26 61 x 3 0 883 x 1 2 38 12 x 2 2 7 170 x 3 2 0 0634 x 4 2 2 123 x 1 x 2 1 213 x 1 x 3 0 2360 x 1 x 4 0 321 x 3 x 4 where y is the removal efficiency percentage of mv by gelm x1 is the span 80 concentration x2 is the hcl concentration in internal phase solution x3 is the mv concentration and x4 is the o a ratio eq 5 is a good visualization of the effects of the important factors and the interaction between them in the response on the other hand the predicted values in eq 5 are consistent with the experimental values as shown in fig 9 the significance and fitness of the model were studied using the analysis of variance anova anova helps to examine the validity of the equation the results of the anova are shown in table 5 the model f value of 127 44 implies the model is significant the p value 0 0001 indicates that there is only a 0 01 chance that such a large f value could be the result of experimental noise this noise is usually considered as an error in experiments and is generally unavoidable values of prob f less than 0 0500 indicate the significance of the model terms therefore in this case x1 x2 x3 x1 2 x2 2 x3 2 x4 2 x1x2 x1x3 x1x4 and x3x4 are significant model terms the p values greater than 0 0100 and the values between 0 0500 and 0 100 indicate the not significant and possibly significant terms of the model respectively indeed the possibly significant factors may become significant when going through the model reduction the lack of fit f value of 5 82 implies the lack of fit is not significant in comparison with the pure error there is a 5 2 chance that this lack of fit f value could occur due to noise in the experiments in order to have the model best fit it is necessary to ensure that the value of lack of fit is non significant the predicted r2 represents the agreement of a response value estimated by the model the difference between adjusted r2 and predicted r2 should always be in the range of 0 0 200 for the model adequacy 28 30 if this is not the case it might be a fault in either the data or the model in the current work the difference is 0 0271 which indicates that both values are reasonably in agreement adequate precision is a measure of the predicted response relative to its associated error in other words a signal to noise ratio a ratio of 4 or more is desirable for the model the ratio of 44 682 indicates an adequate signal the coefficient of variation represents the error expressed for this model as a percentage of the mean based on the anova the data presented were found to be reproducible with less than 5 of standard deviation in the following section the model response is described in the prediction of optimal results for dye removal by the gelm process with the best performance in fig 10 the simultaneous effect of the parameters on the dye extraction shows that excessive increase in concentration of span 80 reduces the extraction efficiency due to an increase in the viscosity of the emulsion 25 the extraction rate increased by increasing hcl concentration from 1 to 1 5 m and then decreased this reduction might be related to the reaction between span 80 and hcl which results in the loss of surfactant properties 61 by increasing the o a ratio from 1 to 2 the extraction rate increased however with an excessive increment of o a ratio the extraction rate diminishes this decrease might be due to an increase in the viscosity of the emulsion and an increase in the size of the internal droplets larger diameter of the droplets reduces the contact surface between the emulsion and the external phase for the dye transfer into the internal phase 3 5 response surface plot and contour plot the response surface represents the interaction between the variables and determines optimal conditions for obtaining the best response for the investigated process in the three dimensional diagrams the effects of two parameters on the extraction percentage were studied while other parameters were adjusted to optimal values the 3d plot in fig 11 shows the interaction between the o a ratio and the span 80 concentration the o a ratio plays an important role in the gelm process the curvature of the lines in this contour plot infers that the interaction between them is significant while organic phase positively affects the stability of the emulsion droplets an excessive increase offers more resistance to the solute transport 64 as observed with increasing the o a ratio from 1 to 2 the extraction rate increases due to the formation of a stable emulsion at a ratio of less than 2 an increase in the hcl concentration leads to an increase in the droplets amount in the internal phase and higher emulsion viscosity 25 61 increasing the diameter of the internal phase droplets reduces the interfacial contact area between the emulsion and the feed phase which reduces the rate of extraction of the dye 35 it has been reported that even a phase inversion might occur when the aqueous phase volume is equal to that of organic phase 35 on the other hand the surfactant concentration affects the extraction efficiency surfactant concentration contributes in making fine droplets of membrane phase under a reasonable o a ratio 30 fig 12 shows the interaction between the concentration of span 80 and the concentration of hcl in the internal phase since contours are parabolic the interaction between them is significant the significance of the interaction can be explained by the reaction between span 80 and hcl which takes place at the inner interface the reaction not only affects the stripping reactions but also the overall extraction efficiency another important interaction between them is the fight for the limiting reagent since span 80 and internal phase are involved in the stability of emulsion and stripping reaction respectively 30 the concentration of surfactant is an important factor affecting the extraction percentage and the stability of the emulsion it can be seen that at the concentration of 3 of span 80 the dye extraction percentage of mv is increased and then decreased by the increment of internal phase concentration the obtained results may be explained by the fact that at 3 concentration the surface tension between the phases was reduced leading to the formation of smaller emulsion droplets and an increase in the mass transfer rate similar results have been reported in the literature 49 on the other hand with an excessive increase in span 80 concentration to more than 3 due to the osmotic pressure difference and increasing viscosity of the emulsion the swelling phenomenon occurs moreover increasing span 80 concentration reduces the transfer of internal phase droplets within the emulsion globule 73 this can be explained by critical micelles concentration cmc concept in which the surfactant aggregates encapsulate some water resulting in instability of emulsion 76 the interaction between the effects of internal phase concentration and o a ratio is shown in fig 13 according to this plot the parabolic curves indicate a maximum dye extraction percentage for the interaction of the studied parameters the plot shows that with increasing both factors up to a certain value the extraction percentage increases dramatically and afterward the percentage of dye extraction tends to decline the interaction between the internal phase concentration and the o a ratio can be explained by the fact that the stripping efficiency directly depends on the internal phase concentration and the excessive increase of the internal phase volume in the o a ratio causes emulsion breakage and water transfer from the external phase to the internal phase based on fig 13 an increasing in the concentration of the internal phase from 1 to 1 5 m enhances the extraction rate at hcl concentrations higher than 1 5 m additional hcl causes swelling of the emulsion and instability of the liquid membrane system which ultimately reduces the extraction efficiency this may be due to the reaction between hcl and span 80 which results in the loss of the properties of the surfactant and the breakdown of the emulsion 35 it was found that span 80 can undergo hydrolysis reaction in acidic media which results in decomposition of it 77 therefore the internal phase concentration and o a ratio are very important parameters in the gelm process fig 14 shows the interaction between mv and span 80 concentrations it is observed that increasing the dye concentration in the feed phase elevates the extraction efficiency this may be due to the fact that with increasing the initial dye concentration the driving force which is the concentration gradient for dye transfer into the internal phase enhances 78 at the lower concentrations of mv dye 15 mg l the swelling of globules occurs and the extraction efficiency reduces this phenomenon which takes place due to the osmotic pressure difference between the external phase and the internal phase leads to the water passage from the external phase to the internal phase 26 3 6 process optimization in order to determine the performance of the prepared gelm statistical optimization of all influential parameters was performed using the design of the experiments fig 15 shows that by setting the span 80 concentration the internal phase concentration the mv concentration and the o a ratio at 3 wt 1 43 m 24 59 mg l and 2 07 respectively the efficiency of the extraction by the prepared gelm can gain to 99 25 to approve this result the dye removal experiment was carried out in these conditions the results showed that working at the optimum values of the parameters aims 99 1 dye separation from water by the prepared waste oil based gelm accordingly the model results are significant with a residual standard error of 1 18 and well suited to the practical results table 6 3 7 effect of stripping agent concentration in order to investigate the stripping efficiency i e emulsion breakage and enrichment of mv the internal phase concentration was studied within the range of 1 2 m of hydrochloric acid and the results are given in fig 16 and table 7 according to previous studies the strength of the stripping phase affects the permeability of the solute in the gelm process at low concentrations of hcl below 1 43 m the removal of mv is insignificant due to the cloudiness of the stripping solution after the process this may be because the amount of the stripping agent is inadequate to strip out mv into the stripping phase 56 the stripping efficiency and enrichment factor of mv increase with increasing hydrochloric acid concentration up to 1 43 m and reach 92 13 and 7 4 respectively on the contrary emulsion breakage decreases from 10 to 5 this could be attributed to the higher concentration of the stripping agent that tends to increase the concentration gradient between the external and internal phase resulting in inducing the mv transportation from the external phase into the internal phase upon further increases in internal phase concentration the stripping efficiency and enrichment factor decreased while the emulsion breakage increased which could be attributed to membrane swelling and consequent breakage therefore 1 43 m was found to be the best concentration of a hydrochloric acid solution as the stripping agent offering high efficiency of stripping and enrichment of mv with the lowest percentage of breakage 4 membrane recovery test in order to recover and reuse the membrane phase the emulsion and the external phase were separated by gravity and settling the emulsion was transferred to another vessel and mixed at 40 c for 10 min the broken emulsion was divided into membrane and internal phase the recovered membrane phase was emulsified with the fresh internal phase concentration of 1 43 m subsequent experiments were performed using the recovered stable emulsion phase as shown in fig 17 the percentage of color extraction did not decrease significantly even after 7 tests during using the recovered membrane the emulsion was stable and swelling was not observed 5 conclusion in this study the feasibility of using untreated waste cooking oil as a low cost green organic solvent in gelm process was evaluated for removing a cationic dye from aqueous solution in order to determine the optimal conditions for dye extraction the rsm methodology was employed by the combination of box behnken and plackett burman design four effective factors on the efficiency of prepared gelm i e the span 80 concentration internal phase concentration mv concentration and o a ratio were investigated employing box behnken design the optimization of the chosen factors was eventuated as span 80 concentration of 3 wt internal phase concentration of 1 43 m mv concentration of 24 59 mg l and o a ratio of 2 07 the maximum achieved mv extraction efficiency was found to be 99 1 with enrichment factor of 7 4 under the optimized process conditions and without utilizing the carrier agent the results of membrane recovery verified the reusability of membrane even after seven times of usage recovery cycles generally it could be concluded that the waste cooking oil can be brought up as a treating material for separation of contaminants via gelm process without complicated oil treatment stage considering the economic point of view developing a water treatment method based on a largely produced food waste with lower environmental risks can be strongly noteworthy to be deeply attended the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests declaration of competing interests the authors

14149,the current study reduces the issues caused by petroleum based organic solvents which commonly employed in emulsion liquid membrane elm process the waste cooking oil as a low cost easily available nontoxic organic solvent was used in a green elm gelm process without complicated pretreatment stages methyl violet 2b mv dye was chosen as the sample cationic dye for the study of the ability of waste vegetable oil in water decolorization the proposed gelm included span 80 as the surfactant hydrochloric acid as the internal phase and waste vegetable oil as the diluent initially plackett burman screening design was employed for the determination of important influencing parameters in dye removal by gelm afterward to achieve the optimal process conditions box behnken design was used the optimized factors were span 80 concentration of 3 wt internal phase concentration of 1 43 m mv concentration of 24 59 mg l and organic phase to aqueous phase ratio of 2 07 the maximum achieved mv extraction efficiency was found to be 99 1 under the optimized process conditions and without utilizing the carrier agent also the membrane might be recovered for more than seven times keywords waste cooking oil emulsion liquid membrane dye removal optimization green process 1 introduction water plays an important role in the economic development and social stability of the world water conservation and purification have always been the main goals of world politics 1 on the other hand due to the increasing urbanization and industrialization various industrial wastes such as textile paper and printing contain a variety of organic and inorganic substances that cause water pollution 2 synthetic dyes are one of the most important organic compounds that are often found in the environment due to their widespread use in many industries 3 4 the colored wastewater may be leaked or discharged into the surface and underground water colored sewage prevents sunlight from transmitting through the water which reduces the photosynthesis efficiency of the plants 5 7 among the various dye molecules the cationic dyes are more toxic because they have lower lc50 value 8 therefore in recent years to protect and improve the quality of water the removal of dye from industrial wastewater has become more intensively considered different methods are already available for dye removal from wastewater such as membrane filtration 9 11 coagulation 12 adsorption 13 14 catalytic and photocatalytic degredation of dye 15 ozonation 16 and biological methods 17 although these methods may have relatively high efficiency in eliminating contaminants there is not much emphasis on recovering contaminated pollutants which if possible can usually be carried out using specific reagents in a distinct additional unit resulting in extra cost 18 recently the liquid membranes have attracted great attention because they can be used in removing desired substances via isolation of them in a single phase 19 21 the elm process was used by n li in 1968 for the first time to isolate hydrocarbons 22 the advantages of the elm include simple operation high efficiency removal and retrieval of the desired species in one step as well as high selectivity and high contact surface 23 the elm consists of a receiver phase that is stabilized by the surfactant and dispersed in the membrane phase in the form of fine droplets then the liquid membrane or the water in oil w o emulsion forms very small globules in the feed phase 24 during the extraction process the dye or any desired species for separation is transmitted by the concentration difference from the feed phase to the receiving phase in the process of elm the organic phase acts as a barrier or membrane the most conspicuous problem in the elm process is the instability of the emulsion which occurs due to swelling of droplets and leads to the low efficiency of contaminant extraction 25 26 as the elm main component the diluent organic solvent should exhibit low solubility in the aqueous phase low viscosity non toxicity non corrosive properties low cost and high capacity for separating the desired species 27 the typically utilized organic solvents are often based on petroleum ingredients such as kerosene 28 31 heptane 32 and hexane 33 35 which are usually toxic non degradable flammable and volatile although achievable dye extraction percentage could be high using these solvents they are not environmentally friendly and cannot be decomposed normally 36 therefore in order to prevent environmental risks and also to avoid the possible secondary pollution of the treated water it is essential to develop environmentally sustainable methods the application of green substances like edible oils and biosurfactants for elm process is more valuable compared to the traditional toxic materials 37 39 table 1 summarizes the researches that studied the removal of various organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater by elm using edible oils as diluent in some liquid membrane processes a carrier agent is used to facilitate the transfer of the desired species imposing additional process costs 28 in this regard the purpose of the present research is to treat the colored water with low cost waste cooking oil in the absence of the carrier agent the used vegetable oil is widely produced by restaurants household kitchens and food processing facilities for example mcdonald s malaysia produces about 144 000 kg of vegetable oil waste annually 51 52 applying the waste cooking oil for water treatment via elm process might turn into valuable reuse of this high volume food waste based on the literature the waste cooking oil mainly contain free fatty acids some water mono di and triglycerides as well as sodium boron phosphorus 53 55 to the best of our knowledge the potential of waste cooking oil apart from its including components to be used as a diluent in elm process has not been investigated therefore the most important idea of this research is to employ waste cooking oil as a non toxic inexpensive diluent without the use of carriers and special reactants in a gelm process due to contributing several variables in elm process many studies have applied various experimental design methods including screening of more effective parameters and optimization of them 32 56 57 hence in order to deeply study the process conditions to achieve higher dye removal performance along with reduced costs and shorter treatment time the design of experiments was used and the adequacy of the obtained model was examined as well for this purpose the screening design of plackett burman followed by box behnken design was applied for the determination of main influential factors and their optimum values respectively 2 experimental 2 1 materials the waste cooking oil sunflower oil was obtained from a local restaurant and simply filtered using a fine mesh kitchen sieve a stainless steel sieve with 1 mm mesh size to remove solid impurities hydrochloric acid hcl 37 as the internal phase and span 80 montane 80 as the surfactant were purchased from merck germany methyl violet 2b mv was also supplied by merck all the purchased chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received with no further purification distilled water was used when required during the experiments 2 2 gelm preparation the internal phase solution was prepared using hydrochloric acid at different concentrations in distilled water the liquid membrane phase was prepared by dissolving suitable amount of span 80 and 20 ml of the waste cooking oil in a 100 ml beaker to form the gelm the internal phase solution was added dropwise to the oil with the aid of a burette while stirring at 3000 rpm using a home made magnetic stirrer during 10 min the time for emulsification was selected based on few pre tests and the literature which confirmed 10 min as the adequate time 58 60 a fresh milky emulsion was produced with the explained procedure for each individual experiment 2 3 dye extraction the obtained milky homogeneous emulsion was then slowly dispersed in the 200 ml of dye containing feed solution at the stirring speed of 200 600 rpm sampling was started from the process beginning at the specified time intervals using a disposable syringe and the samples were kept stagnant for 20 min 61 the membrane phase was separated automatically due to the gravity difference and the lighter membrane phase was stand as the upper phase the lower phase clear solution was analyzed for remaining dye as the treated water the determination of dye concentration was carried out using a uv vis spectrophotometer pg instruments uk at 589 nm wavelength as λmax the percentage of extraction stripping efficiency breakage of the emulsion and enrichment were calculated using eqs 1 4 62 1 e x t r a c t i o n c e 0 c e c e 0 100 2 s t r i p p i n g e f f i c i e n c y c i v i c e 0

external phase ci is the final concentration of the internal phase ve0 is the initial volume of the external phase ve is the final volume of the external phase vi is the final volume of the internal phase vei is the volume of the emulsion before the extraction and vef is the volume of the emulsion after the extraction in eq 4 cint is the concentration of mv after the demulsification process 2 4 demulsification and membrane recovery in order to recover and reuse the membrane phase the emulsion and the external phase were separated by gravity and settling the emulsion was transferred to another vessel and mixed at 40 c for 10 min the heat assisted breaking of emulsion was occurred and the broken emulsion was divided into organic solvent oil and the aqueous internal phase the recovered membrane phase was emulsified with the fresh internal phase at the optimized concentration subsequent experiments were performed using the recovered stable emulsion to verify the reusability of reproduced gelm 2 5 experimental design in elm process various parameters affect the removal efficiency of the contaminant that might change in a wide range therefore a design of experiments using minitab 17 3 1was planned to reduce the number of experiments and the costs and to evaluate the adequacy of the model initially plackett burman screening design was performed to screen out the most important parameters and to investigate the effect of the parameter levels the plackett burman method is a practical way to reveal the relative importance of important parameters and their optimum values 63 in the current study six effective parameters for the separation of mv cationic dye by gelm were considered the process variables and their levels are represented in table 2 the bound values for each parameter were selected based on previous study 61 and other similar reports 57 64 in the next step the box behnken design was utilized in order to optimize the selected factors and to achieve the highest percentage of dye extraction by the gelm process the response surface methodology rsm is a suitable statistical method for studying various factors and interactions between them by reducing the number of experiments and providing the least error of the experiments 65 the design of experiments by bbd model with five replications and central points for estimating the coefficients of the response function fit the following second order polynomial model given by eq 4 4 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β i i x i 2 i 1 k j 1 k β i j x i x j e 0 here y is the predicted response are coefficients estimated from regression and x and x are independent variables in coded levels 0 k and e 0 are constant coefficient number of factors independent variables and model error respectively conducting some pre tests it was observed that the extraction equilibrium was established after 5 min fig 1 represents extraction variation trend during the first minutes of contact time all the tests represented the same trend of a significant increasing rate of extraction during the first minute and then reaching to the highest amount within 5 min the extraction remained constant after 5 min therefore 5 min was considered as the extraction equilibrium time in the subsequent experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction mechanism the extraction mechanism of the elm process has been discussed in many studies 25 45 66 the most of elm process have commonly used carrier assisted transportation of the target molecule from external aqueous phase into the internal one the target molecule must be dissolved in membrane organic phase and pass through the membrane to enter into the internal phase a carrier molecule would be responsible for dissolving the target in the membrane phase via reacting with the target 25 however this study optimized the gelm for no carrier agent transportation of cationic dye therefore the dye molecule is dissolved adequately in the oil phase as the membrane body and passes through the membrane via simple transport 67 the vegetable oil efficiency in extracting mv in the liquid liquid extraction process have been verified before 68 the scheme of dye diffusion into the internal phase is depicted in fig 2 in fact mv can be dissolved in oil due to having hydrophobic aromatic rings and diffuse to the membrane to reach the internal aqueous phase containing its counterion cl on the other hand the protons leach out toward the external phase to maintain the solution neutrality 45 66 essentially the triglycerides as the main component of applied cooking oil 69 act as the complexing agent 70 to connect to dye molecules and dissolve them during transferring into the internal aqueous phase 3 2 emulsion stability emulsion stability is a crucial characteristic in the gelm process emulsion breakdown leads to a decrease in the extraction efficiency due to the leakage of the internal phase to the external phase the most important parameters affecting the emulsion stability were investigated these parameters include surfactant concentration emulsification rate and emulsification time it is worth mentioning that the stability experiments were conducted for the optimized gelm introduced in section 3 6 3 2 1 effect of surfactant concentration surfactants are widely used to diminish surface tension between liquids for the manufacture of emulsions in various industries surfactants in the gelm process prevent the release of hcl from the internal phase by forming a thin layer at the interface between the internal and external phases 71 72 in fact surfactant is considered as the most important factor in the membrane phase which motives the formation of water in oil w o emulsions by reducing the surface tension between water and oil as well as enhancing emulsion stability 73 surfactants usually contain amphipathic compounds and are soluble in both water and organic solvents 71 span 80 has been used as a surfactant in many studies proving that it is particularly useful at low concentrations for membrane phase stability and high extraction efficiency 71 fig 3 shows the effect of span 80 concentration on emulsion stability time and breakage rate of gelm as the concentration of span 80 increased from 1 to 3 wt the stability time of the emulsion increased from 74 to 116 min but started to decrease with increasing more than 3 wt at concentrations of span 80 higher than 3 due to the swelling phenomenon the emulsion durability is reduced and also the breakage rate is increased 74 on the other hand at low concentrations of span 80 below 3 the surfactant amount is not enough to efficiently surround the internal phase droplets of the membrane phase and results in low emulsion stability and high breakage rate 3 2 2 effect of emulsification time emulsification time has a direct effect on emulsion stability therefore excessive or short emulsification time commonly have negative effects on emulsion stability when the emulsification time is shorter than the suitable time it forms the large size of the internal droplet that leads to their coalescence while long emulsification time increases the rate of water transfer to the internal phase and swelling and eventually breaking of emulsion globules 73 the results of emulsification time evaluation are presented in fig 4 the emulsion stability increased significantly from 20 to 118 min with increasing emulsification time from 3 to 10 min with a sufficient emulsification time the internal droplets well distribute in the membrane phase to create water in oil emulsion with finer droplets which increases the emulsion stability time and reduced breakage rate 50 beyond 10 min the emulsion stability reduced due to the increase in water transfer to the internal phase which accelerate the emulsion swelling and internal phase outflowing 34 the findings of the present study are in agreement with previous research concluding that emulsification time has an important effect on the emulsion stability and water transportation into the internal phase and there is an optimal value 37 hence for the formation of stable emulsions the emulsification time must be 10 min 3 2 3 effect of emulsification speed the emulsification speed affects both the emulsion stability as well as the amount of target substance transfer to the internal phase in the extraction process 61 in fact homogenization is a method in which the internal phase droplets are well and rapidly inserted into the membrane phase a combination of waste oil and span 80 in general emulsification speed plays an effective role in the distribution and size of internal phase droplets in the membrane phase 73 fig 5 shows the emulsion stability time and emulsion breakage rate from 2200 to 3200 according to fig 5 the stability of the emulsion increases by increasing emulsification speed from 2200 to 3000 times as the shear force applied to the emulsion cells increases which improves the transfer of internal phase droplets to the membrane phase 75 on the other hand because of the decrease in emulsion droplet size the breakage rate is reduced from 2 7 to 0 6 because smaller droplets require longer integration time 73 in addition another study verified the increment of the number of emulsion globules in volume units as the emulsification speed increases 49 however the excessive increase in emulsification speed beyond 3000 rpm increases the coagulation of droplets and the emulsion breakage rate therefore the stirring speed of 3000 rpm was considered for all the experiments 3 3 screening significant factors plackett burman design method offered 12 experiments for mv dye extraction the experimental design matrix along with the dye extraction percentage is presented in table 3 all the experiments were repeated twice and the average extraction efficiency was applied for the data analysis in order to identify the important parameters the pareto chart and the normal plot were considered as shown in fig 6 the concentration of span 80 the concentration of hcl in the internal phase the mv concentration in the feed solution and the o a ratio had the greatest effect on the gelm process also in the normal plot fig 7 the aforementioned factors have the greatest distance from the linear axis which indicates the importance of these factors in general the order of parameters influencing the gelm process can be expressed as follows surfactant concentration hcl concentration mv concentration o a ratio vex vem ratio stirring speed using the main effects plot in fig 8 the level of efficiency of each parameter in the extraction rate of mv by the gelm process can be obtained the span 80 concentration hcl concentration in the internal phase mv concentration and the o a ratio highly affect the rate of extraction the stirring speed and the ratio of the feed phase volume to the emulsion had a negative effect on the extraction rate in fact these factors at the lower level cause an increase in the rate of extraction of the dye by increasing the span 80 concentration from 1 to 7 wt the extraction rate increases at low surfactant concentrations it is not possible to form a stable emulsion because the amount of surfactant is insufficient for surrounding all the internal phase this ultimately causes the emulsion breakage 73 hence increasing the concentration of span 80 has a positive effect on extraction efficiency stirring speed is an important factor in the gelm process the excessive stirring speed at the extraction stage results in the breakdown of emulsion and disturbing the extraction process 64 therefore in order to prevent the breakdown of emulsions and increase the rate of extraction the stirring speed of 200 rpm was considered the ratio of the volume of the feed phase to the emulsion plays a very important role in determining the efficiency and cost of the gelm process for the extraction of dye the less the elm consumed the more economical advantages would be earned lower consumption of elm makes it more beneficial than the liquid liquid extraction process 59 the volume ratio of the feed phase to the emulsion controls the specific mass transfer surface increasing the feed phase volume results in the reduction of the specific mass transfer surface required for dye permeation into the internal phase therefore at the volume ratio equal to 10 extraction efficiency decreased accordingly in the later gelm processes the optimal ratio of the feed phase volume to the emulsion was considered equal to 5 3 4 statistical analysis after determining the highly influential parameters by plackett burman design method four factors i e span 80 concentration internal phase concentration mv concentration and the o a ratio were optimized by bbd model the selected factors and their levels are shown in table 4 table 5 demonstrates the experimental runs for examining dye extraction by the gelm as well as the extraction results for the regression analysis the coefficients of eq 4 were obtained the final form of the second order equation for dye extraction could be presented as follows 5 y 85 2 13 8 x 1 129 57 x 2 26 61 x 3 0 883 x 1 2 38 12 x 2 2 7 170 x 3 2 0 0634 x 4 2 2 123 x 1 x 2 1 213 x 1 x 3 0 2360 x 1 x 4 0 321 x 3 x 4 where y is the removal efficiency percentage of mv by gelm x1 is the span 80 concentration x2 is the hcl concentration in internal phase solution x3 is the mv concentration and x4 is the o a ratio eq 5 is a good visualization of the effects of the important factors and the interaction between them in the response on the other hand the predicted values in eq 5 are consistent with the experimental values as shown in fig 9 the significance and fitness of the model were studied using the analysis of variance anova anova helps to examine the validity of the equation the results of the anova are shown in table 5 the model f value of 127 44 implies the model is significant the p value 0 0001 indicates that there is only a 0 01 chance that such a large f value could be the result of experimental noise this noise is usually considered as an error in experiments and is generally unavoidable values of prob f less than 0 0500 indicate the significance of the model terms therefore in this case x1 x2 x3 x1 2 x2 2 x3 2 x4 2 x1x2 x1x3 x1x4 and x3x4 are significant model terms the p values greater than 0 0100 and the values between 0 0500 and 0 100 indicate the not significant and possibly significant terms of the model respectively indeed the possibly significant factors may become significant when going through the model reduction the lack of fit f value of 5 82 implies the lack of fit is not significant in comparison with the pure error there is a 5 2 chance that this lack of fit f value could occur due to noise in the experiments in order to have the model best fit it is necessary to ensure that the value of lack of fit is non significant the predicted r2 represents the agreement of a response value estimated by the model the difference between adjusted r2 and predicted r2 should always be in the range of 0 0 200 for the model adequacy 28 30 if this is not the case it might be a fault in either the data or the model in the current work the difference is 0 0271 which indicates that both values are reasonably in agreement adequate precision is a measure of the predicted response relative to its associated error in other words a signal to noise ratio a ratio of 4 or more is desirable for the model the ratio of 44 682 indicates an adequate signal the coefficient of variation represents the error expressed for this model as a percentage of the mean based on the anova the data presented were found to be reproducible with less than 5 of standard deviation in the following section the model response is described in the prediction of optimal results for dye removal by the gelm process with the best performance in fig 10 the simultaneous effect of the parameters on the dye extraction shows that excessive increase in concentration of span 80 reduces the extraction efficiency due to an increase in the viscosity of the emulsion 25 the extraction rate increased by increasing hcl concentration from 1 to 1 5 m and then decreased this reduction might be related to the reaction between span 80 and hcl which results in the loss of surfactant properties 61 by increasing the o a ratio from 1 to 2 the extraction rate increased however with an excessive increment of o a ratio the extraction rate diminishes this decrease might be due to an increase in the viscosity of the emulsion and an increase in the size of the internal droplets larger diameter of the droplets reduces the contact surface between the emulsion and the external phase for the dye transfer into the internal phase 3 5 response surface plot and contour plot the response surface represents the interaction between the variables and determines optimal conditions for obtaining the best response for the investigated process in the three dimensional diagrams the effects of two parameters on the extraction percentage were studied while other parameters were adjusted to optimal values the 3d plot in fig 11 shows the interaction between the o a ratio and the span 80 concentration the o a ratio plays an important role in the gelm process the curvature of the lines in this contour plot infers that the interaction between them is significant while organic phase positively affects the stability of the emulsion droplets an excessive increase offers more resistance to the solute transport 64 as observed with increasing the o a ratio from 1 to 2 the extraction rate increases due to the formation of a stable emulsion at a ratio of less than 2 an increase in the hcl concentration leads to an increase in the droplets amount in the internal phase and higher emulsion viscosity 25 61 increasing the diameter of the internal phase droplets reduces the interfacial contact area between the emulsion and the feed phase which reduces the rate of extraction of the dye 35 it has been reported that even a phase inversion might occur when the aqueous phase volume is equal to that of organic phase 35 on the other hand the surfactant concentration affects the extraction efficiency surfactant concentration contributes in making fine droplets of membrane phase under a reasonable o a ratio 30 fig 12 shows the interaction between the concentration of span 80 and the concentration of hcl in the internal phase since contours are parabolic the interaction between them is significant the significance of the interaction can be explained by the reaction between span 80 and hcl which takes place at the inner interface the reaction not only affects the stripping reactions but also the overall extraction efficiency another important interaction between them is the fight for the limiting reagent since span 80 and internal phase are involved in the stability of emulsion and stripping reaction respectively 30 the concentration of surfactant is an important factor affecting the extraction percentage and the stability of the emulsion it can be seen that at the concentration of 3 of span 80 the dye extraction percentage of mv is increased and then decreased by the increment of internal phase concentration the obtained results may be explained by the fact that at 3 concentration the surface tension between the phases was reduced leading to the formation of smaller emulsion droplets and an increase in the mass transfer rate similar results have been reported in the literature 49 on the other hand with an excessive increase in span 80 concentration to more than 3 due to the osmotic pressure difference and increasing viscosity of the emulsion the swelling phenomenon occurs moreover increasing span 80 concentration reduces the transfer of internal phase droplets within the emulsion globule 73 this can be explained by critical micelles concentration cmc concept in which the surfactant aggregates encapsulate some water resulting in instability of emulsion 76 the interaction between the effects of internal phase concentration and o a ratio is shown in fig 13 according to this plot the parabolic curves indicate a maximum dye extraction percentage for the interaction of the studied parameters the plot shows that with increasing both factors up to a certain value the extraction percentage increases dramatically and afterward the percentage of dye extraction tends to decline the interaction between the internal phase concentration and the o a ratio can be explained by the fact that the stripping efficiency directly depends on the internal phase concentration and the excessive increase of the internal phase volume in the o a ratio causes emulsion breakage and water transfer from the external phase to the internal phase based on fig 13 an increasing in the concentration of the internal phase from 1 to 1 5 m enhances the extraction rate at hcl concentrations higher than 1 5 m additional hcl causes swelling of the emulsion and instability of the liquid membrane system which ultimately reduces the extraction efficiency this may be due to the reaction between hcl and span 80 which results in the loss of the properties of the surfactant and the breakdown of the emulsion 35 it was found that span 80 can undergo hydrolysis reaction in acidic media which results in decomposition of it 77 therefore the internal phase concentration and o a ratio are very important parameters in the gelm process fig 14 shows the interaction between mv and span 80 concentrations it is observed that increasing the dye concentration in the feed phase elevates the extraction efficiency this may be due to the fact that with increasing the initial dye concentration the driving force which is the concentration gradient for dye transfer into the internal phase enhances 78 at the lower concentrations of mv dye 15 mg l the swelling of globules occurs and the extraction efficiency reduces this phenomenon which takes place due to the osmotic pressure difference between the external phase and the internal phase leads to the water passage from the external phase to the internal phase 26 3 6 process optimization in order to determine the performance of the prepared gelm statistical optimization of all influential parameters was performed using the design of the experiments fig 15 shows that by setting the span 80 concentration the internal phase concentration the mv concentration and the o a ratio at 3 wt 1 43 m 24 59 mg l and 2 07 respectively the efficiency of the extraction by the prepared gelm can gain to 99 25 to approve this result the dye removal experiment was carried out in these conditions the results showed that working at the optimum values of the parameters aims 99 1 dye separation from water by the prepared waste oil based gelm accordingly the model results are significant with a residual standard error of 1 18 and well suited to the practical results table 6 3 7 effect of stripping agent concentration in order to investigate the stripping efficiency i e emulsion breakage and enrichment of mv the internal phase concentration was studied within the range of 1 2 m of hydrochloric acid and the results are given in fig 16 and table 7 according to previous studies the strength of the stripping phase affects the permeability of the solute in the gelm process at low concentrations of hcl below 1 43 m the removal of mv is insignificant due to the cloudiness of the stripping solution after the process this may be because the amount of the stripping agent is inadequate to strip out mv into the stripping phase 56 the stripping efficiency and enrichment factor of mv increase with increasing hydrochloric acid concentration up to 1 43 m and reach 92 13 and 7 4 respectively on the contrary emulsion breakage decreases from 10 to 5 this could be attributed to the higher concentration of the stripping agent that tends to increase the concentration gradient between the external and internal phase resulting in inducing the mv transportation from the external phase into the internal phase upon further increases in internal phase concentration the stripping efficiency and enrichment factor decreased while the emulsion breakage increased which could be attributed to membrane swelling and consequent breakage therefore 1 43 m was found to be the best concentration of a hydrochloric acid solution as the stripping agent offering high efficiency of stripping and enrichment of mv with the lowest percentage of breakage 4 membrane recovery test in order to recover and reuse the membrane phase the emulsion and the external phase were separated by gravity and settling the emulsion was transferred to another vessel and mixed at 40 c for 10 min the broken emulsion was divided into membrane and internal phase the recovered membrane phase was emulsified with the fresh internal phase concentration of 1 43 m subsequent experiments were performed using the recovered stable emulsion phase as shown in fig 17 the percentage of color extraction did not decrease significantly even after 7 tests during using the recovered membrane the emulsion was stable and swelling was not observed 5 conclusion in this study the feasibility of using untreated waste cooking oil as a low cost green organic solvent in gelm process was evaluated for removing a cationic dye from aqueous solution in order to determine the optimal conditions for dye extraction the rsm methodology was employed by the combination of box behnken and plackett burman design four effective factors on the efficiency of prepared gelm i e the span 80 concentration internal phase concentration mv concentration and o a ratio were investigated employing box behnken design the optimization of the chosen factors was eventuated as span 80 concentration of 3 wt internal phase concentration of 1 43 m mv concentration of 24 59 mg l and o a ratio of 2 07 the maximum achieved mv extraction efficiency was found to be 99 1 with enrichment factor of 7 4 under the optimized process conditions and without utilizing the carrier agent the results of membrane recovery verified the reusability of membrane even after seven times of usage recovery cycles generally it could be concluded that the waste cooking oil can be brought up as a treating material for separation of contaminants via gelm process without complicated oil treatment stage considering the economic point of view developing a water treatment method based on a largely produced food waste with lower environmental risks can be strongly noteworthy to be
