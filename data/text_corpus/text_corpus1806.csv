9030,over irrigation to ensure high crop yields in north china plain ncp has led to a sharp groundwater table decline over the past decades we conducted a scenario analysis from1980 to 2017 with 12 irrigation strategies from t1w0m0 to t12w3m2 t is treatment and numbers of irrigation times in wheat w and maize m seasons 75 mm each for the dominant winter wheat summer maize rotation using the soil water atmosphere plant swap model in the ncp after model calibration and validation with 4 year experimental data we analyzed the long term simulated annual crop yield actual evapotranspiration et a water productivity wp groundwater table change and economic benefit to the different irrigation practices the optimized irrigation strategy is based on an integral analysis for different precipitation year types results showed that annual yield and wp increased with increased irrigation until these reached a plateau treatment t4w2m1 was the turning point with an annual yield of 15335 kg ha 1 significantly higher than t2w1m1 26 and t1w0m0 63 but not significantly different from 4 to 5 irrigations in wet and normal years et a increased with increased irrigation from 456 to 644 mm yr 1 the annual wp followed a similar trend as annual crop yield for all irrigation schedules t4w2m1 had an annual wp of 2 47 kg cm 3 significantly higher by 15 than t2w1m1 and 24 higher than t1w0m0 with no significant difference seen with 4 5 irrigations the rainfed treatment mitigated groundwater table decline the best even reversing the trend during the past four decades to 0 11 m yr 1 rise this was followed by two irrigation treatments 0 30 m yr 1 three irrigations 0 55 m yr 1 four irrigations 0 72 m yr 1 and five irrigations 0 86 m yr 1 the latter corresponds to typical farmer practice using the productivity indicators including irrigation wp marginal benefit and economic index t4w2m1 showed the best performance therefore we recommend t4w2m1 two irrigations at pre wintering and jointing stages for wheat and one irrigation at maize sowing stage as the best irrigation strategy for the wheat maize rotation to mitigate groundwater table decline and sustain grain yields and water productivity in the ncp another anthesis irrigation for winter wheat is recommended during extreme dry years to sustain grain yield keywords irrigation regime historical scenarios water productivity groundwater table change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the next few decades growers must find ways to increase crop production in order to meet the rising demands of a growing world population davis et al 2017 irrigation is crucial for increasing crop production and reducing the drought effect which is responsible for production losses of 34 for wheat and 22 for maize wang et al 2021a unfortunately excessive irrigation using groundwater reserves has caused severe groundwater table depletion as well as other environmental problems in aquifers chen et al 2010 the irrigation induced overexploitation of groundwater resources is likely to intensify in the years to come schwartz et al 2020 thus investigation of more sustainable irrigation strategies is urgently needed wheat and maize production in the north china plain ncp accounted for 57 of the national wheat production and 35 of the national maize production national bureau of statistics of china 2020 agricultural water use accounted for 62 of the region s total water usage china water resources bulletin 2019 the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system has been the dominant cropping system in this region since 1980 the annual precipitation averages 667 mm which does not meet the water needs of the wheat maize rotation of 700 1000 mm liu et al 2001 between 100 and 300 mm of this water deficit occurring during the annual wheat season is usually supplemented by groundwater cao et al 2014 local farmers usually applied 3 5 irrigation supplements in the winter wheat season sun et al 2022 which has resulted in a sharp 1 m decline in the groundwater table annually in this region yang et al 2022 surpassing india and the us high plains huang et al 2014 optimal irrigation strategies benefit water productivity wp mitigate groundwater table decline and improve the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change mo et al 2017 previous studies were conducted on exploring optimized irrigation strategies for winter wheat and summer maize based on field experiments fang et al 2007 qiu et al 2008 li et al 2010 sun et al 2019a thapa et al 2019 xu et

irrigation pre wintering and at jointing stage for winter wheat w and 75 mm time irrigation at summer maize m sowing stage contributed most to mitigating groundwater decline maintain grain production and improve wp for the wheat maize rotation sun et al 2019a revealed the significance of the disposable pre sowing irrigation in wheat w0m1 as it increased wp and helped to maintain a high yield for wheat maize rotation in the ncp during a 4 year field experiment as compared to the two irrigations for wheat w2m1 field experiments are effective methods to study the response of yield and wp of crops however field experiments are time consuming costly and difficult to maintain over sufficient long timelines that include representative weather years mancosu al 2016 zhao et al 2020a agricultural system models have been developed as tools to simulate crop responses to water stress and extend the results of field experiments to different soil types management practices and climate change for example decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat ceres wheat attia et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 soil water atmosphere plant swap van dam et al 2008 li and ren 2019 wang et al

schedules of wheat maize rotation on groundwater reserves and crop production was reported in historical scenarios created by the apsim model sun et al 2015 2019b implying that even the minimum irrigation strategy one irrigation for each crop also resulted in groundwater table decline zhao et al 2020a discovered that one or two irrigations treatments of 75 150 mm were suitable for winter wheat production in wuqiao county in the ncp from 1981 to 2015 using the aquacrop model with the same model zhang et al 2022 recommended first applying 90 mm of irrigation during the wintering stage and a second irrigation during the wheat jointing stage with 0 30 and 60 mm in the wet normal and dry years respectively for winter wheat from 1961 to 2020 in the guanzhong plain the swap model is a deterministic agro hydrological model based on hydrological chemical and biological processes the swap model and its embedded detailed crop module derived from the world food study wofost model are designed to simulate soil water movement solute transport and heat transfer in the vadose in close interaction with crop growth boogaard et al 1998 kroes et al 2009 the swap wofost model has been used to assess the impact of different irrigation schedules on crop yield et and wp to derive practical and optimal irrigation scenarios for better crop water management de jong van lier et al 2015 stahn et al 2017 li and ren 2019 hu et al 2019 da silva et al 2020 wang et al 2021b irmak and kamble 2009 used the swap model to optimize the yield and wp of wheat in an on demand irrigation management system in india rallo et al 2012 verified that the swap model was a good tool for the precise simulation of et in wine grapes under different irrigation schedules in italy using the swap model martínez ferri et al 2013 found that irrigation requirements for citrus crops would increase between 6 and 16 for selected emission scenarios for the 2050 s and 2080 s in southern spain in the north china plain he et al 2011 analyzed five irrigation times for winter wheat and one irrigation application for summer maize in a median weather year using the swap model the net irrigation amount under the optimal irrigation scheduling for wheat maize rotation was reduced by 51 25 and 77 compared to the reference practices at the luancheng tongzhou and yucheng sites respectively in the ncp ma et al 2015a 2015b using the distributed swap wofost model in ncp li and ren 2019 reported that adopting an optimized irrigation scheme with a threshold of 60 could reduce deep groundwater exploitation by 6 05 108 m3 but has as consequence a winter wheat yield reduction of 50 however the previous studies mainly focused on individual crops like winter wheat there is a lack of long term series analysis on the optimized irrigation schedule for the entire winter wheat summer maize rotation the gap in grain yield wp and groundwater table change under different irrigation schedules has not been explicitly addressed in the previous studies for the integral winter wheat summer maize rotation for a long historical series furthermore the optimized irrigation schedule for the cropping system was not determined at different precipitation type years it is imperative to identify the trade offs between food production and groundwater use for the dominant wheat maize rotation therefore after calibrating and validating the swap wofost model the objectives of this study are to 1 reveal the response and the gap in the annual yield water consumption wp and economic output of the whole wheat maize rotation to different irrigation schedules under different precipitation type years between 1980 and 2017 2 recommend the optimized irrigation schedule for wheat maize rotation under different precipitation type years understanding the whole year s irrigation schedule for the wheat maize rotation could provide a useful basis for improving groundwater irrigation management and water use efficiency in the ncp and other water stressed agricultural regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the luancheng agro ecosystem station 37 50 n 114 40 e altitude 50 m located in luancheng county hebei province in the ncp fig 1 it is in a warm temperate zone with a semi humid monsoon climate the annual average precipitation during the period of 1980 2017 was 520 mm with large yearly fluctuations and an uneven seasonal distribution and with 60 70 of the yearly precipitation occurring from june to september the annual mean air temperature is 14 4 c max t of 19 5 c and min t of 9 3 c and the frost free period is about 200 days the soil texture at the experiment site is sandy loam in the surface soil layer at 0 40 cm depth light loam from 40 to 160 cm and sandy clay below 160 cm depth winter wheat summer maize rotation is the dominant cropping system in this region the soil profile properties are given in table s1 2 2 swap wofost model description swap is a one dimensional model for the vertical direction to simulate water solute and heat in saturated and unsaturated soil with vegetation development kroes et al 2017 the generic crop growth module wofost van ittersum et al 2003 is used to simulate crop growth as affected by weather and soil moisture the penman monteith equation is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration of uniform surfaces including wet and dry vegetation and bare soil swap employs the richards equation including root water extraction to simulate soil moisture movement in variably saturated soils for the bottom boundary condition we employed free drainage in this study as the groundwater occurs at about 40 m below the soil surface swap is open source and freely available online the model has been used in numerous agrohydrological studies around the globe 2 3 swap wofost model calibration and validation a field experiment using different irrigation schedules for wheat maize rotation was conducted at luancheng experiment station as described in detail by yang et al 2022 we used the 2010 2011 field experiment dataset to calibrate the model and the 2012 2013 field data for validation winter wheat was planted from about the 14th to the 19th of october and harvested between the 10th and the 17th of june summer maize was sown at around 18th 24th of june and harvested at the end of september the leaf area index lai was measured weekly after the reviving stage using the sunscan canopy analysis system delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the canopy cover was calculated from the lai using an empirical equation provided by nielsen et al 2012 the aboveground biomass agb was measured after lai measurements and the dry matter was determined by drying about 15 plants at 75 for 72 h grain was harvested at full maturity within a 1 m2 area and the yield was collected by threshing and air drying to a constant weight soil volumetric moisture content 2 m profile was regularly measured with a neutron probe l520 at 20 cm increments every ten days during the wheat and maize growing seasons the daily actual evapotranspiration et a values for winter wheat and summer maize were collected by a lysimeter at the same field experiment site the irrigation practices during calibration years were 3 irrigations 80 60 60 mm for wheat and two irrigations 70 60 mm for maize in 2010 and 4 irrigations 70 60 60 60 mm for wheat and two irrigations 70 60 mm for maize in 2011 for validation years two irrigations 80 60 mm were applied in each wheat season and one irrigation for 70 mm 60 mm in each maize season to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation results for et a and crop production we used the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae according to the following equations 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 3 m a e 1 n i 1 n s i o i where o i and s i are the i th observed and simulated values o and s are the average of the observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of data pairs the regression coefficient r2 is dimensionless acceptable and good results for crop models are r2 0 60 and r2 0 80 respectively both rmse and mae have the same unit as the considered quantity while mae is the arithmetic average of the deviations rmse is a weighted average of the deviations with a higher weight to the larger deviations acceptable and good results for crop models are rmse and mae values smaller than 50 and 20 of the mean value respectively pasquel et al 2022 2 4 classification of precipitation year types the meteorological dataset of luancheng site from 1980 to 2017 was collected from china meteorological science sharing service network https data cma cn the daily meteorological data included solar radiation maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature saturated vapor pressure wind speed air humidity and precipitation the wet normal and dry years according to the annual precipitation from 1980 2017 were determined by drought index d i xu et al 2020 calculated as follows 4 d i p m σ where p is the annual precipitation mm m is the average annual precipitation over the period 1979 2017 mm and σ is the standard error mm wet years were distinguished when di 0 70 normal years when 0 70 di 0 70 and dry years when di 0 70 there were 10 years defined as wet years with an average annual precipitation of 720 135 mm 18 years defined as normal years with average annual precipitation of 501 59 mm and 10 years defined as dry years with average annual precipitation of 365 41 mm fig 2 2 5 swap wofost model for the evaluation of different irrigation strategies the calibrated and validated swap wofost model was used to investigate changes in yield potential water productivity and groundwater table decline of winter wheat summer maize rotation under different irrigation scenarios from 1980 to 2017 we set up five categories including 12 different irrigation schedules for the whole wheat maize rotation the categories included rainfed two irrigations three irrigations four irrigations and five irrigations based on local farmers practice 75 mm irrigation per time table 1 the farmer practice t12w3m2 is the control critical water requirement stages for winter wheat include pre wintering jointing and anthesis and for summer maize include sowing and milking stages there were five three irrigations treatments from t3 to t7 and four treatments for four irrigations from t8 to t11 with different irrigation times at different crop growth stages 2 6 evaluation calculations 1 productivity indices water productivity wp was calculated as follows 5 w p y e t a where wp is water productivity for grain yield of one crop or one given cropping system kg m 3 y is total annual grain yield kg ha 1 of one crop or one given cropping system and et a is the corresponding actual evapotranspiration over the crop growing season mm calculated from the swap model irrigation water productivity iwp and marginal benefit were calculated as follows sun et al 2015 6 i w p y i r r y r a inf e d i 7 marginalbenefit δ y δ e t a y i r r y r a inf e d e t i r r e t r a inf e d where iwp is irrigation water productivity for grain yield of one crop or one given cropping system kg m 3 y and yrainfed are total grain yield of one crop or one cropping system with and without irrigation kg ha 1 respectively i is the irrigation amount mm the grain yield of t1w0m0 was considered as yrainfed marginal benefit is the yield increment corresponding to increasing et a economic output and economic output water use efficiency ewue were calculated as follows 8 economicoutput i y ield i price i c p i i c p i 1980 9 e w u e 1 n economicoutput 1 n e t a where economic output is the crop within year yield multiplied by its corresponding price for the indicated year minus crop production costs yuan ha 1 i is one given year and cpi is the national consumer price index since the simulation started in the year 1980 we assumed the cpi in 1980 as the baseline 2 groundwater table changes inferred by net groundwater depletion the net groundwater depletion nwd mm yr 1 was defined as the difference between groundwater recharge and irrigation yang et al 2022 10 nwd r i where r is the deep groundwater recharge mm yr 1 calculated by the swap model and i is irrigation amount mm yr 1 when nwd is negative deep groundwater recharge irrigation and groundwater is depleted when nwd is positive groundwater recharge irrigation and groundwater table rises the groundwater table recharge for each year is calculated as the percolation rate at 2 m soil depth and includes a time lag to reach the groundwater free drainage was adopted in the swap model in this study which means that water percolates at the bottom of the 2 m soil profile according to unit hydraulic gradient and then eventually recharges the groundwater the groundwater table was observed to respond to annual precipitation changes with a one year time lag because of the groundwater table s cumulative drop to about 40 m below the surface the effect is spread over two years when considering the overall historical behaviour of precipitation and the groundwater table data yang et al 2015 therefore the groundwater table changes due to the withdrawal of irrigation water for winter wheat and summer maize can be simply calculated as follows 11 δ h n w d η where δh is the groundwater table change m yr 1 of wheat maize rotation and nwd is the net groundwater use mm yr 1 calculated as recharge by deep percolation minus the irrigation amount pumped from the groundwater and η is the specific yield set to 0 2 yang et al 2015 2021 2022 2 7 statistical analysis statistical methods including analysis of variance anova regression analysis correlation analysis and generalized linear models were carried out by spss version 21 statistical product and service solutions the differences were considered significant at p 0 05 the entropy topsis a technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution described in wang et al 2023 was adopted for the comprehensive evaluation by multiple indexes to select the optimized irrigation strategy in the different precipitation year types 3 results 3 1 swap model calibration and validation assessment the performance of the model was assessed by comparing the simulated and observed lai agb et a and yield of winter wheat and summer maize in the calibration fig 3a c e g and validation period fig 3b d f h the graphs show that swap captures the dynamics of observed evapotranspiration and crop growth given the large number of soil and crop parameters involved in the simulation and the accuracy of their measurements deviations between model results and measurements are inevitable the numerical deviation assessment is shown in table s2 the calibrated soil and crop parameters are shown in table s3 during the calibration period the values of r2 rmse and mae of winter wheat lai were 0 80 1 1 and 0 81 respectively for an observed mean value of 2 06 for summer maize lai the values of r2 rmse and mae were 0 84 0 94 and 0 67 respectively for an observed mean value of 2 06 in the validation period wheat and maize lai simulation performed equivalently to the calibration based on r2 0 83 and 0 82 respectively rmse 0 96 and 0 87 and mae 0 70 and 0 67 the deviations of agb of winter wheat during the calibration period were 0 90 for r2 2269 kg ha 1 for rmse and 1435 kg ha 1 for mae for the observed mean value of 5746 kg ha 1 it showed a well consistent match between simulated and observed values for winter wheat summer maize agb simulation also performed well for r2 0 97 rmse 952 kg ha 1 and mae 651 kg ha 1 during the calibration period for the mean value of 5771 kg ha 1 in the validation period wheat agb deviations were 0 96 for r2 1178 kg ha 1 for rmse and 694 kg ha 1 for mae and maize deviations were 0 95 1728 kg ha 1 and 1234 kg ha 1 respectively these degrees of agreement demonstrate that the model performed well in simulating the dynamics of the growth and development of winter wheat and summer maize a good consistency was also achieved in the et a of winter wheat during the calibration 2010 and 2011 and validation period 2012 and 2013 r2 0 90 and 0 88 rmse 15 and 17 mm month 1 and mae 11 and 12 mm month 1 respectively as compared with observed calibration and validation period means of 45 and 40 mm month 1 for summer maize the simulated et a also was satisfactory with statistical deviations of r2 0 85 and 0 81 rmse 17 and 30 mm month 1 and mae 13 and 26 mm month 1 respectively for observed means of 70 and 94 mm month 1 the statistical indicators showed that crop yield simulations were good in the calibration and validation periods for winter wheat observed mean 6096 and 6360 kg ha 1 rmse 932 and 709 kg ha 1 mae 881 and 709 kg ha 1 for maize observed mean 7391 and 8998 kg ha 1 rmse 752 and 1335 kg ha 1 with mae 728 and 1064 kg ha 1 overall the calibration and validation results revealed that the swap model performed well to simulate crop growth and water flow in the experimental area 3 2 annual total yield of wheat maize rotation under different irrigation schedules considering all the simulated years 1980 2017 the annual total yield of winter wheat summer maize rotation in the t1w0m0 treatment was the lowest 9390 kg ha 1 significantly lower than those supplied with irrigation p 0 05 fig 4a the annual total yield increased as the irrigation input increased to a point after that no significant extra yield occurred the t10w3m1 treatment obtained the highest annual total yield of 16559 kg ha 1 and there was no significant difference from t11w3m1 and t12w3m2 farmer practice the t2w1m1 increased the annual total yield by 29 compared to the rainfed condition yield from t3w1m2 with an annual total yield of 12676 kg ha 1 was not significantly more than t2w1m1 implying that adding another irrigation to maize during the late growth period did not contribute to a substantial yield increment the annual total yield of wheat maize rotation with three irrigations w2m1 from t4 to t7 averaged 14753 kg ha 1 significantly higher than rainfed 57 and t2w1m1 21 among the three irrigations treatments t4w2m1 with two irrigations at pre wintering and jointing stages for wheat and one irrigation at maize sowing stage resulted in the highest yield with 15335 kg ha 1 wheat 7365 kg ha 1 and maize 7970 kg ha 1 figs s1 2 t4w2m1 was not significantly higher than t5w2m1 or t6w2m1 but significantly greater than t7w2m1 which revealed that one irrigation at the jointing stage for wheat and one irrigation at the maize sowing stage are essential preconditions for good yield formations fig 4a the average annual total yield of wheat maize rotation under four irrigations from t8 to t11 was 15837 kg ha 1 significantly greater 69 than the rainfed condition 30 greater than two irrigations and 11 greater than three irrigations fig 4a by comparing t8 and t9 for w2m2 with irrigations at different wheat stages across all the years we reinforced that irrigation at wheat jointing stage was indispensable for wheat dry matter accumulation to grain yield by comparing t10 and t11 for w3m1 with irrigation at different maize growth stages it was evident that irrigation at the maize sowing stage created a proper soil water condition for maize emergence and to form a good population canopy structure for greater grain yield all results demonstrated that an extra irrigation application played a more significant role in wheat yield than in maize figs s1 2 in short the yield gap was obviously narrowed by adding a suitable irrigation supplement the annual yields in the wet years were obviously higher than those in normal and dry years fig 4b in wet years the annual yield ranged from 11876 kg ha 1 rainfed to 17094 kg ha 1 t10w3m1 t4w2m1 is the turning point with 16454 kg ha 1 no significant differences were found between t4w2m1 and t12w3m2 during the wet years in the normal years t4w2m1 was still the turning point for the annual yield without significant differences until t10w3m1 t7w2m1 with the second irrigation at the anthesis stage instead of the jointing stage for winter wheat and one irrigation at the large trumpet stage instead of pre sowing for summer maize showed the lowest annual yield among the group from t4w2m1 through t12w3m2 in the dry years irrigation had a larger effect on the annual yield than in wet and normal years the annual yield in t4w2m1 was significantly higher than the yield with low and no irrigation 10 lower than t10w3m1 and 5 lower than t8w2m2 respectively fig 4b this revealed that in dry years adding the third irrigation at wheat anthesis or adding the second irrigation at the silk stage of maize could guarantee a better annual grain yield the annual total yield gap of wheat maize rotation was about 29 from rainfed t1w0m0 to two irrigations t2w1m1 then 26 from two irrigations t2w1m1 to three irrigations t4w2m1 and then only 8 from three irrigations t4w2m1 to four irrigations t10w3m1 fig 4c the relationship shown in fig 4d demonstrates that the annual yield increases with irrigation increase and also shows the diminishing return of additional irrigation 3 3 annual et a of wheat maize rotation under different irrigation schedules the average annual et a of winter wheat summer maize rotation under 12 irrigation schedules ranged from 456 mm to 644 mm the annual et a increased when irrigation increased schedule t2w1m1 by adding one irrigation before wheat wintering and one irrigation at maize sowing significantly increased the total annual et a by 21 compared to the rainfed condition the annual et a of three irrigation treatments was 591 mm significantly higher 7 than t2w1m1 the annual et a of four irrigation treatments was 623 mm 5 higher than three irrigation treatments the t12w3m2 farmer practice had the highest annual et a of 644 mm with five irrigations per year which was 3 higher than that of four irrigation treatments 9 higher than 3 irrigation treatments 17 higher than two irrigation treatments and 41 higher than the rainfed condition fig 5a in wet years the annual total et a ranged from 505 mm to 642 mm with no significant differences between t4w2m1 and t12w3m2 with the average annual et a of three irrigation treatments measuring 601 mm four irrigation treatments with et a of 621 mm fig 5b in the normal years the annual total et a ranged from 449 mm to 643 mm the annual et a significantly increased by about 34 mm from three irrigations to four irrigations fig 5c in the dry years the annual total et a ranged from 420 mm to 646 mm there was a significant increase of about 41 mm from three irrigations to four irrigations fig 5d 3 4 annual water productivity of wheat maize rotation under different irrigation schedules the average annual water productivity wp of winter wheat summer maize rotation showed a similar trend as the annual yield ranging from 2 0 kg m 3 to 2 56 kg m 3 across all the years the rainfed treatment had the lowest wp of 2 0 kg m 3 due to a 43 loss in yield similarly t10w3m1 had the greatest annual wp of 2 56 kg m 3due to the highest annual yield t2w1m1 by adding one irrigation at the pre wintering stage for wheat and one irrigation at the maize sowing stage significantly increased wp by 8 compared to the rainfed treatment when adding another irrigation of 75 mm at the large trumpet stage for maize based on w1m1 the annual wp did not significantly increase implying that irrigation at the sowing stage is much more important to yield formation and water use efficiency improvement the average annual wp of 3 irrigations for w2m1 was 2 42 kg m 3 which significantly increased by 13 and 22 compared to t2w1m1 and rainfed respectively the average annual wp of w2m2 with t8 and t9 was 2 44 kg m 3 and no significant increase was seen from three irrigation treatments this result verified that adding another irrigation at the large trumpet stage for maize compared to the sowing stage did not play a significant role in wp increase the average annual wp did not increase with the irrigation input from t10w3m1 through t12w3m2 fig 6a the annual wp of winter wheat summer maize rotation in the wet years were higher than those of normal and dry years fig 6b in the wet years the annual wp ranged from 2 34 to 2 71 kg m 3 t4w2m1 was the turning point there was no significant difference between t1w0m0 and t3w1m2 with an average value of 2 37 kg m 3 no significant difference was found between t4w2m1 and t12w3m2 with an average value of 2 63 kg m 3 similarly in the normal years the annual wp ranged from 2 01 to 2 55 kg m 3 no significant difference was seen between t1w0m0 and t3w1m2 with an average value of 2 10 kg m 3 also no significant difference was found between t4w2m1 and t12w3m2 with an average value of 2 45 kg m 3 in the dry years the annual wp ranged from 1 78 to 2 61 kg m 3 the wp for rainfed strategy was 1 78 kg m 3 significantly increasing to an average of 2 15 kg m 3 for t2w1m1 and t3w1m2 and then significantly increasing to an average of 2 50 kg m 3 from t4w2m1 to t12w3m2 fig 6b in short the gap of wp in the wheat maize rotation was about 8 from rainfed t1w0m0 to two irrigations t2w1m1 14 from two irrigations t2w1m1 to three irrigations t4w2m1 and then only 3 from three irrigations t4w2m1 to four irrigations t10w3m1 fig 6c the relationship between the annual wp and the total irrigation shows that wp initially increased with the increased irrigation and then stabilized fig 6d 3 5 groundwater table change inferred from net groundwater use the groundwater table declined more with the increased irrigation input for the winter wheat summer maize rotation fig 7 in this study the rainfed condition without irrigation t1w0m0 did show a groundwater table rise the cumulative groundwater table change of the rainfed condition was positive 4 1 m from 1980 to 2017 with an average groundwater table rise rate of 0 11 m yr 1 the cumulative groundwater table in all irrigation treatments decreased among the irrigation treatments t2w1m1 had the smallest decline in the groundwater table with a cumulative drop of 11 5 m averaging 0 30 m yr 1 it was followed by t3w1m2 with a cumulative groundwater table decline of 17 0 m averaging 0 45 m yr 1 the average cumulative groundwater table decline in three irrigations w2m1 from t4 through t7 was 20 7 m during the 38 years averaging 0 55 m yr 1 the cumulative groundwater table decline for four irrigations from t8 through t11 was 27 4 m during the 38 years averaging 0 72 m yr 1 the observed groundwater table line overlapped with four and five irrigations t10w3m1 to t12w3m2 with an annual average decline rate of 0 92 m yr 1 the farmer practice of t12w3m2 using 375 mm of irrigation per year had the highest cumulative groundwater table decline of 32 6 m averaging 0 86 m yr 1 this commonly used irrigation practice for winter wheat summer maize rotation was the reason why the groundwater table has persistently declined over the past 40 years the groundwater table decline could be mitigated with fewer irrigation inputs thus this was also the crucial motivator to optimize the irrigation schedule for the whole winter wheat summer maize system 3 6 economic benefit and system efficiency assessment of wheat maize rotation under different irrigation schedules schedule t4w2m1 had the highest annual iwp of 2 64 kg m 3 for the whole winter wheat summer maize rotation during the period between 1980 and 2017 significantly higher by 39 compared to t12w3m2 farmer practices with the same irrigation amount totaling 225 mm per year under three irrigations the irrigation treatments from t5w2m1 through t7w2m1 changed the irrigation time for wheat and maize and their average annual iwp decreased by 13 as compared to t4w2m1 t10w3m1 had the next best iwp of 2 39 kg m 3 closely followed by t11w3m1 with 2 31 kg m 3 the treatments including two irrigations for maize did not have a better iwp t3w1m2 had the lowest iwp of 1 46 kg m 3 and then t8w2m2 and t9w2m2 and t12w3m2 with an average iwp of 1 95 kg m 3 the two irrigations treatment t2w1m1 had an annual iwp of 1 84 kg m 3 30 lower than t4w2m1 but not significant different from t12w3m2 fig 8a marginal benefit denotes the net et a efficiency t4w2m1 was the turning point fig 8b for the first group t2w1m1 and t3w1m2 had the lowest marginal benefit of 3 05 and 2 93 kg m 3 respectively there were no significant differences in the second group from t4 through t7 where measurements ranged from 3 99 to 4 31 kg m 3 average 4 12 kg m 3 which was almost the same in the treatments with four irrigation times fig 8b the economic output and ewue followed a similar trend as the marginal benefit t4w2m1 was also the turning point with an economic output of 10 114 yuan ha 1 and an ewue of 1 65 kg m 3 which is significantly higher than the rainfed condition t2w1m1 and t3w1m2 there were no significant differences in strategies t4w2m1 through t12w3m2 the economic output and ewue of t4w2m1 were lower than t12w3m2 only by 11 and 6 respectively the rainfed condition had the lowest economic output and ewue significantly lower than the irrigation treatments and about 77 and 72 lower than t12w3m2 respectively fig 8c d therefore t4w2m1 is recommended as the most beneficial irrigation strategy for the entire wheat maize rotation when considering multiple indexes including annual yield et a wp economic benefit rotation efficiency and groundwater table decline if preventing yield decline is essential adding another irrigation at the anthesis for winter wheat is desirable in the dry years according to schedule t10w3m1 table s4 4 discussion 4 1 yield eta water productivity and harvest index of winter wheat under different irrigation regimes one irrigation supplement significantly improved the yield of winter wheat by 80 compared to the rainfed condition two irrigations at pre wintering and jointing stages for winter wheat significantly increased the yield 58 as compared to one single irrigation time averaged 4568 kg ha 1 adding the third irrigation at the anthesis stage increased the wheat yield by 19 but showed no significant yield improvement compared to two and three irrigations in this study fig s1 this demonstrated that two irrigations were suitable enough for winter wheat to produce a high yield irrigation times are just as important as irrigation amounts in this study different irrigation combinations with different irrigation times and quotas were considered we found that adding the second irrigation at the jointing stage improved the wheat yield by 13 compared to irrigation at anthesis by comparing t4w2m1 to t9w2m2 fig s1 this revealed that under deficit irrigation jointing irrigation provided the critical water required for sufficient wheat vegetative growth which forms the basis for yield formation this was consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2017 reported that the largest wheat yield increment was from rainfed to one irrigation and that irrigation at the jointing stage significantly improved the wheat yield yang et al 2022 reported that adding another irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat increased yield by 24 compared to one irrigation at pre wintering stage based on a 16 year field experiment while adding another two irrigations at the jointing and booting stages only increased yield by 10 accompanying an increase in et a with no increase in wp the wheat jointing irrigation was critical for determining grain numbers per area and sink capacity of winter wheat for a higher yield and wp compared to traditional practices madani et al 2010 lv et al 2011 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 reported that irrigation at the jointing stage was the most effective time for stem extension and photosynthesis for winter wheat to increase yield and wp we found that the t4w2m1 treatment significantly increased the harvest index hi of winter wheat in this study fig s1 this is consistent with the previous studies villegas et al 2001 zeng et al 2021 their studies revealed that two irrigations at the earlier growth stages pre wintering and jointing stages were beneficial for managing the pre anthesis biomass and translocation after anthesis irrigation at the jointing stage resulted in an increase of co2 in the flag leaves increased the availability of the carbon source for photosynthesis and reduced the limitation of stomatal photosynthesis resulting in the increase in the net photosynthetic rate during the flowering stage ma et al 2015a 2015b fan et al 2019 dong et al 2014 also reported that irrigation at the jointing stage increased the chlorophyll content index in the flag leaves during the late growth stage delayed the degradation of flag leaf chlorophyll further prolonged the ageing period of wheat and produced more photosynthetic products for increasing the grain yield also the irrigation at the jointing stage contributed to the crop s antioxidant ability before the flowering stage and promoted nutrient transformation after anthesis mu et al 2021 based on the precipitation distribution and soil moisture condition two irrigations at pre wintering and jointing stages were recommended for winter wheat in this study no irrigation at the wheat sowing stage was pursued by local farmers the irrigation before wintering was added to supplement the soil water from sowing to jointing which lasts about five months into the dry season supplemental irrigation from recovery to jointing supplied more soil water before anthesis to accelerate root growth and stimulate grain filling in addition dry hot winds at the end of the wheat growing season may and june can very rapidly dehydrate wheat accelerate maturity decrease the grain filling rate reduce grain weights and hi as well as further reduce any positive effect that anthesis irrigation had on grain yield excessive rainfall and soil moisture and high air temperature after anthesis affected the micro environment of the canopy leading to a lower flag leaf chlorophyll content in the late grain filling stage and premature leaf senescence which decreased dry matter at maturity and finally resulted in lower grain yield wang et al 2013 li et al 2018 xu et al 2016 reported that a single irrigation at the jointing stage increased the soil reservoir capacity such that it could store more accessible rainwater in the soil during the rainy summer season and further increase annual soil water use xue et al 2010 reported that drought during the late growth stage of winter wheat promoted primary root deep root growth into the deep soil profile to facilitate absorption and use of deep soil moisture when the early season precipitation was low shifting the irrigation to an earlier time ensures meeting pre anthesis water requirements which help to increase wp and maintain a high yield zeng et al 2021 in the current study the yield of winter wheat was highly affected by precipitation in the rainfed growth condition with high yields in wet years a 46 decrease in normal years and a 51 decrease in dry years the et a of winter wheat increased from no irrigation to three irrigations in wet normal and dry years it also followed precipitation with high values in wet years and low values in dry years the wp of winter wheat across different precipitation type years had a substantial improvement when irrigation was added from a rainfed strategy average 1 07 kg m 3 to one irrigation 1 54 kg m 3 and to two irrigations 2 12 kg m 3 and with no significant increase seen from two irrigations to three irrigations 2 34 kg m 3 in this study the increased wp and relatively higher yield under the limited irrigation conditions could be attributed to a deeper root system and an appropriate wheat canopy xu et al 2016 the optimal wheat canopy could improve the photosynthetic efficiency of leaf and non leaf organs by distributing radiation well from top to bottom gago et al 2014 the water loss through stomata was reduced with reduced irrigation and the wp of winter wheat increased significantly mantovani et al 2014 in addition the dry matter of leaves under deficit irrigation might be used to construct guard cells and increase the density and thickness of leaf cells leading to higher stomatal resistance and reducing the transpiration rate which increased the final wp by reducing total water evapotranspiration zhao et al 2020a 2020b in this study rainfed maize had a yield of 6850 kg ha 1 one irrigation of 75 mm at the sowing stage significantly improved the maize yield by 17 compared to rainfed cultivation one irrigation at the large trumpet stage did not show the expected increase in maize yield only 8 higher than in rainfed conditions fig s2 the maize yield did not significantly increase with two irrigations in this study this demonstrated that one irrigation at the maize sowing stage is crucial for a good grain yield and wp the available soil moisture was very low after the winter wheat harvest because winter wheat can fully take up soil water under limited irrigation due to its deep rooting system which can reach up to 2 m zhang et al 2009 li et al 2016 sufficient soil moisture at the maize sowing stage promoted germination seedling emergence and root growth feng et al 2018 reducing water consumption during the earlier growth stages of maize was important for prolonging the soil water availability for crop growth from the irrigation at maize sowing stage fang et al 2021 especially from sowing to the seven leaf stage maize mainly depends on the soil water for crop growth due to the low rainfall amounts in the dry season lu et al 2017 the sowing irrigation was important for maize seedling growth and therefore helped to determine the crop productivity capacity sun et al 2014 song and jin 2020 reported that water stress during the maize seedling stage damaged the photosynthetic membrane and reduced the chlorophyll content in the leaf essentially reducing the grain yield the maize yield with one irrigation at the large trumpet stage was 7 lower than with one irrigation at the sowing stage in this study a previous study indicated that water deficits during the reproductive stage resulted in more yield reduction than a deficit during the vegetative stage and the 1000 kernel weight was more sensitive to limited irrigation martínez ferri et al 2013 pre sowing irrigation significantly influenced the kernel number per row total spike number and 1000 kernel weight thus collectively increasing grain yield yan et al 2017 in this study et a increased significantly from rainfed to one irrigation no significant differences were found in et a between the irrigation treatments t2 through t12 also there were no significant differences in wp of summer maize between treatments t1 through t12 in this study this verified that the sowing irrigation and rainfall during the growth season were sufficient for maize production in the ncp however the rainfall and its distribution during the maize growing season affected crop production under a limited water supply li et al 2019 omoyo et al 2015 reported that the trend in future rainfall change would negatively influence maize yield at deficit irrigation it is beneficial to estimate the effect of expected climate change on maize yield and wp in the future meanwhile it is very important to better understand the influence of soil moisture on summer maize after previous winter wheat harvesting and how rainfall distribution at the vegetative and reproductive stages of summer maize will be affected in the follow up studies therefore the optimized irrigation schedule should consider the soil water carryover between the previous crop and the successive crop as well as the irrigation retention effect and the rainfall distribution in the whole winter wheat summer maize rotation system it is also necessary to take measures to conserve the soil water after the single irrigation at the maize sowing stage to prolong its availability to the crop by incorporating such things as drought resistant varieties of maize tokatlidis et al 2011 straw mulching rashid et al 2019 optimized plant population fang et al 2021 and drip irrigation plus fertigation tian et al 2017 4 3 optimized irrigation scheduling for winter wheat summer maize rotation the annual average yield of winter wheat summer maize rotation ranged from 9390 to 16559 kg ha 1 under 12 irrigation scenarios t4w2m1 significantly increased the annual yield by 26 and 63 as compared to t2w1m1 and t1w0m0 and was only 7 lower than the largest yield from treatment t10w3m1 across all the tested years in addition there were no significant differences in annual yield between t4w2m1 and t10w3m1 in wet and normal years the annual yields of t4w2m1 and t10w3m1 were significantly lower in dry years by 9 this was consistent with previous field experiments feng et al 2018 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2019a yang et al 2022 limited irrigation during the winter wheat growth period led to earlier maturity and provided benefits to the subsequent summer maize earlier maturity of wheat could leave time for early sown maize to utilize more solar radiation and thermal resources to promote grain filling and grain weight and improve the final grain yield the improved maize performance can compensate for the yield loss of wheat wang et al 2018 irrigation limitation at the later stage of wheat could keep the soil dry during its harvest stage which provided space to store more rainfall for later maize and reduce the deep percolation during the following rainy season wang et al 2006 sun et al 2019a t4w2m1 also was the turning point for wp economic benefit and system efficiency and there were no significant differences of these indices between t4w2m1 and t10w3m1 in any of the three precipitation type years therefore during wet years and normal years t4w2m1 are the best irrigation regime to enhance wp without sacrificing yield in dry years adding the third irrigation at wheat anthesis such as t10w3m1 is beneficial for obtaining a better annual grain yield in this study irrigation treatments did all show a cumulative drop of the groundwater table only the rainfed treatment was simulated to let the groundwater table slowly recover this was consistent with previous studies the rainfed condition of winter wheat summer maize rotation showed a neutral groundwater table in the integrated data analysis carried out over the ncp from 1990 to 2009 yang et al 2021 and a simulation based on a 16 year field experiment yang et al 2022 the rainfed wheat maize rotation was reported to yield a groundwater increase of 0 05 m yr 1 from 1982 to 2013 according to the apsim model sun et al 2019b and an increase of 0 30 0 40 m yr 1 according to another apsim study representing the period from 1961 to 2011 van oort et al 2016 the simulated groundwater table decline caused by farmer irrigation practice t12w3m2 for the wheat maize rotation amounted 0 86 m yr 1 which is close to the observed 0 92 m yr 1 yang et al 2021 and somewhat lower than previous modelling results of 1 13 to 1 60 m yr 1 chen et al 2010 kendy et al 2004 ma et al 2015b van oort et al 2016 sun et al 2019b differences in decline are attributed to different simulation periods and different locales in the ncp as well as whether the recharge time lag effect was considered or not t4 mitigated the groundwater table decline by 44 as compared to four or five irrigations therefore we believe that the t4w2m1 had the most beneficial irrigation schedule for the whole wheat maize rotation when considering multiple indexes including yield et a wp economic benefit and groundwater table decline if no yield decline is accepted we recommend adding another irrigation at the anthesis for winter wheat in the dry years according to t10w3m1 4 4 prospect for a more sustainable winter wheat summer maize rotation climate change and freshwater scarcity have been viewed as the two most important global issues by scientists policymakers and even the public depending entirely on groundwater irrigation to maintain high grain yield for wheat and maize is unrealistic in the severe groundwater depletion funnel area of the ncp it is very important to determine how to balance high grain yield with water saving measures to help ensure the sustainability of food production in the research area in this study irrigation management scenarios were created based on four critical periods of crop water demand the same amount of irrigation water was applied at different irrigation times and quotas resulting in different yields and wp responses within the same amount of irrigation frequent irrigation times would increase the labor burden possibly without increasing yield or wp this study found that the annual economic output of wheat maize rotation under the limited irrigation in t4w2m1 decreased by 12 but the marginal benefit was 5 higher compared to the current farmer practice t12w3m2 this was consistent with zhang et al 2018 therefore the reduction in irrigation frequency can effectively save labor and improve irrigation efficiency with the time saved by reducing irrigation events farmers can earn income from other activities in the study area which has an insufficient amount of laborers in addition this study considered the winter wheat summer maize as an integral cropping system because we cannot ignore the subsequent interactions between rotating crops in this monsoon climate zone such as the yield compensation and soil water carryover between wheat and maize seasons in addition optimal soil water could accelerate n absorption improve the nitrogen utilization efficiency and reduce n leaching li et al 2018 appropriate irrigation could increase the remobilization of pre anthesis biomass into grains and improve the uptake and translocation of water zeng et al 2021 therefore it is essential to make optimal irrigation schedules for increased grain yield and higher wp while recognizing the winter wheat summer maize rotation as one unit it is also important to consider the soil moisture carryover between wheat and maize the yield synergies and trade offs within the wheat maize double cropping system researchers should also keep in mind that any new irrigation strategy needs to be acceptable and economically feasible for farmers the results of this study provide references for better irrigation management strategies for high crop production under limited water supply conditions in the ncp and similar water stressed regions meanwhile more long term simulations are needed to fully investigate the effects of climate change on irrigation scheduling and food productivity in future research the optimized irrigation scheduling should be expanded to more sites and upscaled to the regional scale with a finer grid to account for the spatial heterogeneity of climate and soil conditions the coeffects of new cultivars and optimal fertilizer application on the annual yield and wp should be considered in the modeling work this is very important to balance food production and water resources management on the regional scale 5 conclusion reducing the yield gap and water productivity gap by optimizing irrigation schedules is critical for improvements in sustainability of groundwater management and cereal grain production in the ncp the swap wofost model was used to assess the effect of 12 different irrigation treatments on the annual yield et a wp iwp groundwater table decline and marginal benefit as well as the economic index of the whole winter wheat summer maize rotation from 1980 to 2017 results showed that initially the annual yield and wp increased when irrigation increased but stabilized at higher irrigation amounts with one irrigation before maize sowing and adding one irrigation of 75 mm before the overwintering of wheat the annual yield increased by 29 adding a second irrigation at wheat jointing stage increased yield by 26 and next adding the third irrigation at wheat anthesis stage only increased the yield by 8 wp followed a similar trend as yield and t4w2m1 was the turning point of 2 47 kg m 3 irrigation treatments t5w2m1 through t12w3m2 did not increase wp significantly iwp marginal benefit economic output and ewue also showed an increase until t4w2m1 and then stabilized annual et a increased with the irrigation increase 456 644 mm the rainfed treatment was the best option for turning the groundwater decline into a groundwater rise of 0 11 m yr 1 during the past 38 years the simulated groundwater decline per year of the reduced irrigation schedules from 4 irrigations to 2 irrigations fell by 22 67 compared to the farmer practice with t4w2m1 dropping by 40 we concluded based on a 38 year crop growth simulation that three targeted irrigation per year with two irrigations before wintering and jointing of winter wheat and one irrigation at summer maize sowing stage was the best scenario for balancing food production and sustainable groundwater use while improving wp in the ncp another irrigation at the anthesis for winter wheat was recommended during dry years to guarantee an acceptable wheat yield the optimized irrigation study for the region s main crop rotation also supplies insights useful for other water stressed agricultural regions to maintain their grain yield and save groundwater extraction the approach in this paper could be adapted to simulate the impact of projected climate changes on crop yield evapotranspiration and groundwater depletion

9030,over irrigation to ensure high crop yields in north china plain ncp has led to a sharp groundwater table decline over the past decades we conducted a scenario analysis from1980 to 2017 with 12

water productivity wp groundwater table change and economic benefit to the different irrigation practices the optimized irrigation strategy is based on an integral analysis for different precipitation year types results showed that annual yield and wp increased with increased irrigation until these reached a plateau treatment t4w2m1 was the turning point with an annual yield of 15335 kg ha 1 significantly higher than t2w1m1 26 and t1w0m0 63 but not significantly different from 4 to 5 irrigations in wet and normal years et a increased with increased irrigation from 456 to 644 mm yr 1 the annual wp followed a similar trend as annual crop yield for all irrigation schedules t4w2m1 had an annual wp of 2 47 kg cm 3 significantly higher by 15 than t2w1m1 and 24 higher than t1w0m0 with no significant difference seen with 4 5 irrigations the rainfed treatment mitigated groundwater table decline the best even reversing the trend during the past four decades to 0 11 m yr 1 rise this was followed by two irrigation treatments 0 30 m yr 1 three irrigations 0 55 m yr 1 four irrigations 0 72 m yr 1 and five irrigations 0 86 m yr 1 the latter corresponds to typical farmer practice using the productivity indicators including irrigation wp marginal benefit and economic index t4w2m1 showed the best performance therefore we recommend t4w2m1 two irrigations at pre wintering and jointing stages for wheat and one irrigation at maize sowing stage as the best irrigation strategy for the wheat maize rotation to mitigate groundwater table decline and sustain grain yields and water

chen et al 2010 the irrigation induced overexploitation of groundwater resources is likely to intensify in the years to come schwartz et al 2020 thus investigation of more sustainable irrigation

dominant cropping system in this region since 1980 the annual precipitation averages 667 mm which does not meet the water needs of the wheat maize rotation of 700 1000 mm liu et al 2001 between 100 and 300 mm of this water deficit occurring during the annual wheat season is usually supplemented by groundwater cao et al 2014 local farmers usually applied 3 5 irrigation supplements in the winter

schedules of wheat maize rotation on groundwater reserves and crop production was reported in historical scenarios created by the apsim model sun et al 2015 2019b implying that even the minimum irrigation strategy one irrigation for each crop also resulted in groundwater table decline zhao et al 2020a discovered that one or two irrigations treatments of 75 150 mm were suitable for winter wheat production in wuqiao county in the ncp from 1981 to 2015 using the aquacrop model with the same model zhang et al 2022 recommended first applying 90 mm of irrigation during the wintering stage and a second irrigation during the wheat jointing stage with 0 30 and 60 mm in the wet normal and dry years respectively for winter wheat from 1961 to 2020 in the guanzhong plain the swap model is a

et al 2017 li and ren 2019 hu et al 2019 da silva et al 2020 wang et al 2021b irmak and kamble 2009 used the swap model to optimize the yield and wp of wheat in an on demand irrigation management system in india rallo et al 2012 verified that the swap model was a good tool for the precise simulation of et in wine grapes under different irrigation schedules in italy using the swap model martínez ferri et al 2013 found that irrigation requirements for citrus crops would increase between 6 and 16 for selected emission scenarios for the 2050 s and 2080 s in southern spain in the north china plain he et al 2011 analyzed five irrigation times for winter wheat and one irrigation application for summer maize in a median weather year using the swap model the net irrigation amount under the optimal irrigation scheduling for wheat maize rotation was reduced by 51 25 and 77 compared to the reference practices at the luancheng tongzhou and yucheng sites respectively in the ncp ma et al 2015a 2015b using the distributed swap wofost model in ncp li and ren 2019 reported that adopting an optimized irrigation scheme with a threshold of 60 could reduce deep groundwater exploitation by 6 05 108 m3 but has as consequence a winter wheat yield reduction of 50 however the previous studies mainly focused on individual crops like winter wheat there is a lack of long term series analysis on the optimized irrigation schedule for the entire winter wheat summer maize rotation the gap in grain yield wp and groundwater table change under different irrigation schedules has not been explicitly addressed in the previous studies for the integral winter wheat summer maize rotation for a long historical series furthermore the optimized irrigation schedule for the cropping system was not determined at different precipitation type years it is imperative to identify the trade offs between food production and groundwater use for the dominant wheat maize rotation therefore after calibrating and validating the swap wofost model the objectives of this study are to 1 reveal the response and the gap in the annual yield water consumption wp and economic output of the whole wheat maize rotation to different irrigation schedules under different precipitation type years between 1980 and 2017 2 recommend the optimized irrigation schedule for wheat maize rotation under different precipitation type years understanding the whole year s irrigation schedule for the wheat maize rotation could provide a useful basis for improving groundwater irrigation management and water use

surfaces including wet and dry vegetation and bare soil swap employs the richards equation including root water extraction to simulate soil moisture movement in variably saturated soils for the bottom boundary condition we employed free drainage in this study as the groundwater occurs at about 40 m below the soil surface swap is open source and freely available online the model has been used in numerous agrohydrological studies around the globe 2 3 swap wofost model calibration and validation a field experiment using different irrigation schedules for wheat maize rotation was conducted at luancheng experiment station as described in detail by yang et al 2022 we used the 2010 2011 field experiment dataset to calibrate the model and the 2012 2013 field data for validation winter wheat was planted from about the 14th to the 19th of october and harvested between the 10th and the 17th of june summer maize was sown at around 18th 24th of june and harvested at the end of september the leaf area index lai was measured weekly after the reviving stage using the sunscan canopy analysis system delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the canopy cover was calculated from the lai using an empirical equation provided by nielsen et al 2012 the aboveground biomass agb was measured after lai measurements and the dry matter was determined by drying about 15 plants at 75 for 72 h grain was harvested at full maturity within a 1 m2 area and the yield was collected by threshing and air drying to a constant weight soil volumetric moisture content 2 m profile was regularly measured with a neutron probe l520 at 20 cm increments every ten days during the wheat and maize growing seasons the daily actual evapotranspiration et a values for winter wheat and summer maize were collected by a lysimeter at the same field experiment site the irrigation practices during calibration years were 3 irrigations 80 60 60 mm for wheat and two irrigations 70 60 mm for maize in 2010 and 4 irrigations 70 60 60 60 mm for wheat and two irrigations 70 60 mm for maize in 2011 for validation years two irrigations 80 60 mm were applied in each wheat season and one irrigation for 70 mm 60 mm in each maize season to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation results for et a and crop production we used the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae according to the following equations 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 3 m a e 1 n i 1 n s i o i where o i and s i are the i th observed and simulated values o and s are the average of the observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of data pairs the regression coefficient r2 is dimensionless acceptable and good results for crop models are r2 0 60 and r2 0 80 respectively both rmse and mae have the same unit as the considered quantity while mae is the arithmetic average of the deviations rmse is a weighted average of the deviations with a higher weight to the larger deviations acceptable and good results for crop models are rmse and mae values smaller than 50 and 20 of the mean value respectively pasquel et al 2022 2 4 classification of precipitation year types the meteorological dataset of luancheng site from 1980 to 2017 was collected from china meteorological science sharing service network https data cma cn the daily meteorological data included solar radiation maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature saturated vapor pressure wind speed air humidity and precipitation the wet normal and dry years according to the annual precipitation from 1980 2017 were determined by drought index d i xu et al 2020 calculated as follows 4 d i p m σ where p is the annual precipitation mm m is the average annual precipitation over the period 1979 2017 mm and σ is the standard error mm wet years were distinguished when di 0 70 normal years when 0 70 di 0 70 and dry years when di 0 70 there were 10 years defined as wet years with an average annual precipitation of 720 135 mm 18 years defined as normal years with average annual precipitation of 501 59 mm and 10 years defined as dry years with average annual precipitation of 365 41 mm fig 2 2 5 swap wofost model for the evaluation of different irrigation strategies the calibrated and validated swap wofost model was used to investigate changes in yield potential water productivity and groundwater table decline of winter wheat summer maize rotation under different irrigation scenarios from 1980 to 2017 we set up five categories including 12 different irrigation schedules for the whole wheat maize rotation the categories included rainfed two irrigations three irrigations four irrigations and five irrigations based on local farmers practice 75 mm irrigation per time table 1 the farmer practice t12w3m2 is the control critical water requirement stages for winter wheat include pre wintering jointing and anthesis and for summer maize include sowing and milking stages there were five three irrigations treatments from t3 to t7 and four treatments for four irrigations from t8 to t11 with different irrigation times at different crop growth stages 2 6 evaluation calculations 1 productivity indices water productivity wp was calculated as follows 5 w p y e t a where wp is water productivity for grain yield of one crop or one given cropping system kg m 3 y is total annual grain yield kg ha 1 of one crop or one given cropping system and et a is the corresponding actual evapotranspiration over the crop growing season mm calculated from the swap model irrigation water productivity iwp and marginal benefit were calculated as follows sun et al 2015 6 i w p y i r r y r a inf e d i 7 marginalbenefit δ y δ e t a y i r r y r a inf e d e t i r r e t r a inf e d where iwp is irrigation water productivity for grain yield of one crop or one given cropping system kg m 3 y and yrainfed are total grain yield of one crop or one cropping system with and without irrigation kg ha 1 respectively i is the irrigation amount mm the grain yield of t1w0m0 was considered as yrainfed marginal benefit is the yield increment corresponding to increasing et a economic output and economic output water use efficiency ewue were calculated as follows 8 economicoutput i y ield i price i c p i i c p i 1980 9 e w u e 1 n economicoutput 1 n e t a where economic output is the crop within year yield multiplied by its corresponding price for the indicated year minus crop production costs yuan ha 1 i is one given year and cpi is the national consumer price index since the simulation started in the year 1980 we assumed the cpi in 1980 as the baseline 2 groundwater table changes inferred by net groundwater depletion the net groundwater depletion nwd mm yr 1 was defined as the difference between groundwater recharge and irrigation yang et al 2022 10 nwd r i where r is the deep groundwater recharge mm yr 1 calculated by the swap model and i is irrigation amount mm yr 1 when nwd is negative deep groundwater recharge irrigation and groundwater is depleted when nwd is positive groundwater recharge irrigation and groundwater table rises the groundwater table recharge for each year is calculated as the percolation rate at 2 m soil depth and includes a time lag to reach the groundwater free drainage was adopted in the swap model in this study which means that water percolates at the bottom of the 2 m soil profile according to unit hydraulic gradient and then eventually recharges the groundwater the groundwater table was observed to respond to annual precipitation changes with a one year time lag because of the groundwater table s cumulative drop to about 40 m below the surface the effect is spread over two years when considering the overall historical behaviour of precipitation and the groundwater table data yang et al 2015 therefore the groundwater table changes due to the withdrawal of irrigation water for winter wheat and summer maize can be simply calculated as follows 11 δ h n w d η where δh is the groundwater table change m yr 1 of wheat maize rotation and nwd is the net groundwater use mm yr 1 calculated as recharge by deep percolation minus the irrigation amount pumped from the groundwater and η is the specific yield set to 0 2 yang et al 2015 2021 2022 2 7 statistical analysis statistical methods including analysis of variance anova regression analysis correlation analysis and generalized linear models were carried out by spss version 21 statistical product and service solutions the differences were considered significant at p 0 05 the entropy topsis a technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution described in wang et al 2023 was adopted for the comprehensive evaluation by multiple indexes to select the optimized irrigation strategy in the different precipitation year types 3 results 3 1 swap model calibration and validation assessment the performance of the model was assessed by comparing the simulated and observed lai agb et a and yield of winter wheat and summer maize in the calibration fig 3a c e g and validation period fig 3b d f h the graphs show that swap captures the dynamics of observed evapotranspiration and crop growth given the large number of soil and crop parameters involved in the simulation and the accuracy of their measurements deviations between model results and measurements are inevitable the numerical deviation assessment is shown in table s2 the calibrated soil and crop parameters are shown in table s3 during the calibration period the values of r2 rmse and mae of winter wheat lai were 0 80 1 1 and 0 81 respectively for an observed mean value of 2 06 for summer maize lai the values of r2 rmse and mae were 0 84 0 94 and 0 67 respectively for an observed mean value of 2 06 in the validation period wheat and maize lai simulation performed equivalently to the calibration based on r2 0 83 and 0 82 respectively rmse 0 96 and 0 87 and mae 0 70 and 0 67 the deviations of agb of winter wheat during the calibration period were 0 90 for r2 2269 kg ha 1 for rmse and 1435 kg ha 1 for mae for the observed mean value of 5746 kg ha 1 it showed a well consistent match between simulated and observed values for winter wheat summer maize agb simulation also performed well for r2 0 97 rmse 952 kg ha 1 and mae 651 kg ha 1 during the calibration period for the mean value of 5771 kg ha 1 in the validation period wheat agb deviations were 0 96 for r2 1178 kg ha 1 for rmse and 694 kg ha 1 for mae and maize deviations were 0 95 1728 kg ha 1 and 1234 kg ha 1 respectively these degrees of agreement demonstrate that the model performed well in simulating the dynamics of the growth and development of winter wheat and summer maize a good consistency was also achieved in the et a of winter wheat during the calibration 2010 and 2011 and validation period 2012 and 2013 r2 0 90 and 0 88 rmse 15 and 17 mm month 1 and mae 11 and 12 mm month 1 respectively as compared with observed calibration and validation period means of 45 and 40 mm month 1 for summer maize the simulated et a also was satisfactory with statistical deviations of r2 0 85 and 0 81 rmse 17 and 30 mm month 1 and mae 13 and 26 mm month 1 respectively for observed means of 70 and 94 mm month 1 the statistical indicators showed that crop yield simulations were good in the calibration and validation periods for winter wheat observed mean 6096 and 6360 kg ha 1 rmse 932 and 709 kg ha 1 mae 881 and 709 kg ha 1 for maize observed mean 7391 and 8998 kg ha 1 rmse 752 and 1335 kg ha 1 with mae 728 and 1064 kg ha 1 overall the calibration and validation results revealed that the swap model performed well to simulate crop growth and water flow in the experimental area 3 2 annual total yield of wheat maize rotation under different irrigation schedules considering all the simulated years 1980 2017 the annual total yield of winter wheat summer maize rotation in the t1w0m0 treatment was the lowest 9390 kg ha 1 significantly lower than those supplied with irrigation p 0 05 fig 4a the annual total yield increased as the irrigation input increased to a point after that no significant extra yield occurred the t10w3m1 treatment obtained the highest annual total yield of 16559 kg ha 1 and there was no significant difference from t11w3m1 and t12w3m2 farmer practice the t2w1m1 increased the annual total yield by 29 compared to the rainfed condition yield from t3w1m2 with an annual total yield of 12676 kg ha 1 was not significantly more than t2w1m1 implying that adding another irrigation to maize during the late growth period did not contribute to a substantial yield increment the annual total yield of wheat maize rotation with three irrigations w2m1 from t4 to t7 averaged 14753 kg ha 1 significantly higher than rainfed 57 and t2w1m1 21 among the three irrigations treatments t4w2m1 with two irrigations at pre wintering and jointing stages for wheat and one irrigation at maize sowing stage resulted in the highest yield with 15335 kg ha 1 wheat 7365 kg ha 1 and maize 7970 kg ha 1 figs s1 2 t4w2m1 was not significantly higher than t5w2m1 or t6w2m1 but significantly greater than t7w2m1 which revealed that one irrigation at the jointing stage for wheat and one irrigation at the maize sowing stage are essential preconditions for good yield formations fig 4a the average annual total yield of wheat maize rotation under four irrigations from t8 to t11 was 15837 kg ha 1 significantly greater 69 than the rainfed condition 30 greater than two irrigations and 11 greater than three irrigations fig 4a by comparing t8 and t9 for w2m2 with irrigations at different wheat stages across all the years we reinforced that irrigation at wheat jointing stage was indispensable for wheat dry matter accumulation to grain yield by comparing t10 and t11 for w3m1 with irrigation at different maize growth stages it was evident that irrigation at the maize sowing stage created a proper soil water condition for maize emergence and to form a good population canopy structure for greater grain yield all results demonstrated that an extra irrigation application played a more significant role in wheat yield than in maize figs s1 2 in short the yield gap was obviously narrowed by adding a suitable irrigation supplement the annual yields in the wet years were obviously higher than those in normal and dry years fig 4b in wet years the annual yield ranged from 11876 kg ha 1 rainfed to 17094 kg ha 1 t10w3m1 t4w2m1 is the turning point with 16454 kg ha 1 no significant differences were found between t4w2m1 and t12w3m2 during the wet years in the normal years t4w2m1 was still the turning point for the annual yield without significant differences until t10w3m1 t7w2m1 with the second irrigation at the anthesis stage instead of the jointing stage for winter wheat and one irrigation at the large trumpet stage instead of pre sowing for summer maize showed the lowest annual yield among the group from t4w2m1 through t12w3m2 in the dry years irrigation had a larger effect on the annual yield than in wet and normal years the annual yield in t4w2m1 was significantly higher than the yield with low and no irrigation 10 lower than t10w3m1 and 5 lower than t8w2m2 respectively fig 4b this revealed that in dry years adding the third irrigation at wheat anthesis or adding the second irrigation at the silk stage of maize could guarantee a better annual grain yield the annual total yield gap of wheat maize rotation was about 29 from rainfed t1w0m0 to two irrigations t2w1m1 then 26 from two irrigations t2w1m1 to three irrigations t4w2m1 and then only 8 from three irrigations t4w2m1 to four irrigations t10w3m1 fig 4c the relationship shown in fig 4d demonstrates that the annual yield increases with irrigation increase and also shows the diminishing return of additional irrigation 3 3 annual et a of wheat maize rotation under different irrigation schedules the average annual et a of winter wheat summer maize rotation under 12 irrigation schedules ranged from 456 mm to 644 mm the annual et a increased when irrigation increased schedule t2w1m1 by adding one irrigation before wheat wintering and one irrigation at maize sowing significantly increased the total annual et a by 21 compared to the rainfed condition the annual et a of three irrigation treatments was 591 mm significantly higher 7 than t2w1m1 the annual et a of four irrigation treatments was 623 mm 5 higher than three irrigation treatments the t12w3m2 farmer practice had the highest annual et a of 644 mm with five irrigations per year which was 3 higher than that of four irrigation treatments 9 higher than 3 irrigation treatments 17 higher than two irrigation treatments and 41 higher than the rainfed condition fig 5a in wet years the annual total et a ranged from 505 mm to 642 mm with no significant differences between t4w2m1 and t12w3m2 with the average annual et a of three irrigation treatments measuring 601 mm four irrigation treatments with et a of 621 mm fig 5b in the normal years the annual total et a ranged from 449 mm to 643 mm the annual et a significantly increased by about 34 mm from three irrigations to four irrigations fig 5c in the dry years the annual total et a ranged from 420 mm to 646 mm there was a significant increase of about 41 mm from three irrigations to four irrigations fig 5d 3 4 annual water productivity of wheat maize rotation under different irrigation schedules the average annual water productivity wp of winter wheat summer maize rotation showed a similar trend as the annual yield ranging from 2 0 kg m 3 to 2 56 kg m 3 across all the years the rainfed treatment had the lowest wp of 2 0 kg m 3 due to a 43 loss in yield similarly t10w3m1 had the greatest annual wp of 2 56 kg m 3due to the highest annual yield t2w1m1 by adding one irrigation at the pre wintering stage for wheat and one irrigation at the maize sowing stage significantly increased wp by 8 compared to the rainfed treatment when adding another irrigation of 75 mm at the large trumpet stage for maize based on w1m1 the annual wp did not significantly increase implying that irrigation at the sowing stage is much more important to yield formation and water use efficiency improvement the average annual wp of 3 irrigations for w2m1 was 2 42 kg m 3 which significantly increased by 13 and 22 compared to t2w1m1 and rainfed respectively the average annual wp of w2m2 with t8 and t9 was 2 44 kg m 3 and no significant increase was seen from three irrigation treatments this result verified that adding another irrigation at the large trumpet stage for maize compared to the sowing stage did not play a significant role in wp increase the average annual wp did not increase with the irrigation input from t10w3m1 through t12w3m2 fig 6a the annual wp of winter wheat summer maize rotation in the wet years were higher than those of normal and dry years fig 6b in the wet years the annual wp ranged from 2 34 to 2 71 kg m 3 t4w2m1 was the turning point there was no significant difference between t1w0m0 and t3w1m2 with an average value of 2 37 kg m 3 no significant difference was found between t4w2m1 and t12w3m2 with an average value of 2 63 kg m 3 similarly in the normal years the annual wp ranged from 2 01 to 2 55 kg m 3 no significant difference was seen between t1w0m0 and t3w1m2 with an average value of 2 10 kg m 3 also no significant difference was found between t4w2m1 and t12w3m2 with an average value of 2 45 kg m 3 in the dry years the annual wp ranged from 1 78 to 2 61 kg m 3 the wp for rainfed strategy was 1 78 kg m 3 significantly increasing to an average of 2 15 kg m 3 for t2w1m1 and t3w1m2 and then significantly increasing to an average of 2 50 kg m 3 from t4w2m1 to t12w3m2 fig 6b in short the gap of wp in the wheat maize rotation was about 8 from rainfed t1w0m0 to two irrigations t2w1m1 14 from two irrigations t2w1m1 to three irrigations t4w2m1 and then only 3 from three irrigations t4w2m1 to four irrigations t10w3m1 fig 6c the relationship between the annual wp and the total irrigation shows that wp initially increased with the increased irrigation and then stabilized fig 6d 3 5 groundwater table change inferred from net groundwater use the groundwater table declined more with the increased irrigation input for the winter wheat summer maize rotation fig 7 in this study the rainfed condition without irrigation t1w0m0 did show a groundwater table rise the cumulative groundwater table change of the rainfed condition was positive 4 1 m from 1980 to 2017 with an average groundwater table rise rate of 0 11 m yr 1 the cumulative groundwater table in all irrigation treatments decreased among the irrigation treatments t2w1m1 had the smallest decline in the groundwater table with a cumulative drop of 11 5 m averaging 0 30 m yr 1 it was followed by t3w1m2 with a cumulative groundwater table decline of 17 0 m averaging 0 45 m yr 1 the average cumulative groundwater table decline in three irrigations w2m1 from t4 through t7 was 20 7 m during the 38 years averaging 0 55 m yr 1 the cumulative groundwater table decline for four irrigations from t8 through t11 was 27 4 m during the 38 years averaging 0 72 m yr 1 the observed groundwater table line overlapped with four and five irrigations t10w3m1 to t12w3m2 with an annual average decline rate of 0 92 m yr 1 the farmer practice of t12w3m2 using 375 mm of irrigation per year had the highest cumulative groundwater table decline of 32 6 m averaging 0 86 m yr 1 this commonly used irrigation practice for winter wheat summer maize rotation was the reason why the groundwater table has persistently declined over the past 40 years the groundwater table decline could be mitigated with fewer irrigation inputs thus this was also the crucial motivator to optimize the irrigation schedule for the whole winter wheat summer maize system 3 6 economic benefit and system efficiency assessment of wheat maize rotation under different irrigation schedules schedule t4w2m1 had the highest annual iwp of 2 64 kg m 3 for the whole winter wheat summer maize rotation during the period between 1980 and 2017 significantly higher by 39 compared to t12w3m2 farmer practices with the same irrigation amount totaling 225 mm per year under three irrigations the irrigation treatments from t5w2m1 through t7w2m1 changed the irrigation time for wheat and maize and their average annual iwp decreased by 13 as compared to t4w2m1 t10w3m1 had the next best iwp of 2 39 kg m 3 closely followed by t11w3m1 with 2 31 kg m 3 the treatments including two irrigations for maize did not have a better iwp t3w1m2 had the lowest iwp of 1 46 kg m 3 and then t8w2m2 and t9w2m2 and t12w3m2 with an average iwp of 1 95 kg m 3 the two irrigations treatment t2w1m1 had an annual iwp of 1 84 kg m 3 30 lower than t4w2m1 but not significant different from t12w3m2 fig 8a marginal benefit denotes the net et a efficiency t4w2m1 was the turning point fig 8b for the first group t2w1m1 and t3w1m2 had the lowest marginal benefit of 3 05 and 2 93 kg m 3 respectively there were no significant differences in the second group from t4 through t7 where measurements ranged from 3 99 to 4 31 kg m 3 average 4 12 kg m 3 which was almost the same in the treatments with four irrigation times fig 8b the economic output and ewue followed a similar trend as the marginal benefit t4w2m1 was also the turning point with an economic output of 10 114 yuan ha 1 and an ewue of 1 65 kg m 3 which is significantly higher than the rainfed condition t2w1m1 and t3w1m2 there were no significant differences in strategies t4w2m1 through t12w3m2 the economic output and ewue of t4w2m1 were lower than t12w3m2 only by 11 and 6 respectively the rainfed condition had the lowest economic output and ewue significantly lower than the irrigation treatments and about 77 and 72 lower than t12w3m2 respectively fig 8c d therefore t4w2m1 is recommended as the most beneficial irrigation strategy for the entire wheat maize rotation when considering multiple indexes including annual yield et a wp economic benefit rotation efficiency and groundwater table decline if preventing yield decline is essential adding another irrigation at the anthesis for winter wheat is desirable in the dry years according to schedule t10w3m1 table s4 4 discussion 4 1 yield eta water productivity and harvest index of winter wheat under different irrigation regimes one irrigation supplement significantly improved the yield of winter wheat by 80 compared to the rainfed condition two irrigations at pre wintering and jointing stages for winter wheat significantly increased the yield 58 as compared to one single irrigation time averaged 4568 kg ha 1 adding the third irrigation at the anthesis stage increased the wheat yield by 19 but showed no significant yield improvement compared to two and three irrigations in this study fig s1 this demonstrated that two irrigations were suitable enough for winter wheat to produce a high yield irrigation times are just as important as irrigation amounts in this study different irrigation combinations with different irrigation times and quotas were considered we found that adding the second irrigation at the jointing stage improved the wheat yield by 13 compared to irrigation at anthesis by comparing t4w2m1 to t9w2m2 fig s1 this revealed that under deficit irrigation jointing irrigation provided the critical water required for sufficient wheat vegetative growth which forms the basis for yield formation this was consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2017 reported that the largest wheat yield increment was from rainfed to one irrigation and that irrigation at the jointing stage significantly improved the wheat yield yang et al 2022 reported that adding another irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat increased yield by 24 compared to one irrigation at pre wintering stage based on a 16 year field experiment while adding another two irrigations at the jointing and booting stages only increased yield by 10 accompanying an increase in et a with no increase in wp the wheat jointing irrigation was critical for determining grain numbers per area and sink capacity of winter wheat for a higher yield and wp compared to traditional practices madani et al 2010 lv et al 2011 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 reported that irrigation at the jointing stage was the most effective time for stem extension and photosynthesis for winter wheat to increase yield and wp we found that the t4w2m1 treatment significantly increased the harvest index hi of winter wheat in this study fig s1 this is consistent with the previous studies villegas et al 2001 zeng et al 2021 their studies revealed that two irrigations at the earlier growth stages pre wintering and jointing stages were beneficial for managing the pre anthesis biomass and translocation after anthesis irrigation at the jointing stage resulted in an increase of co2 in the flag leaves increased the availability of the carbon source for photosynthesis and reduced the limitation of stomatal photosynthesis resulting in the increase in the net photosynthetic rate during the flowering stage ma et al 2015a 2015b fan et al 2019 dong et al 2014 also reported that irrigation at the jointing stage increased the chlorophyll content index in the flag leaves during the late growth stage delayed the degradation of flag leaf chlorophyll further prolonged the ageing period of wheat and produced more photosynthetic products for increasing the grain yield also the irrigation at the jointing stage contributed to the crop s antioxidant ability before the flowering stage and promoted nutrient transformation after anthesis mu et al 2021 based on the precipitation distribution and soil moisture condition two irrigations at pre wintering and jointing stages were recommended for winter wheat in this study no irrigation at the wheat sowing stage was pursued by local farmers the irrigation before wintering was added to supplement the soil water from sowing to jointing which lasts about five months into the dry season supplemental irrigation from recovery to jointing supplied more soil water before anthesis to accelerate root growth and stimulate grain filling in addition dry hot winds at the end of the wheat growing season may and june can very rapidly dehydrate wheat accelerate maturity decrease the grain filling rate reduce grain weights and hi as well as further reduce any positive effect that anthesis irrigation had on grain yield excessive rainfall and soil moisture and high air temperature after anthesis affected the micro environment of the canopy leading to a lower flag leaf chlorophyll content in the late grain filling stage and premature leaf senescence which decreased dry matter at maturity and finally resulted in lower grain yield wang et al 2013 li et al 2018 xu et al 2016 reported that a single irrigation at the jointing stage increased the soil reservoir capacity such that it could store more accessible rainwater in the soil during the rainy summer season and further increase annual soil water use xue et al 2010 reported that drought during the late growth stage of winter wheat promoted primary root deep root growth into the deep soil profile to facilitate absorption and use of deep soil moisture when the early season precipitation was low shifting the irrigation to an earlier time ensures meeting pre anthesis water requirements which help to increase wp and maintain a high yield zeng et al 2021 in the current study the yield of winter wheat was highly affected by precipitation in the rainfed growth condition with high yields in wet years a 46 decrease in normal years and a 51 decrease in dry years the et a of winter wheat increased from no irrigation to three irrigations in wet normal and dry years it also followed precipitation with high values in wet years and low values in dry years the wp of winter wheat across different precipitation type years had a substantial improvement when irrigation was added from a rainfed strategy average 1 07 kg m 3 to one irrigation 1 54 kg m 3 and to two irrigations 2 12 kg m 3 and with no significant increase seen from two irrigations to three irrigations 2 34 kg m 3 in this study the increased wp and relatively higher yield under the limited irrigation conditions could be attributed to a deeper root system and an appropriate wheat canopy xu et al 2016 the optimal wheat canopy could improve the photosynthetic efficiency of leaf and non leaf organs by distributing radiation well from top to bottom gago et al 2014 the water loss through stomata was reduced with reduced irrigation and the wp of winter wheat increased significantly mantovani et al 2014 in addition the dry matter of leaves under deficit irrigation might be used to construct guard cells and increase the density and thickness of leaf cells leading to higher stomatal resistance and reducing the transpiration rate which increased the final wp by reducing total water evapotranspiration zhao et al 2020a 2020b in this study rainfed maize had a yield of 6850 kg ha 1 one irrigation of 75 mm at the sowing stage significantly improved the maize yield by 17 compared to rainfed cultivation one irrigation at the large trumpet stage did not show the expected increase in maize yield only 8 higher than in rainfed conditions fig s2 the maize yield did not significantly increase with two irrigations in this study this demonstrated that one irrigation at the maize sowing stage is crucial for a good grain yield and wp the available soil moisture was very low after the winter wheat harvest because winter wheat can fully take up soil water under limited irrigation due to its deep rooting system which can reach up to 2 m zhang et al 2009 li et al 2016 sufficient soil moisture at the maize sowing stage promoted germination seedling emergence and root growth feng et al 2018 reducing water consumption during the earlier growth stages of maize was important for prolonging the soil water availability for crop growth from the irrigation at maize sowing stage fang et al 2021 especially from sowing to the seven leaf stage maize mainly depends on the soil water for crop growth due to the low rainfall amounts in the dry season lu et al 2017 the sowing irrigation was important for maize seedling growth and therefore helped to determine the crop productivity capacity sun et al 2014 song and jin 2020 reported that water stress during the maize seedling stage damaged the photosynthetic membrane and reduced the chlorophyll content in the leaf essentially reducing the grain yield the maize yield with one irrigation at the large trumpet stage was 7 lower than with one irrigation at the sowing stage in this study a previous study indicated that water deficits during the reproductive stage resulted in more yield reduction than a deficit during the vegetative stage and the 1000 kernel weight was more sensitive to limited irrigation martínez ferri et al 2013 pre sowing irrigation significantly influenced the kernel number per row total spike number and 1000 kernel weight thus collectively increasing grain yield yan et al 2017 in this study et a increased significantly from rainfed to one irrigation no significant differences were found in et a between the irrigation treatments t2 through t12 also there were no significant differences in wp of summer maize between treatments t1 through t12 in this study this verified that the sowing irrigation and rainfall during the growth season were sufficient for maize production in the ncp however the rainfall and its distribution during the maize growing season affected crop production under a limited water supply li et al 2019 omoyo et al 2015 reported that the trend in future rainfall change would negatively influence maize yield at deficit irrigation it is beneficial to estimate the effect of expected climate change on maize yield and wp in the future meanwhile it is very important to better understand the influence of soil moisture on summer maize after previous winter wheat harvesting and how rainfall distribution at the vegetative and reproductive stages of summer maize will be affected in the follow up studies therefore the optimized irrigation schedule should consider the soil water carryover between the previous crop and the successive crop as well as the irrigation retention effect and the rainfall distribution in the whole winter wheat summer maize rotation system it is also necessary to take measures to conserve the soil water after the single irrigation at the maize sowing stage to prolong its availability to the crop by incorporating such things as drought resistant varieties of maize tokatlidis et al 2011 straw mulching rashid et al 2019 optimized plant population fang et al 2021 and drip irrigation plus fertigation tian et al 2017 4 3 optimized irrigation scheduling for winter wheat summer maize rotation the annual average yield of winter wheat summer maize rotation ranged from 9390 to 16559 kg ha 1 under 12 irrigation scenarios t4w2m1 significantly increased the annual yield by 26 and 63 as compared to t2w1m1 and t1w0m0 and was only 7 lower than the largest yield from treatment t10w3m1 across all the tested years in addition there were no significant differences in annual yield between t4w2m1 and t10w3m1 in wet and normal years the annual yields of t4w2m1 and t10w3m1 were significantly lower in dry years by 9 this was consistent with previous field experiments feng et al 2018 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2019a yang et al 2022 limited irrigation during the winter wheat growth period led to earlier maturity and provided benefits to the subsequent summer maize earlier maturity of wheat could leave time for early sown maize to utilize more solar radiation and thermal resources to promote grain filling and grain weight and improve the final grain yield the improved maize performance can compensate for the yield loss of wheat wang et al 2018 irrigation limitation at the later stage of wheat could keep the soil dry during its harvest stage which provided space to store more rainfall for later maize and reduce the deep percolation during the following rainy season wang et al 2006 sun et al 2019a t4w2m1 also was the turning point for wp economic benefit and system efficiency and there were no significant differences of these indices between t4w2m1 and t10w3m1 in any of the three precipitation type years therefore during wet years and normal years t4w2m1 are the best irrigation regime to enhance wp without sacrificing yield in dry years adding the third irrigation at wheat anthesis such as t10w3m1 is beneficial for obtaining a better annual grain yield in this study irrigation treatments did all show a cumulative drop of the groundwater table only the rainfed treatment was simulated to let the groundwater table slowly recover this was consistent with previous studies the rainfed condition of winter wheat summer maize rotation showed a neutral groundwater table in the integrated data analysis carried out over the ncp from 1990 to 2009 yang et al 2021 and a simulation based on a 16 year field experiment yang et al 2022 the rainfed wheat maize rotation was reported to yield a groundwater increase of 0 05 m yr 1 from 1982 to 2013 according to the apsim model sun et al 2019b and an increase of 0 30 0 40 m yr 1 according to another apsim study representing the period from 1961 to 2011 van oort et al 2016 the simulated groundwater table decline caused by farmer irrigation practice t12w3m2 for the wheat maize rotation amounted 0 86 m yr 1 which is close to the observed 0 92 m yr 1 yang et al 2021 and somewhat lower than previous modelling results of 1 13 to 1 60 m yr 1 chen et al 2010 kendy et al 2004 ma et al 2015b van oort et al 2016 sun et al 2019b differences in decline are attributed to different simulation periods and different locales in the ncp as well as whether the recharge time lag effect was considered or not t4 mitigated the groundwater table decline by 44 as compared to four or five irrigations therefore we believe that the t4w2m1 had the most beneficial irrigation schedule for the whole wheat maize rotation when considering multiple indexes including yield et a wp economic benefit and groundwater table decline if no yield decline is accepted we recommend adding another irrigation at the anthesis for winter wheat in the dry years according to t10w3m1 4 4 prospect for a more sustainable winter wheat summer maize rotation climate change and freshwater scarcity have been viewed as the two most important global issues by scientists policymakers and even the public depending entirely on groundwater irrigation to maintain high grain yield for wheat and maize is unrealistic in the severe groundwater depletion funnel area of the ncp it is very important to determine how to balance high grain yield with water saving measures to help ensure the sustainability of food production in the research area in this study irrigation management scenarios were created based on four critical periods of crop water demand the same amount of irrigation water was applied at different irrigation times and quotas resulting in different yields and wp responses within the same amount of irrigation frequent irrigation times would increase the labor burden possibly without increasing yield or wp this study found that the annual economic output of wheat maize rotation under the limited irrigation in t4w2m1 decreased by 12 but the marginal benefit was 5 higher compared to the current farmer practice t12w3m2 this was consistent with zhang et al 2018 therefore the reduction in irrigation frequency can effectively save labor and improve irrigation efficiency with the time saved by reducing irrigation events farmers can earn income from other activities in the study area which has an insufficient amount of laborers in addition this study considered the winter wheat summer maize as an integral cropping system because we cannot ignore the subsequent interactions between rotating crops in this monsoon climate zone such as the yield compensation and soil water carryover between wheat and maize seasons in addition optimal soil water could accelerate n absorption improve the nitrogen utilization efficiency and reduce n leaching li et al 2018 appropriate irrigation could increase the remobilization of pre anthesis biomass into grains and improve the uptake and translocation of water zeng et al 2021 therefore it is essential to make optimal irrigation schedules for increased grain yield and higher wp while recognizing the winter wheat summer maize rotation as one unit it is also important to consider the soil moisture carryover between wheat and maize the yield synergies and trade offs within the wheat maize double cropping system researchers should also keep in mind that any new irrigation strategy needs to be acceptable and economically feasible for farmers the results of this study provide references for better irrigation management strategies for high crop production under limited water supply conditions in the ncp and similar water stressed regions meanwhile more long term simulations are needed to fully investigate the effects of climate change on irrigation scheduling and food productivity in future research the optimized irrigation scheduling should be expanded to more sites and upscaled to the regional scale with a finer grid to account for the spatial heterogeneity of climate and soil conditions the coeffects of new cultivars and optimal fertilizer application on the annual yield and wp should be considered in the modeling work this is very important to balance food production and water resources management on the regional scale 5 conclusion reducing the yield gap and water productivity gap by optimizing irrigation schedules is critical for improvements in sustainability of groundwater management and cereal grain production in the ncp the swap wofost model was used to assess the effect of 12 different irrigation treatments on the annual yield et a wp iwp groundwater table decline and marginal benefit as well as the economic index of the whole winter wheat summer maize rotation from 1980 to 2017 results showed that initially the annual yield and wp increased when irrigation increased but stabilized at higher irrigation amounts with one irrigation before maize sowing and adding one irrigation of 75 mm before the overwintering of wheat the annual yield increased by 29 adding a second irrigation at wheat jointing stage increased yield by 26 and next adding the third irrigation at wheat anthesis stage only increased the yield by 8 wp followed a similar trend as yield and t4w2m1 was the turning point of 2 47 kg m 3 irrigation treatments t5w2m1 through t12w3m2 did not increase wp significantly iwp marginal benefit economic output and ewue also showed an increase until t4w2m1 and then stabilized annual et a increased with the irrigation increase 456 644 mm the rainfed treatment was the best option for turning the groundwater decline into a groundwater rise of 0 11 m yr 1 during the past 38 years the simulated groundwater decline per year of the reduced irrigation schedules from 4 irrigations to 2 irrigations fell by 22 67 compared to the farmer practice with t4w2m1 dropping by 40 we concluded based on a 38 year crop growth simulation that three targeted irrigation per year with two irrigations before wintering and jointing of winter wheat and one irrigation at summer maize sowing stage was the best scenario for balancing food production and sustainable groundwater use while improving wp in the ncp another irrigation at the anthesis for winter wheat was recommended during dry years to guarantee an acceptable wheat yield the optimized irrigation study for the region s main crop rotation also supplies insights useful for other water stressed agricultural regions to maintain their grain yield and save groundwater extraction the approach in this paper could be adapted to simulate the impact of projected climate changes on crop yield evapotranspiration and groundwater depletion

9031,in years of increasing impact of climate change effects a reliable characterization of the spatiotemporal evolutionary dynamics of evapotranspiration can enable a significant improvement in water resource management especially as regards irrigation activities sicily an insular region of southern italy has exceptionally valuable agricultural production and high irrigation needs in this study the eto reference evapotranspiration in sicily was first evaluated on the basis of historical and future climate parameters referring for future values to two climate scenarios characterized by different representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 then the hierarchical algorithm was used to divide sicily into three homogeneous regions each characterized by specific eto features in addition some machine learning ml algorithms were used to develop forecasting models based on only historical data support vector regression svr was used to predict the future values of tmin and tmax while an ensemble model based on multilayer perceptron mlp and m5p regression tree was developed for the eto forecasting predictions made with the ensemble mlp m5p model were compared with the eto computed for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future climate scenarios during the forecast period from 2001 to 2091 evapotranspiration increases were observed for all three clusters for cluster c1 along the coast percentage increases of 7 52 14 64 and 10 78 were computed for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively while for cluster c3 in the inland percentage increases were higher and equal to 8 12 16 71 and 14 98 respectively the ensemble mlp m5p model led to intermediate trends between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 showing a high correlation with the latter r2 between 0 93 and 0 98 the developed approach based on both clustering and forecasting algorithms provided a comprehensive analysis of the reference evapotranspiration with the detection of the different homogeneous regions and at the same time the evaluation of the evapotranspiration trends both in coastal and inland areas keywords climate change artificial intelligence algorithms clustering ensemble models mediterranean climate irrigation planning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration is one of the main processes in the water cycle and its assessment plays an essential role in water resource management however given the complexity involved with direct measurement the estimation of evapotranspiration is commonly based on meteorological data which allows the estimation of the eto reference evapotranspiration the physical based penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 which combines radiometric and aerodynamic parameters is recommended by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao for the eto evaluation in different climates worldwide fan et al 2016 however climate change is affecting the hydrological cycle and its effects will be probably more dangerous for arid and semi arid climates characterized by low rainfalls and high temperatures goyal and gaur 2022 therefore a spatio temporal analysis of the future evapotranspiration trends may be crucial for predicting imbalances in regional hydrologic supply and enhancing water resources management yang et al 2020 the considerable variety of climates worldwide can lead to very different eto trends depending on the local climatic features chaouche et al 2010 investigated the spatio temporal evolution of eto for a mediterranean climate area of france showing increasing trends more marked close to the coast pandey and khare 2018 and prăvălie et al 2019 also detected an increasing eto trend for the humid tropical climate of the narmada river watershed india and for the temperate continental climate of romania respectively jerin et al 2021 investigated the reference evapotranspiration trends for the tropical monsoon climate of bangladesh showing how over the period 1980 2015 increasing and decreasing trends can be observed during the monsoon and dry periods respectively however the authors highlighted a decreasing trend for the annual eto different literature studies show a decreasing trend for semi arid she et al 2017 xu et al 2018 and arid areas of china li et al 2017 however fu et al 2022 investigated the terrestrial evapotranspiration trends at china s land scale showing a significant linear increasing trend since 2000 for 87 03 of the study area considering all agricultural regions of china estimating eto using the penman monteith equation over large areas is often complicated by the lack of sufficiently widespread measurement stations for climate variables this problem can be overcome by relying on the results of projects based on the combination of several global climate models gcms and regional climate models rcms which provide climatic variables in most regions of the world with different spatio temporal resolutions and different climate scenarios these allow an evaluation of present and future evapotranspiration even in poorly gauged areas examples of these projects are the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex gutowski et al 2016 and coupled model intercomparison project cmip eyring et al 2016 in the last decades ml based models proved to be able to provide accurate predictions of hydrological variables including evapotranspiration with the advantage of a high computational speed without the need to define analytical relationships between exogenous variables inputs and targets di nunno and granata 2020 granata and di nunno 2021a furthermore in recent years in order to improve the forecasting accuracy of ml algorithms the research has been oriented toward the development of deep learning models e g one dimensional convolutional neural network and long short term memory network chia et al 2022a 2022b and ensemble or hybrid models tikhamarine et al 2019 karbasi et al 2022 malik et al 2022 however investigations on future evapotranspiration trends through a comparison between the eto evaluated on the basis of future data of the climatic variables and the ml approach are to date still very little debated yin et al 2017 investigated the future variability of eto using two ml algorithms extreme learning machine elm and svr in a mountainous inland watershed in north west china the authors considered eight gcms from the cmip5 under two rcp climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 they showed how both elm and svr methods are characterized by good performance in estimating the eto for the future period 2010 2099 maqsood et al 2022 investigated the response of eto under three rcp climate scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 using the second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 in particular the authors estimated eto for western central and eastern parts of prince edward island canada using the hargreaves equation with tmax and tmin for three future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 then the authors employed three different artificial neural networks anns algorithms one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn long short term memory lstm and mlp for the eto estimation showing good accuracy kadkhodazadeh et al 2022 analyzed the eto trends for the period 2021 2050 at nine stations in the two basins of lake urmia and sefidrood iran in particular the authors evaluated eto by the penman monteith equation based on three different cmip6 global climate models then they carried out an eto modeling implementing six ml algorithms multiple linear regression mlr multiple non linear regression mnlr multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model tree m5 m5 random forest rf and least squares boost lsboost with promising results a forecast model of the future eto can be valid for a more or less large area as long as the area is characterized by a certain homogeneity of the features affecting the eto homogeneous evapotranspiration regions can be identified by means of clustering algorithms xing et al 2016 applied the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof clustering method to identify homogenous regions of eto in china based on the annual eto times series from 602 stations for the period 1961 2011 masanta and vemavarapu 2020 detected eighteen homogeneous eto regions in india using a fuzzy dynamic clustering approach with climate variables as predictors chen et al 2020 applied the k means clustering algorithm for the eto analysis in northeast plain china the authors used the daily average values of maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity extraterrestrial radiation and solar radiation to group all weather stations with the clustering algorithm hobeichi et al 2021 also applied the k means algorithm on a global scale with the detected clusters that included three wet and three dry regimes and provided an approximation of köppen geiger climate classes the aim of this study is to provide a characterization of the eto trends in sicily southern italy based on a spatio temporal analysis a step by step description of the modeling procedure is provided in section 2 7 sicily has exceptionally valuable agricultural production and also high irrigation requirements in the context of scarcity of water resources an accurate assessment of future trends in evapotranspiration is crucial to evaluate the impact of climate change on surface water availability in mediterranean climate areas such as sicily liuzzo et al 2015 investigated the effect of climate change on water resource availability for a sub basin of belice catchment sicily showing how the decreasing trends of precipitation involved a decrease in surface and groundwater resources with the latter enhanced by the potential evapotranspiration changing the authors also highlighted the impact on the reservoir management for garcia lake sicily showing how in the future the reservoir will no longer be able to satisfy the water demands this will lead to the need to reduce both agricultural water demand through more efficient irrigation systems and water leakages which chronically affect water supply systems in southern italy viola et al 2016 also investigated the future evapotranspiration runoff relationship scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for one of the largest sicilian basins the imera meridionale river basin showing that future evapotranspiration changing will lead to a sharp reduction of the runoff as the reference evapotranspiration and temperature increase and the precipitation reduces varotsos et al 2021 investigated the implication of climate change on the agricultural sector of three mediterranean islands sicily crete and cyprus based on the euro cordex data and the two scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 authors showed marked changing in the average maximum and minimum temperatures during the period 2031 and 2060 with however a less pronounced reduction of the total precipitation the authors highlighted the impact of these variations on the main crops cultivated in the three islands in particular the expected warming mostly in spring and summer might expose the crops to an adverse impact on the plants phenological stages affecting both production and quality for example for the olive tree widespread in large areas of sicily the temperature increases can lead to positive effects on trunk and fruit growth however climate change can bring also negative impacts on flowering bud differentiation which requires an appropriate low temperature period and the increase of olive fly infestations reducing final yield and quality moreover future climate projections represent extreme conditions corresponding to assumed emission scenarios but conditioned by future environmental policies and certainly affected by significant uncertainty further considerable uncertainty is due to the complexity of global and regional models yin et al 2017 in this scenario the ml based models which are relatively simple to develop on the basis of historical data alone can provide reliable alternative forecasting tools which are also useful for validating the results of the more complex gcms and rcms or highlighting their discrepancies a study of the spatio temporal evolution of regional reference evapotranspiration over the long term based on clustering and ml algorithms with subsequent comparison of the results with extreme climate scenarios is certainly novel compared to the current literature the issue takes on even greater importance for the area investigated in this study sicily where climate change can significantly increase the risk of desertification in this context the clustering results in addition to allowing the recognition of homogeneous eto areas were analyzed in context with the agricultural land use to correlate the reference evapotranspiration with the different crop water demands allowing the identification of the most sensitive areas in terms of potential future water deficit from this point of view reliable future eto forecasting is crucial although the mlp algorithm has recently been applied by maqsood et al 2022 to investigate the eto trends under different future climate scenarios the ensemble model based on mlp and m5p algorithms for the eto prediction besides being a further element of novelty aimed at significantly improving the performance of individual algorithms which are not always able to provide satisfactory predictions especially for long term forecast horizons therefore this study aims to overcome the limitations of the existing literature on the reference evapotranspiration prediction in sicily proposing a combined clustering forecasting approach that can provide useful information for the present and future management of water resources for different purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sicily is the largest island in the mediterranean sea and has a typical mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and mild wet winters moreover especially along the southwestern coast the african anticyclone brings frequent and marked temperature increases benedetto and giordano 2008 fig 1a during the winter the average temperature varies from 4 c in the inland province of enna to 9 7 c and 11 5 c on the west coast of trapani and the northeast coast of messina respectively during the summer the average temperature varies from about 28 c inland to about 30 along the coast rainfall is higher along the east coast with 709 mm of annual precipitation in 109 rainy days for messina compared to the west coast with 446 mm of annual precipitation in 88 rainy days in trapani in addition inland areas showed lower annual precipitation than the coast with 358 mm of annual precipitation on 69 rainy days for the city of enna however annual rainfall is far below the national average one of the main economic activities of the region is agriculture with more than 1 600 000 ha of agricultural land corresponding to about 64 of sicily s total surface fig 1b provides the agricultural land cover of sicily based on corine coordination of information on the environment land cover data for the year 2018 with the 3 level nomenclature fruit trees which cover 11 of agricultural land are mostly concentrated along the east coast and particularly in the province of catania vineyards and olive groves which cover 9 and 12 of agricultural land respectively are more widespread along the west coast permanently irrigated lands which include greenhouses cover only 4 of the agricultural land and are more widespread in the southeastern part of the island in addition 48 of agricultural land is represented by non irrigated arable land which includes rainfed and sporadically irrigated land with non permanent devices in addition to agricultural land use the factor that plays a key role in the management of water resources is the irrigation requirements of each crop these also vary considerably from area to area in sicily depending on the climatic and pedological conditions vineyards require from 1200 to 1800 m3 ha year going from the provinces of caltanissetta and ragusa south east to the province of palermo north west respectively great variability is also observed for olive groves which require from about 1200 m3 ha year for the provinces of caltanissetta ragusa and the northern portion of trapani west to about 2000 m3 ha year for the provinces of catania palermo and the southern portion of trapani fruits trees require about 3500 m3 ha year for the whole region with the only exception of the catania province where the greatest presence of orchards is observed for which 3800 m3 ha year are indicated regione sicilia 2010 however it should be seriously considered that the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle have been observed in recent years related to rising average temperatures and evapotranspiration rates leading to a significant increase in irrigation demands viola et al 2014 this together with the reduced availability of surface water and groundwater is related to the negative rainfall trend which leads to an increased risk of desertification on the island liuzzo et al 2015 2 2 dataset minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperature grid data from the cordex project were used in this study the cordex platform was developed by the world climate research program wcrp with the aim of providing high resolution climate datasets in several locations around the world gutowski et al 2016 specifically the cordex experiments consist of simulations representing different future socio economic scenarios based on different combinations of rcms and gcms the gcm model used was the mohc hadgem2 es developed by the met office hadley centre mohc with the hadgem2 family of configurations including the earth system es components like dynamic vegetation ocean biology and atmospheric chemistry the hadgem2 physical model includes improvements designed to address specific systematic errors found in the previous climate configuration hadgem1 related to continental temperature biases of the northern hemisphere and tropical sea surface the hadgem2 development team 2011 the rcm model was the clmcom cclm4 8 17 for the european domain eur 11 clmcom 2017 since climate features like temperature and rainfall are highly spatially variable due to the rather complex orography of sicily forestieri et al 2018a peres et al 2020 the bias correction included in the gcm model allowed to reduce the errors between the observed and simulated hydrological data based on cordex climate models as demonstrated in several literature studies in other mediterranean areas piani et al 2010 dosio 2016 forestieri et al 2018b demonstrated the capability of cordex models to reproduce extreme rainfall measured at different stations in sicily peres et al 2020 also investigated the skill of several euro cordex rcms with grid size of 0 11 in reproducing the seasonal temperature and precipitation regime for calabria and sicily showing higher performances for temperature which is the variable considered in the present study with respect to precipitation moreover the combination of the two climate models regional and global has recently led to an accurate analysis of climate change in eastern greece and in particular on the island of crete which has a climate similar to that of sicily markantonis et al 2022 two extreme rcp scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were considered as climate projections rcps are greenhouse gas concentration trajectories adopted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc rcp 4 5 is an intermediate scenario with emissions peaking around 2040 and declining until 2100 rcp 4 5 can be regarded as the most likely scenario as it considers the exhaustible nature of non renewable fuels höök et al 2010 rcp 8 5 represents the worst case climate change scenario as it considers an increase in emissions throughout the 21st century the spatial resolution of the dataset grid was equal to 0 11 with 186 gridded data points covering the entire island fig 1a the dataset spans from 1951 to 2005 for historical data and from 2006 to 2100 for the rcp scenarios with a monthly time scale in addition to tmin and tmax the extraterrestrial radiation ra was computed for each gridded data point from 1951 to 2100 expressed as 1 r a 24 60 π g sc d r ω s sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ sin ω s where gsc is the solar constant dr is the inverse relative distance earth sun ωs is the sunset hour angle φ is the latitude and δ is the solar declination zotarelli et al 2013 2 3 reference evapotranspiration in order to calculate the monthly average daily reference evapotranspiration eto the hargreaves samani he equation was used hargreaves and samani 1985 expressed as 2 et 0 c r a t max t min 2 17 8 t max t min where c is the empirical hargreaves coefficient the main advantage of this equation compared to the more complex penman monteith model is that it only requires extraterrestrial radiation and the time series of the minimum and maximum temperature di nunno and granata 2020 elbeltagi et al 2020 however the accuracy in the estimation of eto depends on the value of the empirical coefficient c which can vary significantly depending on the morphoclimatic characteristics of the study area mendicino and senatore 2013 proposed a regionalization of the hargreaves coefficient with different equations for each subregion of southern italy the authors showed how a properly calibrated hs equation provides better performances than the original hs furthermore in comparison to the well known fao penman monteith equation which however requires several parameters for the eto calculation the calibrated hs equation led to very close eto estimation for many locations in southern italy including about 40 measurement stations located throughout sicily for the evaluation of the empirical hargreaves coefficient c in sicily mendicino and senatore 2013 proposed the following equation 3 c 1 10 5 t 2 0 0004 t 0 0049 where t is the average value computed for each data point of the difference between tmax and tmin in particular the calculated value of c for the 186 gridded points ranged from 0 0017 and 0 0038 with the higher values along the coast in particular in the south of the region and the lowest values in the south eastern inland see fig 1a therefore the calibrated hs equation was used to evaluate both the historical eto from 1951 to 2005 and the future eto for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios from 2006 to 2100 considering the individually calculated values of both c and ra for each grid point 2 4 clustering procedure clustering can be defined as a classification process of a large dataset into a smaller number of groups therefore data belonging to the same cluster have common characteristics while data belonging to different clusters are characterized by some heterogeneity barton et al 2016 recently the hierarchical clustering algorithm has found application for various hydrological analyses aladaileh et al 2019 xulu et al 2019 neto et al 2021 the advantages of hierarchical clustering compared to other algorithms such as k means are that the number of clusters does not have to be determined prior to clustering and that the process can be evaluated with the aid of a dendrogram chart which can be used to better understand the overall picture in which the data are clustered berhanu et al 2015 the hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to divide the study area into homogeneous areas several statistical parameters of the time series of eto were preliminary considered as inputs for the clustering procedure the minimum mean and maximum values of the eto etomin etomean etomax respectively the eto standard deviation mode and skewness etostd etomode and etoskew respectively the number of months with eto between 0 and 1 5 mm day eto0 1 5 1 5 mm day and 3 mm day eto1 5 3 0 3 mm day and 4 5 mm day eto3 0 4 5 4 5 mm day and 6 mm day eto4 5 6 0 all these parameters were computed on the historical data to also take into account the frequency with which higher or lower values of evapotranspiration were observed however clustering can be adversely affected by the high dimensionality of the dataset dash and koot 2009 furthermore the optimal number of clusters is also not known a priori therefore in order to identify both the input parameters that have the greatest influence on the clustering and the optimal number of clusters a preliminary analysis based on the silhouette technique was performed silhouette is a well known technique for the interpretation and validation of coherence in clustering applications which provides a measure of how similar an object is to its cluster compared to other clusters rousseeuw 1987 shutaywi and kachouie 2021 the silhouette score ranges from 1 which indicates that the clusters are incorrectly assigned to 1 which indicates that clusters are well distinguished from each other score values close to 0 indicate that the distance between clusters is not significant the clustering process starts by considering each observation as a separate cluster then it follows an iterative process based on two main steps i the detection of a couple of clusters that are closest and ii the merge of two clusters based on a linkage criterion the process stops when all the clusters are merged the distance between two clusters has been evaluated through the manhattan distance expressed as 4 j x v i 1 c k ϵ i x k i v i where v v i i 1 c are the centers of the c clusters x k i is the k th data point belonging to the i th cluster and x k i v i is the distance between each data point and his cluster center v i with v i computed as 5 v i k 1 n i x k n i x k a i where a i represents the set of n i points related to the i th cluster therefore the manhattan distance evaluates the distance between two points by aggregating the absolute difference in pairs between each variable callahan and bridge 2021 conversely other distance formulations such as the euclidean distance aggregate the squared difference between each variable this means that if two data points are similar for most variables but different for one of them the evaluation using euclidean distance will be overly influenced by that single difference in contrast the manhattan distance will be more influenced by the similarity of the other variables being more robust and less affected by outliers to evaluate the distance between clusters the ward linkage was considered which evaluates the distance between the two clusters as the increase in the sum of squares error sse after merging two clusters into a single one expressed as 6 d r s sse rs sse r sse s where d r s is the distance between the clusters r and s the performance of the ward linkage where preliminary compared with other linkages single complete and average in particular the ward linkage led to the most robust results with the identification of clusters consistent with the climatic and morphological features of sicily single complete and average linkage led to anomalous small clusters that are not consistent with the characteristics of the island therefore the results of hierarchical clustering described in section 3 1 were obtained considering the manhattan distance combined with the ward linkage 2 5 machine learning forecasting algorithms some ml algorithms were used to develop forecasting models support vector regression svr was used for predicting tmin and tmax in the future period 2006 2100 after using historical cordex data of the same variables from 1951 to 2005 for training subsequently an ensemble model based on mlp and m5p was employed for the prediction of eto in the period 2006 2100 the bayesian optimization bo process was used for the selection of the input parameters and ml hyperparameters and for the evaluation of the optimal number of lagged values wu et al 2019 the use of optimization algorithms is widely spread in hydrological applications to improve the performance of ml algorithms di nunno et al 2022 in particular the parameters initially considered for the prediction were ra tmin and tmax the bo algorithm led to a reduction of the number of parameters including only ra and tmin however a preliminary analysis was also performed to assess the impact of tmax as a further input variable for the eto modeling this analysis showed an anomalous increase in the minimum peaks of eto inconsistent with both historical data and future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2 5 1 support vector regression svr support vector machine algorithms svms are supervised ml models used for both classification and regression problems cortes and vapnik 1995 vapnik 1998 pham et al 2022 in the latter case it is generally indicated as support vector regression svr svr has been widely applied in the prediction of hydrological variables including evapotranspiration allowing the implementation of individual or hybrid models with other ml and optimization algorithms yin et al 2017 tikhamarine et al 2020a 2020b chia et al 2022a 2022b moreover svr was also successfully applied for long term temperature forecasting aghelpour et al 2019 in agreement with its use in the present study svr algorithm aims to find a function f x with a deviation lower than a given ε value from the target y i based on the training dataset x i y i i 1 l x r where x is the input space it is necessary to solve a constrained convex optimization problem by minimizing the euclidean norm w 2 given a function f x w x b with b r and w x the optimization problem can be expressed as 7 minimize 1 2 w 2 c svr i 1 l ξ i ξ i 8 subject to y i w x i b ε ξ i w x i b y i ε ξ i with both deviation and function flatness depending on the constant c svr 0 in addition since often a significant error must be tolerated the slack variables ξ i ξ i were introduced in the constraints the svr effectiveness mainly depends on the kernel function selection the polynomial kernel was considered in this study which can be expressed as 9 k x i x j 1 x i x j d where d is the degree of the polynomial kernel bo process allowed to find the values of the constant c svr and of the degree d that led to the best predictions c svr 1 8 d 1 03 in addition the optimal lagged value of the input variables for the prediction was equal to 120 months 2 5 2 multilayer perceptron mlp multilayer perceptron mlp is a feedforward ann rosenblatt 1961 murtagh 1991 with three types of layers input hidden and output the input layer consists of a set of nodes corresponding to the input features one or more hidden layers contain neurons that process the values of the input layer based on a weighted linear sum followed by a non linear activation function then the output layer gets the outcomes from the last hidden layer providing the predicted values backpropagation learning algorithm was used for the mlp neurons training in addition the network optimal structure for the present study includes one hidden layer with a neuron number that was equal to number of input variables 1 2 with the sigmoid activation function the optimal learning and momentum rates of the backpropagation algorithm were 0 3 and 0 2 respectively 2 5 3 m5p the m5p algorithm develops prediction models based on decision trees with real numbers as target variables usually referred to as regression trees quinlan 1992 three types of nodes are included in a regression tree the root node which include the complete dataset the internal nodes which define the conditions on the input variables and the leaf nodes consisting of linear regression models of the target values m5p is based on an iterative process that divides the input dataset into subsets on which the linear regression models are built the division is performed by searching the subsets couples that lead to a maximization of the least squared deviation lsd function with 10 r t 1 n t n i t y i y m t n where r t n is the t n node within variance n is the subset units number y i is the ith target variable value and y m is the target variable mean the function ф s p t n to be maximized is expressed as 11 s p t n r t n p l r t l p r r t r with p l and p r that represent the portion units allocated to the left node t l and right node t r respectively and s p that indicate the split value granata and di nunno 2021b in addition the pruning technique is employed for the fully developed tree removing branches with a low contribution to the prediction ability this technique made it possible to reduce the tree size and avoid overfitting problems the optimization process showed that the number of instances in a leaf node to get the best predictions was 4 2 5 4 ensemble model mlp m5p in order to improve the prediction ability of the individual ml models the stacking ml technique was used to build an ensemble model based on both mlp and m5p algorithms stacking combines multiple regression or classification models by means of a meta classifier li et al 2020 which was for the present study the elastic net algorithm zou and hastie 2005 in particular the models based on the individual ml algorithms were first developed on the training dataset then based on the outcomes of each individual model the elastic net was employed to develop the ensemble model it should be noted that the parameters considered for the individual mlp and m5p algorithms were the same reported in sections 2 5 2 and 2 5 3 in addition the number of lagged values of input variables ra tmin and tmax and of eto was assessed based on the bo process finding an optimal value of 12 months for both inputs and target this means that to make a prediction at time t the values of both input and target parameters from t 12 to t 1 were taken into account 2 6 evaluation metrics in this study five different evaluation metrics were used not following the standard approach of comparing predicted and experimental values of a given quantity but comparing the eto predictions obtained from the mlp m5p hybrid model with those obtainable from the climate variables provided by the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future scenarios specifically the metrics are the coefficient of determination r2 which provides an evaluation of the linear correlation between the predictions of two models the root mean square error rmse which provides the root of the total squared difference between the predictions of two models normalized by the number of samples the mean absolute error mae equal to the absolute difference between the predictions of two models normalized by the number of samples the mean absolute percentage error mape equal to the relative difference between the predictions of two models normalized by the number of samples and the mean directional accuracy mda that compares the forecast direction upward or downward of two models providing the probability that they follow the same direction evaluation metrics can be expressed as 12 r 2 1 i 1 n f 1 t f 2 t 2 i 1 n f 2 f 2 t 2 13 rmse i 1 n f 1 t f 2 t 2 n 14 mae i 1 n f 1 t f 2 t n 15 mape i 1 n f 1 t f 2 t f 2 t n 16 mda i 1 n 1 sgn f 1 t f 1 t 1 sgn f 2 t f 2 t 1 n where f 1 t and f 2 t are the predicted values of the first and second models at time t f 1 t 1 and f 2 t 1 are the predicted values of the first and second models at time t 1 f 2 is the averaged value of the prediction for the second model and n is the total amount of forecasting data in the time series 2 7 modeling procedure the modeling procedure fig 2 consists of the following steps 1 starting from the historical time series of ra tmin and tmax 1951 2005 the calibrated hs eq 2 was used to calculate eto 2 based on the values of tmin and tmax for the future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2006 2100 and on ra the hs equation eq 2 was used to calculate the future values of eto 3 the statistical parameters of interest of the eto historical time series 1951 2005 were calculated for each data point 4 based on the parameters assessed at point 3 the homogenous eto regions were detected by means of hierarchical clustering 5 future values of tmin and tmax were predicted by means of the svr algorithm in particular the forecasting models were trained considering only the historical data 1951 2005 of tmin and tmax respectively and used for predictions in the future period 2006 2100 6 the mean values of ra tmin tmax and historical eto point 1 were calculated for each detected cluster point 4 including both historical data and prediction performed with the svr algorithm for tmin and tmax point 5 7 the mean value of eto for the future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 point 5 were calculated for each cluster point 4 8 prediction of eto based on the ensemble mlp m5p model with the mean value of ra tmin and tmax and historical eto point 6 as input parameters and the bo algorithm for the input selection 9 comparison for each cluster point 4 of the eto predicted by means of the ensemble mlp m5p model point 8 with the eto of the future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 point 7 the proposed approach provided a spatio temporal characterization of eto based on the detection of homogeneous regions and the prediction of the future eto with a comparison with different climate scenarios 3 results 3 1 clustering the optimization of the number of clusters and of the proper subset of input variables was performed based on the silhouette technique see section 2 4 as shown in table 1 the best mean silhouette score equal to 0 412 was obtained for a number of clusters equal to 3 and assuming seven input variables etomin etomean etomax eto0 1 5 eto1 5 3 0 eto3 0 4 5 eto4 5 6 0 in addition table 2 reports the mean values of eto statistics for the three clusters fig 3 provides the silhouette scores for all data points related to the three clusters in addition fig 4 provides a representation of the eto clustering of sicily obtained using the inverse distance weighting idw method as a spatial interpolation technique topçu et al 2022 with the dendrogram diagram obtained from the hierarchical clustering cluster c1 includes mainly the eastern western and southern coastal areas showing silhouette peaks of about 0 6 for the data points p182 and p185 located in the north east of the island near the strait of messina p1 in the north west close to trapani and p37 in the south west at the platani river mouth nature reserve in agrigento province in contrast the data points that show the lowest silhouette close to 0 01 are generally located on the border with cluster c2 showing a lower degree of belonging to cluster c1 in particular p105 is located in the southeast at marina di acate ragusa province while p38 is located at capo gallo natural reserve palermo province surrounded by points belonging to cluster c2 cluster c2 includes the coastal portion of the island to the north on the tyrrhenian sea as well as the inland to the southeast and northwest the highest silhouette scores of about 0 58 were computed for data points p18 and p19 along the coast and inland of the gulf of castellammare in the north west trapani province and for p150 in the inland of the syracuse province in the south east the lower silhouette score close to 0 01 was computed for data point p122 in the inland of catania province in the east of the island surrounded by points belonging to cluster c3 cluster c3 mainly covers the inland of sicily in its central and eastern parts overall the highest silhouette score was computed for c3 with values of about 0 63 for data points p57 p81 and p73 located in the inland agrigento and caltanissetta provinces the lower silhouette score close to 0 1 was instead computed for p68 located in the south of the island close to the coast and surrounded by both clusters c1 and c2 overall cluster c1 covering mainly the coasts of sicily showed higher values of etomin etomean and etomax compared to clusters c2 and c3 with also a higher frequency of months with intermediate eto between 1 5 and 3 0 mm day eto1 5 3 0 between 3 0 and 4 5 mm day eto3 0 4 5 and greater than 4 5 mm day eto4 5 6 0 in addition c1 showed higher skewness etoskew indicating a greater positive asymmetry compared to the other clusters otherwise cluster c3 which covers inland sicily showed lower values of etomin etomean and etomax with a higher frequency of months with a low eto between 0 and 1 5 mm eto0 1 5 cluster c2 showed intermediate values of the eto statistics compared to c1 and c3 with however the lower etoskew indicating a more symmetric eto distribution compared to c1 and c3 and the lower number of an intermediate eto range between 1 5 and 3 0 mm day eto1 5 3 0 it should also be noted that although no geomorphological variables have been introduced in the clustering the eto statistics implicitly take them into account for example cluster c3 which is representative of the inland extends as far as the sea both to the north west with the madonie and nebrodi mountain ranges elevation up to 1800 m a s l see fig 1a and to the west with the volcano etna elevation up to 3300 m a s l this indicates how the clusters consider not only the distance from the sea but also the morphology of the territory overall the cluster analysis provided important insights into the heterogeneity of eto both in terms of magnitude and variation across sicily at the same time clustering has led to the identification of sub regions with well defined eto characteristics within sicily which can be useful for the analysis of future eto trends on larger scales as well as providing useful hydrological and agronomic information for non instrumented areas the agricultural land use for the three clusters was also assessed fig 5 cluster c1 showed the highest percentage of permanently irrigated land 2 1 2 accounting for 6 of the cluster surface this type of land cover usually entails a high irrigation requirement as it includes irrigated arable crops which require approximately 3600 m3 ha year in sicily horticultural crops between 4000 and 6000 m3 ha year and greenhouse crops which are particularly widespread along the coasts for the production of vegetables which have the highest irrigation requirement of 12000 m3 ha year c1 showed also a higher percentage of vineyards 20 2 2 1 and olive groves 18 2 2 3 which involve irrigation demand between 1200 and 2000 m3 ha year see also section 2 1 cluster c2 showed instead a higher percentage of fruit trees 16 2 2 2 and a slightly lower percentage of olive groves 17 2 2 3 compared to cluster c1 fruit trees had higher water demands compared to vineyards and olive groves with values between 3500 and 3800 m3 ha year cluster c3 showed a higher percentage of agricultural land with low water demands non irrigated arable land 50 2 2 1 other permanent crops 6 2 2 4 which are mainly represented by the eucalyptus trees typical of the sicilian inland and pastures 8 2 3 1 overall although clusters c2 and c3 have larger agricultural surfaces cluster c1 includes the agricultural land showed a greater concentration of agricultural land with higher water demand considering that c1 is also the cluster that showed the higher values of etomin etomean and etomax compared to c2 and c3 the risk of a water deficit for the coastal areas of sicily could become increasingly marked in the future 3 2 eto analysis for the different clusters the eto mean value predictions performed using the mlp m5p ensemble model for each cluster were compared to the eto values estimated for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future scenarios cluster c1 showed a historical peak of 5 95 mm day fig 6a with a 10 year average eto showing very little change from 1951 to 1991 rising from 2 99 mm day to 3 02 mm day with a lower peak in 1961 of 2 94 mm day fig 6c over the forecast period fig 6b a significant increase in eto was observed for both extreme scenarios and the mlp m5p ensemble model the highest predicted peak value with mlp m5p was 6 50 mm day while rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 showed peak eto values of 6 88 and 6 94 mm day respectively furthermore from 2001 to 2041 the mean eto value on a 10 year scale increased from 3 07 mm day to 3 18 mm day for rcp 4 5 with an increase of 3 62 from 3 05 mm day to 3 21 mm day for rcp 8 5 with an increase of 5 32 and from 3 06 mm day to 3 20 mm day for mlp m5p with an increase of 4 34 in addition from 2041 to 2091 a further increase was observed with eto values that reached 3 30 mm day for rcp 4 5 an increase of 3 76 3 49 mm day for rcp 8 5 an increase of 8 85 and 3 38 mm day for mlp m5p an increase of 6 17 the overall increases during the forecast period from 2001 to 2091 were 7 52 for rcp 4 5 14 64 for rcp 8 5 and 10 78 for mlp m5p fig 6c thus the ensemble model resulted in intermediate predicted values between the two extreme scenarios with rcp 8 5 leading to significantly larger increases in the period 2041 2091 than rcp 4 5 the evaluation metrics table 3 also showed high agreement between rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p r2 0 97 rmse 0 28 mm day mda 99 11 and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p r2 0 97 rmse 0 27 mm day mda 98 40 cluster c2 was characterized by a historical eto peak of 5 76 mm day fig 7a lower than those estimated for cluster c1 with also a small change in the mean eto on a 10 year scale from 2 85 mm day in 1951 2 87 mm day in 1991 with a low peak in 1961 as observed for cluster c1 of 2 79 mm day fig 7c the forecast period fig 7b showed a significant eto increase with peaks of 6 66 mm day 6 67 mm day and 6 29 mm day for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively furthermore the mean eto on a 10 year scale showed percentage increases of 2 97 5 49 and 5 97 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively over the period 2001 2041 while for the period 2041 2091 the percentage increases were 4 36 9 13 and 8 30 respectively overall the increases over the forecast period between 2001 and 2091 were 7 46 15 12 and 14 77 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively fig 7c therefore the ensemble model resulted in future predictions close to rcp 8 5 which is the most extreme scenario the assessment metrics were still high but lower than in cluster c1 with r2 being 0 96 for both rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p rmse between 0 31 mm day rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 0 35 mm day rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p and an mda between 97 16 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 97 51 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p cluster c3 showed a lower historical eto peak compared to c1 and c2 equal to 5 70 mm day fig 8a however significant changes in the mean eto on a 10 year scale were also assessed from 1951 1961 a reduction in eto was estimated from 2 69 mm day to 2 62 mm day the highest peak of 2 72 mm day was computed for 1981 with the lowest eto equal to 2 70 mm day in 1991 fig 8c however the forecast period fig 8b showed an increase in eto with peaks of 6 56 mm day rcp 4 5 6 60 mm day rcp 8 5 and 6 29 mm day mlp m5p furthermore from 2001 to 2041 the 10 year average eto showed increases of 3 27 5 97 and 6 47 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively while over the period 2041 2091 the increases were 4 70 10 13 and 7 99 respectively overall the increases over the entire forecast period between 2001 and 2091 were 8 12 16 71 and 14 98 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively fig 8c thus c3 showed the lowest eto values and the highest percentage increases compared to c1 and c2 in addition as with cluster c2 the ensemble model resulted in eto predictions and trends closer to rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 the evaluation metrics values were in line with those computed for cluster c2 with r2 being 0 96 for both rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p rmse between 0 33 mm day rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 0 35 mm day rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p and an mda between 96 63 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 96 71 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p overall the metrics were in line with a recent literature study maqsood et al 2022 who investigated the future eto under different rcp climate scenarios for prince edward island canada compared the eto evaluated with the hs equation with that evaluated with three algorithms 1d cnn lstm and mlp and obtained values of r2 between 0 92 and 0 96 and rmse between 0 26 and 0 36 comparable to the metrics estimated in this study fig 9 shows maps of the mean eto obtained using the idw method for two historical decades one further back in time between 1951 and 1960 and one more recent between 1991 and 2000 in addition two future decades were also represented for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios and for the mlp m5p ensemble model one for an intermediate time horizon between 2041 and 2050 and one for the more distant time horizon between 2091 and 2100 for all decades in agreement with the previous eto analysis for the different clusters the highest and lowest values of eto were calculated for clusters c1 and c3 respectively in the decade 1951 1960 lower average eto values of 3 mm day 2 85 mm day and 2 69 mm day were observed for clusters c1 c2 and c3 respectively a slight increase was observed in the decade 1991 2000 with 3 02 mm day 2 87 mm day and 2 71 mm day for c1 c2 and c3 respectively however a significant increase can be observed during the forecast period for both climate scenarios and the ensemble model the decade 2041 2050 showed average eto values ranging from 2 97 mm day c3 to 3 19 mm day c1 for the ensemble model almost in line with those for rcp 8 5 which range from 2 92 mm day c3 to 3 21 mm day c1 however for the last decade 2091 2100 the rcp 8 5 resulted in eto values ranging from 3 21 mm day c3 to 3 49 mm day c1 which were higher than those calculated for the ensemble model ranging from 3 21 mm day c3 to 3 39 mm day c1 while rcp 4 5 resulted in lower eto values ranging from 3 02 mm day c3 to 3 30 mm day c1 3 3 eto analysis for reference data points an additional insight of this study was to analyze the predictions of the mlp m5p ensemble model for both high and low silhouette score data points for this purpose 6 data points were chosen 2 for each cluster indeed while a high silhouette score value indicates a strong belonging to a given subregion of sicily a low silhouette score may represent a borderline situation with eto trends that may differ from the typical ones observed for each cluster figs 10 and 11 show the average eto on a 10 year scale for selected data points further insight into the comparison between ensemble models and climate scenarios was provided by examining the box plots for the highest and lowest silhouette data points fig 12 showing the residuals expressed as the difference between predictions of each model with the others each box plot s lower and upper extremes indicate the 1st quartile 25th percentile and the 3rd quartile 75th percentile respectively the whiskers extend from the box bottom to the smallest non outlier and from the box top to the highest non outlier the 10 year average eto for the data points with the highest silhouette score showed an increasing trend for each cluster with mlp m5p leading to predicted values between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 however during the last investigated decades approximately from 2071 onwards mlp m5p led to predictions closer to but still slightly lower than rcp 8 5 fig 10 the evaluation metrics for the highest silhouette data points table 4 show a lower agreement between climate scenarios and the ensemble model for data point p182 cluster c1 with r2 values equal to 0 93 for both rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p rmse between 0 40 mm day rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 0 47 mm day rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p and an mda between 90 41 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p and 90 94 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p instead data points p150 cluster c2 and p57 cluster c3 show metrics in line with those computed for their clusters table 3 with r2 values between 0 96 cluster c3 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 0 97 cluster c2 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p cluster c3 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p this evidence was also confirmed by the box plots fig 12 that showed relatively higher residuals for cluster c1 compared to clusters c2 and c3 however boxes showed a narrow and symmetrical shape ranging from 0 5 mm day to 0 5 mm day with the center close to 0 for all clusters for the lowest silhouette data points mlp m5p led to predictions in line with rcp 4 5 with the extreme scenario rcp 8 5 showing far more significant increases than rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p fig 11 furthermore looking at the data points for clusters c2 and c3 the borderline nature of these points can be noted in particular point p68 cluster c3 showed higher eto averages during the historical period than those observed for point p122 cluster c2 this result disagrees with the evidence from clustering analysis and the data points with high silhouette this can be explained by the greater proximity to the coastline of point p68 compared to point p122 which led to a higher etomean for p68 however the other statistical parameters e g eto0 1 5 eto1 5 3 0 eto3 0 4 5 and eto4 5 6 0 confirmed the belonging of points p122 and p68 to clusters c2 and c3 respectively evaluation metrics for the lowest silhouette score data points table 5 showed a high agreement between rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p with r2 values between 0 97 cluster c1 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p cluster c2 rcp 4 5 mlp m5p cluster c3 rcp 4 5 mlp m5p and cluster c3 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p and 0 98 cluster c1 rcp 4 5 mlp m5p and cluster c2 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p rmse between 0 25 mm day cluster c1 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p and 0 32 mm day cluster c3 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p and mda between 96 71 cluster c1 rcp 4 5 mlp m5p and 97 69 cluster c2 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p the high agreement between climate scenarios and the ensemble model was also confirmed by the box plots that appeared narrower compared to the box plots related to points with high silhouette scores fig 12 overall the evaluation metrics calculated for low silhouette data points were in line with or even higher than those calculated for high on the one hand this result confirms the tendency of the ensemble model to provide forecasts in line with future scenarios for points characterized by more certain and uncertain inclusion in clusters on the other hand a slightly lower eto difference was observed between the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future climate scenarios for lower silhouette data points compared to those with higher silhouette this feature is particularly evident when comparing high and low silhouette data points for cluster c1 for which a marked difference in eto was observed between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 consequently the ensemble model which led to intermediate scenarios between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 showed slightly worse metrics for high silhouette data points however the differences between low and high silhouette data points were less marked for cluster c2 and even less so for cluster c3 highlighting a lower variability of eto with the future climate scenarios for the inland of sicily c3 also showed the lower values of etostd and etoskew overall increasing eto values were observed for both future climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and based on the mlp m5p model predictions from this perspective increasingly careful management of water resources is crucial in order to avoid severe water deficits especially during the irrigation seasons therefore an accurate prediction of hydrological and agronomic variables will have to be combined with an optimization of the irrigation systems and strategies which are often obsolete in southern italy giuliani et al 2019 consequently the promotion of localized irrigation techniques e g micro irrigation and drip irrigation systems in the context of the current climate change scenario together with agricultural reuse strategies of treated wastewater aiello et al 2007 ventura et al 2019 could have a great future impact on both actual evapotranspiration and management of surface and groundwater resources pool et al 2021 vanella et al 2021 however it must be pointed out that this study only focuses on a region with a mediterranean climate in order to overcome this limitation it will be interesting in future studies to test the developed approach for the long term prediction of reference evapotranspiration in different climates where larger or smaller variations in evapotranspiration can be observed over the seasons in addition the combination of the mohc hadgem2 es as gcm and clmcom cclm4 8 17 as rcm was considered in this study a comparison with other regional and global climate models could be considered in future research a further interesting future application of the implemented methodology could concern the assessment of crop evapotranspiration taking into account the typical crops with both high and low water demands this would also help to better highlight similarities and differences in reference and crop evapotranspiration trends for a given area of investigation from this perspective different ml or deep learning algorithms could be included in the forecast procedure in order to improve the reliability of the evapotranspiration prediction furthermore different clustering algorithms in addition to the hierarchical one could be tested to improve the identification of homogeneous regions based on reference and crop evapotranspiration features finally although the calibrated hargreaves samani equation has proven to be reliable in the assessment of eto for well instrumented study areas and more generally for areas where an appropriate calibration of the empirical hargreaves coefficient is not available it might be interesting to test the developed approach to investigate the spatio temporal variability of the reference evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation for the eto evaluation 4 conclusion this study provided an extensive spatio temporal analysis of the evolutionary trends of reference evapotranspiration in sicily eto was first assessed with the hargreaves samani equation calibrated for the study area based on historical data and two future climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the hierarchical algorithm was used to divide sicily into three homogeneous regions each characterized by specific evapotranspiration features support vector regression was used to forecast tmin and tmax for the period 2006 2100 while an ensemble model based on mlp and m5p was developed for the eto prediction in the same period then the eto calculated with the hs equation for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future climate scenarios were compared with the forecasting performed with the ensemble mlp m5p model an increasing eto trend was observed for all three clusters with the highest values predicted for cluster c1 along the coast and an overall increase from 2001 to 2091 of 7 52 for rcp 4 5 14 64 for rcp 8 5 and 10 78 for mlp m5p the lowest values were instead estimated for cluster c3 which however was characterized by the highest percentage increases of eto during the forecast period amounting to 8 12 16 71 and 14 98 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively the cluster analysis also showed a higher concentration of agricultural land with higher water demand along the coast particularly for cluster c1 which also showed the highest eto values this outcome suggests an increased risk of water deficit for the coastal areas of sicily in the future the mlp m5p ensemble model resulted in future eto values intermediate between climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 with the latter showing the highest values of eto in all clusters overall the mlp m5p ensemble model trained on the basis of the historical data of both eto and temperatures resulted in intermediate trends between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios proving to be particularly suitable for evapotranspiration predictions in both coastal and inland areas the developed approach based on the combination of clustering and forecasting algorithms provides a concise and reliable assessment of eto trends and identifies different homogeneous regions as the methodology requires a limited number of climate variables it can be a powerful tool for improving future water resource management planning 5

9031,in years of increasing impact of climate change effects a reliable characterization of the spatiotemporal evolutionary dynamics of evapotranspiration can enable a significant improvement in water resource management especially as regards irrigation activities sicily an insular region of southern italy has exceptionally valuable agricultural production and high irrigation needs in this study the eto reference evapotranspiration in sicily was first evaluated on the basis of historical and future climate parameters referring for future values to two climate scenarios characterized by different representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 then the hierarchical algorithm was used to divide sicily into three homogeneous regions each characterized by specific eto features in addition some machine learning ml algorithms were used to develop forecasting models based on only historical data support vector regression svr was used to predict the future values of tmin and tmax while an ensemble model based on multilayer perceptron mlp and m5p regression tree was developed for the eto forecasting predictions made with the ensemble mlp m5p model were compared with the eto computed for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future climate scenarios during the forecast period from 2001 to 2091 evapotranspiration increases were observed for all three clusters for cluster c1 along the coast percentage increases of 7 52 14 64 and 10 78 were computed for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively while for cluster c3 in the inland percentage increases were higher and equal to 8 12 16 71 and 14 98 respectively the ensemble mlp m5p model led to intermediate trends between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 showing a high correlation with the latter r2 between 0 93 and 0 98 the developed approach based on both clustering and forecasting algorithms provided a comprehensive analysis of the reference evapotranspiration with the detection of the different homogeneous regions and at the same time the evaluation of the evapotranspiration trends both in coastal and inland areas keywords climate change artificial intelligence algorithms clustering ensemble models mediterranean climate irrigation planning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration is one of the main processes in the water cycle and its assessment plays an essential role in water resource management however given the complexity involved with direct measurement the estimation of evapotranspiration is commonly based on meteorological data which allows the estimation of the eto reference evapotranspiration the physical based penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 which combines radiometric and aerodynamic parameters is recommended by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao for the eto evaluation in different climates worldwide fan et al 2016 however climate change is affecting the hydrological cycle and its effects will be probably more dangerous for arid and semi arid climates characterized by low rainfalls and high temperatures goyal and gaur 2022 therefore a spatio temporal analysis of the future evapotranspiration trends may be crucial for predicting imbalances in regional hydrologic supply and enhancing water resources management yang et al 2020 the considerable variety of climates worldwide can lead to very different eto trends depending on the local climatic features chaouche et al 2010 investigated the spatio temporal evolution of eto for a mediterranean climate area of france showing increasing trends more marked close to the coast pandey and khare 2018 and prăvălie et al 2019 also detected an increasing eto trend for the humid tropical climate of the narmada river watershed india and for the temperate continental climate of romania respectively jerin et al 2021 investigated the reference evapotranspiration trends for the tropical monsoon climate of bangladesh showing how over the period 1980 2015 increasing and decreasing trends can be observed during the monsoon and dry periods respectively however the authors highlighted a decreasing trend for the annual eto different literature studies show a decreasing trend for semi arid she et al 2017 xu et al 2018 and arid areas of china li et al 2017 however fu et al 2022 investigated the terrestrial evapotranspiration trends at china s land scale showing a significant linear increasing trend since 2000 for 87 03 of the study area considering all agricultural regions of china estimating eto using the penman monteith equation over large areas is often complicated by the lack of sufficiently widespread measurement stations for climate variables this problem can be overcome by relying on the results of projects based on the combination of several global climate models gcms and regional climate models rcms which provide climatic variables in most regions of the world with different spatio temporal resolutions and different climate scenarios these allow an evaluation of present and future evapotranspiration even in poorly gauged areas examples of these projects are the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex gutowski et al 2016 and coupled model intercomparison project cmip eyring et al 2016 in the last decades ml based models proved to be able to provide accurate predictions of hydrological variables including evapotranspiration with the advantage of a high computational speed without the need to define analytical relationships between exogenous variables inputs and targets di nunno and granata 2020 granata and di nunno 2021a furthermore in recent years in order to improve the forecasting accuracy of ml algorithms the research has been oriented toward the development of deep learning models e g one dimensional convolutional neural network and long short term memory network chia et al 2022a 2022b and ensemble or hybrid models tikhamarine et al 2019 karbasi et al 2022 malik et al 2022 however investigations on future evapotranspiration trends through a comparison between the eto evaluated on the basis of future data of the climatic variables and the ml approach are to date still very little debated yin et al 2017 investigated the future variability of eto using two ml algorithms extreme learning machine elm and svr in a mountainous inland watershed in north west china the authors considered eight gcms from the cmip5 under two rcp climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 they showed how both elm and svr methods are characterized by good performance in estimating the eto for the future period 2010 2099 maqsood et al 2022 investigated the response of eto under three rcp climate scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 using the second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 in particular the authors estimated eto for western central and eastern parts of prince edward island canada using the hargreaves equation with tmax and tmin for three future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 then the authors employed three different artificial neural networks anns algorithms one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn long short term memory lstm and mlp for the eto estimation showing good accuracy kadkhodazadeh et al 2022 analyzed the eto trends for the period 2021 2050 at nine stations in the two basins of lake urmia and sefidrood iran in particular the authors evaluated eto by the penman monteith equation based on three different cmip6 global climate models then they carried out an eto modeling implementing six ml algorithms multiple linear regression mlr multiple non linear regression mnlr multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model tree m5 m5 random forest rf and least squares boost lsboost with promising results a forecast model of the future eto can be valid for a more or less large area as long as the area is characterized by a certain homogeneity of the features affecting the eto homogeneous evapotranspiration regions can be identified by means of clustering algorithms xing et al 2016 applied the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof clustering method to identify homogenous regions of eto in china based on the annual eto times series from 602 stations for the period 1961 2011 masanta and vemavarapu 2020 detected eighteen homogeneous eto regions in india using a fuzzy dynamic clustering approach with climate variables as predictors chen et al 2020 applied the k means clustering algorithm for the eto analysis in northeast plain china the authors used the daily average values of maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity extraterrestrial radiation and solar radiation to group all weather stations with the clustering algorithm hobeichi et al 2021 also applied the k means algorithm on a global scale with the detected clusters that included three wet and three dry regimes and provided an approximation of köppen geiger climate classes the aim of this study is to provide a characterization of the eto trends in sicily southern italy based on a spatio temporal analysis a step by step description of the modeling procedure is provided in section 2 7 sicily has exceptionally valuable agricultural production and also high irrigation requirements in the context of scarcity of water resources an accurate assessment of future trends in evapotranspiration is crucial to evaluate the impact of climate change on surface water availability in mediterranean climate areas such as sicily liuzzo et al 2015 investigated the effect of climate change on water resource availability for a sub basin of belice catchment sicily showing how the decreasing trends of precipitation involved a decrease in surface and groundwater resources with the latter enhanced by the potential evapotranspiration changing the authors also highlighted the impact on the reservoir management for garcia lake sicily showing how in the future the reservoir will no longer be able to satisfy the water demands this will lead to the need to reduce both agricultural water demand through more efficient irrigation systems and water leakages which chronically affect water supply systems in southern italy viola et al 2016 also investigated the future evapotranspiration runoff relationship scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for one of the largest sicilian basins the imera meridionale river basin showing that future evapotranspiration changing will lead to a sharp reduction of the runoff as the reference evapotranspiration and temperature increase and the precipitation reduces varotsos et al 2021 investigated the implication of climate change on the agricultural sector of three mediterranean islands sicily crete and cyprus based on the euro cordex data and the two scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 authors showed marked changing in the average maximum and minimum temperatures during the period 2031 and 2060 with however a less pronounced reduction of the total precipitation the authors highlighted the impact of these variations on the main crops cultivated in the three islands in particular the expected warming mostly in spring and summer might expose the crops to an adverse impact on the plants phenological stages affecting both production and quality for example for the olive tree widespread in large areas of sicily the temperature increases can lead to positive effects on trunk and fruit growth however climate change can bring also negative impacts on flowering bud differentiation which requires an appropriate low temperature period and the increase of olive fly infestations reducing final yield and quality moreover future climate projections represent extreme conditions corresponding to assumed emission scenarios but conditioned by future environmental policies and certainly affected by significant uncertainty further considerable uncertainty is due to the complexity of global and regional models yin et al 2017 in this scenario the ml based models which are relatively simple to develop on the basis of historical data alone can provide reliable alternative forecasting tools which are also useful for validating the results of the more complex gcms and rcms or highlighting their discrepancies a study of the spatio temporal evolution of regional reference evapotranspiration over the long term based on clustering and ml algorithms with subsequent comparison of the results with extreme climate scenarios is certainly novel compared to the current literature the issue takes on even greater importance for the area investigated in this study sicily where climate change can significantly increase the risk of desertification in this context the clustering results in addition to allowing the recognition of homogeneous eto areas were analyzed in context with the agricultural land use to correlate the reference evapotranspiration with the different crop water demands allowing the identification of the most sensitive areas in terms of potential future water deficit from this point of view reliable future eto forecasting is crucial although the mlp algorithm has recently been applied by maqsood et al 2022 to investigate the eto trends under different future climate scenarios the ensemble model based on mlp and m5p algorithms for the eto prediction besides being a further element of novelty aimed at significantly improving the performance of individual algorithms which are not always able to provide satisfactory predictions especially for long term forecast horizons therefore this study aims to overcome the limitations of the existing literature on the reference evapotranspiration prediction in sicily proposing a combined clustering forecasting approach that can provide useful information for the present and future management of water resources for different purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sicily is the largest island in the mediterranean sea and has a typical mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and mild wet winters moreover especially along the southwestern coast the african anticyclone brings frequent and marked temperature increases benedetto and giordano 2008 fig 1a during the winter the average temperature varies from 4 c in the inland province of enna to 9 7 c and 11 5 c on the west coast of trapani and the northeast coast of messina respectively during the summer the average temperature varies from about 28 c inland to about 30 along the coast rainfall is higher along the east coast with 709 mm of annual precipitation in 109 rainy days for messina compared to the west coast with 446 mm of annual precipitation in 88 rainy days in trapani in addition inland areas showed lower annual precipitation than the coast with 358 mm of annual precipitation on 69 rainy days for the city of enna however annual rainfall is far below the national average one of the main economic activities of the region is agriculture with more than 1 600 000 ha of agricultural land corresponding to about 64 of sicily s total surface fig 1b provides the agricultural land cover of sicily based on corine coordination of information on the environment land cover data for the year 2018 with the 3 level nomenclature fruit trees which cover 11 of agricultural land are mostly concentrated along the east coast and particularly in the province of catania vineyards and olive groves which cover 9 and 12 of agricultural land respectively are more widespread along the west coast permanently irrigated lands which include greenhouses cover only 4 of the agricultural land and are more widespread in the southeastern part of the island in addition 48 of agricultural land is represented by non irrigated arable land which includes rainfed and sporadically irrigated land with non permanent devices in addition to agricultural land use the factor that plays a key role in the management of water resources is the irrigation requirements of each crop these also vary considerably from area to area in sicily depending on the climatic and pedological conditions vineyards require from 1200 to 1800 m3 ha year going from the provinces of caltanissetta and ragusa south east to the province of palermo north west respectively great variability is also observed for olive groves which require from about 1200 m3 ha year for the provinces of caltanissetta ragusa and the northern portion of trapani west to about 2000 m3 ha year for the provinces of catania palermo and the southern portion of trapani fruits trees require about 3500 m3 ha year for the whole region with the only exception of the catania province where the greatest presence of orchards is observed for which 3800 m3 ha year are indicated regione sicilia 2010 however it should be seriously considered that the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle have been observed in recent years related to rising average temperatures and evapotranspiration rates leading to a significant increase in irrigation demands viola et al 2014 this together with the reduced availability of surface water and groundwater is related to the negative rainfall trend which leads to an increased risk of desertification on the island liuzzo et al 2015 2 2 dataset minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperature grid data from the cordex project were used in this study the cordex platform was developed by the world climate research program wcrp with the aim of providing high resolution climate datasets in several locations around the world gutowski et al 2016 specifically the cordex experiments consist of simulations representing different future socio economic scenarios based on different combinations of rcms and gcms the gcm model used was the mohc hadgem2 es developed by the met office hadley centre mohc with the hadgem2 family of configurations including the earth system es components like dynamic vegetation ocean biology and atmospheric chemistry the hadgem2 physical model includes improvements designed to address specific systematic errors found in the previous climate configuration hadgem1 related to continental temperature biases of the northern hemisphere and tropical sea surface the hadgem2 development team 2011 the rcm model was the clmcom cclm4 8 17 for the european domain eur 11 clmcom 2017 since climate features like temperature and rainfall are highly spatially variable due to the rather complex orography of sicily forestieri et al 2018a peres et al 2020 the bias correction included in the gcm model allowed to reduce the errors between the observed and simulated hydrological data based on cordex climate models as demonstrated in several literature studies in other mediterranean areas piani et al 2010 dosio 2016 forestieri et al 2018b demonstrated the capability of cordex models to reproduce extreme rainfall measured at different stations in sicily peres et al 2020 also investigated the skill of several euro cordex rcms with grid size of 0 11 in reproducing the seasonal temperature and precipitation regime for calabria and sicily showing higher performances for temperature which is the variable considered in the present study with respect to precipitation moreover the combination of the two climate models regional and global has recently led to an accurate analysis of climate change in eastern greece and in particular on the island of crete which has a climate similar to that of sicily markantonis et al 2022 two extreme rcp scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were considered as climate projections rcps are greenhouse gas concentration trajectories adopted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc rcp 4 5 is an intermediate scenario with emissions peaking around 2040 and declining until 2100 rcp 4 5 can be regarded as the most likely scenario as it considers the exhaustible nature of non renewable fuels höök et al 2010 rcp 8 5 represents the worst case climate change scenario as it considers an increase in emissions throughout the 21st century the spatial resolution of the dataset grid was equal to 0 11 with 186 gridded data points covering the entire island fig 1a the dataset spans from 1951 to 2005 for historical data and from 2006 to 2100 for the rcp scenarios with a monthly time scale in addition to tmin and tmax the extraterrestrial radiation ra was computed for each gridded data point from 1951 to 2100 expressed as 1 r a 24 60 π g sc d r ω s sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ sin ω s where gsc is the solar constant dr is the inverse relative distance earth sun ωs is the sunset hour angle φ is the latitude and δ is the solar declination zotarelli et al 2013 2 3 reference evapotranspiration in order to calculate the monthly average daily reference evapotranspiration eto the hargreaves samani he equation was used hargreaves and samani 1985 expressed as 2 et 0 c r a t max t min 2 17 8 t max t min where c is the empirical hargreaves coefficient the main advantage of this equation compared to the more complex penman monteith model is that it only requires extraterrestrial radiation and the time series of the minimum and maximum temperature di nunno and granata 2020 elbeltagi et al 2020 however the accuracy in the estimation of eto depends on the value of the empirical coefficient c which can vary significantly depending on the morphoclimatic characteristics of the study area mendicino and senatore 2013 proposed a regionalization of the hargreaves coefficient with different equations for each subregion of southern italy the authors showed how a properly calibrated hs equation provides better performances than the original hs furthermore in comparison to the well known fao penman monteith equation which however requires several parameters for the eto calculation the calibrated hs equation led to very close eto estimation for many locations in southern italy including about 40 measurement stations located throughout sicily for the evaluation of the empirical hargreaves coefficient c in sicily mendicino and senatore 2013 proposed the following equation 3 c 1 10 5 t 2 0 0004 t 0 0049 where t is the average value computed for each data point of the difference between tmax and tmin in particular the calculated value of c for the 186 gridded points ranged from 0 0017 and 0 0038 with the higher values along the coast in particular in the south of the region and the lowest values in the south eastern inland see fig 1a therefore the calibrated hs equation was used to evaluate both the historical eto from 1951 to 2005 and the future eto for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios from 2006 to 2100 considering the individually calculated values of both c and ra for each grid point 2 4 clustering procedure clustering can be defined as a classification process of a large dataset into a smaller number of groups therefore data belonging to the same cluster have common characteristics while data belonging to different clusters are characterized by some heterogeneity barton et al 2016 recently the hierarchical clustering algorithm has found application for various hydrological analyses aladaileh et al 2019 xulu et al 2019 neto et al 2021 the advantages of hierarchical clustering compared to other algorithms such as k means are that the number of clusters does not have to be determined prior to clustering and that the process can be evaluated with the aid of a dendrogram chart which can be used to better understand the overall picture in which the data are clustered berhanu et al 2015 the hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to divide the study area into homogeneous areas several statistical parameters of the time series of eto were preliminary considered as inputs for the clustering procedure the minimum mean and maximum values of the eto etomin etomean etomax respectively the eto standard deviation mode and skewness etostd etomode and etoskew respectively the number of months with eto between 0 and 1 5 mm day eto0 1 5 1 5 mm day and 3 mm day eto1 5 3 0 3 mm day and 4 5 mm day eto3 0 4 5 4 5 mm day and 6 mm day eto4 5 6 0 all these parameters were computed on the historical data to also take into account the frequency with which higher or lower values of evapotranspiration were observed however clustering can be adversely affected by the high dimensionality of the dataset dash and koot 2009 furthermore the optimal number of clusters is also not known a priori therefore in order to identify both the input parameters that have the greatest influence on the clustering and the optimal number of clusters a preliminary analysis based on the silhouette technique was performed silhouette is a well known technique for the interpretation and validation of coherence in clustering applications which provides a measure of how similar an object is to its cluster compared to other clusters rousseeuw 1987 shutaywi and kachouie 2021 the silhouette score ranges from 1 which indicates that the clusters are incorrectly assigned to 1 which indicates that clusters are well distinguished from each other score values close to 0 indicate that the distance between clusters is not significant the clustering process starts by considering each observation as a separate cluster then it follows an iterative process based on two main steps i the detection of a couple of clusters that are closest and ii the merge of two clusters based on a linkage criterion the process stops when all the clusters are merged the distance between two clusters has been evaluated through the manhattan distance expressed as 4 j x v i 1 c k ϵ i x k i v i where v v i i 1 c are the centers of the c clusters x k i is the k th data point belonging to the i th cluster and x k i v i is the distance between each data point and his cluster center v i with v i computed as 5 v i k 1 n i x k n i x k a i where a i represents the set of n i points related to the i th cluster therefore the manhattan distance evaluates the distance between two points by aggregating the absolute difference in pairs between each variable callahan and bridge 2021 conversely other distance formulations such as the euclidean distance aggregate the squared difference between each variable this means that if two data points are similar for most variables but different for one of them the evaluation using euclidean distance will be overly influenced by that single difference in contrast the manhattan distance will be more influenced by the similarity of the other variables being more robust and less affected by outliers to evaluate the distance between clusters the ward linkage was considered which evaluates the distance between the two clusters as the increase in the sum of squares error sse after merging two clusters into a single one expressed as 6 d r s sse rs sse r sse s where d r s is the distance between the clusters r and s the performance of the ward linkage where preliminary compared with other linkages single complete and average in particular the ward linkage led to the most robust results with the identification of clusters consistent with the climatic and morphological features of sicily single complete and average linkage led to anomalous small clusters that are not consistent with the characteristics of the island therefore the results of hierarchical clustering described in section 3 1 were obtained considering the manhattan distance combined with the ward linkage 2 5 machine learning forecasting algorithms some ml algorithms were used to develop forecasting models support vector regression svr was used for predicting tmin and tmax in the future period 2006 2100 after using historical cordex data of the same variables from 1951 to 2005 for training subsequently an ensemble model based on mlp and m5p was employed for the prediction of eto in the period 2006 2100 the bayesian optimization bo process was used for the selection of the input parameters and ml hyperparameters and for the evaluation of the optimal number of lagged values wu et al 2019 the use of optimization algorithms is widely spread in hydrological applications to improve the performance of ml algorithms di nunno et al 2022 in particular the parameters initially considered for the prediction were ra tmin and tmax the bo algorithm led to a reduction of the number of parameters including only ra and tmin however a preliminary analysis was also performed to assess the impact of tmax as a further input variable for the eto modeling this analysis showed an anomalous increase in the minimum peaks of eto inconsistent with both historical data and future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2 5 1 support vector regression svr support vector machine algorithms svms are supervised ml models used for both classification and regression problems cortes and vapnik 1995 vapnik 1998 pham et al 2022 in the latter case it is generally indicated as support vector regression svr svr has been widely applied in the prediction of hydrological variables including evapotranspiration allowing the implementation of individual or hybrid models with other ml and optimization algorithms yin et al 2017 tikhamarine et al 2020a 2020b chia et al 2022a 2022b moreover svr was also successfully applied for long term temperature forecasting aghelpour et al 2019 in agreement with its use in the present study svr algorithm aims to find a function f x with a deviation lower than a given ε value from the target y i based on the training dataset x i y i i 1 l x r where x is the input space it is necessary to solve a constrained convex optimization problem by minimizing the euclidean norm w 2 given a function f x w x b with b r and w x the optimization problem can be expressed as 7 minimize 1 2 w 2 c svr i 1 l ξ i ξ i 8 subject to y i w x i b ε ξ i w x i b y i ε ξ i with both deviation and function flatness depending on the constant c svr 0 in addition since often a significant error must be tolerated the slack variables ξ i ξ i were introduced in the constraints the svr effectiveness mainly depends on the kernel function selection the polynomial kernel was considered in this study which can be expressed as 9 k x i x j 1 x i x j d where d is the degree of the polynomial kernel bo process allowed to find the values of the constant c svr and of the degree d that led to the best predictions c svr 1 8 d 1 03 in addition the optimal lagged value of the input variables for the prediction was equal to 120 months 2 5 2 multilayer perceptron mlp multilayer perceptron mlp is a feedforward ann rosenblatt 1961 murtagh 1991 with three types of layers input hidden and output the input layer consists of a set of nodes corresponding to the input features one or more hidden layers contain neurons that process the values of the input layer based on a weighted linear sum followed by a non linear activation function then the output layer gets the outcomes from the last hidden layer providing the predicted values backpropagation learning algorithm was used for the mlp neurons training in addition the network optimal structure for the present study includes one hidden layer with a neuron number that was equal to number of input variables 1 2 with the sigmoid activation function the optimal learning and momentum rates of the backpropagation algorithm were 0 3 and 0 2 respectively 2 5 3 m5p the m5p algorithm develops prediction models based on decision trees with real numbers as target variables usually referred to as regression trees quinlan 1992 three types of nodes are included in a regression tree the root node which include the complete dataset the internal nodes which define the conditions on the input variables and the leaf nodes consisting of linear regression models of the target values m5p is based on an iterative process that divides the input dataset into subsets on which the linear regression models are built the division is performed by searching the subsets couples that lead to a maximization of the least squared deviation lsd function with 10 r t 1 n t n i t y i y m t n where r t n is the t n node within variance n is the subset units number y i is the ith target variable value and y m is the target variable mean the function ф s p t n to be maximized is expressed as 11 s p t n r t n p l r t l p r r t r with p l and p r that represent the portion units allocated to the left node t l and right node t r respectively and s p that indicate the split value granata and di nunno 2021b in addition the pruning technique is employed for the fully developed tree removing branches with a low contribution to the prediction ability this technique made it possible to reduce the tree size and avoid overfitting problems the optimization process showed that the number of instances in a leaf node to get the best predictions was 4 2 5 4 ensemble model mlp m5p in order to improve the prediction ability of the individual ml models the stacking ml technique was used to build an ensemble model based on both mlp and m5p algorithms stacking combines multiple regression or classification models by means of a meta classifier li et al 2020 which was for the present study the elastic net algorithm zou and hastie 2005 in particular the models based on the individual ml algorithms were first developed on the training dataset then based on the outcomes of each individual model the elastic net was employed to develop the ensemble model it should be noted that the parameters considered for the individual mlp and m5p algorithms were the same reported in sections 2 5 2 and 2 5 3 in addition the number of lagged values of input variables ra tmin and tmax and of eto was assessed based on the bo process finding an optimal value of 12 months for both inputs and target this means that to make a prediction at time t the values of both input and target parameters from t 12 to t 1 were taken into account 2 6 evaluation metrics in this study five different evaluation metrics were used not following the standard approach of comparing predicted and experimental values of a given quantity but comparing the eto predictions obtained from the mlp m5p hybrid model with those obtainable from the climate variables provided by the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future scenarios specifically the metrics are the coefficient of determination r2 which provides an evaluation of the linear correlation between the predictions of two models the root mean square error rmse which provides the root of the total squared difference between the predictions of two models normalized by the number of samples the mean absolute error mae equal to the absolute difference between the predictions of two models normalized by the number of samples the mean absolute percentage error mape equal to the relative difference between the predictions of two models normalized by the number of samples and the mean directional accuracy mda that compares the forecast direction upward or downward of two models providing the probability that they follow the same direction evaluation metrics can be expressed as

t and f 2 t are the predicted values of the first and second models at time t f 1 t 1 and f 2 t 1 are the predicted values of the first and second models at time t 1 f 2 is the averaged value of the prediction for the second model and n is the total amount of forecasting data in the time series 2 7 modeling procedure the modeling procedure fig 2 consists of the following steps 1 starting from the historical time series of ra tmin and tmax 1951 2005 the calibrated hs eq 2 was used to calculate eto 2 based on the values of tmin and tmax for the future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2006 2100 and on ra the hs equation eq 2 was used to calculate the future values of eto 3 the statistical parameters of interest of the eto historical time series 1951 2005 were calculated for each data point 4 based on the parameters assessed at point 3 the homogenous eto regions were detected by means of hierarchical clustering 5 future values of tmin and tmax were predicted by means of the svr algorithm in particular the forecasting models were trained considering only the historical data 1951 2005 of tmin and tmax respectively and used for predictions in the future period 2006 2100 6 the mean values of ra tmin tmax and historical eto point 1 were calculated for each detected cluster point 4 including both historical data and prediction performed with the svr algorithm for tmin and tmax point 5 7 the mean value of eto for the future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 point 5 were calculated for each cluster point 4 8 prediction of eto based on the ensemble mlp m5p model with the mean value of ra tmin and tmax and historical eto point 6 as input parameters and the bo algorithm for the input selection 9 comparison for each cluster point 4 of the eto predicted by means of the ensemble mlp m5p model point 8 with the eto of the future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 point 7 the proposed approach provided a spatio temporal characterization of eto based on the detection of homogeneous regions and the prediction of the future eto with a comparison with different climate scenarios 3 results 3 1 clustering the optimization of the number of clusters and of the proper subset of input variables was performed based on the silhouette technique see section 2 4 as shown in table 1 the best mean silhouette score equal to 0 412 was obtained for a number of clusters equal to 3 and assuming seven input variables etomin etomean etomax eto0 1 5 eto1 5 3 0 eto3 0 4 5 eto4 5 6 0 in addition table 2 reports the mean values of eto statistics for the three clusters fig 3 provides the silhouette scores for all data points related to the three clusters in addition fig 4 provides a representation of the eto clustering of sicily obtained using the inverse distance weighting idw method as a spatial interpolation technique topçu et al 2022 with the dendrogram diagram obtained from the hierarchical clustering cluster c1 includes mainly the eastern western and southern coastal areas showing silhouette peaks of about 0 6 for the data points p182 and p185 located in the north east of the island near the strait of messina p1 in the north west close to trapani and p37 in the south west at the platani river mouth nature reserve in agrigento province in contrast the data points that show the lowest silhouette close to 0 01 are generally located on the border with cluster c2 showing a lower degree of belonging to cluster c1 in particular p105 is located in the southeast at marina di acate ragusa province while p38 is located at capo gallo natural reserve palermo province surrounded by points belonging to cluster c2 cluster c2 includes the coastal portion of the island to the north on the tyrrhenian sea as well as the inland to the southeast and northwest the highest silhouette scores of about 0 58 were computed for data points p18 and p19 along the coast and inland of the gulf of castellammare in the north west trapani province and for p150 in the inland of the syracuse province in the south east the lower silhouette score close to 0 01 was computed for data point p122 in the inland of catania province in the east of the island surrounded by points belonging to cluster c3 cluster c3 mainly covers the inland of sicily in its central and eastern parts overall the highest silhouette score was computed for c3 with values of about 0 63 for data points p57 p81 and p73 located in the inland agrigento and caltanissetta provinces the lower silhouette score close to 0 1 was instead computed for p68 located in the south of the island close to the coast and surrounded by both clusters c1 and c2 overall cluster c1 covering mainly the coasts of sicily showed higher values of etomin etomean and etomax compared to clusters c2 and c3 with also a higher frequency of months with intermediate eto between 1 5 and 3 0 mm day eto1 5 3 0 between 3 0 and 4 5 mm day eto3 0 4 5 and greater than 4 5 mm day eto4 5 6 0 in addition c1 showed higher skewness etoskew indicating a greater positive asymmetry compared to the other clusters otherwise cluster c3 which covers inland sicily showed lower values of etomin etomean and etomax with a higher frequency of months with a low eto between 0 and 1 5 mm eto0 1 5 cluster c2 showed intermediate values of the eto statistics compared to c1 and c3 with however the lower etoskew indicating a more symmetric eto distribution compared to c1 and c3 and the lower number of an intermediate eto range between 1 5 and 3 0 mm day eto1 5 3 0 it should also be noted that although no geomorphological variables have been introduced in the clustering the eto statistics implicitly take them into account for example cluster c3 which is representative of the inland extends as far as the sea both to the north west with the madonie and nebrodi mountain ranges elevation up to 1800 m a s l see fig 1a and to the west with the volcano etna elevation up to 3300 m a s l this indicates how the clusters consider not only the distance from the sea but also the morphology of the territory overall the cluster analysis provided important insights into the heterogeneity of eto both in terms of magnitude and variation across sicily at the same time clustering has led to the identification of sub regions with well defined eto characteristics within sicily which can be useful for the analysis of future eto trends on larger scales as well as providing useful hydrological and agronomic information for non instrumented areas the agricultural land use for the three clusters was also assessed fig 5 cluster c1 showed the highest percentage of permanently irrigated land 2 1 2 accounting for 6 of the cluster surface this type of land cover usually entails a high irrigation requirement as it includes irrigated arable crops which require approximately 3600 m3 ha year in sicily horticultural crops between 4000 and 6000 m3 ha year and greenhouse crops which are particularly widespread along the coasts for the production of vegetables which have the highest irrigation requirement of 12000 m3 ha year c1 showed also a higher percentage of vineyards 20 2 2 1 and olive groves 18 2 2 3 which involve irrigation demand between 1200 and 2000 m3 ha year see also section 2 1 cluster c2 showed instead a higher percentage of fruit trees 16 2 2 2 and a slightly lower percentage of olive groves 17 2 2 3 compared to cluster c1 fruit trees had higher water demands compared to vineyards and olive groves with values between 3500 and 3800 m3 ha year cluster c3 showed a higher percentage of agricultural land with low water demands non irrigated arable land 50 2 2 1 other permanent crops 6 2 2 4 which are mainly represented by the eucalyptus trees typical of the sicilian inland and pastures 8 2 3 1 overall although clusters c2 and c3 have larger agricultural surfaces cluster c1 includes the agricultural land showed a greater concentration of agricultural land with higher water demand considering that c1 is also the cluster that showed the higher values of etomin etomean and etomax compared to c2 and c3 the risk of a water deficit for the coastal areas of sicily could become increasingly marked in the future 3 2 eto analysis for the different clusters the eto mean value predictions performed using the mlp m5p ensemble model for each cluster were compared to the eto values estimated for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future scenarios cluster c1 showed a historical peak of 5 95 mm day fig 6a with a 10 year average eto showing very little change from 1951 to 1991 rising from 2 99 mm day to 3 02 mm day with a lower peak in 1961 of 2 94 mm day fig 6c over the forecast period fig 6b a significant increase in eto was observed for both extreme scenarios and the mlp m5p ensemble model the highest predicted peak value with mlp m5p was 6 50 mm day while rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 showed peak eto values of 6 88 and 6 94 mm day respectively furthermore from 2001 to 2041 the mean eto value on a 10 year scale increased from 3 07 mm day to 3 18 mm day for rcp 4 5 with an increase of 3 62 from 3 05 mm day to 3 21 mm day for rcp 8 5 with an increase of 5 32 and from 3 06 mm day to 3 20 mm day for mlp m5p with an increase of 4 34 in addition from 2041 to 2091 a further increase was observed with eto values that reached 3 30 mm day for rcp 4 5 an increase of 3 76 3 49 mm day for rcp 8 5 an increase of 8 85 and 3 38 mm day for mlp m5p an increase of 6 17 the overall increases during the forecast period from 2001 to 2091 were 7 52 for rcp 4 5 14 64 for rcp 8 5 and 10 78 for mlp m5p fig 6c thus the ensemble model resulted in intermediate predicted values between the two extreme scenarios with rcp 8 5 leading to significantly larger increases in the period 2041 2091 than rcp 4 5 the evaluation metrics table 3 also showed high agreement between rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p r2 0 97 rmse 0 28 mm day mda 99 11 and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p r2 0 97 rmse 0 27 mm day mda 98 40 cluster c2 was characterized by a historical eto peak of 5 76 mm day fig 7a lower than those estimated for cluster c1 with also a small change in the mean eto on a 10 year scale from 2 85 mm day in 1951 2 87 mm day in 1991 with a low peak in 1961 as observed for cluster c1 of 2 79 mm day fig 7c the forecast period fig 7b showed a significant eto increase with peaks of 6 66 mm day 6 67 mm day and 6 29 mm day for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively furthermore the mean eto on a 10 year scale showed percentage increases of 2 97 5 49 and 5 97 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively over the period 2001 2041 while for the period 2041 2091 the percentage increases were 4 36 9 13 and 8 30 respectively overall the increases over the forecast period between 2001 and 2091 were 7 46 15 12 and 14 77 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively fig 7c therefore the ensemble model resulted in future predictions close to rcp 8 5 which is the most extreme scenario the assessment metrics were still high but lower than in cluster c1 with r2 being 0 96 for both rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p rmse between 0 31 mm day rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 0 35 mm day rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p and an mda between 97 16 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 97 51 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p cluster c3 showed a lower historical eto peak compared to c1 and c2 equal to 5 70 mm day fig 8a however significant changes in the mean eto on a 10 year scale were also assessed from 1951 1961 a reduction in eto was estimated from 2 69 mm day to 2 62 mm day the highest peak of 2 72 mm day was computed for 1981 with the lowest eto equal to 2 70 mm day in 1991 fig 8c however the forecast period fig 8b showed an increase in eto with peaks of 6 56 mm day rcp 4 5 6 60 mm day rcp 8 5 and 6 29 mm day mlp m5p furthermore from 2001 to 2041 the 10 year average eto showed increases of 3 27 5 97 and 6 47 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively while over the period 2041 2091 the increases were 4 70 10 13 and 7 99 respectively overall the increases over the entire forecast period between 2001 and 2091 were 8 12 16 71 and 14 98 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively fig 8c thus c3 showed the lowest eto values and the highest percentage increases compared to c1 and c2 in addition as with cluster c2 the ensemble model resulted in eto predictions and trends closer to rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 the evaluation metrics values were in line with those computed for cluster c2 with r2 being 0 96 for both rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p rmse between 0 33 mm day rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 0 35 mm day rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p and an mda between 96 63 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 96 71 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p overall the metrics were in line with a recent literature study maqsood et al 2022 who investigated the future eto under different rcp climate scenarios for prince edward island canada compared the eto evaluated with the hs equation with that evaluated with three algorithms 1d cnn lstm and mlp and obtained values of r2 between 0 92 and 0 96 and rmse between 0 26 and 0 36 comparable to the metrics estimated in this study fig 9 shows maps of the mean eto obtained using the idw method for two historical decades one further back in time between 1951 and 1960 and one more recent between 1991 and 2000 in addition two future decades were also represented for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios and for the mlp m5p ensemble model one for an intermediate time horizon between 2041 and 2050 and one for the more distant time horizon between 2091 and 2100 for all decades in agreement with the previous eto analysis for the different clusters the highest and lowest values of eto were calculated for clusters c1 and c3 respectively in the decade 1951 1960 lower average eto values of 3 mm day 2 85 mm day and 2 69 mm day were observed for clusters c1 c2 and c3 respectively a slight increase was observed in the decade 1991 2000 with 3 02 mm day 2 87 mm day and 2 71 mm day for c1 c2 and c3 respectively however a significant increase can be observed during the forecast period for both climate scenarios and the ensemble model the decade 2041 2050 showed average eto values ranging from 2 97 mm day c3 to 3 19 mm day c1 for the ensemble model almost in line with those for rcp 8 5 which range from 2 92 mm day c3 to 3 21 mm day c1 however for the last decade 2091 2100 the rcp 8 5 resulted in eto values ranging from 3 21 mm day c3 to 3 49 mm day c1 which were higher than those calculated for the ensemble model ranging from 3 21 mm day c3 to 3 39 mm day c1 while rcp 4 5 resulted in lower eto values ranging from 3 02 mm day c3 to 3 30 mm day c1 3 3 eto analysis for reference data points an additional insight of this study was to analyze the predictions of the mlp m5p ensemble model for both high and low silhouette score data points for this purpose 6 data points were chosen 2 for each cluster indeed while a high silhouette score value indicates a strong belonging to a given subregion of sicily a low silhouette score may represent a borderline situation with eto trends that may differ from the typical ones observed for each cluster figs 10 and 11 show the average eto on a 10 year scale for selected data points further insight into the comparison between ensemble models and climate scenarios was provided by examining the box plots for the highest and lowest silhouette data points fig 12 showing the residuals expressed as the difference between predictions of each model with the others each box plot s lower and upper extremes indicate the 1st quartile 25th percentile and the 3rd quartile 75th percentile respectively the whiskers extend from the box bottom to the smallest non outlier and from the box top to the highest non outlier the 10 year average eto for the data points with the highest silhouette score showed an increasing trend for each cluster with mlp m5p leading to predicted values between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 however during the last investigated decades approximately from 2071 onwards mlp m5p led to predictions closer to but still slightly lower than rcp 8 5 fig 10 the evaluation metrics for the highest silhouette data points table 4 show a lower agreement between climate scenarios and the ensemble model for data point p182 cluster c1 with r2 values equal to 0 93 for both rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p rmse between 0 40 mm day rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 0 47 mm day rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p and an mda between 90 41 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p and 90 94 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p instead data points p150 cluster c2 and p57 cluster c3 show metrics in line with those computed for their clusters table 3 with r2 values between 0 96 cluster c3 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and 0 97 cluster c2 rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p and rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p cluster c3 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p this evidence was also confirmed by the box plots fig 12 that showed relatively higher residuals for cluster c1 compared to clusters c2 and c3 however boxes showed a narrow and symmetrical shape ranging from 0 5 mm day to 0 5 mm day with the center close to 0 for all clusters for the lowest silhouette data points mlp m5p led to predictions in line with rcp 4 5 with the extreme scenario rcp 8 5 showing far more significant increases than rcp 4 5 and mlp m5p fig 11 furthermore looking at the data points for clusters c2 and c3 the borderline nature of these points can be noted in particular point p68 cluster c3 showed higher eto averages during the historical period than those observed for point p122 cluster c2 this result disagrees with the evidence from clustering analysis and the data points with high silhouette this can be explained by the greater proximity to the coastline of point p68 compared to point p122 which led to a higher etomean for p68 however the other statistical parameters e g eto0 1 5 eto1 5 3 0 eto3 0 4 5 and eto4 5 6 0 confirmed the belonging of points p122 and p68 to clusters c2 and c3 respectively evaluation metrics for the lowest silhouette score data points table 5 showed a high agreement between rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p with r2 values between 0 97 cluster c1 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p cluster c2 rcp 4 5 mlp m5p cluster c3 rcp 4 5 mlp m5p and cluster c3 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p and 0 98 cluster c1 rcp 4 5 mlp m5p and cluster c2 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p rmse between 0 25 mm day cluster c1 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p and 0 32 mm day cluster c3 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p and mda between 96 71 cluster c1 rcp 4 5 mlp m5p and 97 69 cluster c2 rcp 8 5 mlp m5p the high agreement between climate scenarios and the ensemble model was also confirmed by the box plots that appeared narrower compared to the box plots related to points with high silhouette scores fig 12 overall the evaluation metrics calculated for low silhouette data points were in line with or even higher than those calculated for high on the one hand this result confirms the tendency of the ensemble model to provide forecasts in line with future scenarios for points characterized by more certain and uncertain inclusion in clusters on the other hand a slightly lower eto difference was observed between the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future climate scenarios for lower silhouette data points compared to those with higher silhouette this feature is particularly evident when comparing high and low silhouette data points for cluster c1 for which a marked difference in eto was observed between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 consequently the ensemble model which led to intermediate scenarios between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 showed slightly worse metrics for high silhouette data points however the differences between low and high silhouette data points were less marked for cluster c2 and even less so for cluster c3 highlighting a lower variability of eto with the future climate scenarios for the inland of sicily c3 also showed the lower values of etostd and etoskew overall increasing eto values were observed for both future climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and based on the mlp m5p model predictions from this perspective increasingly careful management of water resources is crucial in order to avoid severe water deficits especially during the irrigation seasons therefore an accurate prediction of hydrological and agronomic variables will have to be combined with an optimization of the irrigation systems and strategies which are often obsolete in southern italy giuliani et al 2019 consequently the promotion of localized irrigation techniques e g micro irrigation and drip irrigation systems in the context of the current climate change scenario together with agricultural reuse strategies of treated wastewater aiello et al 2007 ventura et al 2019 could have a great future impact on both actual evapotranspiration and management of surface and groundwater resources pool et al 2021 vanella et al 2021 however it must be pointed out that this study only focuses on a region with a mediterranean climate in order to overcome this limitation it will be interesting in future studies to test the developed approach for the long term prediction of reference evapotranspiration in different climates where larger or smaller variations in evapotranspiration can be observed over the seasons in addition the combination of the mohc hadgem2 es as gcm and clmcom cclm4 8 17 as rcm was considered in this study a comparison with other regional and global climate models could be considered in future research a further interesting future application of the implemented methodology could concern the assessment of crop evapotranspiration taking into account the typical crops with both high and low water demands this would also help to better highlight similarities and differences in reference and crop evapotranspiration trends for a given area of investigation from this perspective different ml or deep learning algorithms could be included in the forecast procedure in order to improve the reliability of the evapotranspiration prediction furthermore different clustering algorithms in addition to the hierarchical one could be tested to improve the identification of homogeneous regions based on reference and crop evapotranspiration features finally although the calibrated hargreaves samani equation has proven to be reliable in the assessment of eto for well instrumented study areas and more generally for areas where an appropriate calibration of the empirical hargreaves coefficient is not available it might be interesting to test the developed approach to investigate the spatio temporal variability of the reference evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation for the eto evaluation 4 conclusion this study provided an extensive spatio temporal analysis of the evolutionary trends of reference evapotranspiration in sicily eto was first assessed with the hargreaves samani equation calibrated for the study area based on historical data and two future climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the hierarchical algorithm was used to divide sicily into three homogeneous regions each characterized by specific evapotranspiration features support vector regression was used to forecast tmin and tmax for the period 2006 2100 while an ensemble model based on mlp and m5p was developed for the eto prediction in the same period then the eto calculated with the hs equation for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future climate scenarios were compared with the forecasting performed with the ensemble mlp m5p model an increasing eto trend was observed for all three clusters with the highest values predicted for cluster c1 along the coast and an overall increase from 2001 to 2091 of 7 52 for rcp 4 5 14 64 for rcp 8 5 and 10 78 for mlp m5p the lowest values were instead estimated for cluster c3 which however was characterized by the highest percentage increases of eto during the forecast period amounting to 8 12 16 71 and 14 98 for rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and mlp m5p respectively the cluster analysis also showed a higher concentration of agricultural land with higher water demand along the coast particularly for cluster c1 which also showed the highest eto values this outcome suggests an increased risk of water deficit for the coastal areas of sicily in the future the mlp m5p ensemble model resulted in future eto values intermediate between climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 with the latter showing the highest values of eto in all clusters overall the mlp m5p ensemble model trained on the basis of the historical data of both eto and temperatures resulted in intermediate trends between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios proving to be particularly suitable for evapotranspiration predictions in both coastal and inland areas the developed approach based on the combination of clustering and forecasting algorithms provides a concise and reliable assessment of eto trends and identifies different homogeneous regions as the methodology requires a limited number of climate variables it can be a powerful tool for improving future water resource management planning 5

9032,irrigation is an important means of ensuring sustainable agricultural production and therefore is critical for realizing sustainable development goals however the persistence drought caused by climate change can deplete water resources and affect the irrigated agricultural crops negatively understanding changes in crop irrigation water requirement iwr and its meteorological driving factors can thus provide key information for long term water resources management and agricultural planning this is particularly true for high water consuming crops in arid and semi arid regions we investigated the trends of cotton iwr at several temporal scales monthly annual and growth stages for the period of 1961 2020 based on the trend free pre whitening mann kendall method the major meteorological factors including relative contributions of reference crop evapotranspiration eto and precipitation to cotton iwr were further examined using multiple linear regression and pearson correlation analysis results showed that the average annual cotton iwr exhibited a significant decreasing trend over the study period but a shift occurred after 1992 an area of increased cotton iwr was primarily located in southern xinjiang moreover the inter annual fluctuation of iwr at the mid season stage was larger than at the other growth stages and that in northern xinjiang was larger than in southern xinjiang a statistically significant decrease in monthly iwr occurred over the entire growing season except during the planting stage eto was the dominant factor affecting cotton iwr even though average annual precipitation showed a long term increasing trend with a rate of change of 0 615 mm year p 0 01 relative humidity and wind speed were the two main factors affecting cotton iwr in xinjiang due to the strong correlation with eto demand for irrigation water was greatest during june to august when the relative contribution of eto was more than 80 followed by september our findings demonstrated that the temporal pattern of eto should be given greater attention when planning for wise and efficient use of regional water resources and for designing irrigation systems graphical

water scarcity has become increasingly prominent as global climate changes and population increases li et al 2020b yang et al 2021 wwap 2021 irrigation is responsible for approximately 70 of the global water withdrawal döll and siebert 2002 gleick 2014 zhang et al 2021 and accounts for as much as 90 of the water withdrawal in some arid regions of asia india pakistan and northwestern china shen et al 2013 ding et al 2017 wwap 2021 the availability of agricultural irrigation water is thus critical to insure sustainable agricultural production and is closely related to sustainable development goals i e sdg6 however global warming and the cultivation of high water consuming crops pose a threat to sustainable agricultural production cotton is the most essential natural fiber source for human beings but its cultivation and production have often had negative effects on local water resources and the environment due to the greater intensity of water consumption than observed for other crops shen et al 2020 gedik and avinc 2020 zhang et al 2021 thus understanding the variations of irrigation water requirements iwr for cotton and its dominant meteorological factors is particularly important for the cultivation and water management of cotton china is the world s largest cotton producer accounting for one quarter of the world s cotton production usda 2021 more than 80 of china s cotton production comes from xinjiang specifically planted area and yield for cotton in xinjiang accounted for 78 95 and 87 33 respectively of china s planted area and yield in 2020 nbsc 2021 the arid climate and large iwr of cotton have resulted in unprecedented pressure on water resources in xinjiang crop evapotranspiration etc the product of the crop coefficient kc and reference evapotranspiration eto based on the fao method and precipitation during crop growth periods are two key hydrological components of the water balance associated with water output and input respectively dominating crop iwr ye et al 2014 xu et al 2021 however global warming that has occurred in the climate system over past decades and centuries can increase eto and crop water demand guo and shen 2016 sun et al 2018 li et al 2020b additionally the warming climate can accelerate atmospheric circulation and the hydrological cycle and affect regional precipitation and the water resource system zhang et al 2012 2015 malek et al 2018 thereby reducing crop yields by affecting the carrying capacity of agricultural water resources qi et al 2021 many recent studies have shown that rising global temperatures have also been accompanied by changes in other climatic variables such as relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation tabari et al 2011 ipcc 2013 xinjiang is an extremely sensitive region in terms of response to global climate change wang et al 2020 these changes will cause great uncertainties with respect to the variation of iwr for cotton thus it is necessary to further study the relationship between crop iwr and climate driving factors especially in the context of a warmer wetter climate trend in xinjiang chen et al 2014 deng et al 2014 wang et al 2020 in recent years considerable evidence has shown that changes in precipitation varied with regions and exhibited certain temporal variability li et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 sang et al 2020 changes in eto are found to be closely related to meteorological driving factors for example in eastern china a reduction in net radiation was the main reason for a decrease in eto zhang et al 2010 however in northeast china such as heilongjiang province eto was greatly affected by sunshine duration and average wind speed hu et al 2021 in northwest china variations in eto were dominated by changes in wind speed dong et al 2019 additionally an inverse relationship between temperature and eto was observed in a warming climate and this is known as the evaporation paradox phenomenon brutsaert and parlange 1998 li et al 2014 xing et al 2016 qin et al 2021 these reports provide the basic knowledge for understanding the trends in dry wet climate conditions however these studies also underscore uncertainties that exist in understanding the driving forces of eto as well as the significant challenges for regional water resource planning and irrigation system design due to spatial and temporal variability these concerns have partly motivated this study the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal changes of cotton iwr in xinjiang during 1961 2020 at multiple scales and 2 clarify the trend of meteorological factors and their contributions to cotton iwr in order to more completely understand the relative contributions of eto and p to the variation of cotton iwr and to reveal the driving forces of cotton iwr this information will aid in comprehensively understanding the present changes in water conditions and in managing agricultural water resources in xinjiang 2 data and methods 2 1 study area xinjiang is located in northwest china and covers an area of approximately 1 66 million km2 the two largest deserts in china i e the taklimakan desert and the gurbantünggüt desert are located in xinjiang xinjiang is characterized by three mountain ranges from north to south the altai mountains the tianshan mountains and the kunlun mountains and two basins the junggar basin and the tarim basin between the mountain ranges the tianshan mountains divide xinjiang into two parts southern xinjiang and northern xinjiang fig 1 these mountains play an important role in the distribution of perceptible atmospheric water vapor in xinjiang because the water vapor of xinjiang mainly comes from the west northwest and north and lesser effects of the east asian monsoon ling et al 2013 xu et al 2016 huang et al 2017 the typical continental monsoon climate produces an arid environment characterized by severe water shortages in xinjiang the average annual precipitation in xinjiang is only 127 mm but the average annual evapotranspiration is greater than 1000 mm annual sunshine duration is up to 3000 h the average annual temperature is approximately 8 c wang et al 2020 xinjiang cotton is mainly planted on both sides of the tianshan mountains and the periphery of the tarim basin fig 1 the unique climate conditions and advantages such as long sunshine duration and wide daily temperature range make this region an important cotton producing region in china the sowing date generally started in april while the harvest began at the end of september in this region wang et al 2016 xue et al 2018 the planted area and yield of cotton in xinjiang in 2020 reached 2502 kha and 5161 kt respectively nbsc 2021 2 2 data meteorological data for this study were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn operated by the national meteorological information centre nmic these data include daily maximum minimum and mean temperature c relative humidity at 2 m height wind speed m s 1 at 10 m height sunshine duration h atmospheric pressure hpa and precipitation mm from 53 meteorological stations during 1961 2020 in xinjiang the data have been subjected to rigorous quality control by the nmic and additionally tested for outliers and errors before implementing the project database wu et al 2022 after identifying spatially explicit data and evaluating county level statistics for the cotton planting areas in xinjiang and after excluding stations with many missing values 33 effective stations located in and around the cotton growing area remained for analysis most of these stations overlap with the agro meteorological experiment stations from the nmic where cotton or other crops is the underlying surface a few missing data values were interpolated based on a regression relationship with data from neighboring stations a brief characterization of the climate along the cotton growing season in xinjiang was provided as fig s3 cotton phenology data were also obtained from the nmic cotton planted area data were collected from the xinjiang statistical yearbook and china statistical yearbook the spatial distribution data of cotton planting was from the international food policy research institute ifpri https dataverse harvard edu global spatially disaggregated crop production statistics data for 2010 version 2 0 yu et al 2020 2 3 cotton irrigation water requirements crop growth mainly depends on the water available for meeting etc demand as a supplemental source of water for maintaining crop growth the iwr is the amount of water that needs to be supplemented to fully satisfy crop water demand when other water terms including precipitation capillary rise and soil water storage variation are insufficient pereira et al 2020 thus a soil water balance at a selected time period can be expresses as 1 i w r e t c p s w var c r d p r o where iwr is the irrigation requirements mm etc is crop water requirements mm p is precipitation mm swvar is the soil water storage variation mm cr is the capillary rise mm dp is deep percolation from the soil root zone mm and ro is runoff mm considering that the focus of this study is to investigate the effects of climate change on cotton iwr and we thus assumed that cotton growth was under no water stress and not affected by crop variety and or other management practices i e under an optimal and well watered crop condition in this case swvar cr dp and ro can be not taken into account meanwhile effective precipitation pe mm should be used instead of the actual precipitation due to the water availability thus the soil water balance can be simplified as the difference between etc and pe that is 2 i w r cotton e t c p e where iwrcotton is cotton irrigation water requirement mm adopting the single crop coefficient method recommended by fao 56 method etc can be calculated by multiplying eto by a dimensionless crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2020 3 e t c k c e t 0 where eto is reference evapotranspiration mm here kc was determined using the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 the entire cotton growing season was divided into four stages the initial stage the crop development stage the mid season stage and the late season stage the specific date and growth periods for each growth stages were obtained from the occurring range and median date of the observed growing degree days gdd for the diverse growth stages see supplementary materials for details and the literature values fu et al 2009 wang et al 2016 xue et al 2018 kc varies with local climate irrigation and other management conditions since cotton growth was assumed under an optimal and well watered condition crop evapotranspiration is mainly attributed to soil surface evaporation during the initial stage allen et al 1998 kc ini was thus based on the value recommended by fao i e kc ini 0 35 in this study the values of kc mid and kc end were optimized by adjusting to local climate conditions at each site for the different years of this study the daily kc values during the other growth stages were derived by considering three constants i e kc ini kc mid and kc end the specific values of kc at different growth stages were calculated as 4 k c m i d k c m i d t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 5 k c e n d k c e n d t a

table 1 shows the multi year average of kc values and corresponding growth periods for cotton that were used for the different crop stages in the present study allen et al 1998 yang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 notably the same growth period length was adopted in this research and the diversity of crop variety was not taken into consideration however growth periods of cotton in northern xinjiang and southern xinjiang were distinguished as well kc values daily reference evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman monteith method for grass recommended by fao allen et al 1998 and the

irrigation water requirements at multiple scales the annual average iwr of cotton was 791 mm during 1961 2020 in xinjiang exhibiting a significant decreasing trend with a mean change rate of 1 589 mm year p 0 01 iwr decreased with time in the years before 1992 when the iwr change rate was greater 2 791 mm year but an obvious increasing trend with a change rate of 1 963 mm year occurred after 1992 fig 2 similar to the annual trend cotton iwr showed a significant decrease with time for the four different growth stages and shifts occurred after the 1990 s in 1988 during the initial stage however the magnitudes of the shifts were not uniform the downward trend and the shift were more pronounced at the mid season stage when the change rates were 0 765 mm year during 1961 1992 and 1 418 mm year during 1993 2020 in contrast the trend in iwr was relatively gentle at the initial stage 0 086 mm year over the study period the daily iwr ranges were 1 6 8 1 mm d 1 and 1 3 7 4 mm d 1 in northern xinjiang and southern xinjiang respectively the lowest iwr values were observed at the initial stage and the highest values were observed at the mid season stage fig 3 these results were consistent with observations based on eddy covariance in xinjiang reported by yang et al 2016 at the monthly scale fig 2b the decreasing trends of iwr were statistically significant during may september but not for april considering that irrigation and other management factors were ignored in this study the above results indicated that climate effects resulted in more and more severe pressure on irrigation water use in xinjiang in the most recent 20 years and xinjiang will likely face more serious challenges in terms of agricultural water management and agricultural production in the future especially at the mid season stage iwr accounted for almost half of the total iwr during the entire growing season 49 7 crop water shortage during this period will have a great influence on cotton growth and yield the large increase in iwr after 1992 resulted in great uncertainties regarding how to ensure high yields and indicated that it is particularly necessary to optimize irrigation scheduling for cotton in order to mitigate and adapt to the current climate change moreover the inter annual fluctuation of iwr at the mid season stage was larger than at the other growth stages especially in northern xinjiang fig 3 suggesting that agricultural stakeholders should give more attention to irrigation systems used in northern xinjiang during this period in addition cotton acreage in xinjiang increased exponentially during 1961 2020 fig s4 according to shen et al 2013 changes in planting structure caused a large increase in iwr and raised water supply risk during 1989 2010 the continuous expansion of the planted area of cotton in the most recent 20 years will exacerbate the risk situation drastig et al 2016 in order to examine the spatial variation of iwr we calculated the trends of annual iwr at each individual station and employed the spatial interpolation technique the greater annual iwr values 800 mm were mainly located in kashgar of southern xinjiang and in tacheng of northern xinjiang while the lower annual iwr values were observed in changji of northern xinjiang 500 mm meanwhile we found that most tendencies for annual iwr were negative in xinjiang specifically 27 of the 33 stations had negative trends in cotton iwr i e 81 8 of all stations of which there were 22 stations with statistically significant trends p 0 05 only one station had a positive trend value in northern xinjiang and the other five stations with positive trends were located in southern xinjiang indicating that there was great spatial heterogeneity in the trends of annual iwr in southern xinjiang fig 4 3 2 spatial and temporal variation of eto and p without considering irrigation eto and precipitation were the two key parameters of the water budget for influencing iwr as a key indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand eto determines the consumptive water use or water demand of crops and thus influences application of irrigation water to crops over the past 60 years mean annual eto experienced a significant decreasing trend of 1 487 mm year p 0 01 in xinjiang fig 5a similar to the trend of iwr there were two distinct periods in the change of eto from 1961 to 2020 a large decreasing eto trend was found before 1992 3 716 mm year and an obvious increasing trend occurred after that 3 251 mm year similar eto trends have been observed in other regions such as in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin in southwest and southeast china liu et al 2016 she et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 qin et al 2021 average annual precipitation exhibited an inverse trend compared with eto i e a long term increasing trend with a change rate of 0 615 mm year p 0 01 moreover a dominant monotonic trend was observed from 1961 to 2020 fig 5b however the trend of precipitation change was more moderate than that of eto and annual precipitation ranged from 65 mm to 163 mm monthly eto had a decreasing trend in all months except in february and march fig 5c a significant trend occurred during almost the entire cotton growing season may to october the change in monthly precipitation over time showed an increase in all months but the trend was significant only in may and august during the growing season these results verified that the temporal patterns of eto and precipitation should be given more attention when planning for regional water resources and designing irrigation systems the annual eto was 1182 mm during 1961 2020 in xinjiang with the higher value observed along the edge of tarim river 1200 mm and the lowest value also observed in changji of northern xinjiang 1000 the spatial variation of annual eto was similar to the spatial variation of iwr there were 26 stations i e 79 of all stations where a decreasing trend was detected and most stations i e 77 of stations with negative trends had statistically significant decreases these stations were mainly located in the areas north and south of the tianshan mountains among the stations showing positive trends only five stations had significant increasing trends at the 95 confidence level the annual precipitation in southern xinjiang with less than 100 mm was lower than that in northern xinjiang but the trends at all of the stations showed a consistent increase of which more than 73 of stations i e 24 stations exhibited statistically significant trends fig 6 3 3 contributions of eto and p to iwr both the positive precipitation effect and the negative eto effect contributed to the decreasing of iwr and to the relieving of pressure on local water resources little research has been conducted to reveal the relative contributions of eto and precipitation to changes of iwr in xinjiang eto had a greater impact on cotton iwr than precipitation accounting for about 85 1 of the total decrease while increased precipitation only accounted for 14 9 of the iwr change during 1961 2020 moreover eto was the dominant factor during the entire growing season and the contribution of eto was lowest at the initial growth stage due to low crop transpiration at this stage allen et al 1998 hou et al 2022 however the contribution of eto during this stage was still more than 60 fig 7 july and august were the months with the greatest iwr and the contribution of eto to iwr was greater than 80 during these two months two sub periods 1961 1992 and 1993 2020 were identified based on the change point of temporal variations in eto fig 8 shows the spatial characteristics of the relative contributions of eto and precipitation to cotton iwr for 1961 1992 and 1993 2020 as well as the average contribution rate for the entire region in different time periods eto overwhelming affected the trend of iwr compared with precipitation in the early period the contribution of eto to iwr varied from 65 3 to 99 6 among the various stations the average contribution rate was 83 7 and there were no stations where precipitation was the dominant factor the highest contribution rate was observed at naomaohu located in northern xinjiang a similar result was found in the later period 1993 2020 the contribution rate of eto in 1961 1992 was slightly higher than in 1993 2020 and lower than that in the overall time period of 1961 2020 the contribution rate of eto was clearly higher than that of precipitation in all three time periods fig 8c thus the spatial patterns of the relative effects of eto and precipitation were relatively consistent across analysis periods and regions 3 4 driving forces of cotton iwr as described in section 2 3 eto p and kc are the three most direct factors affecting iwr fig 9 shows that there was little change in kc during 1961 2020 the coefficients of variation for kc mid and kc end in northern xinjiang were 0 011and 0 010 respectively and 0 014 and 0 015 in southern xinjiang these results were consistent with previous studies by yang et al 2016 and hou et al 2022 and also reported in similar geographic areas e g central asia khaydar et al 2021 thus most of the variation in cotton iwr could be attributed to eto and precipitation however the variation ranges of kc values in northern xinjiang were larger than that in southern xinjiang due to greater variations among different stations meanwhile important to note that the upper values of kc mid in northern xinjiang were more than 1 30 due to the higher kc mid values at several individual stations which may be related to the effects of local advection allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021 kc will be larger under windy arid and semiarid conditions due to the effects aerodynamic and surface conductance coupled with local advection even reaching 1 40 for tall healthy and well watered vegetation as indicated by pereira et al 2021 another possibility for the higher kc is the oasis effect due to high surface heterogeneity for example wang et al 2019 reported that the contribution of the oasis effect to kc was as high as above 50 in an irrigated vineyard in arid northwest china however higher kc with above 1 40 needs to be caution on the weather data used and the data handling procedures according to allen et al 1998 eto depends on meteorological factors including temperature tmean tmin tmax relative humidity rh wind speed ws and sunshine duration sd to better understand the key climatic factors influencing cotton iwr we further conducted correlation analyses between iwr and eight factors i e tmean tmin tmax rh ws sd eto and p by using the pearson correlation coefficient method the correlation coefficient between eto and cotton iwr was 0 99 while the correlation coefficient between p and iwr was 0 40 fig 10 in addition to these two direct driving factors rh and ws also had a great influence on iwr with correlation coefficients of 0 75 and 0 74 respectively rh and ws had relatively stronger correlations with eto than did the three temperature factors with iwr 0 45 0 44 0 40 for tmean tmin tmax respectively fig 10 a great amount of evidence has previously shown that decreased wind speed and sunshine duration and the increased rh can potentially cause decreases in eto gui et al 2021 hu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 although temperature increases fig s5 can increase eto meanwhile it needs to be pointed out that ws was one of the most influential climatic variable related to eto variability not only in xinjiang presented by this study but also other regions with different climates in china for example in the semi arid and sub humid regions e g the yellow river basin zhang et al 2015 she et al 2017 the loess plateau region zhao et al 2014 and the north china plain yang et al 2021 ws was investigated as a major contributing factor controlling the change of eto in northeast china dominated by a sub humid climate e g in the west liao river basin gao et al 2017 and in heilongjiang province hu et al 2021 ws was examined as the second most significant factor for the decrease in eto likewise in southwestern china with a humid climate wind speed was the dominant variable for change of eto liu et al 2016 even wind speed was the most influential climatic variable related to eto variability at a national scale in china wang et al 2017 gui et al 2021 this is mainly because china is located in the monsoon climate zone while winter and summer monsoon in the past 50 years was weakening zhao et al 2014 the decreasing intensity of the east asian winter and summer monsoons played a significant role in reducing wind speed meanwhile accompanying the changes of atmospheric circulation the reduction of ws can weaken the surface atmosphere energy exchange intensity liu et al 2016 however wang et al 2017 also reported that wind speed exhibited the highest contribution rate in arid northwest china these results further verified an indication of the intensification of the regional hydrological cycle 4 summary and conclusions this study investigated spatial and temporal changes in cotton iwr and identified its meteorological driving forces focusing on the relative contributions of eto and precipitation to iwr in xinjiang the most important cotton farming region in china generally cotton iwr had a significant decreasing trend during 1961 2020 1 589 mm year while a remarkable increase in iwr occurred in 1993 2020 this result was consistent with the trends observed for eto moreover similar trends occurred at all four cotton growth stages the lowest iwr values were observed at the initial stage and the highest occurred at the mid season stage the decrease in monthly iwr was statistically significant over the entire growing season however increased precipitation did not play a substantial role in reducing cotton iwr or in alleviating agricultural water stress in xinjiang due to a non significant increase in cotton growing season precipitation over the time of the study temporal variability in iwr poses new challenges for agricultural water management in xinjiang in particular the large inter annual fluctuation in iwr at the mid season stage should be given more attention in northern xinjiang although precipitation and eto were the main factor affecting cotton iwr eto was related to rh and ws eto showed a dominant influence on the trend of iwr due to increased rh and decreased ws moreover the contribution rate of eto to iwr was greater than the contribution rate of precipitation to iwr over the entire growing season in particular iwr showed an increase due to increased eto in the most recent 20 years 1992 2020 thereby putting more severe pressure on irrigation water use in xinjiang although water saving irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation controlled alternate partial root zone irrigation and deficit irrigation have been applied to improve irrigation efficiency zhang et al 2018 ning et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the large increase in cotton acreage poses a substantial impact on iwr and local water resources therefore it is urgent to adjust the planting structure of cotton in xinjiang from the perspective of water security our research provides a scientific basis for optimizing irrigation systems and adjusting irrigation schedules in response to climate change in xinjiang as well as for allocating agricultural water resources however some challenges and uncertainties always exist in estimating irrigation water requirements and some assumptions are necessary the results presented in this study are subjective to the following assumptions firstly the fixed dates for the diverse crop growth stages during 1961 2020 were used the method was widely applied when estimating the long term crop iwr shen et al 2013 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2021 liu et al 2022 meanwhile the crop growth stages in this study were defined by considering the range and median date of cotton growth stages based on observed data from the nmic which can lessen the shortcoming of this method the estimated results were also consistent with previous reports yang et al 2016 hou et al 2022 secondly the definition of kc value was another source of uncertainties considering the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of climate change the effects of crop variety irrigation and or other management practices on cotton iwr were not considered i e an optimal and well watered condition for cotton growth was assumed thus kc ini was defined based on the fao recommended value 0 35 not by using a soil water balance of the evaporation layer considering wetting frequency of soil surface allen et al 1998 2011 pereira et al 2021 meanwhile the adjustment of kc mid and kc end with fao 56 to the local climate was used to define the local kc for the daily etc predictions however we adopted the method by adjusting cotton crop coefficients during the corresponding growth stages at each site and in each year to improve the reliability of the results on the whole when the focus is on the more accurate estimation of iwr these constraints will be non negligible moreover other ways on more accurate estimation crop iwr including to use the cumulative growing degree days or heat units gdd to derive the date of diverse crop growth stages should be considered fortunately our aim is to investigate the long term trends and the impacts of climate change on these trends hence the estimated results based on these assumptions were acceptable which can provide the needed valuable information for local irrigation management additionally an adequate irrigation environment can act as a reference condition from the penman monteith method when estimating eto allen 1996 thus our results can provide a helpful information on crop water use and then to serve to guide and improve irrigation planning declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9032,irrigation is an important means of ensuring sustainable agricultural production and therefore is critical for realizing sustainable development goals however the persistence drought caused by climate change can deplete water resources and affect the irrigated agricultural crops negatively understanding changes in crop irrigation water requirement iwr and its meteorological driving factors can thus provide key information for long term water resources management and agricultural planning this is particularly true for high water consuming crops in arid and semi arid regions we investigated the trends of cotton iwr at several temporal scales monthly annual and growth stages for the period of 1961 2020 based on the trend free pre whitening mann kendall method the major meteorological factors including relative contributions of reference crop evapotranspiration eto and precipitation to cotton iwr were further examined using multiple linear regression and pearson correlation analysis results showed that the average annual cotton iwr exhibited a significant decreasing trend over the study period but a shift occurred after 1992 an area of increased cotton iwr was primarily located in southern xinjiang moreover the inter annual fluctuation of iwr at the mid season stage was larger than at the other growth stages and that in northern xinjiang was larger than in southern xinjiang a statistically significant decrease in monthly iwr occurred over the entire growing season except during the planting stage eto was the dominant factor affecting cotton iwr even though average annual precipitation showed a long term increasing trend with a rate of change of 0 615 mm year p 0 01 relative humidity and wind speed were the two main factors affecting cotton iwr in xinjiang due to the strong correlation with eto demand for irrigation water was greatest during june to august when the relative contribution of eto was more than 80 followed by september our findings demonstrated that the temporal pattern of eto should be given greater attention when planning for wise and efficient use of regional water resources and for designing irrigation systems graphical

water scarcity has become increasingly prominent as global climate changes and population increases li et al 2020b yang et al 2021 wwap 2021 irrigation is responsible for approximately 70 of the global water withdrawal döll and siebert 2002 gleick 2014 zhang et al 2021 and accounts for as much as 90 of the water withdrawal in some arid regions of asia india pakistan and northwestern china shen et al 2013 ding et al 2017 wwap 2021 the availability of agricultural irrigation water is thus critical to insure sustainable agricultural production and is closely related to sustainable development goals i e sdg6 however global warming and the cultivation of high water consuming crops pose a threat to sustainable agricultural production cotton is the most essential natural fiber source for human beings but its cultivation and production have often had negative effects on local water resources and the environment due to the greater intensity of water consumption than observed for other crops shen et al 2020 gedik and avinc 2020 zhang et al 2021 thus understanding the variations of irrigation water requirements iwr for cotton and its dominant meteorological factors is particularly important for the cultivation and water management of cotton china is the world s largest cotton producer accounting for one quarter of the world s cotton production usda 2021 more than 80 of china s cotton production comes from xinjiang specifically planted area and yield for cotton in xinjiang accounted for 78 95 and 87 33 respectively of china s planted area and yield in 2020 nbsc 2021 the arid climate and large iwr of cotton have resulted in unprecedented pressure on water resources in xinjiang crop evapotranspiration etc the product of the crop coefficient kc and reference evapotranspiration eto based on the fao method and precipitation during crop growth periods are two key hydrological components of the water balance associated with water output and input respectively dominating crop iwr ye et al 2014 xu et al 2021 however global warming that has occurred in the climate system over past decades and centuries can increase eto and crop water demand guo and shen 2016 sun et al 2018 li et al 2020b additionally the warming climate can accelerate atmospheric circulation and the hydrological cycle and affect regional precipitation and the water resource system zhang et al 2012 2015 malek et al 2018 thereby reducing crop yields by affecting the carrying capacity of agricultural water resources qi et al 2021 many recent studies have shown that rising global temperatures have also been accompanied by changes in other climatic variables such as relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation tabari et al 2011 ipcc 2013 xinjiang is an extremely sensitive region in terms of response to global climate change wang et al 2020 these changes will cause great uncertainties with respect to the variation of iwr for cotton thus it is necessary to further study the relationship between crop iwr and climate driving factors especially in the context of a warmer wetter climate trend in xinjiang chen et al 2014 deng et al 2014 wang et al 2020 in recent years considerable evidence has shown that changes in precipitation varied with regions and exhibited certain temporal variability li et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 sang et al 2020 changes in eto are found to be closely related to meteorological driving factors for example in eastern china a reduction in net radiation was the main reason for a decrease in eto zhang et al 2010 however in northeast china such as heilongjiang province eto was greatly affected by sunshine duration and average wind speed hu et al 2021 in northwest china variations in eto were dominated by changes in wind speed dong et al 2019 additionally an inverse relationship between temperature and eto was observed in a warming climate and this is known as the evaporation paradox phenomenon brutsaert and parlange 1998 li et al 2014 xing et al 2016 qin et al 2021 these reports provide the basic knowledge for understanding the trends in dry wet climate conditions however these studies also underscore uncertainties that exist in understanding the driving forces of eto as well as the significant challenges for regional water resource planning and irrigation system design due to spatial and temporal variability these concerns have partly motivated this study the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal changes of cotton iwr in xinjiang during 1961 2020 at multiple scales and 2 clarify the trend of meteorological factors and their contributions to cotton iwr in order to more completely understand the relative contributions of eto and p to the variation of cotton iwr and to reveal the driving forces of cotton iwr this information will aid in comprehensively understanding the present changes in water conditions and in managing agricultural water resources in xinjiang 2 data and methods 2 1 study area xinjiang is located in northwest china and covers an area of approximately 1 66 million km2 the two largest deserts in china i e the taklimakan desert and the gurbantünggüt desert are located in xinjiang xinjiang is characterized by three mountain ranges from north to south the altai mountains the tianshan mountains and the kunlun mountains and two basins the junggar basin and the tarim basin between the mountain ranges the tianshan mountains divide xinjiang into two parts southern xinjiang and northern xinjiang fig 1 these mountains play an important role in the distribution of perceptible atmospheric water vapor in xinjiang because the water vapor of xinjiang mainly comes from the west northwest and north and lesser effects of the east asian monsoon ling et al 2013 xu et al 2016 huang et al 2017 the typical continental monsoon climate produces an arid environment characterized by severe water shortages in xinjiang the average annual precipitation in xinjiang is only 127 mm but the average annual evapotranspiration is greater than 1000 mm annual sunshine duration is up to 3000 h the average annual temperature is approximately 8 c wang et al 2020 xinjiang cotton is mainly planted on both sides of the tianshan mountains and the periphery of the tarim basin fig 1 the unique climate conditions and advantages such as long sunshine duration and wide daily temperature range make this region an important cotton producing region in china the sowing date generally started in april while the harvest began at the end of september in this region wang et al 2016 xue et al 2018 the planted area and yield of cotton in xinjiang in 2020 reached 2502 kha and 5161 kt respectively nbsc 2021 2 2 data meteorological data for this study were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn operated by the national meteorological information centre nmic these data include daily maximum minimum and mean temperature c relative humidity at 2 m height wind speed m s 1 at 10 m height sunshine duration h atmospheric pressure hpa and precipitation mm from 53 meteorological stations during 1961 2020 in xinjiang the data have been subjected to rigorous quality control by the nmic and additionally tested for outliers and errors before implementing the project database wu et al 2022 after identifying spatially explicit data and evaluating county level statistics for the cotton planting areas in xinjiang and after excluding stations with many missing values 33 effective stations located in and around the cotton growing area remained for analysis most of these stations overlap with the agro meteorological experiment stations from the nmic where cotton or other crops is the underlying surface a few missing data values were interpolated based on a regression relationship with data from neighboring stations a brief characterization of the climate along the cotton growing season in xinjiang was provided as fig s3 cotton phenology data were also obtained from the nmic cotton planted area data were collected from the xinjiang statistical yearbook and china statistical yearbook the spatial distribution data of cotton planting was from the international food policy research institute ifpri https dataverse harvard edu global spatially disaggregated crop production statistics data for 2010 version 2 0 yu et al 2020 2 3 cotton irrigation water requirements crop growth mainly depends on the water available for meeting etc demand as a supplemental source of water for maintaining crop growth the iwr is the amount of water that needs to be supplemented to fully satisfy crop water demand when other water terms including precipitation capillary rise and soil water storage variation are insufficient pereira et al 2020 thus a soil water balance at a selected time period can be expresses as 1 i w r e t c p s w var c r d p r o where iwr is the irrigation requirements mm etc is crop water requirements mm p is precipitation mm swvar is the soil water storage variation mm cr is the capillary rise mm dp is deep percolation from the soil root zone mm and ro is runoff mm considering that the focus of this study is to investigate the effects of climate change on cotton iwr and we thus assumed that cotton growth was under no water stress and not affected by crop variety and or other management practices i e under an optimal and well watered crop condition in this case swvar cr dp and ro can be not taken into account meanwhile effective precipitation pe mm should be used instead of the actual precipitation due to the water availability thus the soil water balance can be simplified as the difference between etc and pe that is 2 i w r cotton e t c p e where iwrcotton is cotton irrigation water requirement mm adopting the single crop coefficient method recommended by fao 56 method etc can be calculated by multiplying eto by a dimensionless crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2020 3 e t c k c e t 0 where eto is reference evapotranspiration mm here kc was determined using the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 the entire cotton growing season was divided into four stages the initial stage the crop development stage the mid season stage and the late season stage the specific date and growth periods for each growth stages were obtained from the occurring range and median date of the observed growing degree days gdd for the diverse growth stages see supplementary materials for details and the literature values fu et al 2009 wang et al 2016 xue et al 2018 kc varies with local climate irrigation and other management conditions since cotton growth was assumed under an optimal and well watered condition crop evapotranspiration is mainly attributed to soil surface evaporation during the initial stage allen et al 1998 kc ini was thus based on the value recommended by fao i e kc ini 0 35 in this study the values of kc mid and kc end were optimized by adjusting to local climate conditions at each site for the different years of this study the daily kc values during the other growth stages were derived by considering three constants i e kc ini kc mid and kc end the specific values of kc at different growth stages were calculated as 4 k c m i d k c m i d t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 5 k c e n d k c e n d t a

table 1 shows the multi year average of kc values and corresponding growth periods for cotton that were used for the different crop stages in the present study allen et al 1998 yang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 notably the same growth period length was adopted in this research and the diversity of crop variety was not taken into consideration however growth periods of cotton in northern xinjiang and southern xinjiang were distinguished as well kc values daily reference evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman monteith method for grass recommended by fao allen et al 1998 and the

calculation of contribution rate multiple linear regression can clarify the relationship between independent or predictor variables and a dependent variable wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 in this

irrigation water requirements at multiple scales the annual average iwr of cotton was 791 mm during 1961 2020 in xinjiang exhibiting a significant decreasing trend with a mean change rate of 1 589 mm year p 0 01 iwr decreased with time in the years before 1992 when the iwr change rate was greater 2 791 mm year but an obvious increasing trend with a change rate of 1 963 mm year occurred after 1992 fig 2 similar to the annual trend cotton iwr showed a significant decrease with time for the four different growth stages and shifts occurred after the 1990 s in 1988 during the initial stage however the magnitudes of the shifts were not uniform the downward trend and the shift were more pronounced at the mid season stage when the change rates were 0 765 mm year during 1961 1992 and 1 418 mm year during 1993 2020 in contrast the trend in iwr was relatively gentle at the initial stage 0 086 mm year over the study period the daily iwr ranges were 1 6 8 1 mm d 1 and 1 3 7 4 mm d 1 in northern xinjiang and southern xinjiang respectively the lowest iwr values were observed at the initial stage and the highest values were observed at the mid season stage fig 3 these results were consistent with observations based on eddy covariance in xinjiang reported by yang et al 2016 at the monthly scale fig 2b the decreasing trends of iwr were statistically significant during may september but not for april considering that irrigation and other management factors were ignored in this study the above results indicated that climate effects resulted in more and more severe pressure on irrigation water use in xinjiang in the most recent 20 years and xinjiang will likely face more serious challenges in terms of agricultural water management and agricultural production in the future especially at the mid season stage iwr accounted for almost half of the total iwr during the entire growing season 49 7 crop water shortage during this period will have a great influence on cotton growth and yield the large increase in iwr after 1992 resulted in great uncertainties regarding how to ensure high yields and indicated that it is particularly necessary to optimize irrigation scheduling for cotton in order to mitigate and adapt to the current climate change moreover the inter annual fluctuation of iwr at the mid season stage was larger than at the other growth stages especially in northern xinjiang fig 3 suggesting that agricultural stakeholders should give more attention to irrigation systems used in northern xinjiang during this period in addition cotton acreage in xinjiang increased exponentially during 1961 2020 fig s4 according to shen et al 2013 changes in planting structure caused a large increase in iwr and raised water supply risk during 1989 2010 the continuous expansion of the planted area of cotton in the most recent 20 years will exacerbate the risk situation drastig et al 2016 in order to examine the spatial variation of iwr we calculated the trends of annual iwr at each individual station and employed the spatial interpolation technique the greater annual iwr values 800 mm were mainly located in kashgar of southern xinjiang and in tacheng of northern xinjiang while the lower annual iwr values were observed in changji of northern xinjiang 500 mm meanwhile we found that most tendencies for annual iwr were negative in xinjiang specifically 27 of the 33 stations had negative trends in cotton iwr i e 81 8 of all stations of which there were 22 stations with statistically significant trends p 0 05 only one station had a positive trend value in northern xinjiang and the other five stations with positive trends were located in southern xinjiang indicating that there was great spatial heterogeneity in the trends of annual iwr in southern xinjiang fig 4 3 2 spatial and temporal variation of eto and p without considering irrigation eto and precipitation were the two key parameters of the water budget for influencing iwr as a key indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand eto determines the consumptive water use or water demand of crops and thus influences application of irrigation water to crops over the past 60 years mean annual eto experienced a significant decreasing trend of 1 487 mm year p 0 01 in xinjiang fig 5a similar to the trend of iwr there were two distinct periods in the change of eto from 1961 to 2020 a large decreasing eto trend was found before 1992 3 716 mm year and an obvious increasing trend occurred after that 3 251 mm year similar eto trends have been observed in other regions such as in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin in southwest and southeast china liu et al 2016 she et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 qin et al 2021 average annual precipitation exhibited an inverse trend compared with eto i e a long term increasing trend with a change rate of 0 615 mm year p 0 01 moreover a dominant monotonic trend was observed from 1961 to 2020 fig 5b however the trend of precipitation change was more moderate than that of eto and annual precipitation ranged from 65 mm to 163 mm monthly eto had a decreasing trend in all months except in february and march fig 5c a significant trend occurred during almost the entire cotton growing season may to october the change in monthly precipitation over time showed an increase in all months but the trend was significant only in may and august during the growing season these results verified that the temporal patterns of eto and precipitation should be given more attention when planning for regional water resources and designing irrigation systems the annual eto was 1182 mm during 1961 2020 in xinjiang with the higher value observed along the edge of tarim river 1200 mm and the lowest value also observed in changji of northern xinjiang 1000 the spatial variation of annual eto was similar to the spatial variation of iwr there were 26 stations i e 79 of all stations where a decreasing trend was detected and most stations i e 77 of stations with negative trends had statistically significant decreases these stations were mainly located in the areas north and south of the tianshan mountains among the stations showing positive trends only five stations had significant increasing trends at the 95 confidence level the annual precipitation in southern xinjiang with less than 100 mm was lower than that in northern xinjiang but the trends at all of the stations showed a consistent increase of which more than 73 of stations i e 24 stations exhibited statistically significant trends fig 6 3 3 contributions of eto and p to iwr both the positive precipitation effect and the negative eto effect contributed to the decreasing of iwr and to the relieving of pressure on local water resources little research has been conducted to reveal the relative contributions of eto and precipitation to changes of iwr in xinjiang eto had a greater impact on cotton iwr than precipitation accounting for about 85 1 of the total decrease while increased precipitation only accounted for 14 9 of the iwr change during 1961 2020 moreover eto was the dominant factor during the entire growing season and the contribution of eto was lowest at the initial growth stage due to low crop transpiration at this stage allen et al 1998 hou et al 2022 however the contribution of eto during this stage was still more than 60 fig 7 july and august were the months with the greatest iwr and the contribution of eto to iwr was greater than 80 during these two months two sub periods 1961 1992 and 1993 2020 were identified based on the change point of temporal variations in eto fig 8 shows the spatial characteristics of the relative contributions of eto and precipitation to cotton iwr for 1961 1992 and 1993 2020 as well as the average contribution rate for the entire region in different time periods eto overwhelming affected the trend of iwr compared with precipitation in the early period the contribution of eto to iwr varied from 65 3 to 99 6 among the various stations the average contribution rate was 83 7 and there were no stations where precipitation was the dominant factor the highest contribution rate was observed at naomaohu located in northern xinjiang a similar result was found in the later period 1993 2020 the contribution rate of eto in 1961 1992 was slightly higher than in 1993 2020 and lower than that in the overall time period of 1961 2020 the contribution rate of eto was clearly higher than that of precipitation in all three time periods fig 8c thus the spatial patterns of the relative effects of eto and precipitation were relatively consistent across analysis periods and regions 3 4 driving forces of cotton iwr as described in section 2 3 eto p and kc are the three most direct factors affecting iwr fig 9 shows that there was little change in kc during 1961 2020 the coefficients of variation for kc mid and kc end in northern xinjiang were 0 011and 0 010 respectively and 0 014 and 0 015 in southern xinjiang these results were consistent with previous studies by yang et al 2016 and hou et al 2022 and also reported in similar geographic areas e g central asia khaydar et al 2021 thus most of the variation in cotton iwr could be attributed to eto and precipitation however the variation ranges of kc values in northern xinjiang were larger than that in southern xinjiang due to greater variations among different stations meanwhile important to note that the upper values of kc mid in northern xinjiang were more than 1 30 due to the higher kc mid values at several individual stations which may be related to the effects of local advection allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021 kc will be larger under windy arid and semiarid conditions due to the effects aerodynamic and surface conductance coupled with local advection even reaching 1 40 for tall healthy and well watered vegetation as indicated by pereira et al 2021 another possibility for the higher kc is the oasis effect due to high surface heterogeneity for example wang et al 2019 reported that the contribution of the oasis effect to kc was as high as above 50 in an irrigated vineyard in arid northwest china however higher kc with above 1 40 needs to be caution on the weather data used and the data handling procedures according to allen et al 1998 eto depends on meteorological factors including temperature tmean tmin tmax relative humidity rh wind speed ws and sunshine duration sd to better understand the key climatic factors influencing cotton iwr we further conducted correlation analyses between iwr and eight factors i e tmean tmin tmax rh ws sd eto and p by using the pearson correlation coefficient method the correlation coefficient between eto and cotton iwr was 0 99 while the correlation coefficient between p and iwr was 0 40 fig 10 in addition to these two direct driving factors rh and ws also had a great influence on iwr with correlation coefficients of 0 75 and 0 74 respectively rh and ws had relatively stronger correlations with eto than did the three temperature factors with iwr 0 45 0 44 0 40 for tmean tmin tmax respectively fig 10 a great amount of evidence has previously shown that decreased wind speed and sunshine duration and the increased rh can potentially cause decreases in eto gui et al 2021 hu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 although temperature increases fig s5 can increase eto meanwhile it needs to be pointed out that ws was one of the most influential climatic variable related to eto variability not only in xinjiang presented by this study but also other regions with different climates in china for example in the semi arid and sub humid regions e g the yellow river basin zhang et al 2015 she et al 2017 the loess plateau region zhao et al 2014 and the north china plain yang et al 2021 ws was investigated as a major contributing factor controlling the change of eto in northeast china dominated by a sub humid climate e g in the west liao river basin gao et al 2017 and in heilongjiang province hu et al 2021 ws was examined as the second most significant factor for the decrease in eto likewise in southwestern china with a humid climate wind speed was the dominant variable for change of eto liu et al 2016 even wind speed was the most influential climatic variable related to eto variability at a national scale in china wang et al 2017 gui et al 2021 this is mainly because china is located in the monsoon climate zone while winter and summer monsoon in the past 50 years was weakening zhao et al 2014 the decreasing intensity of the east asian winter and summer monsoons played a significant role in reducing wind speed meanwhile accompanying the changes of atmospheric circulation the reduction of ws can weaken the surface atmosphere energy exchange intensity liu et al 2016 however wang et al 2017 also reported that wind speed exhibited the highest contribution rate in arid northwest china these results further verified an indication of the intensification of the regional hydrological cycle 4 summary and conclusions this study investigated spatial and temporal changes in cotton iwr and identified its meteorological driving forces focusing on the relative contributions of eto and precipitation to iwr in xinjiang the most important cotton farming region in china generally cotton iwr had a significant decreasing trend during 1961 2020 1 589 mm year while a remarkable increase in iwr occurred in 1993 2020 this result was consistent with the trends observed for eto moreover similar trends occurred at all four cotton growth stages the lowest iwr values were observed at the initial stage and the highest occurred at the mid season stage the decrease in monthly iwr was statistically significant over the entire growing season however increased precipitation did not play a substantial role in reducing cotton iwr or in alleviating agricultural water stress in xinjiang due to a non significant increase in cotton growing season precipitation over the time of the study temporal variability in iwr poses new challenges for agricultural water management in xinjiang in particular the large inter annual fluctuation in iwr at the mid season stage should be given more attention in northern xinjiang although precipitation and eto were the main factor affecting cotton iwr eto was related to rh and ws eto showed a dominant influence on the trend of iwr due to increased rh and decreased ws moreover the contribution rate of eto to iwr was greater than the contribution rate of precipitation to iwr over the entire growing season in particular iwr showed an increase due to increased eto in the most recent 20 years 1992 2020 thereby putting more severe pressure on irrigation water use in xinjiang although water saving irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation controlled alternate partial root zone irrigation and deficit irrigation have been applied to improve irrigation efficiency zhang et al 2018 ning et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the large increase in cotton acreage poses a substantial impact on iwr and local water resources therefore it is urgent to adjust the planting structure of cotton in xinjiang from the perspective of water security our research provides a scientific basis for optimizing irrigation systems and adjusting irrigation schedules in response to climate change in xinjiang as well as for allocating agricultural water resources however some challenges and uncertainties always exist in estimating irrigation water requirements and some assumptions are necessary the results presented in this study are subjective to the following assumptions firstly the fixed dates for the diverse crop growth stages during 1961 2020 were used the method was widely applied when estimating the long term crop iwr shen et al 2013 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2021 liu et al 2022 meanwhile the crop growth stages in this study were defined by considering the range and median date of cotton growth stages based on observed data from the nmic which can lessen the shortcoming of this method the estimated results were also consistent with previous reports yang et al 2016 hou et al 2022 secondly the definition of kc value was another source of uncertainties considering the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of climate change the effects of crop variety irrigation and or other management practices on cotton iwr were not considered i e an optimal and well watered condition for cotton growth was assumed thus kc ini was defined based on the fao recommended value 0 35 not by using a soil water balance of the evaporation layer considering wetting frequency of soil surface allen et al 1998 2011 pereira et al 2021 meanwhile the adjustment of kc mid and kc end with fao 56 to the local climate was used to define the local kc for the daily etc predictions however we adopted the method by adjusting cotton crop coefficients during the corresponding growth stages at each site and in each year to improve the reliability of the results on the whole when the focus is on the more accurate estimation of iwr these constraints will be non negligible moreover other ways on more accurate estimation crop iwr including to use the cumulative growing degree days or heat units gdd to derive the date of diverse crop growth stages should be considered fortunately our aim is to investigate the long term trends and the impacts of climate change on these trends hence the estimated results based on these assumptions were acceptable which can provide the needed valuable information for local irrigation management additionally an adequate irrigation environment can act as a reference condition from the penman monteith method when estimating eto allen 1996 thus our results can provide a helpful information on crop water use and then to serve to guide and improve irrigation planning declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9033,at present maize yields as high as 15 0 mg ha 1 can be achieved under fully irrigated conditions in china however due to water restrictions exploring appropriate water saving irrigation methods is of great significance here we sought to test the ability of several irrigation regimes to maintain high grain yield while increasing water productivity wpc two water saving irrigation methods deficit irrigation di and regulated deficit irrigation rdi were optimized based on changes in maize water consumption and soil water content over the growing season the experiments were carried out in

according to statistics from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china in 2019 the maize planting area reached 4 2 108 ha accounting for 35 6 of all arable land dedicated to food crops increasing maize production is necessary to ensure food security during the current covid 19 pandemic and beyond however china is facing a severe water shortage with annual per capita water availability standing at approximately 28 of the global average kang et al 2016 water shortages have already begun to limit maize production in the arid and semi arid regions of northwestern china zhang et al 2015 2017 2019 therefore there is an urgent need for sustainable irrigation methods which foster yield stability and water productivity wpc to address this issue our research team previously proposed a high yield maize cultivation system that integrated mulching and drip irrigation with high density planting 12 104 plants ha 1 li et al 2017 this system achieved the highest maize yield ever recorded in china 24 95 mg ha 1 when tested in a small field 0 15 ha in qitai xinjiang china cheng et al 2021 according to our research on the water demand of maize grown in northwestern china we proposed that 540 mm of irrigation per year could achieve yields as high as 15 7 19 1 mg ha 1 and a wpc of between 2 4 and 2 8 kg m 3 zhang et al 2015 2017 2019 wang a b et al 2021 however the irrigation amount for each time during the maize growth period was the equivalent in all the studies in the preliminary research the water demand of maize is different at different periods of the growth period wang a et al 2021 we suggest that the irrigation regime can be further optimized for sustainability and wpc e g through the use of deficit irrigation di and regulated deficit irrigation rdi without sacrificing grain yield 15 0 mg ha 1 however the real world feasibility of di and rdi under mulched drip irrigation and high density planting requires validation di is a strategy to optimize irrigation under water limited scenarios and often does not fully meet the water demands of the crop di is considered a sustainable strategy for arid regions and has received extensive study in the last two decades pandey et al 2000 payero et al 2006 oktem 2008 benjamin et al 2015 marek et al 2017 the appropriate application of di requires a thorough assessment of the impact of drought stress on crop yield sepaskhah and akbari 2005 for example maize is very sensitive to drought at the early grain filling stage and drought stress occurring at this time may decrease the grain yield by more than 60 nesmith and ritchie 1992 boyer and westgate 2004 benjamin et al 2015 thus more precise irrigation methods are necessary to synergistically improve both maize yield and wpc rdi further optimizes irrigation by timing the application of water around specific drought sensitive growth stages in order to control soil water deficit stewart and nielsen 1990 domínguez et al 2012 pardo et al 2020 rdi has been widely adopted in the horticultural industry as a way to improve wpc without sacrificing product quality goodwin and macrae 1990 davies et al 2000 mingo et al 2003 in their seminal study of rdi in maize kang et al 2000 reported that subjecting maize to drought during the early seedling stage 50 60 field capacity fc and the stem extension stage 55 65 fc reduced water consumption by 18 6 22 5 while maintaining grain yield other proposed rdi strategies involve applying irrigation only when soil water is depleted i e between 50 and 70 fc without considering the irrigation interval or the amount of water applied during each interval yin et al 2013 wei et al 2018 however in china the irrigation interval used by farmers is usually not fixed because of restrictions placed on rotation irrigation systems zhang et al 2019 as a result these proposed rdi strategies may not be applicable to real world maize production using our proposed irrigation target of 540 mm per year we sought to explore efficient and practicable di and rdi strategies to improve both wpc and yield in maize because such strategies must take into account changes in both the water demand of the crop and soil water availability over the entire growing period our aim was to comprehensively consider these dimensions while testing the feasibility of different irrigation strategies specifically our study was designed to 1 maintain leaf area index lai dry matter dm accumulation and yield 15 0 mg ha 1 through irrigation optimization 2 decrease crop evapotranspiration etc and increase wpc by less soil ineffective evaporation in maize non water sensitive period and 3 compare the mechanism by which yield may be stabilized by di and rdi the results of this study will provide a sustainable solution for maize production in arid and semi arid climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field trials were carried out in the qitai farm qitai xinjiang 43 29 15 n 89 28 42 e 1021 m a s l in 2019 and 2020 fig 1 the experiment site is a semi arid area meteorological data for the maize growing season in 2019 2020 came from a weather station located near the experimental station fig 2 compared with 2019 there were higher temperatures less rainfall and more drought at seedling stage in 2020 the soil was heavy loam 0 40 cm and medium loam 60 100 cm at experiment site table 1 the two year experiment was carried out in the same field and the soil texture was uniform and consistent 2 2 experimental design in this region the same amount of water is typically applied per irrigation interval our previous research determined that the optimal amount of irrigation to sustain high maize yields is 540 mm zhang et al 2015 2017 2019 wang et al 2021a b and this irrigation amount is being promoted on nearby farms in 2018 we calculated the actual etc soil evaporation e maize transpiration tr and tr etc and e etc ratios under the 540 mm irrigation rate consistent with the check treatment ck fig 3 etc was calculated during the growing season using eq 1 rana and katerji 2000 1 e t c i p c r r f d p δ s where et c is crop evapotranspiration mm including crop transpiration mm and soil evaporation mm during the maize growing season i is the total amount of water applied mm p is seasonal precipitation mm c r is the capillary rise mm r f is runoff mm d p is deep percolation mm and δs is the change in soil water storage sws mm in eq 1 c r was considered zero because the groundwater table was 70 80 m below the surface no runoff was observed in the whole process of drip irrigation so the r f was also assumed to be negligible d p was considered zero because soil water content below 80 cm did not reach fc on any sampling date e was measured with a mini lysimeter wei et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 tr was calculated as the value of etc minus e we roughly determined the ratio tr etc and e etc under the 540 mm irrigation rate with the same amount of water applied per irrigation interval in order to achieve the dual goals of stabilizing high maize yield and improving wpc we compared both di and rdi utilizing a randomized complete block design rcbd with three replicates per treatment we utilized 1 m wide buffer plots and waterproof plastic film buried 1 m deep to block water movement between plots water discharge and pressure were stabilized through careful design and management the 540 mm irrigation rate was used as the control treatment in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 optimized di and rdi regimes were determined as follows 2 2 1 the basis of di optimization using eqs 1 and 2 the phase water consumption coefficient kp of maize at the sowing jointing stage sow v6 jointing tasseling stage v6 vt tasseling milk stage vt r3 and milk maturity stage r3 r6 were calculated as 18 1 27 2 24 9 and 29 8 respectively all calculations were based on an irrigation amount of 540 mm and an irrigation interval of 6 d zhang et al 2019 the kp ratio of the v6 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages was calculated as 1 1 1 1 2 the kp can be calculated following wang et al 2021a 2 k p w c p e t c 100 where k p is the phase water consumption coefficient during a specific growth period wc p is phase water consumption mm and et c is total crop evapotranspiration mm during the entire growing season the coefficient 100 in eq 2 converts the unit of k p to 2 2 2 optimized di design our experiment consisted of five di treatments fig 4 the full irrigation amount of 540 mm ck 540 mm di1 486 mm 90 ck di2 432 mm 80 ck di3 and 378 mm 70 ck di4 in the ck treatment the remaining irrigation water was averaged to obtain a single irrigation amount to be applied per irrigation interval in the di1 di4 treatments the remaining irrigation water was divided and applied according to the v6 vt vt r3 r3 r6 ratio of 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 the basis of rdi optimization based on soil fc the levels of water stress experienced by maize plants can be roughly divided into the following categories 70 fc no water stress 60 70 fc mild water stress 50 60 fc moderate water stress 50 fc severe water stress kang et al 2000 zhang and cheng 2009 wei et al 2018 in these rdi studies each irrigation was initiated based on a specific water stress levels however farmers typically use an irrigation interval of 6 15 d under mulched drip irrigation zhang et al 2019 in other words there is no the specific water stress level before each irrigation in actual production 2 2 4 optimization of rdi design our experiment consisted of six rdi treatments fig 4 the full irrigation

growth periods in eq 3 the h was set at a depth of 60 cm during the jointing tasseling stage and a depth of 80 cm during the tasseling maturity stage during rdi the real time soil water content swc v v was measured at 10 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm with a water monitor zhishang et100 hangzhou dongfang zhigan zhejiang technology co ltd fig 5 a this frequency domain reflectometry fdr based water monitor is powered by solar panels and built in lithium batteries and continuously monitors soil water in multiple soil layers at the same location transmits data to the cloud in real time through the 4 g network and performs in depth analysis of the data the real time volumetric swc of each treatment was automatically collected every 2 h the amount of water applied during the first irrigation interval after the jointing stage in treatments rdi1 rdi5 was based on a threshold of 60 mm which represents the local amount for first irrigation lafi specifically the amount of irrigation applied during this time period in the rdi1 rdi2 and rdi4 treatments was 60 mm in the rdi3 treatment was 42 mm 70 lafi and in the rdi5 treatment was 30 mm 50 lafi subsequently the amount of water applied per irrigation interval of each treatment during the maize growth period was determined based on the swsa of the h measured the day before irrigation 2 3 field management a high yield density tolerant maize hybrid cv xianyu 335 was used in two optimal irrigation experiments the mulched drip irrigation and dense planting 12 0 104 ha 1 cultivation modes were adopted the area of each plot was 165 m2 15 m 11 m wide narrow 70 40 cm row planting was adopted fig 5 b before sowing drip tapes were placed under plastic film with punch holes for seedling growth a precision seeder acme bzq acme china was used for sowing the seeds at an average depth of 5 cm to ensure uniform plant density seeds were sown along each row and covered with thin soil a transparent plastic film 90 cm wide and 0 01 mm thick tianye inc xinjiang china was used for the experiment the drip irrigation belt was maintained at an emitter spacing of 30 cm and a flow rate of 3 2 l h 1 at 0 1 mpa operating pressure irrigation water was pumped from groundwater the coefficient of drip irrigation is 0 90 maize was sown on april 21 2019 and april 18 2020 and harvested on october 3 2019 and september 30 2020 after sowing all experimental fields were immediately irrigated with 30 mm of water based on the soil water shortage in the topsoil 0 20 cm 50 7 mm in 2019 and 48 4 mm in 2020 to guarantee rapid seed germination and uniform seedling emergence in 2020 precipitation at the seedling stage was only 5 1 mm and the jointing stage was advanced 12 15 d because of drought therefore all treatments received 36 3 mm of irrigation on may 21 the plants were not irrigated from ve emergence to jointing stage to induce slight drought and promote root penetration thereby avoiding lodging which typically occurs in the tasseling milk stage based on the initial nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k contents in the 0 100 cm soil profile base fertilizers including urea 150 kg ha 1 n potassium phosphate 225 kg

1 additional urea totally 600 kg ha 1 n was applied at the jointing tasseling and milk stages of maize to all treatments at a ratio of 3 4 3 all weeds diseases and pests in the experimental plots were controlled 2 4 measurement indices 2 4 1 soil water content swc the swc v v of the di and rdi treatments was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm by time domain reflectometry tdr using a tube probe trime iph imko germany fig 4 a in each plot three 150 cm long tubes were deployed adjacent to the drip tapes and two between the drip tapes fig 4 b data were presented as the average swc for the entire plot prior to sowing swc was determined using the oven drying method swc was measured every ten days starting from the first irrigation to harvest additional measurements were conducted before and after each irrigation and precipitation event according to previous research 70 swsfc is the ideal lower limit for soil water in maize fields under mulched drip irrigation and 60 swsfc is the lower limit for mild water stress zhang et al 2019 2 4 2 crop evapotranspiration etc and daily crop evapotranspiration dce total etc during the growing season i e the actual evapotranspiration mm

2 4 4 dry matter dm five maize plants were randomly selected for sampling at the v6 v12 vt r3 r4 and r6 stages the leaves stems sheaths and female and male panicles were dried at 105 c for 30 min and then at 80 c to constant weight prior to measuring their dry weights the seasonal changes of dm accumulation can be simulated using a logistic function in eq 5 qin et al 2019 using eqs 6 7 8 and 9 xue et al 2020 the initiation t1 and termination t2 times of rapid dry matter accumulation the duration of these periods t and the maximum rates of rapid dry matter accumulation vmax were used to

significantly alter the number of ears harvested table 2 under optimized di there were no significant differences in the number of kn kw or gy between ck di1 or di2 however the kn kw and gy were reduced by 7 0 8 3 2 7 4 5 and 2 6 3 8 compared with ck respectively in the di3 treatment over both growing seasons under optimized rdi there were no significant differences in kn kw or gy between ck rdi1 or rdi2 again the kn kw and gy were reduced by 6 5 9 3 4 5 5 3 and 5 2 5 8 compared with ck respectively in the rdi3 treatment over both growing seasons in the rdi4 treatment these parameters were decreased by 3 0 4 5 1 5 2 3 and 3 2 3 3 respectively in the rdi5 treatment these parameters were decreased by 11 8 13 2 7 1 8 2 and 8 0 11 1 respectively 3 2 crop evapotranspiration etc water productivity wpc and irrigation water productivity wpi under optimized di there were no significant differences in etc wpc and wpi between ck and di1 table 3 however the etc was reduced by 5 8 9 1 12 1 15 1 and 18 3 19 4 in di2 di3 and di4 respectively compared to ck over both growing seasons both the wpc was increased by 5 3 9 4 9 6 13 8 and 14 4 14 8 and the wpi was increased by 10 2 10 5 20 5 21 6 and 33 3 33 6 in di2 di3 and di4 respectively under optimized rdi the etc was significantly reduced in all five rdi treatments rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 compared to ck table 3 both the wpc was increased by 13 5 24 1 and the wpi was increased by 36 0 41 6 in rdi1 rdi5 respectively the wpc did not differ significantly between the rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 and rdi4 treatments although the wpc of these treatments was significantly higher than in rdi5 or ck there was no significant difference in wpi among the five rdi treatments although the wpi of these treatments was significantly higher than ck 3 3 soil water the total soil water storage sws within the 0 100 cm soil gradient was influenced by both irrigation method and rainfall and varied across maize growth stages fig 6 under optimized di the sws of four di treatments di1 di2 di3 di4 stabilized at approximately 70 swsfc during irrigation events indicative of a good soil water environment fig 6 a b during the v6 vt and r3 r6 growth stages the sws of the di3 di4 and di5 treatments remained close to 70 swsfc prior to irrigation compared with ck the sws of the di1 di2 di3 and di4 treatments were reduced by 2 9 5 7 8 4 and 11 7 during the v6 vt stage and by 2 8 5 9 9 2 and 11 8 during the r3 r6 stage respectively under optimized rdi the sws of the rdi1 and rdi2 treatments stabilized at approximately 70 swsfc during irrigation events fig 6 c d the sws of the rdi3 and rdi4 treatments stabilized between 60 and 70 swsfc during the vt r3 stage indicating that rdi does not induce severe drought stress during the water sensitive growth period compared with ck the sws of rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 were reduced by 5 9 6 9 11 7 7 2 and 16 8 during the v6 vt stage and by 3 0 4 5 8 0 10 3 and 15 7 during the r3 r6 stage respectively taken together our data suggest that neither di nor rdi significantly reduced sws during the water insensitive growth periods v6 vt and r3 r6 in addition under both the di and rdi regimes the sws during the r3 r6 stage was higher in 2020 than in 2019 this was likely because of the occurrence of greater precipitation more cloudy days and less sunshine after the r3 growth period in 2020 the soil water content swc was relatively stable in the 80 100 cm soil layer over the maize growing season fig 7 however the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer varied under optimized di the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer was not significantly different between di1 di2 and ck during the water sensitive growth period vt r3 during the water insensitive growth period the of the 0 60 cm soil layer was lower in the four di treatments compared to ck under optimized rdi the soil water content of the 0 60 cm soil layer was lower in the five rdi treatments compared to ck during the irrigation event v6 r6 it appears that compared with di rdi results in a lower soil water content during vt r3 3 4 daily crop evapotranspiration dce and phase water consumption coefficient kp under optimized di the dce during the v6 vt stage decreased by 6 7 10 0 13 3 and 16 6 in the di1 di2 di3 and di4 treatments compared to ck respectively during the r3 r6 stage the dce decreased by 6 7 10 0 13 3 and 16 6 respectively these results indicate that di effectively reduced the water consumption of maize during the water insensitive growth period fig 8 a b however during vt r3 stage the dce was higher in the di1 and di2 treatments than in ck indicating that maize maintained increased water consumption during this growth period under optimized rdi the dce of the five rdi treatments was significantly lower than ck throughout the entire growing season demonstrating that optimized rdi can reduce the dce of maize during irrigation periods fig 8 c d during the v6 vt stage the dce of the ck treatment was 14 8 11 1 14 5 10 0 and 16 6 higher than rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 rdi5 and rdi5 respectively during the r3 r6 stage the dce of the ck treatment was 26 3 29 4 30 2 35 1 and 34 1 higher respectively in maize the demand for water varies with growth stage namely from sowing to v6 sow v6 from v6 to vt v6 vt from vt to r3 vt r3 and from r3 to r6 r3 r6 fig 9 under optimized di the kp of the di1 di2 di3 and di4 treatments were reduced by 4 0 4 5 9 9 and 0 3 compared to ck during the r3 r6 stage under optimized rdi the kp of the rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 treatments were reduced by 3 4 4 6 4 7 7 0 and 6 0 compared to ck during the r3 r6 stage additionally the kp was the lowest between sowing v6 in both di and rdi treatments 3 5 leaf area index lai across all treatments and growth periods the maize lai was the highest in the ck treatment laimax 7 4 at the vt stage fig 10 under optimized di there was no significant difference in laimax between di1 di2 di3 and ck however laimax was significantly reduced in the di4 treatment laimax 6 8 compared to ck at the r6 stage there was no significant difference in lai between di1 di2 and ck however laimax was significantly reduced in the di3 and di4 treatments compared to ck under optimized rdi the laimax was significantly reduced at the vt stage in the rdi5 treatment laimax 6 6 compared to ck fig 10 c d and at the r6 stage in the rdi3 and rdi5 treatments 3 6 dry matter dm accumulation we simulated the process of maize dm accumulation using a logistic equation fig 11 which indicated that the initiation t 1 of rapid dm accumulation occurred at the v12 v13 stage and termination t 2 occurred at the r3 r4 stage under optimized di t 2 was advanced by 1 2 d and the period of rapid dm accumulation t was shortened by 1 2 d in the di3 and di4 treatments compared to ck in addition the maximum rate of dry matter accumulation vmax was reduced in the di3 and di4 treatments in effect the accumulation of dm was reduced in the di3 and di4 treatments compared to ck at r6 stage there was no significant difference in dm accumulation between di1 di2 and ck under optimized rdi t 1 was delayed by 1 d and t 2 was delayed by 1 3 d in the rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 treatments compared to ck resulting in increasing t by 1 2 d the v max was reduced by 10 2 12 8 8 2 8 5 and 17 0 18 4 in the rdi3 di4 and di5 treatments respectively therefore the accumulation of dm was reduced in the rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 treatments compared to ck at the r6 stage fig 11 a b there was no significant difference in dm accumulation between rdi1 rdi2 and ck 3 7 path analysis a path analysis was conducted on the sws lai dm gy and yield components in the di and rdi experiments fig 12 overall sws was significantly positively correlated with laimax at the vt stage sws at r3 stage was significantly positively correlated with lai at the r6 stage dm was significantly positively correlated with laimax lai kn kw and gy at r6 stage and gy was significantly positively correlated with kn and kw these correlations suggest that di and rdi alter gy by affecting the leaf photosynthetic area the accumulation of photoassimilates and yield composition 3 8 a sustainable irrigation strategy to increase yield and wpc based on di and rdi the results of our study indicate that both high maize yield and wpc can be sustainably maintained by optimizing di and rdi regimes fig 13 this irrigation regime comprehensively considers changes in both water consumption and soil water over the entire maize growth period furthermore the proposed irrigation regime is designed to reduce etc during water insensitive growth periods maintain high grain yield and improve wpc based on our research we propose the following optimized irrigation method 1 based on the sws at a depth of 0 20 cm prior to sowing the soil should be irrigated immediately after sowing to increase sws and ensure uniform emergence 2 irrigation should be withheld between the seedling and v10 stages under normal precipitation conditions reducing etc to about 36 of e if the field receives less than average rainfall the first irrigation can be advanced to the 6 leaf stage 3 less than full irrigation should be applied between the v6 and vt stages to relieve early drought stress additional water may be necessary to obtain greater lai 4 full irrigation should be applied between the vt and r3 stages at which time maize is particularly sensitive to drought during this period optimal soil moisture is necessary to maintain maximum transpiration and accumulation of photosynthates 5 less than full irrigation should be applied between the r3 and r6 stages care should be taken to avoid premature senescence of green leaves and maintain a high grain yield 4 discussion 4 1 optimized di and rdi result in high dm accumulation yield and wpc the accumulation of dm forms the material basis of gy and is significantly reduced by drought stress karam et al 2003 in maize total gy is primarily dictated by kn and kw and the primary mechanism by which drought stress reduces grain yield is through reducing these components golzardi et al 2017 wang et al 2021b in this study we found that the accumulation of dm kn and kw was not significantly reduced by either 20 water deficit di2 or 85 ir at the r3 r6 stage rdi2 however these indices were significantly reduced by 30 40 water deficit di3 and di4 and 70 ir at the v6 vt and r3 r6 stages rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 overall we were able to maintain high maize yields 15 0 mg ha 1 while increasing wpc 2 7 kg m 3 indicating that efficient dm accumulation was maintained although water deficits were incurred by both the optimized di di1 di4 and rdi rdi1 rdi5 regimes however water deficit can significantly affect both maize yield and wpc water stress occurring at either the vegetative or early reproductive stages can reduce maize yield by 22 6 26 4 pandey et al 2000 studies report that water stress can reduce maize yields by 10 76 with the magnitude of reduction being dependent on both the intensity of water stress and the growth stage pandey et al 2000 karam et al 2003 domínguez et al 2012 here we adopted an optimized di regime based on the water demand of maize at different growth stages compared with the ideal irrigation amount of 540 mm ck grain yield was stabilized 15 0 mg ha 1 and both wpc and wpi were significantly increased 7 3 14 7 and 10 3 33 4 respectively under 10 30 water deficit di2 di3 and di4 table 2 furthermore compared with the amount of irrigation used by local farmers 720 mm in 2018 and 2019 wang et al 2021a our method both stabilized high grain yield 15 0 mg ha 1 and increased wpc by 31 2 51 2 while reducing total irrigation by 25 0 47 5 optimizing rdi according to the water needs of each growth stage can increase wpc without sacrificing grain yield mild water deficit should be applied during the initial and vegetative growth stages domínguez et al 2012 yin et al 2013 while moderate and higher deficits should be applied during the ripening and grain filling stages domínguez et al 2012 xue et al 2013 here we found that under the rdi2 85 ir at the milk maturity stage treatment not only was maize yield not significantly reduced but both wpc and wpi were significantly increased 19 9 23 4 and 38 3 40 1 respectively table 2 by withholding water at the milk maturity stage we maintained high maize grain yield 15 0 mg ha 1 while increasing wpc 2 7 kg m 3 in 2019 rdi4 70 ir at the r3 r6 stage treatment significantly reduced maize yield suggesting that 85 ir at the r3 r6 stage may be the lower limit to maintain high yield 15 0 mg ha 1 although there were significant differences in both yield and wpc among the five rdi treatments there was no significant difference in wpi this is primarily due to the different amounts of irrigation water applied at each maize growth stage 4 2 di results in higher maize yields and rdi uses less irrigation water by optimizing the di and rdi regimes we saved between 10 0 and 30 0 and 28 9 34 3 of irrigation water respectively the di strategy minimizes water use while maintaining maize yield which makes this irrigation method an attractive option in mediterranean bozkurt et al 2011 semi arid dağdelen et al 2006 and arid lack et al 2012 regions according to our previous research maize has similar water demands over the growth period in arid semi arid and semi humid areas wang et al 2021a therefore our optimized di strategy may be useful for increasing grain yield and wpc in these areas here we designed an optimized rdi strategy based on the level of water deficit tolerable at different maize growth stages rdi is a more scientific strategy that reflects the theoretical lower limit to irrigation which can maintain high yields in supplemental irrigation areas with higher precipitation the rdi strategy can be highly effective at lowering water use although its implementation requires real time monitoring of soil water status compared with traditional rdi kang et al 2000 zhang and cheng 2009 wei et al 2018 our proposed optimized rdi strategy is more suitable for use in real world contexts compared with di both soil water consumption and rotation irrigation schedule are explicitly considered by rdi 4 3 rdi is superior to di at reducing ineffective etc here we found that sws was significantly positively correlated with gy research suggests that the highest yield may be obtained when soil water is 65 70 of swsfc li et al 2015 under mulched drip irrigation 70 swsfc is the ideal lower limit for soil water in maize fields and 60 swsfc is the lower limit for mild water stress zhang et al 2019 in this study the sws of the di2 treatment was nearly 70 of swsfc at the tasseling maturity stage indicative of a good soil water environment fig 6 simultaneously the rdi2 treatment was irrigated to fc during the v6 r3 stage and consequently ear formation and development were not affected by water stress between 100 and 150 d after sowing the sws stabilized to 70 of swsfc these results indicate that the maize rhizosphere continually experienced an ideal soil water environment under both the optimized di and rdi regimes the total water consumption of a crop includes both physiological and ecological water consumption both of which are related to the intricacies of the growth and development cycle in maize for example the ratio of plant transpiration and soil evaporation differs among growth stages during the middle stages of maize growth 80 of etc is due to transpiration while the ratio of transpiration to etc decreased by 74 at the late grain filling stage liu et al 2002 the status of the soil surface can also considerably alter water consumption with 64 9 of etc at the seedling stage attributable to soil evaporation due to exposure of the soil surface liu et al 2002 another study reported that from sowing to the seedling stage the majority of etc is due to evaporation from the bare soil surface while more than 90 of etc is due to crop transpiration when the plants fully cover the soil surface waller and yitayew 2016 the use of mulch film has been shown to reduce soil evaporation by 55 although patches of bare soil between wide rows can still generate significant evaporation zhang et al 2019 our previous research found that transpiration accounted for 96 8 and 94 7 of etc under mulched drip irrigation at the v10 vt and vt r3 stages respectively fig 3 under mulched drip irrigation the vt r3 stage is the most water sensitive period of maize growth wang et al 2021a in this study the peak dce occurred at the vt stage additionally we found that laimax was not significantly reduced in the di2 di3 di4 rdi1 rdi2 and rdi4 treatments taken together these results suggest that neither optimized di nor rdi inhibited transpiration during water sensitive growth periods according to our analysis of e etc and tr etc under the 540 mm irrigation amount fig 3 e accounted for 36 0 and 13 5 of total etc during the sowing v10 and the r3 r6 stages respectively our optimized di and rdi regimes reduced total etc by 44 6 63 0 mm and 138 6 144 6 mm respectively furthermore the kp was lower during water insensitive growth periods sowing v6 and r3 r6 under both optimized di and rdi therefore we suggest that our optimized di and rdi regimes can reduce etc during the water insensitive periods of maize growth under water deficit thereby reducing the total seasonal etc and increasing wpc however compared with di optimized rdi can both save more water and achieve higher wpi making this irrigation method attractive and convenient for maize production in areas suffering severe water shortages 4 4 the ways for sustainability of maize production are provided in irrigation area and supplementary irrigation area at present a sizeable portion of northern china cannot be feasibly used for crop production due to limited water availability feike et al 2015 three of our optimized di treatments di2 di3 and di4 and all five of our optimized rdi treatments were able to reduce the amount of irrigation water by 54 162 mm and 151 180 mm respectively furthermore high grain yield was stabilized 15 0 mg ha 1 and wpc was significantly increased 2 7 kg m 3 by our optimized di and rdi strategies thus these high yield water saving maize production strategies are proposed for adoption in northern china fig 13 as droughts and water shortages are projected to increase in severity these optimized irrigation strategies may be a sustainable method to maintain high maize yields and wpc in both irrigated and supplementarily irrigated contexts for example winter wheat is one of the primary food crops grown across the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china second only to maize jin et al 2007 chen et al 2015 the heading grain filling stage is considered to be the growth stage with the highest water demand accounting for 57 of total water consumption liu et al 2002 additionally wheat yield is significantly reduced by water stress at the jointing heading stage chennafi et al 2006 generally speaking the peak water consumption of winter wheat and the vegetative stage of spring maize are synchronized and the two crops compete for irrigation water based on the two optimal irrigation strategies proposed in this study irrigation water withheld during the v6 vt stage of maize could instead be supplied to winter wheat thereby maximizing the utilization of regional agricultural irrigation water 5 conclusion here we optimized deficit irrigation di and regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies based on changes in water consumption and soil water storage over the maize growth period compared with the application of 540 mm of water during each irrigation interval our optimized di and rdi strategies stabilized high grain yield while increasing water productivity by 7 3 14 7 and 13 6 22 3 and irrigation water productivity by 10 3 33 4 and 36 0 41 3 respectively additionally etc was significantly reduced during the water insensitive growth period and dry matter accumulation and leaf area were maintained we propose that these optimized irrigation methods which combine knowledge about crop water consumption and soil water storage can improve maize yield and water productivity in arid and semi arid production areas declaration of competing interest the authors

9033,at present maize yields as high as 15 0 mg ha 1 can be achieved under fully irrigated conditions in china however due to water restrictions exploring appropriate water saving irrigation methods is of great significance here we sought to test the ability of several irrigation regimes to maintain high grain yield while increasing water productivity wpc two water saving irrigation methods deficit irrigation di and regulated deficit irrigation rdi were optimized based on changes in maize water consumption and soil water content over the growing season the experiments were carried out in one of china s primary spring maize producing areas qitai xinjiang in 2019 and 2020 with mulched drip irrigation and dense planting 12 104 plants ha 1 adopted in both experiments the control ck treatment consisted of the application of 540 mm of water during each irrigation interval compared with ck the soil water content swc in the 0 100 cm particularly 0 60 cm soil layers were lower during the water insensitive growth periods 6th leaf tasseling and milk maturity stage under both optimized di and rdi furthermore the daily crop evapotranspiration dce phase water consumption coefficient kp and ineffective crop evapotranspiration etc were reduced by 12 6 35 1 3 4 9 9 and 6 7 16 6 respectively both the maximum leaf area index laimax and biomass accumulation were maintained during the 6th leaf milk stage under optimized di and rdi high maize yield was maintained 15 0 mg ha 1 wpc was increased 2 7 kg m 3 and irrigation water productivity wpi was increased by 10 3 33 4 and 36 0 41 3 respectively optimized di resulted in higher maize yields but optimized rdi used less irrigation water we propose that these optimized irrigation methods can improve maize yield and wpc in arid and

irrigation dense planting data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction maize zea mays l is a major food fodder and oil crop in china as well as across much of the world according to statistics from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china in 2019 the maize planting area reached 4 2 108 ha accounting for 35 6 of all arable land dedicated to food crops increasing maize production is necessary to ensure food security during the current covid 19 pandemic and beyond however china is facing a severe water shortage with annual per capita water availability standing at approximately 28 of the global average kang et al 2016 water shortages have already begun to limit maize production in the arid and semi arid regions of northwestern china zhang et al 2015 2017 2019 therefore there is an urgent need for sustainable irrigation methods which foster yield stability and water productivity wpc to address this issue our research team previously proposed a high yield maize cultivation system that integrated mulching and drip irrigation with high density planting 12 104 plants ha 1 li et al 2017 this system achieved the highest maize yield ever recorded in china 24 95 mg ha 1 when tested in a small field 0 15 ha in qitai xinjiang china cheng et al 2021 according to our research on the water demand of maize grown in northwestern china we proposed that 540 mm of irrigation per year could achieve yields as high as 15 7 19 1 mg ha 1 and a wpc of between 2 4 and 2 8 kg m 3 zhang et al 2015 2017 2019 wang a b et al 2021 however the irrigation amount for each time during the maize growth period was the equivalent in all the studies in the preliminary research the water demand of maize is different at different periods of the growth period wang a et al 2021 we suggest that the irrigation regime can be further optimized for sustainability and wpc e g through the use of deficit irrigation di and regulated deficit irrigation rdi without sacrificing grain yield 15 0 mg ha 1 however the real world feasibility of di and rdi under mulched drip irrigation and high density planting requires validation di is a strategy to optimize irrigation under water limited scenarios and often does not fully meet the water demands of the crop di is considered a sustainable strategy for arid regions and has received extensive study in the last two decades pandey et al 2000 payero et al 2006 oktem 2008 benjamin et al 2015 marek et al 2017 the appropriate application of di requires a thorough assessment of the impact of drought stress on crop yield sepaskhah and akbari 2005 for example maize is very sensitive to drought at the early grain filling stage and drought stress occurring at this time may decrease the grain yield by more than 60 nesmith and ritchie 1992 boyer and westgate 2004 benjamin et al 2015 thus more precise irrigation methods are necessary to synergistically improve both maize yield and wpc rdi further optimizes irrigation by timing the application of water around specific drought sensitive growth stages in order to control soil water deficit stewart and nielsen 1990 domínguez et al 2012 pardo et al 2020 rdi has been widely adopted in the horticultural industry as a way to improve wpc without sacrificing product quality goodwin and macrae 1990 davies et al 2000 mingo et al 2003 in their seminal study of rdi in maize kang et al 2000 reported that subjecting maize to drought during the early seedling stage 50 60 field capacity fc and the stem extension stage 55 65 fc reduced water consumption by 18 6 22 5 while maintaining grain yield other proposed rdi strategies involve applying irrigation only when soil water is depleted i e between 50 and 70 fc without considering the irrigation interval or the amount of water applied during each interval yin et al 2013 wei et al 2018 however in china the irrigation interval used by farmers is usually not fixed because of restrictions placed on rotation irrigation systems zhang et al 2019 as a result these proposed rdi strategies may not be applicable to real world maize production using our proposed irrigation target of 540 mm per year we sought to explore efficient and practicable di and rdi strategies to improve both wpc and yield in maize because such strategies must take into account changes in both the water demand of the crop and soil water availability over the entire growing period our aim was to comprehensively consider these dimensions while testing the feasibility of different irrigation strategies specifically our study was designed to 1 maintain leaf area index lai dry matter dm accumulation and yield 15 0 mg ha 1 through irrigation optimization 2 decrease crop evapotranspiration etc and increase wpc by less soil ineffective evaporation in maize non water sensitive period and 3 compare the mechanism by which yield may be stabilized by di and rdi the results of this study will provide a sustainable solution for maize production in arid and semi arid climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field trials were carried out in the qitai farm qitai xinjiang 43 29 15 n 89 28 42 e 1021 m a s l in 2019 and 2020 fig 1 the experiment site is a semi arid area meteorological data for the maize growing season in 2019 2020 came from a weather station located near the experimental station fig 2 compared with 2019 there were higher temperatures less rainfall and more drought at seedling stage in 2020 the soil was heavy loam 0 40 cm and medium loam 60 100 cm at experiment site table 1 the two year experiment was carried out in the same field and the soil texture was uniform and consistent 2 2 experimental design in this region the same amount of water is typically applied per irrigation interval our previous research determined that the optimal amount of irrigation to sustain high maize yields is 540 mm zhang et al 2015 2017 2019 wang et al 2021a b and this irrigation amount is being promoted on nearby farms in 2018 we calculated the actual etc soil evaporation e maize transpiration tr and tr etc and e etc ratios under the 540 mm irrigation rate consistent with the check treatment ck fig 3 etc was calculated during the growing season using eq 1 rana and katerji 2000 1 e t c i p c r r f d p δ s where et c is crop evapotranspiration mm including crop transpiration mm and soil evaporation mm during the maize growing season i is the total amount of water applied mm p is seasonal precipitation mm c r is the capillary rise mm r f is runoff mm d p is deep percolation mm and δs is the change in soil water storage sws mm in eq 1 c r was considered zero because the groundwater table was 70 80 m below the surface no runoff was observed in the whole process of drip irrigation so the r f was also assumed to be negligible d p was considered zero because soil water content below 80 cm did not reach fc on any sampling date e was measured with a mini lysimeter wei et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 tr was calculated as the value of etc minus e we roughly determined the ratio tr etc and e etc under the 540 mm irrigation rate with the same amount of water applied per irrigation interval in order to achieve the dual goals of stabilizing high maize yield and improving wpc we compared both di and rdi utilizing a randomized complete block design rcbd with three replicates per treatment we utilized 1 m wide buffer plots and waterproof plastic film buried 1 m deep to block water movement between plots water discharge and pressure were stabilized through careful design and management the 540 mm irrigation rate was used as the control treatment in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 optimized di and rdi regimes were determined as follows 2 2 1 the basis of di optimization using eqs 1 and 2 the phase water consumption coefficient kp of maize at the sowing jointing stage sow v6 jointing tasseling stage v6 vt tasseling milk stage vt r3 and milk maturity stage r3 r6 were calculated as 18 1 27 2 24 9 and 29 8 respectively all calculations were based on an irrigation amount of 540 mm and an irrigation interval of 6 d zhang et al 2019 the kp ratio of the v6 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages was calculated as 1 1 1 1 2 the kp can be calculated following wang et al 2021a 2 k p w c p e t c 100 where k p is the phase water consumption coefficient during a specific growth period wc p is phase water consumption mm and et c is total crop evapotranspiration mm during the entire growing season the coefficient 100 in eq 2 converts the unit of k p to 2 2 2 optimized di design our experiment consisted of five di treatments fig 4 the full irrigation amount of 540 mm ck 540 mm di1 486 mm 90 ck di2 432 mm 80 ck di3 and 378 mm 70 ck di4 in the ck treatment the remaining irrigation water was averaged to obtain a single irrigation amount to be applied per irrigation interval in the di1 di4 treatments the remaining irrigation water was divided and applied according to the v6 vt vt r3 r3 r6 ratio of 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 the basis of rdi optimization based on soil fc the levels of water stress experienced by maize plants can be roughly divided into the following categories 70 fc no water stress 60 70 fc mild water stress 50 60 fc moderate water stress 50 fc severe water stress kang et al 2000 zhang and cheng 2009 wei et al 2018 in these rdi studies each irrigation was initiated based on a specific water stress levels however farmers typically use an irrigation interval of 6 15 d under mulched drip irrigation zhang et al 2019 in other words there is no the specific water stress level before each irrigation in actual production 2 2 4 optimization of rdi design our experiment consisted of six rdi treatments fig 4 the full irrigation

growth periods in eq 3 the h was set at a depth of 60 cm during the jointing tasseling stage and a depth of 80 cm during the tasseling maturity stage during rdi the real time soil water content swc v v was measured at 10 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm with a water monitor zhishang et100 hangzhou dongfang zhigan zhejiang technology co ltd fig 5 a this frequency domain reflectometry fdr based water monitor is powered by solar panels and built in lithium batteries and continuously monitors soil water in multiple soil layers at the same location transmits data to the cloud in real time through the 4 g network and performs in depth analysis of the data the real time volumetric swc of each treatment was automatically collected every 2 h the amount of water applied during the first irrigation interval after the jointing stage in treatments rdi1 rdi5 was based on a threshold of 60 mm which represents the local amount for first irrigation lafi specifically the amount of irrigation applied during this time period in the rdi1 rdi2 and rdi4 treatments was 60 mm in the rdi3 treatment was 42 mm 70 lafi and in the rdi5 treatment was 30 mm 50 lafi subsequently the amount of water applied per irrigation interval of each treatment during the maize growth period was determined based on the swsa of the h measured the day before irrigation 2 3 field management a high yield density tolerant maize hybrid cv xianyu 335 was used in two optimal irrigation experiments the mulched drip irrigation and dense planting 12 0 104 ha 1 cultivation modes were adopted the area of each plot was 165 m2 15 m 11 m wide narrow 70 40 cm row planting was adopted fig 5 b before sowing drip tapes were placed under plastic film with punch holes for seedling growth a precision seeder acme bzq acme china was used for sowing the seeds at an average depth of 5 cm to ensure uniform plant density seeds were sown along each row and covered with thin soil a transparent plastic film 90 cm wide and 0 01 mm thick tianye inc xinjiang china was used for the experiment the drip irrigation belt was maintained at an emitter spacing of 30 cm and a flow rate of 3 2 l h 1 at 0 1 mpa operating pressure irrigation water was pumped from groundwater the coefficient of drip irrigation is 0 90 maize was sown on april 21 2019 and april 18 2020 and harvested on october 3 2019 and september 30 2020 after sowing all experimental fields were immediately irrigated with 30 mm of water based on the soil water shortage in the topsoil 0 20 cm 50 7 mm in 2019 and 48 4 mm in 2020 to guarantee rapid seed germination and uniform seedling emergence in 2020 precipitation at the seedling stage was only 5 1 mm and the jointing stage was advanced 12 15 d because of drought therefore all treatments received 36 3 mm of irrigation on may 21 the plants were not irrigated from ve emergence to jointing stage to induce slight drought and promote root penetration thereby avoiding lodging which typically occurs in the tasseling milk stage based on the initial nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k contents in the 0 100 cm soil profile base fertilizers including urea 150 kg ha 1 n potassium phosphate 225 kg

1 additional urea totally 600 kg ha 1 n was applied at the jointing tasseling and milk stages of maize to all treatments at a ratio of 3 4 3 all weeds diseases and pests in the experimental plots were controlled 2 4 measurement indices 2 4 1 soil water content swc the swc v v of the di and rdi treatments was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm by time domain reflectometry tdr using a tube probe trime iph imko germany fig 4 a in each plot three 150 cm long tubes were deployed adjacent to the drip tapes and two between the drip tapes fig 4 b data were presented as the average swc

before and after each irrigation and precipitation event according to previous research 70 swsfc is the ideal lower limit for soil water in maize fields under mulched drip irrigation and 60 swsfc is the lower limit for mild water stress zhang et al 2019 2 4 2 crop evapotranspiration etc and daily crop evapotranspiration dce total etc during the growing season i e the actual evapotranspiration mm

increased by 13 5 24 1 and the wpi was increased by 36 0 41 6 in rdi1 rdi5 respectively the wpc did not differ significantly between the rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 and rdi4 treatments although the wpc of these

3 soil water the total soil water storage sws within the 0 100 cm soil gradient was influenced by both irrigation method and rainfall and varied across maize growth stages fig 6 under optimized di the sws of four di treatments di1 di2 di3 di4 stabilized at approximately 70 swsfc during irrigation events indicative of a good soil water environment fig 6 a b during the v6 vt and r3 r6 growth stages the sws of the di3 di4 and di5 treatments remained close to 70 swsfc prior to irrigation compared with ck the sws of the di1 di2 di3 and di4 treatments were reduced by 2 9 5 7 8 4 and 11 7 during the v6 vt stage and by 2 8 5 9 9 2 and 11 8 during the r3 r6 stage respectively under optimized rdi the sws of the rdi1 and rdi2 treatments stabilized at approximately 70 swsfc during irrigation events fig 6 c d the sws of the rdi3 and rdi4 treatments stabilized between 60 and 70 swsfc during the vt r3 stage indicating that rdi does not induce severe drought stress during the water sensitive growth period compared with ck the sws of rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 were reduced by 5 9 6 9 11 7 7 2 and 16 8 during the v6 vt stage and by 3 0 4 5 8 0 10 3 and 15 7 during the r3 r6 stage respectively taken together our data suggest that neither di nor rdi significantly reduced sws during the water insensitive growth periods v6 vt and r3 r6 in addition under both the di and rdi regimes the sws during the r3 r6 stage was higher in 2020 than in 2019 this was likely because of the occurrence of greater precipitation more cloudy days and less sunshine after the r3 growth period in 2020 the soil water content swc was relatively stable in the 80 100 cm soil layer over the maize growing season fig 7 however the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer varied under optimized di the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer was not significantly different between di1 di2 and ck during the water sensitive growth period vt r3 during the water insensitive growth period the of the 0 60 cm soil layer was lower in the four di treatments compared to ck under optimized rdi the soil water content of the 0 60 cm soil layer was lower in the five rdi treatments compared to ck during the irrigation event v6 r6 it appears that compared with di rdi results in a lower soil water content during vt r3 3 4 daily crop evapotranspiration dce and phase water consumption coefficient kp under optimized di the dce during the v6 vt stage decreased by 6 7 10 0 13 3 and 16 6 in the di1 di2 di3 and di4 treatments compared to ck respectively during the r3 r6 stage the dce decreased by 6 7 10 0 13 3 and 16 6 respectively these results indicate that di effectively reduced the water consumption of maize during the water insensitive growth period fig 8 a b however during vt r3 stage the dce was higher in the di1 and di2 treatments than in ck indicating that maize maintained increased water consumption during this growth period under optimized rdi the dce of the five rdi treatments was significantly lower than ck throughout the entire growing season demonstrating that optimized rdi can reduce the dce of maize during irrigation periods fig 8 c d during the v6 vt stage the dce of the ck treatment was 14 8 11 1 14 5 10 0 and 16 6 higher than rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 rdi5 and rdi5 respectively during the r3 r6 stage the dce of the ck treatment was 26 3 29 4 30 2 35 1 and 34 1 higher respectively in maize the demand for water varies with growth stage namely from sowing to v6 sow v6 from v6 to vt v6 vt from vt to r3 vt r3 and from r3 to r6 r3 r6 fig 9 under optimized di the kp of the di1 di2 di3 and di4 treatments were reduced by 4 0 4 5 9 9 and 0 3 compared to ck during the r3 r6 stage under optimized rdi the kp of the rdi1 rdi2 rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 treatments were reduced by 3 4 4 6 4 7 7 0 and 6 0 compared to ck during the r3 r6 stage additionally the kp was the lowest between sowing v6 in both di and rdi treatments 3 5 leaf area index lai across all treatments and growth periods the maize lai was the highest in the ck treatment laimax 7 4 at the vt stage fig 10 under optimized di there was no significant difference in laimax between di1 di2 di3 and ck however laimax was significantly reduced in the di4 treatment laimax 6 8 compared to ck at the r6 stage there was no significant difference in lai between di1 di2 and ck however laimax was significantly reduced in the di3 and di4 treatments compared to ck under optimized rdi the laimax was significantly reduced at the vt stage in the rdi5 treatment laimax 6 6 compared to ck fig 10 c d and at the r6 stage in the rdi3 and rdi5 treatments 3 6 dry matter dm accumulation we simulated the process of maize dm accumulation using a logistic equation fig 11 which indicated that the initiation t 1 of rapid dm accumulation occurred at the v12 v13 stage and termination t 2 occurred at the r3 r4 stage under optimized di t 2 was advanced by 1 2 d and the period of rapid dm accumulation t was shortened by 1 2 d in the di3 and di4 treatments compared to ck in addition the maximum rate of dry matter accumulation vmax was reduced in the di3 and di4 treatments in effect the accumulation of dm was reduced in the di3 and di4 treatments compared to ck at r6 stage there was no significant difference in dm accumulation between di1 di2 and ck under optimized rdi t 1 was delayed by 1 d and t 2 was delayed by 1 3 d in the rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 treatments compared to ck resulting in increasing t by 1 2 d the v max was reduced by 10 2 12 8 8 2 8 5 and 17 0 18 4 in the rdi3 di4 and di5 treatments respectively therefore the accumulation of dm was reduced in the rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 treatments compared to ck at the r6 stage fig 11 a b there was no significant difference in dm accumulation between rdi1 rdi2 and ck 3 7 path analysis a path analysis was conducted on the sws lai dm gy and yield components in the di and rdi experiments fig 12 overall sws was significantly positively correlated with laimax at the vt stage sws at r3 stage was significantly positively correlated with lai at the r6 stage dm was significantly positively correlated with laimax lai kn kw and gy at r6 stage and gy was significantly positively correlated with kn and kw these correlations suggest that di and rdi alter gy by affecting the leaf photosynthetic area the accumulation of photoassimilates and yield composition 3 8 a sustainable irrigation strategy to increase yield and wpc based on di and rdi the results of our study indicate that both high maize yield and wpc can be sustainably maintained by optimizing di and rdi regimes fig 13 this irrigation regime comprehensively considers changes in both water consumption and soil water over the entire maize growth period furthermore the proposed irrigation regime is designed to reduce etc during water insensitive growth periods maintain high grain yield and improve wpc based on our research we propose the following optimized irrigation method 1 based on the sws at a depth of 0 20 cm prior to sowing the soil should be irrigated immediately after sowing to increase sws and ensure uniform emergence 2 irrigation should be withheld between the seedling and v10 stages under normal precipitation conditions reducing etc to about 36 of e if the field receives less than average rainfall the first irrigation can be advanced to the 6 leaf stage 3 less than full irrigation should be applied between the v6 and vt stages to relieve early drought stress additional water may be necessary to obtain greater lai 4 full irrigation should be applied between the vt and r3 stages at which time maize is particularly sensitive to drought during this period optimal soil moisture is necessary to maintain maximum transpiration and accumulation of photosynthates 5 less than full irrigation should be applied between the r3 and r6 stages care should be taken to avoid premature senescence of green leaves and maintain a high grain yield 4 discussion 4 1 optimized di and rdi result in high dm accumulation yield and wpc the accumulation of dm forms the material basis of gy and is significantly reduced by drought stress karam et al 2003 in maize total gy is primarily dictated by kn and kw and the primary mechanism by which drought stress reduces grain yield is through reducing these components golzardi et al 2017 wang et al 2021b in this study we found that the accumulation of dm kn and kw was not significantly reduced by either 20 water deficit di2 or 85 ir at the r3 r6 stage rdi2 however these indices were significantly reduced by 30 40 water deficit di3 and di4 and 70 ir at the v6 vt and r3 r6 stages rdi3 rdi4 and rdi5 overall we were able to maintain high maize yields 15 0 mg ha 1 while increasing wpc 2 7 kg m 3 indicating that efficient dm accumulation was maintained although water deficits were incurred by both the optimized di di1 di4 and rdi rdi1 rdi5 regimes however water deficit can significantly affect both maize yield and wpc water stress occurring at either the vegetative or early reproductive stages can reduce maize yield by 22 6 26 4 pandey et al 2000 studies report that water stress can reduce maize yields by 10 76 with the magnitude of reduction being dependent on both the intensity of water stress and the growth stage pandey et al 2000 karam et al 2003 domínguez et al 2012 here we adopted an optimized di regime based on the water demand of maize at different growth stages compared with the ideal irrigation amount of 540 mm ck grain yield was stabilized 15 0 mg ha 1 and both wpc and wpi were significantly increased 7 3 14 7 and 10 3 33 4 respectively under 10 30 water deficit di2 di3 and di4 table 2 furthermore compared with the amount of irrigation used by local farmers 720 mm in 2018 and 2019 wang et al 2021a our method both stabilized high grain yield 15 0 mg ha 1 and increased wpc by 31 2 51 2 while reducing total irrigation by 25 0 47 5 optimizing rdi according to the water needs of each growth stage can increase wpc without sacrificing grain yield mild water deficit should be applied during the initial and vegetative growth stages domínguez et al 2012 yin et al 2013 while moderate and higher deficits should be applied during the ripening and grain filling stages domínguez et al 2012 xue et al 2013 here we found that under the rdi2 85 ir at the milk maturity stage treatment not only was maize yield not significantly reduced but both wpc and wpi were significantly increased 19 9 23 4 and 38 3 40 1 respectively table 2 by withholding water at the milk maturity stage we maintained high maize grain yield 15 0 mg ha 1 while increasing wpc 2 7 kg m 3 in 2019 rdi4 70 ir at the r3 r6 stage treatment significantly reduced maize yield suggesting that 85 ir at the r3 r6 stage may be the lower limit to maintain high yield 15 0 mg ha 1 although there were significant differences in both yield and wpc among the five rdi treatments there was no significant difference in wpi this is primarily due to the different amounts of irrigation water applied at each maize growth stage 4 2 di results in higher maize yields and rdi uses less irrigation water by optimizing the di and rdi regimes we saved between 10 0 and 30 0 and 28 9 34 3 of irrigation water respectively the di strategy minimizes water use while maintaining maize yield which makes this irrigation method an attractive option in mediterranean bozkurt et al 2011 semi arid dağdelen et al 2006 and arid lack et al 2012 regions according to our previous research maize has similar water demands over the growth period in arid semi arid and semi humid areas wang et al 2021a therefore our optimized di strategy may be useful for increasing grain yield and wpc in these areas here we designed an optimized rdi strategy based on the level of water deficit tolerable at different maize growth stages rdi is a more scientific strategy that reflects the theoretical lower limit to irrigation which can maintain high yields in supplemental irrigation areas with higher precipitation the rdi strategy can be highly effective at lowering water use although its implementation requires real time monitoring of soil water status compared with traditional rdi kang et al 2000 zhang and cheng 2009 wei et al 2018 our proposed optimized rdi strategy is more suitable for use in real world contexts compared with di both soil water consumption and rotation irrigation schedule are explicitly considered by rdi 4 3 rdi is superior to di at reducing ineffective etc here we found that sws was significantly positively correlated with gy research suggests that the highest yield may be obtained when soil water is 65 70 of swsfc li et al 2015 under mulched drip irrigation 70 swsfc is the ideal lower limit for soil water in maize fields and 60 swsfc is the lower limit for mild water stress zhang et al 2019 in this study the sws of the di2 treatment was nearly 70 of swsfc at the tasseling maturity stage indicative of a good soil water environment fig 6 simultaneously the rdi2 treatment was irrigated to fc during the v6 r3 stage and consequently ear formation and development were not affected by water stress between 100 and 150 d after sowing the sws stabilized to 70 of swsfc these results indicate that the maize rhizosphere continually experienced an ideal soil water environment under both the optimized di and rdi regimes the total water consumption of a crop includes both physiological and ecological water consumption both of which are related to the intricacies of the growth and development cycle in maize for example the ratio of plant transpiration and soil evaporation differs among growth stages during the middle stages of maize growth 80 of etc is due to transpiration while the ratio of transpiration to etc decreased by 74 at the late grain filling stage liu et al 2002 the status of the soil surface can also considerably alter water consumption with 64 9 of etc at the seedling stage attributable to soil evaporation due to exposure of the soil surface liu et al 2002 another study reported that from sowing to the seedling stage the majority of etc is due to evaporation from the bare soil surface while more than 90 of etc is due to crop transpiration when the plants fully cover the soil surface waller and yitayew 2016 the use of mulch film has been shown to reduce soil evaporation by 55 although patches of bare soil between wide rows can still generate significant evaporation zhang et al 2019 our previous research found that transpiration accounted for 96 8 and 94 7 of etc under mulched drip irrigation at the v10 vt and vt r3 stages respectively fig 3 under mulched drip irrigation the vt r3 stage is the most water sensitive period of maize growth wang et al 2021a in this study the peak dce occurred at the vt stage additionally we found that laimax was not significantly reduced in the di2 di3 di4 rdi1 rdi2 and rdi4 treatments taken together these results suggest that neither optimized di nor rdi inhibited transpiration during water sensitive growth periods according to our analysis of e etc and tr etc under the 540 mm irrigation amount fig 3 e accounted for 36 0 and 13 5 of total etc during the sowing v10 and the r3 r6 stages respectively our optimized di and rdi regimes reduced total etc by 44 6 63 0 mm and 138 6 144 6 mm respectively furthermore the kp was lower during water insensitive growth periods sowing v6 and r3 r6 under both optimized di and rdi therefore we suggest that our optimized di and rdi regimes can reduce etc during the water insensitive periods of maize growth under water deficit thereby reducing the total seasonal etc and increasing wpc however compared with di optimized rdi can both save more water and achieve higher wpi making this irrigation method attractive and convenient for maize production in areas suffering severe water shortages 4 4 the ways for sustainability of maize production are provided in irrigation area and supplementary irrigation area at present a sizeable portion of northern china cannot be feasibly used for crop production due to limited water availability feike et al 2015 three of our optimized di treatments di2 di3 and di4 and all five of our optimized rdi treatments were able to reduce the amount of irrigation water by 54 162 mm and 151 180 mm respectively furthermore high grain yield was stabilized 15 0 mg ha 1 and wpc was significantly increased 2 7 kg m 3 by our optimized di and rdi strategies thus these high yield water saving maize production strategies are proposed for adoption in northern china fig 13 as droughts and water shortages are projected to increase in severity these optimized irrigation strategies may be a sustainable method to maintain high maize yields and wpc in both irrigated and supplementarily irrigated contexts for example winter wheat is one of the primary food crops grown across the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china second only to maize jin et al 2007 chen et al 2015 the heading grain filling stage is considered to be the growth stage with the highest water demand accounting for 57 of total water consumption liu et al 2002 additionally wheat yield is significantly reduced by water stress at the jointing heading stage chennafi et al 2006 generally speaking the peak water consumption of winter wheat and the vegetative stage of spring maize are synchronized and the two crops compete for irrigation water based on the two optimal irrigation strategies proposed in this study irrigation water withheld during the v6 vt stage of maize could instead be supplied to winter wheat thereby maximizing the utilization of regional agricultural irrigation water 5 conclusion here we optimized deficit irrigation di and regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies based on changes in water consumption and soil water storage over the maize growth period compared with the application of 540 mm of water during each irrigation interval our optimized di and rdi strategies stabilized high grain yield while increasing water productivity by 7 3 14 7 and 13 6 22 3 and irrigation water productivity by 10 3 33 4 and 36 0 41 3 respectively additionally etc was significantly reduced during the water insensitive growth period and dry matter accumulation and leaf area were maintained we propose that these optimized irrigation methods which combine knowledge about crop water consumption and soil water storage can improve maize yield and water productivity in arid and semi arid production areas declaration of competing interest the authors

9034,the loess plateau is a major area for apple production in china and improper irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer managements have affected the sustainable development of the apple industry in this region therefore this study aims to 1 investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on soil available nitrogen and apple yield in loess plateau 2 explore the optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen managements based on soil nitrogen and apple yield for this purpose a four year irrigation and nitrogen management experiment was conducted from 2016 to 2019 in loess plateau according to the water and nitrogen fertilizer requirement of apple tree 4 irrigation levels w1 no irrigation w2 60 etc w3 80 etc w4 100 etc and 4 nitrogen fertilizer levels n1 375 kg ha 1 n2 490 kg ha 1 n3 605 kg ha 1 n4 720 kg ha 1 were applied to the experiment the results showed that irrigation and nitrogen levels had pronounced effects on soil available nitrogen distribution content uniformity coefficient cu apple yield stable index si sustainable yield index syi and nitrogen surplus with the increase in irrigation level the soil available nitrogen accumulation area changed from the surface to the bottom and the content and cu of soil available nitrogen first increased and then decreased the greater nitrogen level was accompanied by surface aggregation of soil available nitrogen and nitrogen surplus with the increase in nitrogen level the cu and dulq of soil available nitrogen significantly decreased while duhq decreased first and then increased moreover the increasing irrigation and nitrogen level improved the apple yield yield stability and sustainability based on the comprehensive evaluation and simulation analysis the recommend irrigation and nitrogen level was 129 172 mm and 500 720 kg ha 1 respectively with the intention of stabilize and sustaining apple yield and reducing environmental risk however there are still potential environmental problems in the recommended nitrogen level further improvements are needed such as coating compound fertilizer and integration of water and fertilizer to achieve the dual goals of soil sustainability and environmental security keywords apple nitrogen distribution uniformity coefficient nitrogen balance stable index sustainable yield index data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the most critical important factors for the agriculture system throughout the world gheysari et al 2009 as the primary source of soil nitrogen nitrogen fertilizer has been reported to be a sensitive parameter of soil nitrogen content and much evidence suggests that yield is related to soil nitrogen content muchow 1988 zhang et al 2021a an appropriate nitrogen supply can improve root development water and nutrient uptake drenovsky et al 2012 crop quality li et al 2021 and plant drought resistance alandia et al 2016 the positive effects of nitrogen and the growing demand for food have led to the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer however instead of increasing yields excessive nitrogen fertilizer inputs reduce nitrogen use efficiency and contribute to the nitrogen surplus and accumulation in the soil tilman et al 2002 in fact an appropriate amount of nitrogen surplus is conducive to enhancing soil nutrients and productivity while excessive nitrogen surplus and accumulation in the soil have created the risk of nitrogen leaching apple is one of the most important fruit crops worldwide hou et al 2021 as one of the largest apple producing areas in the world the loess plateau is also the eugenics area of the apple industry in china it covers an area of 628600 ha accounting for more than 25 of china s apple production due to the excessive pursuit of high yield and large size fruit overuse of chemical fertilizer is very common in this area especially nitrogen fertilizer the average nitrogen fertilizer application rate in loess plateau is 1032 kg ha 1 111 higher than the average nitrogen fertilizer use for apple orchards 490 kg ha 1 in china zhao et al 2017 excessive nitrogen inputs have resulted in a large nitrogen surplus liu et al 2015 reported a nitrogen surplus rate of 328 1 in loess plateau apple orchards 67 3 of the nitrogen surplus accumulated in the soil as nitrate which can easily cause nitrogen leaching zhu et al 2021 in addition to nitrogen accumulation in the soil irrigation level is another crucial factor that affecting nitrogen leaching by altering the subsurface drainage of the farmland gheysari et al 2009 reported that high nitrogen leaching occurred simultaneously with the high levels of irrigation and fertilization events unscientific water and fertilizer management can cause nitrogen leaching and lead to a series of environmental problems such as soil acidification groundwater pollution and surface water eutrophication lai et al 2013 obviously misuse of nitrogen fertilizer is an essential limiting factor restricting the sustainable development of the apple industry in loess plateau optimizing nitrogen and irrigation management is critical to obtain consistently sustainable and stable high yields at low environmental costs nilahyane et al 2018 many observations have been conducted on irrigation and nitrogen management in loess plateau apple orchards zhong et al 2019 reported that fruit yield quality and water use efficiency wue of apple trees were significantly affected by water deficit during different growth stages the comprehensive benefits of apple tree yield wue and nitrogen partial factor productivity were maximized under 60 75 field capacity and 0 45 kg plant 1 of nitrogen fertilizer dai et al 2021 moreover both alternate partial root zone irrigation and mulching can increase the yield and wue du et al 2017 liao et al 2021 however few studies have been conducted on the effects of irrigation and nitrogen management on soil nitrogen distribution nitrogen balance sustainable yield index syi and stable index si which are used to estimate the yield sustainability and stability of apple han et al 2020 mi et al 2023 the distribution of nitrogen in soil affects nitrogen surplus by affecting nitrogen use efficiency and yield and finally affects nitrogen leaching the nitrogen balance is one of the potentially useful methods for predicting the risk of nitrogen leaching into groundwater barry et al 1993 puckett et al 1999 quantifying the nitrogen balance is an essential step towards sustainable management moreover as an important reflection of the quality of farmland ecosystems both yield stability and sustainability are essential indicators for evaluating farmland sustainability han et al 2020 nevertheless research on yield stability has mainly focused on the yield performance among different varieties in breeding and genetic clarke et al 2019 overall additional information about the effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on soil nitrogen distribution nitrogen balance yield sustainability and stability will help determine scientifically reliable irrigation and fertilization strategies for stable and sustainable yields with a low environmental cost in this context the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on soil nitrogen distribution characteristics nitrogen balance apple yield sustainability and stability and 2 to develop appropriate nitrogen and irrigation management strategies with the intention of these indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this four year field experiment was conducted in luochuan yan an city shaanxi province of china 35º41 15 n 109º30 24 e 1072 m a s l during 2016 2019 the experimental site is situated in a typical hilly gully region and the central part of the loess plateau apple production region zhang et al 2019 the region is in the temperate and semi humid climate zone with an average annual temperature rainfall evaporation and sunshine duration of 9 2 c 550 650 mm 1600 2000 mm and 2632 9 h respectively the soil texture and hydraulic conductivity were shown in table 1 2 2 experiment 16 year old apple trees malus domestica borkh cv naganofuji no 2 were selected as the experimental trees the trees were planted at a spacing of 4 m 5 m 500 plants ha 1 the experiment consisted of two parts the experiment of irrigation level and the experiment of nitrogen level irrigation water is scarce in the experimental area peng et al 2017 referring to the management of local fruit growers and previous studies zhao et al 2012 four irrigation levels were set in the irrigation experiment table 2 no irrigation w1 low irrigation w2 60 etc moderate irrigation w3 80 etc and high irrigation w4 100 etc the average nitrogen fertilizer application rate in loess plateau is as high as 1032 kg ha 1 an application rate that has been proven by numerous studies to be excessive and irrational hou et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 therefore by combining previous studies and actual local nitrogen fertilizer application hao et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 four nitrogen application rates were set in the nitrogen experiment table 2 n1 375 kg ha 1 n2 490 kg ha 1 n3 605 kg ha 1 and n4 720 kg ha 1 in the irrigation level experiment the nitrogen level of all 4 treatments was n2 similarly in the nitrogen level experiment the irrigation level of all 4 treatments was w2 obviously w2 and n2 treatments had the same irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer levels this means that there were actually 7 treatments in this study to facilitate understanding we referred to this treatment as w2 and n2 in irrigation level experiment and nitrogen fertilizer level experiment respectively table 2 irrigation was carried out every 15 days from april to october during 2016 2019 cai et al 2021 du et al 2017 irrigation amount was referred to eqs 1 and 2 the irrigation events and levels were displayed in fig 1 and table 2 for different irrigation level treatments from 2016 to 2019 circular drip irrigation was used for irrigation in this study tang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b an irrigation pipeline was laid in a circinal shape around the tree with a radius of 70 cm fig 2 moreover 10 drippers were evenly arranged on each tree fertilizers applied in the experiment were obtained at local markets in the form of urea potassium phosphate and potassium sulfate in the early of march and june ditch fertilizing was carried out between the tree rows at a distance of 100 cm from the plant with a ditch length of 40 50 cm a ditch width of 20 30 cm and ditch depth of 20 30 cm the specific fertilization levels for march and june can be obtained from table 2 each treatment had three replicates etc was calculated as 1 etc i 1 n et 0 k c p 0 2 p 0 p p r p d α p where et o is the reference evapotranspiration and calculated using the fao penman monteith equation k c is the single crop coefficient and taken as follows wang et al 2000 in april k c 0 61 in may k c 0 79 in june k c 0 92 in july k c 0 85 in august k c 0 83 in september k c 1 13 in october k c 0 53 p 0 and p are the effective rainfall and average daily rainfall respectively pr and pd are the surface runoff and deep leakage caused by rainfall α is the effective utilization coefficient of rainfall and the value of α is taken as follows p 5 mm α 0 5 mm p 50 mm α 1 0 p 50 mm α 0 8 zhang et al 2023 2 3 soil water content and soil available nitrogen soil samples were collected from each experimental plot using an auger the sampling depth was 200 cm and the interval was 20 cm a total of 8 points were taken from each experimental plot in a z shape and the specific locations were shown in fig 2 from 2016 2019 soil samples from these 8 points were used to determine the soil water content in october using oven drying method the soil water content was the average of the soil samples from the 8 points available nitrogen is a form of inorganic nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen and easily hydrolyzed organic nitrogen easily absorbed and used by plants zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 the short term nitrogen supply capacity of the soil can be reflected through soil available nitrogen lu et al 2019 the soil sampling points a b and c were used to analyze the distribution of soil available nitrogen in october 2019 and soil available nitrogen was determined by the procedures described by lu 2000 2 3 apple yield and wue apple yield was determined by the weighing method the underground water in this study was above 50 m below the ground level moreover due to the drip irrigation with low irrigation level no runoff and deep percolation were generated during the growing season therefore the wue kg m 3 could be simplified to 3 wue y po i w where y i p 0 and w are the apple yield kg ha 1 irrigation mm effective rainfall m3 ha 1 and change in soil water storage m3 ha 1 in the range of 0 200 cm between the beginning and end of every experiment year respectively 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 uniformity of soil available nitrogen the coefficient of uniformity cu proposed by christiansen christiansen 1942 can describe the deviation of the soil available nitrogen at different depths the cu of soil available nitrogen was calculated as follows 4 cu 1 δ h h where cu is the soil available nitrogen uniformity coefficient ranging between 1 very high uniformity and 0 very low uniformity the h and δh were calculated as follows 5 h 1 n i 1 n h i 6 δ h 1 n i 1 n h i h where n is the number of soil samples and i is the observed available nitrogen for the i th grid when most of the soil available nitrogen content values are close to the average value the cu cannot reflect the maximum or minimum value of individual points distribution uniformity coefficient beale and howell 1966 emphasizes the part of the soil with extreme available nitrogen value which is helpful in understanding the characteristics of soil available nitrogen leaching and aggregation the du was calculated as follows 7 d u lq 1 4 i 1 n 4 h q i 1 n i 1 n h i 8 d u hq 1 4 i 3 n 4 n h q i 1 n i 1 n h i where du lq and du hq are 1 4 low and high uniformity coefficient respectively h qi is the observed soil available nitrogen for the i th grid in order from low to high 2 4 2 sustainable yield index and stable index sustainable yield index and stable index were calculated as follows han et al 2020 9 sustainable yield index ῡ σ y max 10 stable index σ ῡ where σ is standard deviation ῡ and y max are the average and maximum apple yields in all experimental years respectively a larger sustainable yield index indicates a more sustainable yield and a smaller stable index represents a more stable yield 2 4 3 nitrogen balance soil nitrogen balance was obtained by the following formula qaswar et al 2020 van eerdt and fong 1998 11 nitrogen surplus input components fertilizer atmospheric nitrogen deposition output components nitrogen moved by fruits nitrogen moved by branches 12 nitrogen surplus rate input components output components input components nitrogen inputs from fertilizers were calculated in table 2 the atmospheric nitrogen deposition was estimated as 18 88 kg ha 1 zhu et al 2021 the average nitrogen content of apple fruits and branches was 0 31 and 0 78 respectively wan et al 2020 apple yields were calculated based on actual yield data and the amount of pruning of apple branches were calculated from published literature wan et al 2020 2 4 4 comprehensive evaluation the quality index qi was calculated to assess the overall response of irrigation and nitrogen management to soil available nitrogen and apple yield obriot et al 2016 considering the correlation between factors the factors for comprehensive evaluation were determined by principal component analysis and pearson correlation analysis askari et al 2015 vasu et al 2016 each factor was given a weight according to the pearson correlation coefficient between the factors if the correlation coefficient 0 60 the factor with a small weight could be considered redundant therefore eliminated from the factor collections for a correlation coefficient 0 6 both factors were considered necessary thus they were retained in the factor collections andrews et al 2002 then calculate the weight of the selected factors and the qi was calculated as follows 13 q i i 1 n s i w i where n is the number of selected factors w i is the weighted factor and s i is the score calculated by linear scoring liebig et al 2001 vasu et al 2016 2 5 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the difference of content cu and du of soil available nitrogen apple yield nitrogen balance and evaluation score differences were considered significant at 0 05 level by the fisher s least significant difference lsd test the analysis was carried out with spss version 20 0 spss inc usa and matlab 2020a mathworks usa and origin 2019b originlab northampton usa was used for mapping 3 results 3 1 soil available nitrogen distribution 3 1 1 soil available nitrogen distribution under different irrigation levels as shown in fig 3 the distribution of soil available nitrogen varied with irrigation levels in the vertical direction with the increase in irrigation level there was an overall tendency for reduction of soil available nitrogen in the upper soil layer with a subsequent increase in the lower soil layer the soil available nitrogen of w1 treatment was mainly distributed in the 0 100 cm soil layer with the maximum value 359 77 mg kg 1 occurring at a depth of 60 cm compared with w1 the accumulation range of soil available nitrogen in w2 treatment dropped to 40 160 cm and its maximum value 258 75 mg kg 1 appeared at a depth of 120 cm further increase in irrigation level caused a rapid decrease of soil available nitrogen in the upper layer and a sharp increase in the lower layer treatment in w4 the maximum value 288 72 mg kg 1 appeared at a depth of 160 cm and higher soil available nitrogen was observed than any other treatments w1 w2 and w3 in the 160 200 cm soil layer which represented a higher potential risk of nitrogen loss the horizontal distribution of the soil available nitrogen also varied over irrigation levels fig 3 soil available nitrogen distribution range was relatively large with a high irrigation level the soil available nitrogen of w1 treatment main distributed within the 200 cm width more extensive distribution ranges were observed in w3 and w4 treatments two to three times that of w1 treatment moreover the maximum value appeared in the middle of the tree row in w1 w2 and w3 treatments in comparison the maximum value of w4 treatment was directly below the tree row 3 1 2 soil available nitrogen distribution under different nitrogen levels there were apparent differences in the profile distributions of soil available nitrogen at different nitrogen fertilizer levels fig 4 in the vertical direction with the increase in nitrogen level there was an overall tendency for increasing of soil available nitrogen at the upper soil layer in n1 treatment the soil available nitrogen was mainly distributed in the 100 200 cm soil layer and the maximum value 152 12 mg kg 1 appeared at a depth of 160 cm the increased nitrogen application rate drove the soil available nitrogen accumulation range upward the soil available nitrogen in n2 and n3 treatments accumulated in 40 140 cm and 0 120 cm soil layers respectively and the available nitrogen values peaked at 120 cm and 60 cm depths respectively moreover in n4 treatment the soil available nitrogen distributed in the upper soil layer 0 100 cm with a significant peak at the 0 60 cm soil layer in general the soil available nitrogen distribution changed from bottom accumulation to surface accumulation as the nitrogen level increased horizontally for different nitrogen levels the soil available nitrogen peaked in the middle of the tree rows and gradually decreased with an increase in lateral distance this might be explained by the fertilization location and nitrogen uptake the soil available nitrogen in the tree rows increased rapidly with increasing nitrogen level indicating that higher nitrogen fertilizer levels could provide better nutrient conditions for apple trees 3 2 soil available nitrogen content 3 2 1 soil available nitrogen content under different irrigation levels irrigation level had a significant effect on soil available nitrogen content and the effect varied with soil layers fig 5a the soil available nitrogen content in 0 100 cm soil layer followed the order of w1 w2 w3 w4 indicating a significant adverse effect however a significant positive effect was found in 100 200 cm soil layer with the soil available nitrogen content in the order of w3 w4 w2 w1 compared with w1 the soil available nitrogen content in w3 and w4 treatments decreased by 11 2 and 28 9 in 0 100 cm soil layer respectively and increased by 169 6 and 158 2 in 100 200 cm soil layer respectively as a result the available nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil layer increased first and then decreased the lowest soil available nitrogen content occurred in w1 while the highest content was obtained by w3 due to the soil available nitrogen accumulation in 100 200 cm soil layer w4 treatment had the risk of nitrogen leaching consistent with the characteristics of available nitrogen distribution fig 3 3 2 2 soil available nitrogen content under different nitrogen levels nitrogen level also presented a significant positive effect on soil available nitrogen content in 0 100 cm 100 200 cm and 0 200 cm soil layers respectively fig 5b with the increasing nitrogen level from 375 kg ha 1 n1 to 490 kg ha 1 n2 and 605 kg ha 1 n3 the soil available nitrogen content increased by 62 9 and 99 1 in 0 200 cm soil layer respectively while the higher nitrogen application rate n4 720 kg ha 1 produced the highest soil available nitrogen content with the value of 213 0 mg kg 1 compared with n1 n2 and n3 n4 has increased the soil available nitrogen content by 202 4 mg kg 1 137 1 mg kg 1 and 99 3 mg kg 1 in 0 100 cm soil layer and 103 0 mg kg 1 74 0 mg kg 1 and 58 6 mg kg 1 in 100 200 cm soil layer respectively all these indicated that nitrogen level had a stronger effect on 0 100 cm soil layer than 100 200 cm soil layer furthermore the greater effect of nitrogen level on soil available nitrogen content in 0 100 cm soil layer exacerbated the difference between 0 and 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layers fig 5b there was no significant difference in soil available nitrogen content between 0 and 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layers in n1 however significant differences were found in n2 n3 and n4 treatments respectively the soil available nitrogen content gap between 0 and 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layer was 49 5 mg kg 1 and 72 0 mg kg 1 in n2 and n3 treatments respectively treatment in n4 the difference in soil available nitrogen content between 0 and 100 cm and 100 200 cm was greater than any other treatments n1 n2 n3 which indicated that high nitrogen levels exacerbated the spatial heterogeneity of soil available nitrogen 3 3 nitrogen uniformity 3 3 1 cu of soil available nitrogen due to the extraordinary efficiency of soil available nitrogen migration with water irrigation level had a significant effect on the cu of soil available nitrogen fig 6a the cu of soil available nitrogen in 0 200 cm soil layer showed a parabola with an opening downward the lowest and highest cu values were detected in w1 and w2 treatments respectively in w2 and w3 treatments the cu values were 0 66 and 0 64 respectively significantly higher than that of w1 and w4 however there was no significant difference between w2 and w3 treatments obviously appropriate irrigation levels could effectively increase the uniformity of soil available nitrogen and reduce accumulation significant differences in cu of soil available nitrogen were also observed for different nitrogen levels in 0 200 cm soil layer fig 6b the cu of soil available nitrogen in n1 and n2 treatments were 0 69 and 0 66 and these values were significantly higher by 25 5 and 20 0 as compared to n3 the lowest cu value was detected in n4 with a value of 0 53 there was no significance between n1 and n2 similar in n3 and n4 generally it was again emphasized that nitrogen supply significantly increased the spatial variability of soil available nitrogen the above results show that both irrigation and nitrogen levels affected the uniformity of soil available nitrogen however the coefficient of variation cv of cu under different irrigation and nitrogen levels differed the high cv value observed in different nitrogen levels indicated a greater effect on available nitrogen uniformity than irrigation levels 3 3 2 duhq and dulq of soil available nitrogen dulq and duhq were used to analyze the distribution of the extreme content of soil available nitrogen irrigation level had a significant effect on dulq and duhq of soil available nitrogen fig 7 the duhq of soil available nitrogen showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the increasing irrigation level the highest and lowest duhq values were detected in w1 1 9 and w3 1 24 this implied less aggregation of soil available nitrogen in w3 treatment conversely the dulq value increased first and then decreased with the increasing irrigation level the highest value was detected in w2 0 57 suggesting fewer areas of low soil available nitrogen content in soil profile similarly n3 and n1 treatments had uniformly distributed high and low soil available nitrogen content in soil profile respectively moreover the cv of dulq and duhq under different irrigation levels were higher than that of different nitrogen levels indicating a greater effect of irrigation levels 3 4 soil water content irrigation level had a significant effect on soil water content in 0 200 cm soil layer fig 8 with the increase of irrigation level soil moisture increased significantly in four years in 2016 the soil water content in w1 w2 w3 and w4 were 9 1 13 1 16 1 and 19 respectively significant differences were also found between treatments in 2017 the soil water content of both w2 and w3 was significantly higher than that of w1 and significantly lower than that of w4 while there was no significant difference between w2 and w3 moreover no significant difference was also found between w1 and w2 in 2018 in 2019 the soil water content in w1 and w2 were 9 2 and 12 2 and these values were significantly lower by 39 9 and 20 3 compared to w3 the highest soil water content was observed in w4 treatments with a value of 18 3 apparently irrigation can significantly improve soil moisture conditions as for different nitrogen level there was no significant different on soil moisture among treatments this may be due to the fact that nitrogen improves root water uptake by apple trees but the apple tree canopy under high nitrogen level reduces evaporation from the soil surface 3 5 apple yield and wue the apple yields over 4 years are given in fig 9 the apple yields varied from year to year and irrigation level produced a significant effect on yield the response of apple yield to irrigation level was generally consistent in all 4 years showing an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend with a significant increase in apple yield when irrigation level did not exceed w3 the highest yields were recorded at 67940 kg ha 1 56290 kg ha 1 45430 kg ha 1 and 62697 kg ha 1 on w3 in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the further increase of irrigation level resulted in a decline in yield this may be related to the lower soil available nitrogen content and cu in w4 treatment the apple yield of w4 was even smaller than w2 in 2016 there was a significant difference between the yield of w2 and w4 in 2016 and 2018 but no significant difference was observed in 2017 and 2019 obviously adequate water with high cu and content of soil available nitrogen in w3 treatment was conducive to obtaining highest apple yield by increasing the nitrogen level the yield trended upward except for 2016 fig 9b in 2016 the yield of n1 was higher than that of n2 without any significant difference and similar between n3 and n4 in 2017 no significant difference was observed between n1 and n2 however the yield of n4 was 63760 kg ha 1 significantly higher than that of n3 due to severe frost damage the maximum yield in 2018 was lower than the minimum yield in other years there were significant differences between nitrogen levels in 2018 the apple yields of n2 n3 and n4 were 38610 kg ha 1 42820 kg ha 1and 45830 kg ha 1 respectively 14 2 26 6 and 35 6 higher than n1 in 2019 significant differences in yields were also observed with higher nitrogen levels leading to significantly higher yields all these demonstrated that nitrogen fertilizer had an apparent positive effect on apple yields and a high nitrogen level was more conducive to high yield both irrigation and nitrogen levels significantly affected the wue p 0 05 fig 10 however the response of wue to the two were inconsistent the wue first increased and then decreased with the increasing irrigation levels w3 obtained peak values of 11 7 kg m 3 8 5 kg m 3 7 1 kg m 3 and 10 6 kg m 3 in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the lowest wue values were obtained by w4 in 2016 2017 and 2019 w1 had the lowest wue in 2018 due to the effects of nitrogen fertilizer levels on apple yield the wue increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer levels fig 10b and the highest wue was obtained in n4 with the value of 11 9 kg m 3 10 3 kg m 3 7 6 kg m 3 and 11 6 kg m 3 in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively in general proper water and nitrogen management can improve wue 3 6 yield sustainability and stability irrigation and nitrogen levels produced similar effects on syi fig 11a at different nitrogen levels syi was in the descending order of n4 n3 n2 n1 the maximum syi under different irrigation water was obtained in w4 with the value of 0 77 which was an increase of 17 6 11 4 and 8 7 compared to w1 0 66 w2 0 7 and w3 0 71 respectively however the response of si to irrigation and nitrogen levels differed from syi fig 11b the si decreased with the increase of both irrigation and nitrogen levels indicating that irrigation and nitrogen levels increased the stability of apple yield apple yields and syi were divided into four quadrants m1 m2 m3 m4 based on the average values representing high sustainability and high yield m1 low sustainability and high yield m2 low sustainability and low yield m3 high sustainability and low yield m4 the result shows that treatments with high irrigation and nitrogen levels w3 n3 and n4 were associated with high apple yields and sustainability although the w4 treatment had the largest syi the reduction in yield was responsible for being located in the fourth quadrant high sustainability low yield treatments with low irrigation and nitrogen levels n1 w1 were located in the third quadrant low sustainability low yield compared with w1 n1 dealt with a higher yield and lower syi similarly yield stability responded to irrigation and nitrogen levels in much the same way as sustainability treatments w3 n3 and n4 had high apple yield and stability low si values while treatments n1 and w1 had low apple yield and stability high si values in terms of yield sustainability and stability indicators treatments w3 n3 and n4 were considered to be better management strategies 3 7 nitrogen balance based on the calculation of nitrogen inputs and outputs the nitrogen balance under different irrigation and nitrogen levels is obtained with the inventory in table 3 a large nitrogen surplus amount was observed with 230 68 542 48 kg ha 1 at different irrigation and nitrogen levels the response of nitrogen surplus amount and rate to nitrogen levels was essentially the same with the increase in nitrogen levels the nitrogen surplus amount and rate increased from 230 68 kg ha 1 to 542 48 kg ha 1 from 141 35 to 276 21 respectively the maximum nitrogen surplus amount and rate were approximately twice as large as the minimum nitrogen surplus and rate this was due to the large variation in nitrogen application amount and the relatively small variation in yield the differences in nitrogen surplus amount between irrigation levels were comparatively slight this may be related to the same amount of applied nitrogen and relatively small variation in yield the nitrogen surplus rates for all treatments were much higher than 17 indicating that the nitrogen surplus greatly exceeded their rational ranges zhu et al 2021 3 8 comprehensive evaluation the apple yield si available nitrogen content and cu of the seven treatments were selected and evaluated by qi considering the weights and pearson correlation coefficients among the indicators the percentage of scores for the individual indicator was essentially the same fig 12 cu received the highest percentage of total scores the score of w3 treatment was the highest reaching 0 89 which indicated the best irrigation and nitrogen management w4 took the second place with a score of 0 85 followed by n2 the score of w4 and n2 significantly lower than that of w3 overall all these results demonstrated that the rational regulation of irrigation and nitrogen levels was effective to improve the overall benefits of the apple industry in loess plateau the data collected were comprehensively analyzed with irrigation level and nitrogen level were treated as independent variables and evaluation score was considered as the response variables the coupling effect of irrigation and nitrogen level had a significant effect on the comprehensive score in an upward convex shape fig 13 based on the least squares method and a binary quadratic regression equation was determined and used to calculate the irrigation and nitrogen levels required to maximize the evaluation score the simulation results showed that the highest evaluation score was obtained when the irrigation and nitrogen level were 172 mm and 638 kg ha 1 respectively the comprehensive score was set to 98 of highest value to ensure the applicability of the final results to actual production management in this context the optimal strategy for irrigation and nitrogen level were 129 172 mm and 500 720 kg ha 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on soil nitrogen nitrogen plays a crucial role in plant growth and sustainable agriculture zhang et al 2015 the main form of nitrogen in soil no3 n can accumulate and be leached therefore irrigation is one of the dominant factors influencing nitrogen transport and leaching in the soil profile turkeltaub et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 in this study rainfall was much greater than irrigation amount during the growing season fig 1 and table 2 this means that rainfall was the main source of water for apple growth fertilizer was dissolved by the rainfall migrated to the drip irrigation pipeline and further affected by the irrigation water when the irrigation amount was small soil available nitrogen was mainly distributed in the upper soil layer fig 3 with the increasing irrigation level soil available nitrogen migrated from the upper to the lower soil layer related to the soil moisture movement large irrigation amount has a greater leaching effect and identical results were found in previous studies li et al 2015 wang and huang 2008 the variation of soil available nitrogen distribution in the soil profile also inevitably led to change in content the rising irrigation level reduced the soil available nitrogen content in 0 100 cm soil layer and increased in 100 200 cm soil layer fig 5 as for the 0 200 cm soil layer the soil available nitrogen increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation level this is because irrigation water w1 w2 and w3 reduced the soil available nitrogen content in the surface soil reducing nitrogen absorption by orchard weeds thereby increasing the soil available nitrogen content it was found that with further increase in irrigation amount w4 the soil available nitrogen was leached below 200 cm fig 3d resulting in a decrease in available nitrogen content in the 0 200 cm soil layer fig 5 in addition the variation of soil available nitrogen uniformity in 0 200 cm was similar to that of soil available nitrogen content which increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation level this is because in w1 and w2 treatments irrigation reduced the difference in available nitrogen between the upper and lower soil layers and increased the uniformity however heavy irrigation w3 and w4 caused a sharp drop in the available nitrogen content of the surface layer and an increase in the lower soil layer which aggravated the difference between the upper and the lower soil layers and reduced the uniformity nitrogen fertilizer was the main source of soil available nitrogen table 3 nitrogen supply significantly increased soil available nitrogen content fig 5 consistent with previous research results wang et al 2015 high nitrogen levels had higher available nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil layer fig 5b however the effect of nitrogen fertilizer on available nitrogen content of the surface soil was more remarkable than that of the lower soil which was attributed to the furrow fertilization therefore the uniformity of available nitrogen decreased with the increase of nitrogen levels that is to say nitrogen supply increased the soil available nitrogen content and exacerbated the difference in available nitrogen content in different soil layers both irrigation and nitrogen supply affected the soil available nitrogen distribution fig 3 and fig 4 content fig 5 and uniformity fig 6 and fig 7 in the soil profile the combined effects of excessive nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation led to nitrogen leaching from the root zone and into deep soil depths leading to groundwater pollution sun et al 2018 and reduced nitrogen use efficiency due to the positively correlated between nitrogen leaching with nitrogen and irrigation levels li et al 2015 xu et al 2020 optimal irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer level is effective means to reduce nitrogen leaching and improve nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2015 4 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on yield stability and sustainability irrigation and fertilization are important factors in increasing yields by improving soil nutrients and mitigating the effects of rainfall vagaries taylor et al 2013 vico and porporato 2015 wada et al 2012 numerous reports can be found in the literature providing different results on the effects of irrigation amount on apple yield el jaouhari et al 2018 some scholars also reported a positive correlation between irrigation amount and apple yield ucar et al 2016 however mpelasoka et al 2001 concluded that a 50 water deficit during the entire cycle did not result in a significant loss in apple yield these contradictory results are probably due to varying irrigation scheduling methods irrigation frequency as well as to the experimental conditions climatic edaphic cultivars etc in this study irrigation significantly improved the soil moisture conditions fig 8 and apple yield was significantly affected by irrigation levels which first increased and then decreased with the increase in irrigation level although soil water content was lower in the 20 water deficit w3 treatment compared to 100 etc w4 the 20 water deficit did not lead to yield reduction contrary to expectations yield increased significantly compared to other treatments this tendency was consistent with the findings of el jaouhari et al 2018 in addition to the soil moisture condition soil nutrients are also an important factor affecting apple yield el jaouhari et al 2018 compared with w3 treatment irrigation water reduced the available nitrogen of the 0 200 cm soil layer in the w4 treatment fig 5b moreover the w4 treatment reduced the soil available nitrogen uniformity which may have a negative impact on nutrient uptake by the apple tree resulting in a decline in yield many previous studies have shown that yield increased with increasing nitrogen application rate xu et al 2020 this may because nitrogen fertilizer provided more available nitrogen which was positively affected yield cai et al 2019 the same result was also observed in this study the high nitrogen levels were always accompanied by high yields fig 10 however the good linear relationship between soil available nitrogen and yield fig 14a differed from previous studies gu et al 2017 in fact nitrogen absorption by plants would reach a maximum value once nitrogen exceeds the critical value glass 2003 sperling et al 2019 xu et al 2020 further increases in nitrogen fertilizer do not significantly increase yield on the contrary the negative effects of excessive nitrogen fertilizer on soil decreases the yield excessive nitrogen fertilizer has been reported to affect water uptake and gain more energy to maintain cell water content thus reducing transpiration and nutrient uptake inhibiting growth and development reducing hydraulic conductivity limiting photosynthetic productivity and decreasing water use efficiency erel et al 2013 li et al 2021 in the study region the recommended nitrogen application rate was 240 360 kg ha 1 zhao et al 2012 no significant effect of nitrogen level on apple yield was found when the nitrogen application rate was as high as 1200 kg ha 1 wu et al 2021 however our research still shows a significant impact on the yield when the nitrogen application rate ranged from 375 kg ha 1 to 720 kg ha 1 this may because the low nitrogen use efficiency of furrow applied fertilizer required a higher nitrogen level to reach the critical value of nitrogen uptake by apple trees the significant differences in cu and content of soil available nitrogen among nitrogen supply treatments may also lead to significant effects of nitrogen levels on apple yield in this study syi is used to assess the effects of agricultural practices on crop yield sustainability yadav et al 2000 a higher syi value indicates a better management of producing satisfactory yields over the years li et al 2018 reported that the long term application of combined organic and chemical fertilizers could make the yield more sustainable by improving the properties of the soil it has also been reported that the long term sustainability of yield may be due to the continuous supply of soil nutrients cai et al 2019 in our research there was a positive correlation between yield sustainability and available nitrogen fig 14b nitrogen improved the sustainability of apple yield may be due to nitrogen fertilizer to improve soil available nitrogen content fig 5 although the concept of yield stability has been well established in genotyping research yield stability indicators in research on agronomic management systems is very limited daigh et al 2018 the si provides a measure of consistent productivity similar to yield sustainability our research shows that nitrogen fertilizer improved the stability of apple yield the largest si was obtained by n1 treatment indicating that apple yield could fluctuate drastically macholdt et al 2019 the small si in n4 indicated better nitrogen management practices capable of sustaining high yields zhang et al 2021a the results were the same as the findings of previous studies huang et al 2018a soil nutrient supply chemical physical and biological properties may be the reason that affects the high and stable yield of crops macholdt et al 2019 in our research the soil available nitrogen content was negatively correlated with si fig 14c it might be inferred that the positive aspects of nitrogen on nutrient supply could be assumed to be a possible reason for the higher yield stability of apples moreover a high irrigation level has a positive effect on improving the stability and sustainability of apple yield fig 11 this may be related to the improvement of soil moisture conditions by high irrigation levels and reduction of abiotic stress on apple trees improving the nitrogen uptake and utilization equally mahajan and pal 2022 described water and nitrogen as key components of sustainable productivity in stevia our research reiterated the positive effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on apple yield yield stability and sustainability however long term heavy nitrogen fertilizer and only applying chemical fertilizers could cause a series of negative effects and even reduce yield in the long run continuous application of chemical fertilizers could reduce soil quality by lowering soil ph sarkar et al 2018 resulting in a decline in crop yield and syi choudhary et al 2018 many studies have shown that combining chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers was an effective method to increase yield improve yield stability and sustainability qaswar et al 2020 currently the amount of nitrogen input in apple chemical fertilizers in orchards in northern shaanxi is much higher than that provided by organic fertilizers liu et al 2015 the proportion of organic fertilizer used is less than 5 zhao et al 2014 this implied that the input of nitrogen fertilizer in the orchard in loess plateau has huge potential for improvement 4 3 effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on nitrogen balance nitrogen balance calculation is an effective method for predicting the risk of nitrate leaching into groundwater puckett et al 1999 previous studies have shown that the nitrogen balance depends on the amount of applied fertilizer and yield from agricultural fields mclellan et al 2018 in this study nitrogen inputs included fertilization and atmospheric nitrogen deposition with atmospheric nitrogen deposition accounting for 10 20 of total nitrogen inputs the output of nitrogen included branch and fruit carry out with branch pruning accounting for 10 of the total nitrogen output obviously nitrogen application rate and apple yield were the main factors affecting nitrogen balance 80 etc significantly reduced nitrogen surplus as influenced by yield differences table 3 it is also worth noting that the nitrogen carried out by apple fruit and branch pruning cannot be replenished only by atmospheric deposition this means that no or limited nitrogen applications would degrade soil fertility maintenance and reduce the apple tree yield ultimately affecting the sustainability of the apple industry as previously reported soil fertility and apple yield were significantly reduced with no or small nitrogen fertilizer zhang et al 2023 however the minimum nitrogen application in this study was 375 kg ha 1 which was higher than that of some studies in the same region hao et al 2022 zhang et al 2023 this is because the trees in this study were older produced more apples and brought out more nitrogen by the apples therefore 375 kg ha 1 was set as the lowest applied nitrogen level in this study however high nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the nitrogen surplus table 3 in this study the nitrogen surplus showed an increase from 230 68 to 524 48 kg ha 1 as the applied nitrogen increased from 375 to 720 kg ha 1 similarly ju et al 2006 reported a significant correlation between nitrogen surplus and nitrogen application rate as the nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increasing nitrogen level the application rates of nitrogen were severely overused across the apple orchards of luochuan county hou et al 2021 previous studies have shown that nitrogen surplus rate was 328 1 in loess plateau apple orchards however the permissible nitrogen surplus rate was only 17 in this study the nitrogen surplus rate ranged from 141 36 to 276 21 greater than the permissible surplus rate of nitrogen the risk classification of nitrogen surplus amount in apple orchards shows that the nitrogen surplus of n3 and n4 treatments exceeded the threshold of environmental safety with a medium risk level 400 550 kg ha 1 while other treatments were at a low risk level 250 400 kg ha 1 and no risk 250 kg ha 1 in fact higher fertilizer ensured the sustainability and stability of yields fig 11 which might lead to the stability and sustainability of nitrogen surplus result in a series of negative effects on the environment in the long run there is widespread agreement on the urgent need to achieve higher yields while minimizing environmental impacts however lucrative economic benefits have exacerbated high nitrogen fertilizer in chinese apple orchards excessive pursuit of high yield and big fruit leads to excessive nitrogen input zhao et al 2017 the average apple orchard nitrogen fertilizer increased from 350 kg ha 1 in 2000 1200 kg ha 1 in 2017 which resulted in a high level nitrogen surplus liu et al 2019 nitrate accumulation in the soil profile of apple orchards has been reported to reach 7250 8050 kg ha 1 which would lead to serious environmental problems and soil quality degradation ultimately affecting the sustainability of the apple industry zhu et al 2021 in different irrigation levels apple yields differed significantly among years p 0 05 similar results were observed in the experiments with different nitrogen application levels this indicates that the nitrogen surplus of the previous year did not have a positive effect on apple growth in the following year apple yield was linearly and positively correlated with soil available nitrogen content fig 14 all these results indicate a high probability of leaching of surplus nitrogen however due to the deep loess deposits in loess plateau environmental problems caused by excessive nitrogen surplus have not received enough attention huang et al 2018b overall high nitrogen level increased nitrogen surplus and soil nitrogen content and may also increase nitrogen leaching however in this study we focused more on the cumulative effect of water and nitrogen management on soil nitrogen content no detailed analysis of the nitrogen leaching performance for each year was done which needs to be focused on in the following studies 4 4 further improvement in irrigation and fertilization management in this study the comprehensive evaluation showed that the scores of w2 w3 and w4 were significantly higher by 28 5 35 8 and 29 8 respectively compared to w1 however compared to n1 the scores of n2 n3 and n4 were significantly higher by 4 6 1 6 and 2 1 respectively clearly irrigation level had a greater effect on the overall benefit scores this implied that the promotion of irrigation and reduction of nitrogen levels can effective in improving the overall benefit in contrast to local rainfed and high nitrogen application rate in this region the simulation analysis showed that the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy would be 129 172 mm and 500 720 kg ha 1 for apple orchards in loess plateau however the nitrogen surplus rate was still at risk in fact excessive nitrogen amount and low utilization efficiency are the main reasons for the huge nitrogen surplus for the sustainable development of the apple industry apple orchards in loess plateau should further optimize water and fertilizer management measures to reduce nitrogen application rate and improve nitrogen use efficiency and benefits previous studies have shown that integrated water and fertilizer organic fertilizer and slow release fertilizer can improve nutrient utilization efficiency liu et al 2021 reported that substitution of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with organic fertilizers reduced nitrogen leaching loss and organic fertilizer could improve soil quality and microbial community structure effectively han et al 2021 compared with ordinary uncoated compound fertilizers the nitrogen agronomic efficiency and partial productivity of coated compound fertilizers are 23 68 30 88 and 64 53 72 43 higher respectively meanwhile the nitrogen fertilizer application amount of the coated compound fertilizer may be reduced by 20 without reducing yield chen et al 2017 moreover establishing a good apple quality evaluation system promoting scientific and efficient planting mode site specific and real time nitrogen management should be considered in the future 5 conclusions the four year field experiment based on different irrigation and nitrogen levels in loess plateau apple orchards revealed that appropriate irrigation and nitrogen levels had positive effects on soil available nitrogen distribution content cu nitrogen surplus apple yield yield stability and sustainability although nitrogen level was the key determinant of nitrogen surpluses irrigation outweighed nitrogen in improving the overall benefits of apple orchards moreover the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management based on these factors was 129 172 mm and 500 720 kg ha 1 however the recommended nitrogen level still posed environmental risks which required further optimization such as coated compound fertilizer and integration of water and fertilizer to achieve the dual goals of soil sustainability

9034,the loess plateau is a major area for apple production in china and improper irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer managements have affected the sustainable development of the apple industry in this region therefore this study aims to 1 investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on soil available nitrogen and apple yield in loess plateau 2 explore the optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen managements based on soil nitrogen and apple yield for this purpose a four year irrigation and nitrogen management experiment was conducted from 2016 to 2019 in loess plateau according to the water and nitrogen fertilizer requirement of apple tree 4 irrigation levels w1 no irrigation w2 60 etc w3 80 etc w4 100 etc and 4 nitrogen fertilizer levels n1 375 kg ha 1 n2 490 kg ha 1 n3 605 kg ha 1 n4 720 kg ha 1 were applied to the experiment the results showed that irrigation and nitrogen levels had pronounced effects on soil available nitrogen distribution content uniformity coefficient cu apple yield stable index si sustainable yield index syi and nitrogen surplus with the increase in irrigation level the soil available nitrogen accumulation area changed from the surface to the bottom and the content and cu of soil available nitrogen first increased and then decreased the greater nitrogen level was accompanied by surface aggregation of soil available nitrogen and nitrogen surplus with the increase in nitrogen level the cu and dulq of soil available nitrogen significantly decreased while duhq decreased first and then increased moreover the increasing irrigation and nitrogen level improved the apple yield yield stability and sustainability based on the comprehensive evaluation and simulation analysis the recommend irrigation and nitrogen level was 129 172 mm and 500 720 kg ha 1 respectively with the intention of stabilize and sustaining apple yield and reducing environmental risk however there are still potential environmental problems in the recommended nitrogen level further improvements are needed such as coating compound fertilizer and integration of water and fertilizer to achieve the dual goals of soil sustainability

share data 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the most critical important factors for the agriculture system throughout the world gheysari et al 2009 as the primary source of soil nitrogen nitrogen fertilizer has been reported to be a sensitive parameter of soil nitrogen content and much evidence suggests that yield is related to soil nitrogen content muchow 1988 zhang et al 2021a an appropriate nitrogen supply can improve root development water and nutrient uptake drenovsky et al 2012 crop quality li et al 2021 and plant drought resistance alandia et al 2016 the positive effects of nitrogen and the growing demand for food have led to the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer however instead of increasing yields excessive nitrogen fertilizer inputs reduce nitrogen use efficiency and contribute to the nitrogen surplus and accumulation in the soil tilman et al 2002 in fact an appropriate amount of nitrogen surplus is conducive to enhancing soil nutrients and productivity while excessive nitrogen surplus and accumulation in the soil have created the risk of nitrogen leaching apple is one of the most important fruit crops worldwide hou et al 2021 as one of the largest apple producing areas in the world the loess plateau is also the eugenics area of the apple industry in china it covers an area of 628600 ha accounting for more than 25 of china s apple production due to the excessive pursuit of high yield and large size fruit overuse of chemical fertilizer is very common in this area especially nitrogen fertilizer the average nitrogen fertilizer application rate in loess plateau is 1032 kg ha 1 111 higher than the average nitrogen fertilizer use for apple orchards 490 kg ha 1 in china zhao et al 2017 excessive nitrogen inputs have resulted in a large nitrogen surplus liu et al 2015 reported a nitrogen surplus rate of 328 1 in loess plateau apple orchards 67 3 of the nitrogen surplus accumulated in the soil as nitrate which can easily cause nitrogen leaching zhu et al 2021 in addition to nitrogen accumulation in the soil irrigation level is another crucial factor that affecting nitrogen leaching by altering the subsurface drainage of the farmland gheysari et al 2009 reported that high nitrogen leaching occurred simultaneously with the high levels of irrigation and fertilization events unscientific water and fertilizer management can cause nitrogen leaching and lead to a series of environmental problems such as soil acidification groundwater pollution and surface water eutrophication lai et al 2013 obviously misuse of nitrogen fertilizer is an essential limiting factor restricting the sustainable development of the apple industry in loess plateau optimizing nitrogen and irrigation management is critical to obtain consistently sustainable and stable high yields at low environmental costs nilahyane et al 2018 many observations have been conducted on irrigation and nitrogen management in loess plateau apple orchards zhong et al 2019 reported that fruit yield quality and water use efficiency wue of apple trees were significantly affected by water deficit during different growth stages the comprehensive benefits of apple tree yield wue and nitrogen partial factor productivity were maximized under 60 75 field capacity and 0 45 kg plant 1 of nitrogen fertilizer dai et al 2021 moreover both alternate partial root zone irrigation and mulching can increase the yield and wue du et al 2017 liao et al 2021 however few studies have been conducted on the effects of irrigation and nitrogen management on soil nitrogen distribution nitrogen balance sustainable yield index syi and stable index si which are used to estimate the yield sustainability and stability of apple han et al 2020 mi et al 2023 the distribution of nitrogen in soil affects nitrogen surplus by affecting nitrogen use efficiency and yield and finally affects nitrogen leaching the nitrogen balance is one of the potentially useful methods for predicting the risk of nitrogen leaching into groundwater barry et al 1993 puckett et al 1999 quantifying the nitrogen balance is an essential step towards sustainable management moreover as an important reflection of the quality of farmland ecosystems both yield stability and sustainability are essential indicators for evaluating farmland sustainability han et al 2020 nevertheless research on yield stability has mainly focused on the yield performance among different varieties in breeding and genetic clarke et al 2019 overall additional information about the effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on soil nitrogen distribution nitrogen balance yield sustainability and stability will help determine scientifically reliable irrigation and fertilization strategies for stable and sustainable yields with a low environmental cost in this context the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on soil nitrogen distribution characteristics nitrogen balance apple yield sustainability and stability and 2 to develop appropriate nitrogen and irrigation management strategies with the intention of these indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this four year field experiment was conducted in luochuan yan an city shaanxi province of china 35º41 15 n 109º30 24 e 1072 m a s l during 2016 2019 the experimental site is situated in a typical hilly gully region and the central part of the loess plateau apple production region zhang et al 2019 the region is in the temperate and semi humid climate zone with an average annual temperature rainfall evaporation and sunshine duration of 9 2 c 550 650 mm 1600 2000 mm and 2632 9 h respectively the soil texture and hydraulic conductivity were shown in table 1 2 2 experiment 16 year old apple trees malus domestica borkh cv naganofuji no 2 were selected as the experimental trees the trees were planted at a spacing of 4 m 5 m 500 plants ha 1 the experiment consisted of two parts the experiment of irrigation level and the experiment of nitrogen level irrigation water is scarce in the experimental area peng et al 2017 referring to the management of local fruit growers and previous studies zhao et al 2012 four irrigation levels were set in the irrigation experiment table 2 no irrigation w1 low irrigation w2 60 etc moderate irrigation w3 80 etc and high irrigation w4 100 etc the average nitrogen fertilizer application rate in loess plateau is as high as 1032 kg ha 1 an application rate that has been proven by numerous studies to be excessive and irrational hou et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 therefore by combining previous studies and actual local nitrogen fertilizer application hao et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 four nitrogen application rates were set in the nitrogen experiment table 2 n1 375 kg ha 1 n2 490 kg ha 1 n3 605 kg ha 1 and n4 720 kg ha 1 in the irrigation level experiment the nitrogen level of all 4 treatments was n2 similarly in the nitrogen level experiment the irrigation level of all 4 treatments was w2 obviously w2 and n2 treatments had the same irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer levels this means that there were actually 7 treatments in this study to facilitate understanding we referred to this treatment as w2 and n2 in irrigation level experiment and nitrogen fertilizer level experiment respectively table 2 irrigation was carried out every 15 days from april to october during 2016 2019 cai et al 2021 du et al 2017 irrigation amount was referred to eqs 1 and 2 the irrigation events and levels were displayed in fig 1 and table 2 for different irrigation level treatments from 2016 to 2019 circular drip irrigation was used for irrigation in this study tang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b an irrigation pipeline was laid in a circinal shape around the tree with a radius of 70 cm fig 2 moreover 10 drippers were evenly arranged on each tree fertilizers applied in the experiment were obtained at local markets in the form of urea potassium phosphate and potassium sulfate in the early of march and june ditch fertilizing was carried out between the tree rows at a distance of 100 cm from the plant with a ditch length of 40 50 cm a ditch width of 20 30 cm and ditch depth of 20 30 cm the specific fertilization levels for march and june can be obtained from table 2 each treatment had three replicates etc was calculated as 1 etc i 1 n et 0 k c p 0 2 p 0 p p r p d α p where et o is the reference evapotranspiration and calculated using the fao penman monteith equation k c is the single crop coefficient and taken as

average daily rainfall respectively pr and pd are the surface runoff and deep leakage caused by rainfall α is the effective utilization coefficient of rainfall and the value of α is taken as follows p 5 mm α 0 5 mm p 50 mm α 1 0 p 50 mm α 0 8 zhang et al 2023 2 3 soil water content and soil available nitrogen soil samples were collected from each experimental plot using an auger the sampling depth was 200 cm and the interval was 20 cm a total of 8 points were taken from each experimental plot in a z shape and the specific locations were shown in fig 2 from 2016 2019 soil samples from these 8 points were used to determine the soil water content in october using oven drying method the soil water content was the average of the soil samples from the 8 points available nitrogen is a form of inorganic nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen and easily hydrolyzed organic nitrogen easily absorbed and used by plants zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 the short term nitrogen supply capacity of the soil can be reflected through soil available nitrogen lu et al 2019 the soil sampling points a b and c were used to analyze the distribution of soil available nitrogen in october 2019 and soil available nitrogen was determined by the procedures described by lu 2000 2 3 apple yield and wue apple yield was determined by the weighing method the underground water in this study was above 50 m below the ground level moreover due to the drip irrigation with low irrigation level no runoff and deep percolation were generated during the growing season therefore the wue kg m 3 could be simplified to 3 wue y po i w where y i p 0 and w are the apple yield kg ha 1 irrigation mm effective rainfall m3 ha 1 and change in soil water storage m3 ha 1 in the range of 0 200 cm between the beginning and end of every experiment year respectively 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 uniformity of soil available nitrogen the coefficient of uniformity cu proposed by christiansen christiansen 1942 can describe the deviation of the soil available nitrogen at different depths the cu of soil available nitrogen was calculated as follows 4 cu 1 δ h h where cu is the soil available nitrogen uniformity coefficient ranging between 1 very high uniformity and 0 very low uniformity the h and δh were calculated as follows 5 h 1 n i 1 n h i 6 δ h 1 n i 1 n h i h where n is the number of soil samples and i is the observed available nitrogen for the i th grid when most of the soil available nitrogen content values are close to the average value the cu cannot reflect the maximum or minimum value of individual points distribution uniformity coefficient beale and howell 1966 emphasizes the part of the soil with extreme available nitrogen value which is helpful in understanding the characteristics of soil available nitrogen leaching and aggregation the du was calculated as follows 7 d u lq 1 4 i 1 n 4 h q i 1 n i 1 n h i 8 d u hq 1 4 i 3 n 4 n h q i 1 n i 1 n h i where du lq and du hq are 1 4 low and high uniformity coefficient respectively h qi is the observed soil available nitrogen for the i th grid in order from low to high 2 4 2 sustainable yield index and stable index sustainable yield index and stable index were calculated as follows han et al 2020 9 sustainable yield index ῡ σ y max 10 stable index σ ῡ where σ is standard deviation ῡ and y max are the average and maximum apple yields in all experimental years respectively a larger sustainable yield index indicates a more sustainable yield and a smaller stable index represents a more stable yield 2 4 3 nitrogen balance soil nitrogen balance was obtained by the following formula qaswar et al 2020 van eerdt and fong 1998 11 nitrogen surplus input components fertilizer atmospheric nitrogen deposition output components nitrogen moved by fruits nitrogen moved by branches 12 nitrogen surplus rate input components output components input components nitrogen inputs from fertilizers were calculated in table 2 the atmospheric nitrogen deposition was estimated as 18 88 kg ha 1 zhu et al 2021 the average nitrogen content of apple fruits and branches was 0 31 and 0 78 respectively wan et al 2020 apple yields were calculated based on actual yield data and the amount of pruning of apple branches were calculated from published literature wan et al 2020 2 4 4 comprehensive evaluation the quality index qi was calculated to assess the overall response of irrigation and nitrogen management to soil available nitrogen and apple yield obriot et al 2016 considering the correlation between factors the factors for comprehensive evaluation were determined by principal component analysis and pearson correlation analysis askari et al 2015 vasu et al 2016 each factor was given a weight according to the pearson correlation coefficient between the factors if the correlation coefficient 0 60 the factor with a small weight could be considered redundant therefore eliminated from the factor collections for a correlation coefficient 0 6 both factors were considered necessary thus they were retained in the factor collections andrews et al 2002 then calculate the weight of the selected factors and the qi was calculated as follows 13 q i i 1 n s i w i where n is the number of selected factors w i is the weighted factor and s i is the score calculated by linear scoring liebig et al 2001 vasu et al 2016 2 5 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the difference of content cu and du of soil available nitrogen apple yield nitrogen balance and evaluation score differences were considered significant at 0 05 level by the fisher s least significant difference lsd test the analysis was carried out with spss version 20 0 spss inc usa and matlab 2020a mathworks usa and origin 2019b originlab northampton usa was used for mapping 3 results 3 1 soil available nitrogen distribution 3 1 1 soil available nitrogen distribution under different irrigation levels as shown in fig 3 the distribution of soil available nitrogen varied with irrigation levels in the vertical direction with the increase in irrigation level there was an overall tendency for reduction of soil available nitrogen in the upper soil layer with a subsequent increase in the lower soil layer the soil available nitrogen of w1 treatment was mainly distributed in the 0 100 cm soil layer with the maximum value 359 77 mg kg 1 occurring at a depth of 60 cm compared with w1 the accumulation range of soil available nitrogen in w2 treatment dropped to 40 160 cm and its maximum value 258 75 mg kg 1 appeared at a depth of 120 cm further increase in irrigation level caused a rapid decrease of soil available nitrogen in the upper layer and a sharp increase in the lower layer treatment in w4 the maximum value 288 72 mg kg 1 appeared at a depth of 160 cm and higher soil available nitrogen was observed than any other treatments w1 w2 and w3 in the 160 200 cm soil layer which represented a higher potential risk of nitrogen loss the horizontal distribution of the soil available nitrogen also varied over irrigation levels fig 3 soil available nitrogen distribution range was relatively large with a high irrigation level the soil available nitrogen of w1 treatment main distributed within the 200 cm width more extensive distribution ranges were observed in w3 and w4 treatments two to three times that of w1 treatment moreover the maximum value appeared in the middle of the tree row in w1 w2 and w3 treatments in comparison the maximum value of w4 treatment was directly below the tree row 3 1 2 soil available nitrogen distribution under different nitrogen levels there were apparent differences in the profile distributions of soil available nitrogen at different nitrogen fertilizer levels fig 4 in the vertical direction with the increase in nitrogen level there was an overall tendency for increasing of soil available nitrogen at the upper soil layer in n1 treatment the soil available nitrogen was mainly distributed in the 100 200 cm soil layer and the maximum value 152 12 mg kg 1 appeared at a depth of 160 cm the increased nitrogen application rate drove the soil available nitrogen accumulation range upward the soil available nitrogen in n2 and n3 treatments accumulated in 40 140 cm and 0 120 cm soil layers respectively and the available nitrogen values peaked at 120 cm and 60 cm depths respectively moreover in n4 treatment the soil available nitrogen distributed in the upper soil layer 0 100 cm with a significant peak at the 0 60 cm soil layer in general the soil available nitrogen distribution changed from bottom accumulation to surface accumulation as the nitrogen level increased horizontally for different nitrogen levels the soil available nitrogen peaked in the middle of the tree rows and gradually decreased with an increase in lateral distance this might be explained by the fertilization location and nitrogen uptake the soil available nitrogen in the tree rows increased rapidly with increasing nitrogen level indicating that higher nitrogen fertilizer levels could provide better nutrient conditions for apple trees 3 2 soil available nitrogen content 3 2 1 soil available nitrogen content under different irrigation levels irrigation level had a significant effect on soil available nitrogen content and the effect varied with soil layers fig 5a the soil available nitrogen content in 0 100 cm soil layer followed the order of w1 w2 w3 w4 indicating a significant adverse effect however a significant positive effect was found in 100 200 cm soil layer with the soil available nitrogen content in the order of w3 w4 w2 w1 compared with w1 the soil available nitrogen content in w3 and w4 treatments decreased by 11 2 and 28 9 in 0 100 cm soil layer respectively and increased by 169 6 and 158 2 in 100 200 cm soil layer respectively as a result the available nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil layer increased first and then decreased the lowest soil available nitrogen content occurred in w1 while the highest content was obtained by w3 due to the soil available nitrogen accumulation in 100 200 cm soil layer w4 treatment had the risk of nitrogen leaching consistent with the characteristics of available nitrogen distribution fig 3 3 2 2 soil available nitrogen content under different nitrogen levels nitrogen level also presented a significant positive effect on soil available nitrogen content in 0 100 cm 100 200 cm and 0 200 cm soil layers respectively fig 5b with the increasing nitrogen level from 375 kg ha 1 n1 to 490 kg ha 1 n2 and 605 kg ha 1 n3 the soil available nitrogen content increased by 62 9 and 99 1 in 0 200 cm soil layer respectively while the higher nitrogen application rate n4 720 kg ha 1 produced the highest soil available nitrogen content with the value of 213 0 mg kg 1 compared with n1 n2 and n3 n4 has increased the soil available nitrogen content by 202 4 mg kg 1 137 1 mg kg 1 and 99 3 mg kg 1 in 0 100 cm soil layer and 103 0 mg kg 1 74 0 mg kg 1 and 58 6 mg kg 1 in 100 200 cm soil layer respectively all these indicated that nitrogen level had a stronger effect on 0 100 cm soil layer than 100 200 cm soil layer furthermore the greater effect of nitrogen level on soil available nitrogen content in 0 100 cm soil layer exacerbated the difference between 0 and 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layers fig 5b there was no significant difference in soil available nitrogen content between 0 and 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layers in n1 however significant differences were found in n2 n3 and n4 treatments respectively the soil available nitrogen content gap between 0 and 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layer was 49 5 mg kg 1 and 72 0 mg kg 1 in n2 and n3 treatments respectively treatment in n4 the difference in soil available nitrogen content between 0 and 100 cm and 100 200 cm was greater than any other treatments n1 n2 n3 which indicated that high nitrogen levels exacerbated the spatial heterogeneity of soil available nitrogen 3 3 nitrogen uniformity 3 3 1 cu of soil available nitrogen due to the extraordinary efficiency of soil available nitrogen migration with water irrigation level had a significant effect on the cu of soil available nitrogen fig 6a the cu of soil available nitrogen in 0 200 cm soil layer showed a parabola with an opening downward the lowest and highest cu values were detected in w1 and w2 treatments respectively in w2 and w3 treatments the cu values were 0 66 and 0 64 respectively significantly higher than that of w1 and w4 however there was no significant difference between w2 and w3 treatments obviously appropriate irrigation levels could effectively increase the uniformity of soil available nitrogen and reduce accumulation significant differences in cu of soil available nitrogen were also observed for different nitrogen levels in 0 200 cm soil layer fig 6b the cu of soil available nitrogen in n1 and n2 treatments were 0 69 and 0 66 and these values were significantly higher by 25 5 and 20 0 as compared to n3 the lowest cu value was detected in n4 with a value of 0 53 there was no significance between n1 and n2 similar in n3 and n4 generally it was again emphasized that nitrogen supply significantly increased the spatial variability of soil available nitrogen the above results show that both irrigation and nitrogen levels affected the uniformity of soil available nitrogen however the coefficient of variation cv of cu under different irrigation and nitrogen levels differed the high cv value observed in different nitrogen levels indicated a greater effect on available nitrogen uniformity than irrigation levels 3 3 2 duhq and dulq of soil available nitrogen dulq and duhq were used to analyze the distribution of the extreme content of soil available nitrogen irrigation level had a significant effect on dulq and duhq of soil available nitrogen fig 7 the duhq of soil available nitrogen showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the increasing irrigation level the highest and lowest duhq values were detected in w1 1 9 and w3 1 24 this implied less aggregation of soil available nitrogen in w3 treatment conversely the dulq value increased first and then decreased with the increasing irrigation level the highest value was detected in w2 0 57 suggesting fewer areas of low soil available nitrogen content in soil profile similarly n3 and n1 treatments had uniformly distributed high and low soil available nitrogen content in soil profile respectively moreover the cv of dulq and duhq under different irrigation levels were higher than that of different nitrogen levels indicating a greater effect of irrigation levels 3 4 soil water content irrigation level had a significant effect on soil water content in 0 200 cm soil layer fig 8 with the increase of irrigation level soil moisture increased significantly in four years in 2016 the soil water content in w1 w2 w3 and w4 were 9 1 13 1 16 1 and 19 respectively significant differences were also found between treatments in 2017 the soil water content of both w2 and w3 was significantly higher than that of w1 and significantly lower than that of w4 while there was no significant difference between w2 and w3 moreover no significant difference was also found between w1 and w2 in 2018 in 2019 the soil water content in w1 and w2 were 9 2 and 12 2 and these values were significantly lower by 39 9 and 20 3 compared to w3 the highest soil water content was observed in w4 treatments with a value of 18 3 apparently irrigation can significantly improve soil moisture conditions as for different nitrogen level there was no significant different on soil moisture among treatments this may be due to the fact that nitrogen improves root water uptake by apple trees but the apple tree canopy under high nitrogen level reduces evaporation from the soil surface 3 5 apple yield and wue the apple yields over 4 years are given in fig 9 the apple yields varied from year to year and irrigation level produced a significant effect on yield the response of apple yield to irrigation level was generally consistent in all 4 years showing an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend with a significant increase in apple yield when irrigation level did not exceed w3 the highest yields were recorded at 67940 kg ha 1 56290 kg ha 1 45430 kg ha 1 and 62697 kg ha 1 on w3 in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the further increase of irrigation level resulted in a decline in yield this may be related to the lower soil available nitrogen content and cu in w4 treatment the apple yield of w4 was even smaller than w2 in 2016 there was a significant difference between the yield of w2 and w4 in 2016 and 2018 but no significant difference was observed in 2017 and 2019 obviously adequate water with high cu and content of soil available nitrogen in w3 treatment was conducive to obtaining highest apple yield by increasing the nitrogen level the yield trended upward except for 2016 fig 9b in 2016 the yield of n1 was higher than that of n2 without any significant difference and similar between n3 and n4 in 2017 no significant difference was observed between n1 and n2 however the yield of n4 was 63760 kg ha 1 significantly higher than that of n3 due to severe frost damage the maximum yield in 2018 was lower than the minimum yield in other years there were significant differences between nitrogen levels in 2018 the apple yields of n2 n3 and n4 were 38610 kg ha 1 42820 kg ha 1and 45830 kg ha 1 respectively 14 2 26 6 and 35 6 higher than n1 in 2019 significant differences in yields were also observed with higher nitrogen levels leading to significantly higher yields all these demonstrated that nitrogen fertilizer had an apparent positive effect on apple yields and a high nitrogen level was more conducive to high yield both irrigation and nitrogen levels significantly affected the wue p 0 05 fig 10 however the response of wue to the two were inconsistent the wue first increased and then decreased with the increasing irrigation levels w3 obtained peak values of 11 7 kg m 3 8 5 kg m 3 7 1 kg m 3 and 10 6 kg m 3 in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the lowest wue values were obtained by w4 in 2016 2017 and 2019 w1 had the lowest wue in 2018 due to the effects of nitrogen fertilizer levels on apple yield the wue increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer levels fig 10b and the highest wue was obtained in n4 with the value of 11 9 kg m 3 10 3 kg m 3 7 6 kg m 3 and 11 6 kg m 3 in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively in general proper water and nitrogen management can improve wue 3 6 yield sustainability and stability irrigation and nitrogen levels produced similar effects on syi fig 11a at different nitrogen levels syi was in the descending order of n4 n3 n2 n1 the maximum syi under different irrigation water was obtained in w4 with the value of 0 77 which was an increase of 17 6 11 4 and 8 7 compared to w1 0 66 w2 0 7 and w3 0 71 respectively however the response of si to irrigation and nitrogen levels differed from syi fig 11b the si decreased with the increase of both irrigation and nitrogen levels indicating that irrigation and nitrogen levels increased the stability of apple yield apple yields and syi were divided into four quadrants m1 m2 m3 m4 based on the average values representing high sustainability and high yield m1 low sustainability and high yield m2 low sustainability and low yield m3 high sustainability and low yield m4 the result shows that treatments with high irrigation and nitrogen levels w3 n3 and n4 were associated with high apple yields and sustainability although the w4 treatment had the largest syi the reduction in yield was responsible for being located in the fourth quadrant high sustainability low yield treatments with low irrigation and nitrogen levels n1 w1 were located in the third quadrant low sustainability low yield compared with w1 n1 dealt with a higher yield and lower syi similarly yield stability responded to irrigation and nitrogen levels in much the same way as sustainability treatments w3 n3 and n4 had high apple yield and stability low si values while treatments n1 and w1 had low apple yield and stability high si values in terms of yield sustainability and stability indicators treatments w3 n3 and n4 were considered to be better management strategies 3 7 nitrogen balance based on the calculation of nitrogen inputs and outputs the nitrogen balance under different irrigation and nitrogen levels is obtained with the inventory in table 3 a large nitrogen surplus amount was observed with 230 68 542 48 kg ha 1 at different irrigation and nitrogen levels the response of nitrogen surplus amount and rate to nitrogen levels was essentially the same with the increase in nitrogen levels the nitrogen surplus amount and rate increased from 230 68 kg ha 1 to 542 48 kg ha 1 from 141 35 to 276 21 respectively the maximum nitrogen surplus amount and rate were approximately twice as large as the minimum nitrogen surplus and rate this was due to the large variation in nitrogen application amount and the relatively small variation in yield the differences in nitrogen surplus amount between irrigation levels were comparatively slight this may be related to the same amount of applied nitrogen and relatively small variation in yield the nitrogen surplus rates for all treatments were much higher than 17 indicating that the nitrogen surplus greatly exceeded their rational ranges zhu et al 2021 3 8 comprehensive evaluation the apple yield si available nitrogen content and cu of the seven treatments were selected and evaluated by qi considering the weights and pearson correlation coefficients among the indicators the percentage of scores for the individual indicator was essentially the same fig 12 cu received the highest percentage of total scores the score of w3 treatment was the highest reaching 0 89 which indicated the best irrigation and nitrogen management w4 took the second place with a score of 0 85 followed by n2 the score of w4 and n2 significantly lower than that of w3 overall all these results demonstrated that the rational regulation of irrigation and nitrogen levels was effective to improve the overall benefits of the apple industry in loess plateau the data collected were comprehensively analyzed with irrigation level and nitrogen level were treated as independent variables and evaluation score was considered as the response variables the coupling effect of irrigation and nitrogen level had a significant effect on the comprehensive score in an upward convex shape fig 13 based on the least squares method and a binary quadratic regression equation was determined and used to calculate the irrigation and nitrogen levels required to maximize the evaluation score the simulation results showed that the highest evaluation score was obtained when the irrigation and nitrogen level were 172 mm and 638 kg ha 1 respectively the comprehensive score was set to 98 of highest value to ensure the applicability of the final results to actual production management in this context the optimal strategy for irrigation and nitrogen level were 129 172 mm and 500 720 kg ha 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on soil nitrogen nitrogen plays a crucial role in plant growth and sustainable agriculture zhang et al 2015 the main form of nitrogen in soil no3 n can accumulate and be leached therefore irrigation is one of the dominant factors influencing nitrogen transport and leaching in the soil profile turkeltaub et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 in this study rainfall was much greater than irrigation amount during the growing season fig 1 and table 2 this means that rainfall was the main source of water for apple growth fertilizer was dissolved by the rainfall migrated to the drip irrigation pipeline and further affected by the irrigation water when the irrigation amount was small soil available nitrogen was mainly distributed in the upper soil layer fig 3 with the increasing irrigation level soil available nitrogen migrated from the upper to the lower soil layer related to the soil moisture movement large irrigation amount has a greater leaching effect and identical results were found in previous studies li et al 2015 wang and huang 2008 the variation of soil available nitrogen distribution in the soil profile also inevitably led to change in content the rising irrigation level reduced the soil available nitrogen content in 0 100 cm soil layer and increased in 100 200 cm soil layer fig 5 as for the 0 200 cm soil layer the soil available nitrogen increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation level this is because irrigation water w1 w2 and w3 reduced the soil available nitrogen content in the surface soil reducing nitrogen absorption by orchard weeds thereby increasing the soil available nitrogen content it was found that with further increase in irrigation amount w4 the soil available nitrogen was leached below 200 cm fig 3d resulting in a decrease in available nitrogen content in the 0 200 cm soil layer fig 5 in addition the variation of soil available nitrogen uniformity in 0 200 cm was similar to that of soil available nitrogen content which increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation level this is because in w1 and w2 treatments irrigation reduced the difference in available nitrogen between the upper and lower soil layers and increased the uniformity however heavy irrigation w3 and w4 caused a sharp drop in the available nitrogen content of the surface layer and an increase in the lower soil layer which aggravated the difference between the upper and the lower soil layers and reduced the uniformity nitrogen fertilizer was the main source of soil available nitrogen table 3 nitrogen supply significantly increased soil available nitrogen content fig 5 consistent with previous research results wang et al 2015 high nitrogen levels had higher available nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil layer fig 5b however the effect of nitrogen fertilizer on available nitrogen content of the surface soil was more remarkable than that of the lower soil which was attributed to the furrow fertilization therefore the uniformity of available nitrogen decreased with the increase of nitrogen levels that is to say nitrogen supply increased the soil available nitrogen content and exacerbated the difference in available nitrogen content in different soil layers both irrigation and nitrogen supply affected the soil available nitrogen distribution fig 3 and fig 4 content fig 5 and uniformity fig 6 and fig 7 in the soil profile the combined effects of excessive nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation led to nitrogen leaching from the root zone and into deep soil depths leading to groundwater pollution sun et al 2018 and reduced nitrogen use efficiency due to the positively correlated between nitrogen leaching with nitrogen and irrigation levels li et al 2015 xu et al 2020 optimal irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer level is effective means to reduce nitrogen leaching and improve nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2015 4 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on yield stability and sustainability irrigation and fertilization are important factors in increasing yields by improving soil nutrients and mitigating the effects of rainfall vagaries taylor et al 2013 vico and porporato 2015 wada et al 2012 numerous reports can be found in the literature providing different results on the effects of irrigation amount on apple yield el jaouhari et al 2018 some scholars also reported a positive correlation between irrigation amount and apple yield ucar et al 2016 however mpelasoka et al 2001 concluded that a 50 water deficit during the entire cycle did not result in a significant loss in apple yield these contradictory results are probably due to varying irrigation scheduling methods irrigation frequency as well as to the experimental conditions climatic edaphic cultivars etc in this study irrigation significantly improved the soil moisture conditions fig 8 and apple yield was significantly affected by irrigation levels which first increased and then decreased with the increase in irrigation level although soil water content was lower in the 20 water deficit w3 treatment compared to 100 etc w4 the 20 water deficit did not lead to yield reduction contrary to expectations yield increased significantly compared to other treatments this tendency was consistent with the findings of el jaouhari et al 2018 in addition to the soil moisture condition soil nutrients are also an important factor affecting apple yield el jaouhari et al 2018 compared with w3 treatment irrigation water reduced the available nitrogen of the 0 200 cm soil layer in the w4 treatment fig 5b moreover the w4 treatment reduced the soil available nitrogen uniformity which may have a negative impact on nutrient uptake by the apple tree resulting in a decline in yield many previous studies have shown that yield increased with increasing nitrogen application rate xu et al 2020 this may because nitrogen fertilizer provided more available nitrogen which was positively affected yield cai et al 2019 the same result was also observed in this study the high nitrogen levels were always accompanied by high yields fig 10 however the good linear relationship between soil available nitrogen and yield fig 14a differed from previous studies gu et al 2017 in fact nitrogen absorption by plants would reach a maximum value once nitrogen exceeds the critical value glass 2003 sperling et al 2019 xu et al 2020 further increases in nitrogen fertilizer do not significantly increase yield on the contrary the negative effects of excessive nitrogen fertilizer on soil decreases the yield excessive nitrogen fertilizer has been reported to affect water uptake and gain more energy to maintain cell water content thus reducing transpiration and nutrient uptake inhibiting growth and development reducing hydraulic conductivity limiting photosynthetic productivity and decreasing water use efficiency erel et al 2013 li et al 2021 in the study region the recommended nitrogen application rate was 240 360 kg ha 1 zhao et al 2012 no significant effect of nitrogen level on apple yield was found when the nitrogen application rate was as high as 1200 kg ha 1 wu et al 2021 however our research still shows a significant impact on the yield when the nitrogen application rate ranged from 375 kg ha 1 to 720 kg ha 1 this may because the low nitrogen use efficiency of furrow applied fertilizer required a higher nitrogen level to reach the critical value of nitrogen uptake by apple trees the significant differences in cu and content of soil available nitrogen among nitrogen supply treatments may also lead to significant effects of nitrogen levels on apple yield in this study syi is used to assess the effects of agricultural practices on crop yield sustainability yadav et al 2000 a higher syi value indicates a better management of producing satisfactory yields over the years li et al 2018 reported that the long term application of combined organic and chemical fertilizers could make the yield more sustainable by improving the properties of the soil it has also been reported that the long term sustainability of yield may be due to the continuous supply of soil nutrients cai et al 2019 in our research there was a positive correlation between yield sustainability and available nitrogen fig 14b nitrogen improved the sustainability of apple yield may be due to nitrogen fertilizer to improve soil available nitrogen content fig 5 although the concept of yield stability has been well established in genotyping research yield stability indicators in research on agronomic management systems is very limited daigh et al 2018 the si provides a measure of consistent productivity similar to yield sustainability our research shows that nitrogen fertilizer improved the stability of apple yield the largest si was obtained by n1 treatment indicating that apple yield could fluctuate drastically macholdt et al 2019 the small si in n4 indicated better nitrogen management practices capable of sustaining high yields zhang et al 2021a the results were the same as the findings of previous studies huang et al 2018a soil nutrient supply chemical physical and biological properties may be the reason that affects the high and stable yield of crops macholdt et al 2019 in our research the soil available nitrogen content was negatively correlated with si fig 14c it might be inferred that the positive aspects of nitrogen on nutrient supply could be assumed to be a possible reason for the higher yield stability of apples moreover a high irrigation level has a positive effect on improving the stability and sustainability of apple yield fig 11 this may be related to the improvement of soil moisture conditions by high irrigation levels and reduction of abiotic stress on apple trees improving the nitrogen uptake and utilization equally mahajan and pal 2022 described water and nitrogen as key components of sustainable productivity in stevia our research reiterated the positive effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on apple yield yield stability and sustainability however long term heavy nitrogen fertilizer and only applying chemical fertilizers could cause a series of negative effects and even reduce yield in the long run continuous application of chemical fertilizers could reduce soil quality by lowering soil ph sarkar et al 2018 resulting in a decline in crop yield and syi choudhary et al 2018 many studies have shown that combining chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers was an effective method to increase yield improve yield stability and sustainability qaswar et al 2020 currently the amount of nitrogen input in apple chemical fertilizers in orchards in northern shaanxi is much higher than that provided by organic fertilizers liu et al 2015 the proportion of organic fertilizer used is less than 5 zhao et al 2014 this implied that the input of nitrogen fertilizer in the orchard in loess plateau has huge potential for improvement 4 3 effects of irrigation and nitrogen levels on nitrogen balance nitrogen balance calculation is an effective method for predicting the risk of nitrate leaching into groundwater puckett et al 1999 previous studies have shown that the nitrogen balance depends on the amount of applied fertilizer and yield from agricultural fields mclellan et al 2018 in this study nitrogen inputs included fertilization and atmospheric nitrogen deposition with atmospheric nitrogen deposition accounting for 10 20 of total nitrogen inputs the output of nitrogen included branch and fruit carry out with branch pruning accounting for 10 of the total nitrogen output obviously nitrogen application rate and apple yield were the main factors affecting nitrogen balance 80 etc significantly reduced nitrogen surplus as influenced by yield differences table 3 it is also worth noting that the nitrogen carried out by apple fruit and branch pruning cannot be replenished only by atmospheric deposition this means that no or limited nitrogen applications would degrade soil fertility maintenance and reduce the apple tree yield ultimately affecting the sustainability of the apple industry as previously reported soil fertility and apple yield were significantly reduced with no or small nitrogen fertilizer zhang et al 2023 however the minimum nitrogen application in this study was 375 kg ha 1 which was higher than that of some studies in the same region hao et al 2022 zhang et al 2023 this is because the trees in this study were older produced more apples and brought out more nitrogen by the apples therefore 375 kg ha 1 was set as the lowest applied nitrogen level in this study however high nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the nitrogen surplus table 3 in this study the nitrogen surplus showed an increase from 230 68 to 524 48 kg ha 1 as the applied nitrogen increased from 375 to 720 kg ha 1 similarly ju et al 2006 reported a significant correlation between nitrogen surplus and nitrogen application rate as the nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increasing nitrogen level the application rates of nitrogen were severely overused across the apple orchards of luochuan county hou et al 2021 previous studies have shown that nitrogen surplus rate was 328 1 in loess plateau apple orchards however the permissible nitrogen surplus rate was only 17 in this study the nitrogen surplus rate ranged from 141 36 to 276 21 greater than the permissible surplus rate of nitrogen the risk classification of nitrogen surplus amount in apple orchards shows that the nitrogen surplus of n3 and n4 treatments exceeded the threshold of environmental safety with a medium risk level 400 550 kg ha 1 while other treatments were at a low risk level 250 400 kg ha 1 and no risk 250 kg ha 1 in fact higher fertilizer ensured the sustainability and stability of yields fig 11 which might lead to the stability and sustainability of nitrogen surplus result in a series of negative effects on the environment in the long run there is widespread agreement on the urgent need to achieve higher yields while minimizing environmental impacts however lucrative economic benefits have exacerbated high nitrogen fertilizer in chinese apple orchards excessive pursuit of high yield and big fruit leads to excessive nitrogen input zhao et al 2017 the average apple orchard nitrogen fertilizer increased from 350 kg ha 1 in 2000 1200 kg ha 1 in 2017 which resulted in a high level nitrogen surplus liu et al 2019 nitrate accumulation in the soil profile of apple orchards has been reported to reach 7250 8050 kg ha 1 which would lead to serious environmental problems and soil quality degradation ultimately affecting the sustainability of the apple industry zhu et al 2021 in different irrigation levels apple yields differed significantly among years p 0 05 similar results were observed in the experiments with different nitrogen application levels this indicates that the nitrogen surplus of the previous year did not have a positive effect on apple growth in the following year apple yield was linearly and positively correlated with soil available nitrogen content fig 14 all these results indicate a high probability of leaching of surplus nitrogen however due to the deep loess deposits in loess plateau environmental problems caused by excessive nitrogen surplus have not received enough attention huang et al 2018b overall high nitrogen level increased nitrogen surplus and soil nitrogen content and may also increase nitrogen leaching however in this study we focused more on the cumulative effect of water and nitrogen management on soil nitrogen content no detailed analysis of the nitrogen leaching performance for each year was done which needs to be focused on in the following studies 4 4 further improvement in irrigation and fertilization management in this study the comprehensive evaluation showed that the scores of w2 w3 and w4 were significantly higher by 28 5 35 8 and 29 8 respectively compared to w1 however compared to n1 the scores of n2 n3 and n4 were significantly higher by 4 6 1 6 and 2 1 respectively clearly irrigation level had a greater effect on the overall benefit scores this implied that the promotion of irrigation and reduction of nitrogen levels can effective in improving the overall benefit in contrast to local rainfed and high nitrogen application rate in this region the simulation analysis showed that the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy would be 129 172 mm and 500 720 kg ha 1 for apple orchards in loess plateau however the nitrogen surplus rate was still at risk in fact excessive nitrogen amount and low utilization efficiency are the main reasons for the huge nitrogen surplus for the sustainable development of the apple industry apple orchards in loess plateau should further optimize water and fertilizer management measures to reduce nitrogen application rate and improve nitrogen use efficiency and benefits previous studies have shown that integrated water and fertilizer organic fertilizer and slow release fertilizer can improve nutrient utilization efficiency liu et al 2021 reported that substitution of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with organic fertilizers reduced nitrogen leaching loss and organic fertilizer could improve soil quality and microbial community structure effectively han et al 2021 compared with ordinary uncoated compound fertilizers the nitrogen agronomic efficiency and partial productivity of coated compound fertilizers are 23 68 30 88 and 64 53 72 43 higher respectively meanwhile the nitrogen fertilizer application amount of the coated compound fertilizer may be reduced by 20 without reducing yield chen et al 2017 moreover establishing a good apple quality evaluation system promoting scientific and efficient planting mode site specific and real time nitrogen management should be considered in the future 5 conclusions the four year field experiment based on different irrigation and nitrogen levels in loess plateau apple orchards revealed that appropriate irrigation and nitrogen levels had positive effects on soil available nitrogen distribution content cu nitrogen surplus apple yield yield stability and sustainability although nitrogen level was the key determinant of nitrogen surpluses irrigation outweighed nitrogen in improving the overall benefits of apple orchards moreover the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management based on these factors was 129 172 mm and 500 720 kg ha 1 however the recommended nitrogen level still posed environmental risks which required further optimization such as coated compound fertilizer and integration of water and fertilizer to achieve the dual goals of soil sustainability
