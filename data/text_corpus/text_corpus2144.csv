10720,efficient agricultural water use is required for food safety and water alleviation on a global scale combining the water footprint and agricultural water use paradigms and enveloping water resource movement and its impact on the environment in the agricultural production process a hybrid framework for agricultural water utilization and efficiency evaluation was constructed in the current paper the indicators water resources use wru efficiency wre and productivity wrp are used in this framework for the total water exploitation the effective utilization rate and the production capacity measurement respectively an empirical study on the framework was conducted with major cereals wheat maize and rice in 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities pams of china the national wru wre and wrp values of integrated cereal were calculated to be 669 0 g m³ 0 633 and 0 679 kg m³ respectively from 1996 to 2015 the pams with high wre values were located in southwestern northeastern and northern china while the ones with low values were clustered in northwestern and southeastern china the spatial distribution pattern of wrp is consistent with precipitation the water use efficiency wre and wrp of the three specific crops in this framework increased over time the wre of maize was significantly higher than that of rice and wheat while the wrp of wheat was the lowest wru measures the total water resource appropriation during crop growth in both quantity and quality wrp was able to show where water use efficiency needs to be improved and the function of wre to indicate water saving potential could not be replaced by notable indices such as irrigation efficiency or generalized efficiency therefore further research is warranted to evaluate agricultural water use efficiency at different scales using this hybrid framework abbreviations wru water resources use wre water resources efficiency wrp water resource productivity iww irrigation water withdrawal iwc

water resource shortages and deterioration of the water environment are bottlenecks for the sustainable development of society approximately 90 of the human water footprint is derived from agricultural products and agriculture is the largest sector of influence on water resources worldwide hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 xinchun et al 2018 field crop evapotranspiration consumes extensive blue and green water resources the construction of irrigation facilities consumes many costs and changes the natural movement of water and the nonpoint source pollution of farmland has irreversible impacts on the water environment mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 duarte et al 2014 xinchun et al 2017a 2017b the regulation of water resource utilization in agricultural production systems is the basis of sustainable water utilization in society with the premise being to scientifically evaluate the agricultural water resource utilization and its efficiency currently agricultural water use and efficiency evaluations are performed through the following three categories of approaches appropriation amount effective utilization rate and production ability of water resources table 1 establishing the effective utilization rate and productivity ability indicators based on the definition and calculation of the water appropriation amount are the general procedures for agricultural water use efficiency assessments wang et al 2014a 2014b cao et al 2018b initially it was the concern of farmers and water resource allocators to fully irrigate crops to ensure food output therefore irrigation water withdrawal iww and crop irrigation water consumption iwc which are closely related to irrigation facilities corresponded to agricultural water use in regional and field perspectives respectively shahid 2011 yuan et al 2016 shrestha and shrestha 2017 djaman et al 2018 iww measurements were also the basis for governmental departments to formulate water resource management strategies wisser et al 2008 hanasaki et al 2010 chaturvedi et al 2015 fader et al 2016 liu et al 2017a 2017b 2017c the crop water consumption cwc which contained field irrigation and precipitation water consumption was one of the most commonly used indicators by hydrologists to measure the water demand of regional agricultural production allen et al 1998 beyazgöl et al 2000 liu et al 2007 al najar 2011 shen et al 2013 mcnally et al 2015 to overcome the shortcomings of the cwc which could not reflect irrigation facilities and water transportation processes crop water use cwu was used to measure the water resource utilization for the entire process of agricultural production igbadun et al 2012 cao et al 2014 2015a 2018a using artificial irrigation systems instead of natural river basins is suitable for farmers and irrigation district administrators to formulate agricultural water management strategies based on controlling the cwu cao et al 2015b 2018a however the impact of agricultural production on the water environment could not be reflected by the cwu the environmental effect should not be ignored because agricultural nonpoint source pollution has become a common issue of water resources in our world chapagain and hoekstra 2011 the crop water footprint cwf which can be divided into blue green and gray water components not only distinguishes blue and green water resources but also measures the impact of agricultural production on water quantity and quality yoo et al 2013 herath et al 2014 wang et al 2015 ababaei and etedali 2017 liu et al 2017a 2017b 2017c as with the cwc the cwf also evaluates the relationship between crops and blue green water from the perspective of water consumption based on accounting for the water appropriation amount the effective utilization rate and production ability of water resources can be evaluated by establishing relevant indicators in other words the development of an effective utilization rate and production ability measurements was synchronized with the appropriation amount jensen 2007 cao et al 2015a 2018b the irrigation efficiency ie and irrigation water productivity iwp were parameters for irrigation water use efficiency evaluation in irrigated systems yilmaz et al 2009 lankford 2012 angella et al 2016 singh et al 2017 pereira and marques 2017 gao et al 2018 grafton et al 2018 various indices for ie and iwp mirroring were established according to needs the green water use efficiency in croplands without irrigation could be interpreted with the aid of the rainwater utilization rate rur and the rain fed water productivity rwp rockström et al 2009 park et al 2012 kim and furumai 2012 zhang and hu 2014 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 kuller et al 2017 the generalized efficiency ge and generalized water productivity gwp not only examined the agricultural production and irrigation processes but also completely contained the utilization and efficiency of blue and green water resources playán and mateos 2006 cao et al 2015b xinchun et al 2017a 2017b with strong applicability the evaluation object of ge and gwp can be any designated area improving ge and gwp is the fundamental way to realize water saving and water efficient utilization in agriculture from a quantitative perspective ali and talukder 2008 cao et al 2018b the water footprint per unit crop product wfp also has the function of revealing the production ability of water resources quantifying the impact on water quality is the advance of wfp compared to the traditional water productivity indices including iwp cwp and gwp mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 nana et al 2014 marano and filippi 2015 xinchun et al 2018 karandish and šimůnek 2019 an agricultural production unit is a complex system including the natural water cycle artificial engineering interventions and environmental impacts existing approaches and indicators are attempting to reflect the agricultural production and water utilization situation as much as possible cao et al 2018b the objective of traditional methods was to save water particularly irrigation water and the objective of the water footprint was to comprehensively measure the impact of crop growth on water resources the transition from water quantity to quality is the development direction of agricultural water use efficiency evaluation methods however present research separates the two from each other in terms of both methods and indicators in other words there was no approach that can not only consider the irrigation and drainage process but also quantify the impact of agricultural nonpoint source pollution on the water environment the purpose of the current paper is to establish a hybrid analytical framework which not only considers the characteristics of water movement but also reflects the environmental impact in the agricultural production process to analyze the crop water relationship based on the latest research to elaborate the meaning and calculation method of the research paradigms contained in the framework and to conduct an empirical study on cereal planting in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 water use and efficiency indices the hybrid analytical framework for agricultural water resource utilization has the ability to measure the appropriation amount the effective utilization rate and the production ability of involved water resources inspired by and different from previous studies the corresponding indicators are called the water resources use wru water resources efficiency wre and water resources productivity wrp wru is the sum of the water resources invested and polluted in agricultural production and has four components irrigation water consumption iwc rainwater consumption rwc gray water footprint gwf and irrigation water loss iwl 1 w r u i w c r w c g w f i w l where iwc and rwc are the amounts of irrigation blue water and rainwater green consumed by crops in the form of field evapotranspiration respectively in mm or m³ gwf is the amount of nonpoint source pollution of water resources caused by agricultural discharges and iwl is the amount of water resources lost in the irrigation process including the extraction and movement of water resources wre is defined as the effective consumption proportion of the total water exploitation 2 w r e c w c w r u where cwc is the total field crop water consumption in m³ and has two components 3 c w c i w c r w c wrp in kg mg is calculated as the crop product per unit total water resource exploitation 4 w r p y w r u where y is the crop yield in kg m2 the utilization and efficiency of water resources in the crop production process can be evaluated comprehensively by combining wru wre and wrp according to the connotation of wru the accounting object of this framework includes all the water resources including the water quantity and quality involved in the agricultural production process agricultural water use processes are complex and special and are affected by irrigation facilities precipitation soil crop types fertilizer and other factors during a specific period usually the crop growth period all parts of wru cannot be used for other purposes therefore reducing the wru and improving wre and wrp in the hybrid framework can directly contribute to agricultural water saving and protection of the water environment water use and efficiency quantification in cereal wheat maize and rice production in 31 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities pams of china is taken as the case study in the current study iwc and rwc in eq 1 were calculated as follows 5 i w c a i w r 6 r w c a min e t c p e where a is the area of crops sown in ha iwr is the crop irrigation water requirement in mm etc is the crop water evapotranspiration in mm and pe is the effective precipitation during the crop period in mm iwr and etc could be obtained by 7 i w r e t c p e e t c p e 0 e t c p e 8 e t c k c e t 0 where kc is the crop coefficient dimensionless and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration in mm and is calculated through the widely used penman monteith p m formula pe could be estimated using the method in the fao cropwat model as follows fao 2010 9 p e p 4 17 0 02 p 4 17 p 83 41 7 0 1 p p 83 where p is the precipitation in ten days in mm the empirical formula recommended by the water footprint assessment manual was used for the gwf calculation mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 10 g w f α a r c m a x c m i n where α is the leaching runoff fraction ar is the rate of nitrogen application to the field per hectare kg ha c m a x is the maximum acceptable concentration 10 mg l for tn and c m a x is the concentration in natural water which is assumed to be 0 mg l in addition iwl is determined jointly by iwc and the status of the irrigation facilities 11 i w l i w c 1 i e i e where ie is the abbreviation for the irrigation efficiency 2 2 data resources the water use and efficiency for cereals rice wheat and maize in china from 1996 to 2015 were quantified and analyzed in the current study the ie values in 31 pams of the country fig 1 were obtained from the china water resources bulletins 1996 2015 the sown area a nitrogen application and crop yield data were collected from the china statistical yearbook in 1997 2016 the growth period data and kc were supplied by the farmland irrigation research institute chinese academy of agricultural sciences meteorological data for the et0 calculation were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center the 31 pams were divided into five subregions according to their geographic location and cereal planting structure fig 1 3 water resources use wru the national annual wru in cereal production was calculated to be approximately 669 0 gm³ during the observed period including 103 2 gm³ of iwc 321 3 gm³ of rwc 122 1 gm³of gwf and 122 4 gm³ of iwl the temporal variations of wru and its compositions in china are organized and shown in fig 2 the crop production share wru and its composition in five subregions are listed in table 2 to identify the regional wru performance fig 2 shows that the cereal wru in china has experienced a process of first decreasing and then rising over time the wru in 1996 was 695 7 gm³ and fell to 545 5 gm³ in 2003 the lowest value in the calculated period the wru has been rising since then and it exceeded 770 gm³ in 2015 the trend of each wru component varies over time in line with wru rwc has also experienced a decreasing and then rising process the minimum amount was 259 6 gm³ in 2003 which was only 65 5 of the maximum value in 2015 the ratio of rwc in wru was not only significantly higher than the other three components but also increased from 44 3 in 1997 to 51 0 in 2015 the effective precipitation absorbed by crops accounted for more than half of the total water exploitation in the cereal production of china since 2011 with a small change range both iwc and gwf showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing which determined that the proportion of the two in wru did not change significantly over the years iwl decreased from nearly 160 gm³ to less than 110 gm³ in 2015 and its corresponding proportion in wru decreased by 9 percentage points on the basis of 23 0 the changes of wru and its composition were mainly influenced by the agricultural production scale the cereal sown area shrank from 92 2 m ha in 1996 to 76 8 m ha in 2003 and then increased over time and expanded to 95 6 m ha in 2015 the annual variation of precipitation and the effective precipitation during the crop growth period was small which resulted in the crop area being the determinant of rwc iwc was influenced by both the crop sowing area and the irrigation rate of cultivated land the statistical data show that the cultivated land irrigation rate in china increased from 47 6 53 5 during the observed period which offset the effect of the sown area interannual variation on the iwc ratio this is the reason why the proportion of iwc does not change with time the case of gwf is similar to that of iwc iwl is determined by both iwc and ie and the latter increased from less than 0 400 to 0 538 in the study period which is the direct reason for the decline of iwl and its proportion in wru over time rice wheat and maize contributed 36 0 34 5 and 29 5 of the wru in china respectively table 2 shows that both the crop production and the wru varied among the subregions due to the differences in the crop type and planting structure north china produces 36 7 of cereals and occupies 285 6 g m³ 42 7 of the total of the wru which were significantly higher than those in other subregions northeast and southeast china contributed approximately one fifth of the cereals and had similar wru compositions while the wru gap was nearly 30 g m³ wru and its composition in southwest china were similar to those in the southeast while the crop output was only 3 4 of that in the former northwest china needed 71 6 g m³ of water to obtain 8 2 of the country s cereal at the same time rwc accounted for approximately one third of the wru and northwestern china was also a subregion with iwc and iwl values higher than 20 4 water resources efficiency wre the national wre in cereal production was estimated to be 0 633 meaning that more than one third of the wru is not converted to evapotranspiration the wre values for the three crops over the studied years are mapped in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the wre for integrated cereal production shows a growth trend over time and increased from approximately 0 600 in the previous three years to 0 666 in 2015 the wre and its change trend varied among crops the annual wre of maize was 0 686 which was higher than the 0 633 of integrated cereal the 0 607 of wheat and the 0 618 of rice meanwhile the wre of maize remained stable with a standard deviation of 0 008 for the 20 years which was significantly lower than the 0 045 of wheat and the 0 031 of rice the wre of wheat and rice showed a trend of increasing over time and the former had a trend of exceeding the latter the wre gap between wheat and rice was approximately 0 025 in the first six years decreased to 0 010 in 2002 2006 and was almost equal after 2007 climate conditions crop water requirement and water management types in the agricultural production process are closely related to the wre the water requirements of maize wheat and rice in china were approximately 370 440 and 550 mm respectively moreover the coincidence of the maize growth period and the rainy season led to a larger proportion of rwc in the wru and a small exploitation for iwc and iwl less precipitation during the growth period of the major wheat species of winter wheat in china contributing to the iwc and iwl being higher than that of maize the large and concentrated precipitation during the rice growth period has prompted the low utilization rate of precipitation serious nonpoint source pollution and a higher wre than maize in china wheat and maize are mainly distributed in the arid north while rice is mainly grown in the humid south differences in the crop planting structure may lead to differences in the wre of cereals fig 4 exhibits the average wre and production share of cereals at the provincial scale during the observed period it is clearly illustrated in fig 4 that the wre of cereals in china showed obvious spatial aggregation provinces with high wre values are located in the southwestern northeastern and northern china while ones with low values are mainly located in northwestern and southeastern china specifically the wre of jilin peaked at 0 700 and ranked the highest of all the pams in china the wre values in yunnan anhui beijing guizhou liaoning shanghai and jiangsu also exceeded 0 680 in addition the wre values in six pams were above the national value of 0 633 the wre values of 17 pams were below the national line of which hebei tibet hainan inner mongolia qinghai xinjiang and ningxia were less than 0 600 the wre in ningxia was only 0 494 which was the lowest in china ningxia was also the only province with an effective water resource utilization rate in cereal production of no more than 50 the spatial performance of the wre was determined by the crop planting conditions climate environment topography and water resource endowment as granaries in china both northern china and northeastern china have flat land fertile soil approximately 600 mm of precipitation and other conditions suitable for wheat and maize growth the output of maize with a high wre fig 3 occupied more than 50 in most pams of the two subregions mentioned above this is an important reason for the high wre in north china and northeast china precipitation in the southeast pams was more than 1200 mm which is suitable for rice growth but not wheat and maize the low wre rice fig 3 output and wru in this subregion accounted for approximately 90 of the cereal total which is the reason for the low wre the western region is vast in area however it is not a key area for cereal production and efficient water use in china due to insufficient climatic or topographic conditions the high rwc ratio table 2 and wre resulted from by abundant precipitation in southwest china although rice was also the main cereal crop the drought and water shortage in northwest china were dominated by wheat and the crops depend heavily on irrigation therefore the wre is difficult to upgrade due to the high iwc and iwl ratio table 2 in the wru as a whole 5 water resources productivity wrp the annual national value of wrp was estimated to be 0 679 kg m³ for the past 20 years the results also showed that the wrp values of wheat maize and rice were 0 475 0 778 and 0 795 kg m³ respectively the national wrp for integrated cereal and the three specific crops from 1996 to 2015 are displayed in fig 5 the wrp of the three kinds of specific crops increased with time resulting in the wrp of integrated cereals improving at an annual rate of 0 002 kg m³ on the premise that the wru per unit area did not change much the wrp increase was mainly determined by the change of crop yield the data showed that the crop yield and wru per unit area of the integrated cereal during the study period were 5 44 ton ha and 799 1 mm and the cv values were 0 07 and 0 03 respectively interannual variability of the former was larger than that of the latter which was the reason for the increase of the wrp fig 5 also clearly shows that the wrp values of rice and corn are very close to each other over the years and are both significantly higher than that of wheat the difference in the specific crop wrp was determined by the wru per unit area and the crop yield the wru values per unit area of wheat corn and rice were 923 5 683 5 and 810 8 mm and the yields were 4 38 5 34 and 6 44 ton ha respectively china was simultaneously facing the reality of increasing yields and reducing water resource requirements in wheat cultivation the annual wrp of provincial scale integrated cereal and specific crops is plotted in fig 6 for spatial pattern observation the wrp of integrated cereal among the pams was quite different ranging from 0 332 kg m³ in qinghai to 1 183 kg m³ in jiangxi fig 6 shows that almost in accordance with the distribution of precipitation the wrp increased from the northwest to the southeast in addition the wrp of hunan and fujian also exceeded 1 100 kg m reaching 1 157 and 1 106 kg m³ respectively and they were in the leading position in the country other pams with wrp values greater than 1 000 kg m³ included guangdong and zhejiang in addition there are another 10 pams with wrp values above the national value of 0 679 kg m³ most of which were located in the yangtze river basin all of the pams with wrp values below the national value were located in northwestern and northeastern china and the north china plain except sichuan and tibet ningxia tibet xinjiang and qinghai had wrp values of 0 473 0 393 0 355 and 0 332 kg m³ respectively which were the lowest in the country fig 6 shows that the wrp of the three specific crops was different among the pams and the wrp values of rice no rice in qinghai and maize were higher than that of wheat no wheat in hainan the wrp of wheat was less than 0 400 kg m³ in the northwest pams and only approximately 0 500 kg m³ in the north china plain which was the direct reason for the low wrp of integrated cereal in the two wheat based subregions fig 4 the wrp values of maize and rice in northeast china were lower than 0 900 and 0 700 kg m³ respectively which resulted in the wrp of integrated cereal being near the national value the wrp values of rice and maize in the southeastern pams were over 1 000 and 0 800 kg m³ respectively the wrp of wheat was also higher than that in the northern pams so the cereal wrp in the southeast was the highest in the country the wrp of the three crops determined the performance of the regional integrated cereal wrp and the former was determined by the per unit area of the wru and the crop output the wru values per unit area of rice wheat and maize were approximately 810 8 923 5 and 683 5 mm respectively in contrast the crop yield was 6 44 rice 4 38 wheat and 5 34 maize ton ha respectively wheat was the crop with the greatest impact on water resources and the lowest cereal production benefit in china the wru wre and wrp are complementary to each other in the hybrid framework and form a complete index system the wru is the foundation of the wre and wrp quantification agricultural water utilization efficiency evaluation and strategy formulation based on the wru rely on the wre and wrp the distribution of the wre and wrp was different among crops figs 3 and 5 due to the different water resource requirements and crop yields maize has high wre and wrp values at the same time but wheat has the opposite the cwc ratio of rice was as low as that of wheat while the wrp was the highest in the latest decade benefiting from its high crop yield the water use efficiency of rice determined the wre fig 4 and wrp fig 6 performance of the southeast because rice contributes 88 7 table 2 of the wru in this subregion in contrast most of the north china and southwest china pams had high wre values and lower wrp values and the northwest pams had the lowest agricultural water use efficiency from the perspectives of the effective use rate and the production ability in general the spatial performance of the wre and wrp is not always consistent and it may be difficult to develop comprehensive strategies for improving the water resource utilization efficiency based on a single indicator 6 discussion the aim of quantitatively accounting for the relationship between agricultural production and water resources is to provide a basis for the formulation of agricultural water management strategies the purpose of this study is to combine the concepts of the agricultural water footprint and water movement into a framework for water exploitation calculations to comprehensively quantify the utilization and impact of agricultural production on water resources to discuss the necessity of our hybrid framework and its difference from previous methods the wru crop water footprint cwf and crop water use cwu are compared and analyzed here as shown in fig 7 the annual average values of both cwf wru and cwu wru are 0 817 indicating that the water resource requirement of agricultural production can be underestimated by approximately 20 from the perspective of the water footprint and water use fig 7 shows that the higher the wru per unit area the smaller the proportion of cwf in the wru at the provincial scale in other words the large wru in some pams may be due to the great water loss during the irrigation process in fact when evaluating water resource utilization from the perspective of cwf its activity in water resources management in the agricultural production process could be limited due to the neglect of irrigation facilities and the irrigation water transportation process improving irrigation facilities and the irrigation efficiency has always been an important direction of agricultural water saving irrigation district managers will lose the main motivation of water saving if the iwl is not considered in the total agricultural water resource requirement the difference of the cwf lies in the calculation of the gwf compared to the cwu agricultural nonpoint source pollution is the main cause of regional environmental problems the gwf is a quantitative indicator of the impact of agricultural production on the water environment and has been widely accepted as a meaningful measure agricultural producers will not be able to evaluate the extent of agricultural nonpoint source pollution intuitively and actively improve agronomic technology if the gwf is neglected in the wru the cwu wru in southern china was approximately 0 795 which is lower than the 0 830 in northern china this indicated that the issue of the crop gwf and agricultural nonpoint source pollution should be considered in the efficient and sustainable utilization of regional water resources in humid areas in fact the evaluation method of agricultural water use and efficiency has been in the process of exploration and development due to the complexity of agricultural production and the water use process in the current study the establishment of the water resource utilization efficiency and productivity index based on the calculation of the wru has a theoretical basis and practical significance to further discuss this point comparisons of the wrp and the wre with existing indicators are shown in fig 8 because the crop yield was fixed and the water input varied changes in the water productivity value are inevitable fig 8 shows that the wrp has a good linear correlation with the selected wp indicators with the determinant coefficients reaching 0 9485 and 0 9408 respectively in other words the spatial distribution pattern of the wp is consistent with the existing indices when the wru is used as the water resources input item this is in line with the spatial distribution characteristics of the water productivity indicators previous studies have shown that the spatial distribution pattern of different wp indices is consistent cao et al 2015a which is determined by crop yields and water consumption characteristics the wrp in the hybrid framework proposed in the current paper also conforms to the characteristic that the wp index is conducive to the evaluation of the relative size among regions in other words using the wru as the water input item to evaluate the water resource production ability can not only fully calculate the utilization of water resources but also maintain the general nature of the wp indicators which is progress in this field improving the wp is an effective measure to improve the water use efficiency however the crop yield per unit area cannot be increased indefinitely and increasing the crop yield cannot guarantee a reduction of the regional total water resource utilization therefore reducing the input of ineffective water resources that is improving the effective utilization of water resources is a direct way to improve the efficiency of water resource utilization the effective water resource utilization evaluation index reveals the potential and direction of water saving it is found that there is no linear correlation between the wre in the hybrid framework and the existing indicators fig 8c and d previous indicators cannot reveal the spatial pattern of the wru effective consumption rate in other words locations with the potential to reduce the impact of agricultural production on water resources quantity and environment cannot be determined by using the ie or ge a synthesized framework for the relationship between crop production and water resource measurement is proposed in this paper based on the latest progress in the agricultural water resource utilization and efficiency evaluation the wru wre and wrp indicators can comprehensively explain the water resource utilization effective utilization rate and output capacity under this framework the water use efficiency cannot be compared independently in view of the functions of the three indicators and their spatial distribution pattern for each crop figs 4 and 6 the three indicators should be combined to evaluate the water use efficiency therefore the hybrid framework proposed in this paper is a new and independent index system in the field of agricultural water use efficiency assessments and can be used as a tool in the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources in the future it should be pointed out that it is difficult to accurately calculate the components of agricultural water requirements on a large scale due to the complexity of farmland water and fertilizer transport at the same time the demand of different crops for agricultural facilities and water management is not entirely consistent and a unified calculation method may lead to deviations in results for example pollutants in paddy fields tend to migrate with drainage xinchun et al 2018 i e the concentration of pollutants in drainage will be lower than the hypothesized value of gwf calculations which may overestimate the crop gwf and wre combining the hybrid framework in this paper with more precise methods or tools such as field observations is the future development direction of agricultural water utilization and efficiency evaluation 7 conclusion this study proposes a hybrid assessment framework for agricultural utilization use and efficiency evaluation the framework differs from the previous method in that it comprehensively considers the effect on water resources and the environment in agricultural production processes and the characteristics of farmland water conservancy facilities and water conservation needs we recommend using the wru wre and wrp to measure the total exploitation the effective utilization rate and the production capacity or water resources respectively agricultural water and its efficiency indicators in this framework were accounted for and analyzed by taking cereal cultivation in china as a case study we found that there were differences in the indicators among wheat rice and maize this paper also demonstrates the reliability and necessity of the hybrid evaluation framework by comparing it with the traditional water resource utilization efficiency evaluation indicators the agricultural production process should be more comprehensively reflected is the direction of agricultural water use and its efficiency evaluation and the hybrid framework proposed in the current paper is an attempt because the agricultural production process involves both natural and artificial double interference to water resources the accurate evaluation of the wru and its efficiency on a large scale is an important issue and it is a major area for improvement in the methods and

10720,efficient agricultural water use is required for food safety and water alleviation on a global scale combining the water footprint and agricultural water use paradigms and enveloping water resource movement and its impact on the environment in the agricultural production process a hybrid framework for agricultural water utilization and efficiency evaluation was constructed in the current paper the indicators water resources use wru efficiency wre and productivity wrp are used in this framework for the total water exploitation the effective utilization rate and the production capacity measurement respectively an empirical study on the framework was conducted with major cereals wheat maize and rice in 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities pams of china the national wru wre and wrp values of integrated cereal were calculated to be 669 0 g m³ 0 633 and 0 679 kg m³ respectively from 1996 to 2015 the pams with high wre values were located in southwestern northeastern and northern china while the ones with low values were clustered in northwestern and southeastern china the spatial distribution pattern of wrp is consistent with precipitation the water use efficiency wre and wrp of the three specific crops in this framework increased over time the wre of maize was significantly higher than that of rice and wheat while the wrp of wheat was the lowest wru measures the total water resource appropriation during crop growth in both quantity and quality wrp was able to show where water use efficiency needs to be improved and the function of wre to indicate water saving potential could not be replaced by notable indices such as irrigation efficiency or generalized efficiency therefore further research is warranted to evaluate agricultural water

water resource shortages and deterioration of the water environment are bottlenecks for the sustainable development of society approximately 90 of the human water footprint is derived from agricultural products and agriculture is the largest sector of influence on water resources worldwide hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 xinchun et al 2018 field crop evapotranspiration consumes extensive blue and green water resources the construction of irrigation facilities consumes many costs and changes the natural movement of water and the nonpoint source pollution of farmland has irreversible impacts on the water environment mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 duarte et al 2014 xinchun et al 2017a 2017b the regulation of water resource utilization in agricultural production systems is the basis of sustainable water utilization in society with the premise being to scientifically evaluate the agricultural water resource utilization and its efficiency currently agricultural water use and efficiency evaluations are performed through the following three categories of approaches appropriation amount effective utilization rate and production ability of water resources table 1 establishing the effective utilization rate and productivity ability indicators based on the definition and calculation of the water appropriation amount are the general procedures for agricultural water use efficiency assessments wang et al 2014a 2014b cao et al 2018b initially it was the concern of farmers and water resource allocators to fully irrigate crops to ensure food output therefore irrigation water withdrawal iww and crop irrigation water consumption iwc which are closely related to irrigation facilities corresponded to agricultural water use in regional and field perspectives respectively shahid 2011 yuan et al 2016 shrestha and shrestha 2017 djaman et al 2018 iww measurements were also the basis for governmental departments to formulate water resource management strategies wisser et al 2008 hanasaki et al 2010 chaturvedi et al 2015 fader et al 2016 liu et al 2017a 2017b 2017c the crop water consumption cwc which contained field irrigation and precipitation water consumption was one of the most commonly used indicators by hydrologists to measure the water demand of regional agricultural production allen et al 1998 beyazgöl et al 2000 liu et al 2007 al najar 2011 shen et al 2013 mcnally et al 2015 to overcome the shortcomings of the cwc which could not reflect irrigation facilities and water transportation processes crop water use cwu was used to measure the water resource utilization for the entire process of agricultural production igbadun et al 2012 cao et al 2014 2015a 2018a using artificial irrigation systems instead of natural river basins is suitable for farmers and irrigation district administrators to formulate agricultural water management strategies based on controlling the cwu cao et al 2015b 2018a however the impact of agricultural production on the water environment could not be reflected by the cwu the environmental effect should not be ignored because agricultural nonpoint source pollution has become a common issue of water resources in our world chapagain and hoekstra 2011 the crop water footprint cwf which can be divided into blue green and gray water components not only distinguishes blue and green water resources but also measures the impact of agricultural production on water quantity and quality yoo et al 2013 herath et al 2014 wang et al 2015 ababaei and etedali 2017 liu et al 2017a 2017b 2017c as with the cwc the cwf also evaluates the relationship between crops and blue green water from the perspective of water consumption based on accounting for the water appropriation amount the effective utilization rate and production ability of water resources can be evaluated by establishing relevant indicators in other words the development of an effective utilization rate and production ability measurements was synchronized with the appropriation amount jensen 2007 cao et al 2015a 2018b the irrigation efficiency ie and irrigation water productivity iwp were parameters for irrigation water use efficiency

revealing the production ability of water resources quantifying the impact on water quality is the advance of wfp compared to the traditional water productivity indices including iwp cwp and gwp mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 nana et al 2014 marano and filippi 2015 xinchun et al 2018 karandish and šimůnek 2019 an agricultural production unit is a complex system including the natural water cycle artificial engineering interventions and environmental impacts existing approaches and indicators are attempting to reflect the agricultural production and water utilization situation as much as possible cao et al 2018b the objective of traditional methods was to save water particularly irrigation water and the objective of the water footprint was to comprehensively measure the impact of crop growth on water resources the transition from water quantity to quality is the development direction of agricultural water use efficiency evaluation methods however present research separates the two from each other in terms of both methods and indicators in other words there was no approach that can not only consider the irrigation and drainage process but also quantify the impact of agricultural nonpoint source pollution on the water environment the purpose of the current paper is to establish a hybrid analytical framework which not only considers the characteristics of water movement but also reflects the environmental impact in the agricultural production process to analyze the crop water relationship based on the latest research to elaborate the meaning and calculation method of the research paradigms contained in the framework and to conduct an empirical study on cereal planting in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 water use and efficiency indices the hybrid analytical framework for agricultural water resource utilization has the ability to measure the appropriation amount the effective utilization rate and the production ability of involved water resources inspired by and different from previous studies the corresponding indicators are called the water resources use wru water resources efficiency wre and water resources productivity wrp wru is the sum of the water resources invested and polluted in agricultural production and has four components irrigation water consumption iwc rainwater consumption rwc gray water footprint gwf and irrigation water loss iwl 1 w r u i w c r w c g w f i w l where iwc and rwc are the amounts of irrigation blue water and rainwater green consumed by crops in the form of field evapotranspiration respectively in mm or m³ gwf is the amount of nonpoint source pollution of water resources caused by agricultural discharges and iwl is the amount of water resources lost in the irrigation process including the extraction and movement of water resources wre is defined as the effective consumption proportion of the total water exploitation 2 w r e c w c w r u where cwc is the total field crop water consumption in m³ and has two components 3 c w c i w c r w c wrp in kg mg is calculated as the crop product per unit total water resource exploitation 4 w r p y w r u where y is the crop yield in kg m2 the utilization and efficiency of water resources in the crop production process can be evaluated comprehensively by combining wru wre and wrp according to the connotation of wru the accounting object of this framework includes all the water resources including the water quantity and quality involved in the agricultural production process agricultural water use processes are complex and special and are affected by irrigation facilities precipitation soil crop types fertilizer and other factors during a specific period usually the crop growth period all parts of wru cannot be used for other purposes therefore reducing the wru and improving wre and wrp in the hybrid framework can directly contribute to agricultural water saving and protection of the water environment water use and efficiency quantification in cereal wheat maize and rice production in 31 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities pams of china is taken as the case study in the current study iwc and rwc in eq 1 were calculated as follows 5 i w c a i w r 6 r w c a min e t c p e where a is the area of crops sown in ha iwr is the crop irrigation water requirement in mm etc is the crop water evapotranspiration in mm and pe is the effective precipitation during the crop period in mm iwr and etc could be obtained by 7 i w r e t c p e e t c p e 0 e t c p e 8 e t c k c e t 0 where kc is the crop coefficient dimensionless and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration in mm and is calculated through the widely used penman monteith p m formula pe could be estimated using the method in the fao cropwat model as follows fao 2010 9 p e p 4 17 0 02 p 4 17 p 83 41 7 0 1 p p 83 where p is the precipitation in ten days in mm the empirical formula recommended by the water footprint assessment manual was used for the gwf calculation mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 10 g w f α a r c m a x c m i n where α is the leaching runoff fraction ar is the rate of nitrogen application to the field per hectare kg ha c m a x is the maximum acceptable concentration 10 mg l for tn and c m a x is the concentration in natural water which is assumed to be 0 mg l in addition iwl is determined jointly by iwc and the status of the irrigation facilities 11 i w l i w c 1 i e i e where ie is the abbreviation for the irrigation efficiency 2 2 data resources the water use and efficiency for cereals rice wheat and maize in china from 1996 to 2015 were quantified and analyzed in the current study the ie values in 31 pams of the country fig 1 were obtained from the china water resources bulletins 1996 2015 the sown area a nitrogen application and crop yield data were collected from the china statistical yearbook in 1997 2016 the growth period data and kc were supplied by the farmland irrigation research institute chinese academy of agricultural sciences meteorological data for the et0 calculation were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center the 31 pams were divided into five subregions according to their geographic location and cereal planting structure fig 1 3 water resources use wru the national annual wru in cereal production was calculated to be approximately 669 0 gm³ during the observed period including 103 2 gm³ of iwc 321 3 gm³ of rwc 122 1 gm³of gwf and 122 4 gm³ of iwl the temporal variations of wru and its compositions in china are organized and shown in fig 2 the crop production share wru and its composition in five subregions are listed in table 2 to identify the regional wru performance fig 2 shows that the cereal wru in china has experienced a process of first decreasing and then rising over time the wru in 1996 was 695 7 gm³ and fell to 545 5 gm³ in 2003 the lowest value in the calculated period the wru has been rising since then and it exceeded 770 gm³ in 2015 the trend of each wru component varies over time in line with wru rwc has also experienced a decreasing and then rising process the minimum amount was 259 6 gm³ in 2003 which was only 65 5 of the maximum value in 2015 the ratio of rwc in wru was not only significantly higher than the other three components but also increased from 44 3 in 1997 to 51 0 in 2015 the effective precipitation absorbed by crops accounted for more than half of the total water exploitation in the cereal production of china since 2011 with a small change range both iwc and gwf showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing which determined that the proportion of the two in wru did not change significantly over the years iwl decreased from nearly 160 gm³ to less than 110 gm³ in 2015 and its corresponding proportion in wru decreased by 9 percentage points on the basis of 23 0 the changes of wru and its composition were mainly influenced by the agricultural production scale the cereal sown area shrank from 92 2 m ha in 1996 to 76 8 m ha in 2003 and then increased over time and expanded to 95 6 m ha in 2015 the annual variation of precipitation and the effective precipitation during the crop growth period was small which resulted in the crop area being the determinant of rwc iwc was influenced by both the crop sowing area and the irrigation rate of cultivated land the statistical data show that the cultivated land irrigation rate in china increased from 47 6 53 5 during the observed period which offset the effect of the sown area interannual variation on the iwc ratio this is the reason why the proportion of iwc does not change with time the case of gwf is similar to that of iwc iwl is determined by both iwc and ie and the latter increased from less than 0 400 to 0 538 in the study period which is the direct reason for the decline of iwl and its proportion in wru over time rice wheat and maize contributed 36 0 34 5 and 29 5 of the wru in china respectively table 2 shows that both the crop production and the wru varied among the subregions due to the differences in the crop type and planting structure north china produces 36 7 of cereals and occupies 285 6 g m³ 42 7 of the total of the wru which were significantly higher than those in other subregions northeast and southeast china contributed approximately one fifth of the cereals and had similar wru compositions while the wru gap was nearly 30 g m³ wru and its composition in southwest china were similar to those in the southeast while the crop output was only 3 4 of that in the former northwest china needed 71 6 g m³ of water to obtain 8 2 of the country s cereal at the same time rwc accounted for approximately one third of the wru and northwestern china was also a subregion with iwc and iwl values higher than 20 4 water resources efficiency wre the national wre in cereal production was estimated to be 0 633 meaning that more than one third of the wru is not converted to evapotranspiration the wre values for the three crops over the studied years are mapped in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the wre for integrated cereal production shows a growth trend over time and increased from approximately 0 600 in the previous three years to 0 666 in 2015 the wre and its change trend varied among crops the annual wre of maize was 0 686 which was higher than the 0 633 of integrated cereal the 0 607 of wheat and the 0 618 of rice meanwhile the wre of maize remained stable with a standard deviation of 0 008 for the 20 years which was significantly lower than the 0 045 of wheat and the 0 031 of rice the wre of wheat and rice showed a trend of increasing over time and the former had a trend of exceeding the latter the wre gap between wheat and rice was approximately 0 025 in the first six years decreased to 0 010 in 2002 2006 and was almost equal after 2007 climate conditions crop water requirement and water management types in the agricultural production process are closely related to the wre the water requirements of maize wheat and rice in china were approximately 370 440 and 550 mm respectively moreover the coincidence of the maize growth period and the rainy season led to a larger proportion of rwc in the wru and a small exploitation for iwc and iwl less precipitation during the growth period of the major wheat species of winter wheat in china contributing to the iwc and iwl being higher than that of maize the large and concentrated precipitation during the rice growth period has prompted the low utilization rate of precipitation serious nonpoint source pollution and a higher wre than maize in china wheat and maize are mainly distributed in the arid north while rice is mainly grown in the humid south differences in the crop planting structure may lead to differences in the wre of cereals fig 4 exhibits the average wre and production share of cereals at the provincial scale during the observed period it is clearly illustrated in fig 4 that the wre of cereals in china showed obvious spatial aggregation provinces with high wre values are located in the southwestern northeastern and northern china while ones with low values are mainly located in northwestern and southeastern china specifically the wre of jilin peaked at 0 700 and ranked the highest of all the pams in china the wre values in yunnan anhui beijing guizhou liaoning shanghai and jiangsu also exceeded 0 680 in addition the wre values in six pams were above the national value of 0 633 the wre values of 17 pams were below the national line of which hebei tibet hainan inner mongolia qinghai xinjiang and ningxia were less than 0 600 the wre in ningxia was only 0 494 which was the lowest in china ningxia was also the only province with an effective water resource utilization rate in cereal production of no more than 50 the spatial performance of the wre was determined by the crop planting conditions climate environment topography and water resource endowment as granaries in china both northern china and northeastern china have flat land fertile soil approximately 600 mm of precipitation and other conditions suitable for wheat and maize growth the output of maize with a high wre fig 3 occupied more than 50 in most pams of the two subregions mentioned above this is an important reason for the high wre in north china and northeast china precipitation in the southeast pams was more than 1200 mm which is suitable for rice growth but not wheat and maize the low wre rice fig 3 output and wru in this subregion accounted for approximately 90 of the cereal total which is the reason for the low wre the western region is vast in area however it is not a key area for cereal production and efficient water use in china due to insufficient climatic or topographic conditions the high rwc ratio table 2 and wre resulted from by abundant precipitation in southwest china although rice was also the main cereal crop the drought and water shortage in northwest china were dominated by wheat and the crops depend heavily on irrigation therefore the wre is difficult to upgrade due to the high iwc and iwl ratio table 2 in the wru as a whole 5 water resources productivity wrp the annual national value of wrp was estimated to be 0 679 kg m³ for the past 20 years the results also showed that the wrp values of wheat maize and rice were 0 475 0 778 and 0 795 kg m³ respectively the national wrp for integrated cereal and the three specific crops from 1996 to 2015 are displayed in fig 5 the wrp of the three kinds of specific crops increased with time resulting in the wrp of integrated cereals improving at an annual rate of 0 002 kg m³ on the premise that the wru per unit area did not change much the wrp increase was mainly determined by the change of crop yield the data showed that the crop yield and wru per unit area of the integrated cereal during the study period were 5 44 ton ha and 799 1 mm and the cv values were 0 07 and 0 03 respectively interannual variability of the former was larger than that of the latter which was the reason for the increase of the wrp fig 5 also clearly shows that the wrp values of rice and corn are very close to each other over the years and are both significantly higher than that of wheat the difference in the specific crop wrp was determined by the wru per unit area and the crop yield the wru values per unit area of wheat corn and rice were 923 5 683 5 and 810 8 mm and the yields were 4 38 5 34 and 6 44 ton ha respectively china was simultaneously facing the reality of increasing yields and reducing water resource requirements in wheat cultivation the annual wrp of provincial scale integrated cereal and specific crops is plotted in fig 6 for spatial pattern observation the wrp of integrated cereal among the pams was quite different ranging from 0 332 kg m³ in qinghai to 1 183 kg m³ in jiangxi fig 6 shows that almost in accordance with the distribution of precipitation the wrp increased from the northwest to the southeast in addition the wrp of hunan and fujian also exceeded 1 100 kg m reaching 1 157 and 1 106 kg m³ respectively and they were in the leading position in the country other pams with wrp values greater than 1 000 kg m³ included guangdong and zhejiang in addition there are another 10 pams with wrp values above the national value of 0 679 kg m³ most of which were located in the yangtze river basin all of the pams with wrp values below the national value were located in northwestern and northeastern china and the north china plain except sichuan and tibet ningxia tibet xinjiang and qinghai had wrp values of 0 473 0 393 0 355 and 0 332 kg m³ respectively which were the lowest in the country fig 6 shows that the wrp of the three specific crops was different among the pams and the wrp values of rice no rice in qinghai and maize were higher than that of wheat no wheat in hainan the wrp of wheat was less than 0 400 kg m³ in the northwest pams and only approximately 0 500 kg m³ in the north china plain which was the direct reason for the low wrp of integrated cereal in the two wheat based subregions fig 4 the wrp values of maize and rice in northeast china were lower than 0 900 and 0 700 kg m³ respectively which resulted in the wrp of integrated cereal being near the national value the wrp values of rice and maize in the southeastern pams were over 1 000 and 0 800 kg m³ respectively the wrp of wheat was also higher than that in the northern pams so the cereal wrp in the southeast was the highest in the country the wrp of the three crops determined the performance of the regional integrated cereal wrp and the former was determined by the per unit area of the wru and the crop output the wru values per unit area of rice wheat and maize were approximately 810 8 923 5 and 683 5 mm respectively in contrast the crop yield was 6 44 rice 4 38 wheat and 5 34 maize ton ha respectively wheat was the crop with the greatest impact on water resources and the lowest cereal production benefit in china the wru wre and wrp are complementary to each other in the hybrid framework and form a complete index system the wru is the foundation of the wre and wrp quantification agricultural water utilization efficiency evaluation and strategy formulation based on the wru rely on the wre and wrp the distribution of the wre and wrp was different among crops figs 3 and 5 due to the different water resource requirements and crop yields maize has high wre and wrp values at the same time but wheat has the opposite the cwc ratio of rice was as low as that of wheat while the wrp was the highest in the latest decade benefiting from its high crop yield the water use efficiency of rice determined the wre fig 4 and wrp fig 6 performance of the southeast because rice contributes 88 7 table 2 of the wru in this subregion in contrast most of the north china and southwest china pams had high wre values and lower wrp values and the northwest pams had the lowest agricultural water use efficiency from the perspectives of the effective use rate and the production ability in general the spatial performance of the wre and wrp is not always consistent and it may be difficult to develop comprehensive strategies for improving the water resource utilization efficiency based on a single indicator 6 discussion the aim of quantitatively accounting for the relationship between agricultural production and water resources is to provide a basis for the formulation of agricultural water management strategies the purpose of this study is to combine the concepts of the agricultural water footprint and water movement into a framework for water exploitation calculations to comprehensively quantify the utilization and impact of agricultural production on water resources to discuss the necessity of our hybrid framework and its difference from previous methods the wru crop water footprint cwf and crop water use cwu are compared and analyzed here as shown in fig 7 the annual average values of both cwf wru and cwu wru are 0 817 indicating that the water resource requirement of agricultural production can be underestimated by approximately 20 from the perspective of the water footprint and water use fig 7 shows that the higher the wru per unit area the smaller the proportion of cwf in the wru at the provincial scale in other words the large wru in some pams may be due to the great water loss during the irrigation process in fact when evaluating water resource utilization from the perspective of cwf its activity in water resources management in the agricultural production process could be limited due to the neglect of irrigation facilities and the irrigation water transportation process improving irrigation facilities and the irrigation efficiency has always been an important direction of agricultural water saving irrigation district managers will lose the main motivation of water saving if the iwl is not considered in the total agricultural water resource requirement the difference of the cwf lies in the calculation of the gwf compared to the cwu agricultural nonpoint source pollution is the main cause of regional environmental problems the gwf is a quantitative indicator of the impact of agricultural production on the water environment and has been widely accepted as a meaningful measure agricultural producers will not be able to evaluate the extent of agricultural nonpoint source pollution intuitively and actively improve agronomic technology if the gwf is neglected in the wru the cwu wru in southern china was approximately 0 795 which is lower than the 0 830 in northern china this indicated that the issue of the crop gwf and agricultural nonpoint source pollution should be considered in the efficient and sustainable utilization of regional water resources in humid areas in fact the evaluation method of agricultural water use and efficiency has been in the process of exploration and development due to the complexity of agricultural production and the water use process in the current study the establishment of the water resource utilization efficiency and productivity index based on the calculation of the wru has a theoretical basis and practical significance to further discuss this point comparisons of the wrp and the wre with existing indicators are shown in fig 8 because the crop yield was fixed and the water input varied changes in the water productivity value are inevitable fig 8 shows that the wrp has a good linear correlation with the selected wp indicators with the determinant coefficients reaching 0 9485 and 0 9408 respectively in other words the spatial distribution pattern of the wp is consistent with the existing indices when the wru is used as the water resources input item this is in line with the spatial distribution characteristics of the water productivity indicators previous studies have shown that the spatial distribution pattern of different wp indices is consistent cao et al 2015a which is determined by crop yields and water consumption characteristics the wrp in the hybrid framework proposed in the current paper also conforms to the characteristic that the wp index is conducive to the evaluation of the relative size among regions in other words using the wru as the water input item to evaluate the water resource production ability can not only fully calculate the utilization of water resources but also maintain the general nature of the wp indicators which is progress in this field improving the wp is an effective measure to improve the water use efficiency however the crop yield per unit area cannot be increased indefinitely and increasing the crop yield cannot guarantee a reduction of the regional total water resource utilization therefore reducing the input of ineffective water resources that is improving the effective utilization of water resources is a direct way to improve the efficiency of water resource utilization the effective water resource utilization evaluation index reveals the potential and direction of water saving it is found that there is no linear correlation between the wre in the hybrid framework and the existing indicators fig 8c and d previous indicators cannot reveal the spatial pattern of the wru effective consumption rate in other words locations with the potential to reduce the impact of agricultural production on water resources quantity and environment cannot be determined by using the ie or ge a synthesized framework for the relationship between crop production and water resource measurement is proposed in this paper based on the latest progress in the agricultural water resource utilization and efficiency evaluation the wru wre and wrp indicators can comprehensively explain the water resource utilization effective utilization rate and output capacity under this framework the water use efficiency cannot be compared independently in view of the functions of the three indicators and their spatial distribution pattern for each crop figs 4 and 6 the three indicators should be combined to evaluate the water use efficiency therefore the hybrid framework proposed in this paper is a new and independent index system in the field of agricultural water use efficiency assessments and can be used as a tool in the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources in the future it should be pointed out that it is difficult to accurately calculate the components of agricultural water requirements on a large scale due to the complexity of farmland water and fertilizer transport at the same time the demand of different crops for agricultural facilities and water management is not entirely consistent and a unified calculation method may lead to deviations in results for example pollutants in paddy fields tend to migrate with drainage xinchun et al 2018 i e the concentration of pollutants in drainage will be lower than the hypothesized value of gwf calculations which may overestimate the crop gwf and wre combining the hybrid framework in this paper with more precise methods or tools such as field observations is the future development direction of agricultural water utilization and efficiency evaluation 7 conclusion this study proposes a hybrid assessment framework for agricultural utilization use and efficiency evaluation the framework differs from the previous method in that it comprehensively considers the effect on water resources and the environment in agricultural production processes and the characteristics of farmland water conservancy facilities and water conservation needs we recommend using the wru wre and wrp to measure the total exploitation the effective utilization rate and the production capacity or water resources respectively agricultural water and its efficiency indicators in this framework were accounted for and analyzed by taking cereal cultivation in china as a case study we found that there were differences in the indicators among wheat rice and maize this paper also demonstrates the reliability and necessity of the hybrid evaluation framework by comparing it with the traditional water resource utilization efficiency evaluation indicators the agricultural production process should be more comprehensively reflected is the direction of agricultural water use and its efficiency evaluation and the hybrid framework proposed in the current paper is an attempt because the agricultural production process involves both natural and artificial double interference to water resources the accurate evaluation of the wru and its efficiency on a large scale is an important issue and it is a major area for improvement in the methods and

10721,a higher drought risk in java island is generally known than the other regions in indonesia tracking soil moisture can be an alternative way to monitor drought rather than precipitation based drought indices the objective of this study was to assess root zone water storage defined by root zone soil moisture contents based on a linked approach between the generalized complementary relationship gcr and a single bucket model in java island since it does not require precipitation for estimating actual evapotranspiration eta the gcr allowed implementation of a simple single bucket model the eta and root zone soil moisture estimated in this study were compared against the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam and the root zone water storage additionally compared with the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 reanalysis data products overall the gcr eta estimates were higher than those from gleam and similar patterns of the root zone water storage were found in the comparisons of both gleam and era5 the comparative evaluation suggests a further study on the adjustment of priestley taylor coefficient value in java for better application of the gcr the soil moisture estimated by the single bucket model and the root zone soil moisture products of gleam were highly correlated 0 8 or greater pearson correlation coefficients low root zone water storage and high eta rates were found in eastern java relative to the other areas indicating high water shortage risks in dry season this study found that el niño clearly contributed to the

systems inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 actual evapotranspiration eta estimation fig 3 shows the monthly precipitation and estimated eta by the gcr method for the period 1984 2017 over java island the monthly mean precipitation showed a typical pattern of the region a classified by aldrian and dwi susanto 2003 while the monthly precipitation over java island largely varied with the range of 40 319 4 mm month 1 the range of the monthly estimated eta was relatively small 111 6 142 1 mm month 1 the variation of the monthly estimated eta was a typical radiation pattern of equatorial regions these results indicate that java island is usually under energy limited conditions rather than water limited ones even though the monthly mean precipitation decreased from june to august the monthly estimated eta slightly increased over the three month one possible reason could be that the soil moisture memory lasts weeks to months mahanama and koster 2003 the spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation over java island is presented in fig 4 a the highest annual precipitation was found in the south of central java island with around 2582 mm year 1 whereas the smallest annual precipitation in eastern java island with around 1536 mm year 1 the spatial pattern of annual precipitation over java tended to decline in an eastward direction this agrees with takama et al 2015takama et al 2015 reporting that a shorter wet season happen in eastern java november to april whereas western and central java usually have longer wet seasons october to may fig 4b displays the distribution of the mean annual gcr eta the highest annual eta was found in the coastline especially in eastern java island with around 1712 mm year 1 while the smallest annual eta occurred in the central part of java island with around 1367 mm year 1 fig 4c displays the ratio of eta estimated by the gcr method to eta from gleam overall the eta estimated by the gcr method was higher than the eta from gleam aschonitis et al 2015 argued that the α value could change across seasons with variations of solar radiation and air temperature however the fixed value of 1 26 was used for this study this can be an error source for the estimation by the gcr method a further study on how the α value could be determined across land surfaces over java island for each season is recommended however the gcr eta estimates could be deemed acceptable based on the validation in kim et al 2019 in which α 1 26 and the same rn estimation methods were used they showed that the gcr method could be even more reliable than interpolated flux observations and sophisticated land surface model products the distribution of ratios between annual eta and precipitation presented in fig 4d shows that eta could be considerably water limited in eastern java providing an indication that the land atmospheric feedback mechanism underpinning the gcr could exist at least a half of the island 3 2 estimation of the root zone water storage smax and kl values calibrated against the gleam root zone soil moisture are displayed in fig 5 overall the pearson correlation coefficient r values were around 0 9 with the highest value of 0 95 in the south of central java high pearson r values were found with the era5 reanalysis data which are independent of the modeled soil moisture but a slightly larger range those high correlations imply that the single bucket model linked from the gcr seems to acceptably perform in java despite its simplicity the actual evapotranspiration is one of the most important components for the estimation of the root zone water storage by the proposed approach in this study the gcr method has been validated over the world kim et al 2019 ma et al 2019 these studies showed that the gcr method can accurately provide evapotranspiration in a wide range of soil moisture availabilities i e both water and energy limited regions this led us to believe that the proposed approach can be applied to various soil moisture availabilities however the proposed approach should be replicated in the other regions fig 5c shows the calibrated kl values in java the greater kl value indicates the higher discharge capability of the root zone relatively higher kl values were found in the central part and the northeastern edge of the island due to more rapid soil responses to precipitation those regions could be flood prone the high water storage capacity smax were in the south of central java around 525 mm and the lowest value was in eastern java around 214 mm this indicates that the high eta to precipitation ratios in eastern java fig 4d and the relatively small storage capacity fig 5d could result in rapid depletion of soil moisture when a drying condition persists implying a high risk of water shortage in the eastern part of the island in dry season the root zone water storage in the period 1984 2017 was compared with the monthly precipitation and the result is presented in fig 6 the two patterns appear to have two to three months shift from january to july and approximately one month shift from august this is different from the changes of monthly precipitation and eta changes shown in fig 3 a similar reduction in the monthly precipitation from january to february would be followed by a reduction in the root zone water storage from april to may and this rate of decrease lasted until july the lowest monthly precipitation occurred in august while the lowest root zone water storage was found in september these results indicate that the root zone water storage from february to april may be close to the smax the root zone water storage was used to develop a drought assessment first the monthly mean root zone water storage anomalies for each grid cell was calculated by subtracting monthly mean root zone water storage of the whole study period 1984 2017 in a corresponding grid cell from the monthly mean root zone water storage in each grid cell respectively and we then estimated the drought area in each month assumed as grid cells less than the 10th percentile of the monthly mean root zone water storage anomalies for each grid cell finally the years when the drought areas were larger than 90 of the total island area were compared with the observed drought years 1986 1987 1991 1992 1994 1995 1997 1998 and 2015 2016 based on the available references lestari et al 2018 kishore et al 2000 the estimated drought years by the proposed approach well identified those drought years fig 7 these results suggest that the proposed approach can be useful for a monitoring and early warning system for drought we investigated the influence of el niño southern oscillation enso on the root zone water storage variability for the period 1984 2017 monthly niño 3 4 anomaly indices ersstv5 1981 2010 base period were collected from the climate prediction center https www cpc ncep noaa gov data indices for the period 1984 2017 wet and dry seasons were defined as december to february djf and january to september jas respectively based on the monthly precipitation the scatter plots of the root zone water storage anomalies versus niño 3 4 anomaly indices for each season are presented in fig 8 the correlations between the root zone water storage anomalies and niño 3 4 anomaly indices were 0 54 and 0 48 for the wet season djf and the dry season jas respectively the correlation for the wet season was higher than that for the dry season this result implies that because el niño is generally peak in the wet season the el niño influence on the root zone water storage could be stronger in the wet season than in the dry season a lag correlation analysis with a seasonal scale of the mean root zone water storage anomalies and the mean niño 3 4 anomalies was performed to investigate any time lags between el niño and the root zone water storage the results showed that the highest correlation was found at a lag of two months in the wet season djf while no improvement found in the dry season jas the lagged correlation was 0 56 for the wet season and slightly improved 0 54 for no lag correlation coefficient due to the somewhat small increase in the correlation coefficient it may be hard to determine whether any lags exist between the root zone water storage anomalies and niño 3 4 anomalies a further study is recommended to address this issue a linear relationship in the wet season seems to be present over the entire range of niño 3 4 anomaly indices for this study while a relatively weaker relationship between the root zone water storage and niño 3 4 anomaly index in the dry season was found fig 8 especially a linear relationship between nino 3 4 and the anomaly was not discernable in the dry season for indices less than 0 resulting in an overall weaker relationship compared to the wet season one possible reason could be that indonesia is a region clearly influenced by indian ocean dipole iod as well as el niño nur utami and hidayat 2016 however an influence by iod on the root zone water storage was not addressed in this study a further study on the influence of iod is recommended 4 conclusions this study attempted to assess eta from the generalized complementary relationship gcr and the root zone water storage based on a single bucket model with eta from gcr in java the variation of the monthly eta estimated by the gcr method was much smaller than that of the monthly precipitation suggesting that that java island may be an energy limited region a single bucket model was used to estimate monthly root zone water storage in java these results were compared with the era5 reanalysis soil moisture data the results showed that the root zone water storage and the era5 root zone soil moisture in java were highly correlated the correlations were greater than 0 8 lower maximum water storage values and higher ratios of eta to precipitation in eastern java imply that the eastern part of the island could have a high risk of water shortage in a dry season this study found that enso clearly contributed to the variability of the root zone water storage in java especially in the wet season djf we concluded that this study can be useful to operationally provide detailed soil water availability with meteorological variables which are generally available

10721,a higher drought risk in java island is generally known than the other regions in indonesia tracking soil moisture can be an alternative way to monitor drought rather than precipitation based drought indices the objective of this study was to assess root zone water storage defined by root zone soil moisture contents based on a linked approach between the generalized complementary relationship gcr and a single bucket model in java island since it does not require precipitation for estimating actual evapotranspiration eta the gcr allowed implementation of a simple single bucket model the eta and root zone soil moisture estimated in this study were compared against the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam and the root zone water storage additionally compared with the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 reanalysis data products overall the gcr eta estimates were higher than those from gleam and similar patterns of the root zone water storage were found in the comparisons of both gleam and era5 the comparative evaluation suggests a further study on the adjustment of priestley taylor coefficient value in java for better application of the gcr the soil moisture estimated by the single bucket model and the root zone soil moisture products of gleam were highly correlated 0 8 or greater pearson correlation coefficients low root zone water storage and high eta rates were found in eastern java relative to the other areas indicating high water shortage risks in dry season this study found that el niño clearly contributed to the

the monthly mean precipitation showed a typical pattern of the region a classified by aldrian and dwi susanto 2003 while the monthly precipitation over java island largely varied with the range of 40 319 4 mm month 1 the range of the monthly estimated eta was relatively small 111 6 142 1 mm month 1 the variation of the monthly estimated eta was a typical radiation pattern of equatorial regions these results indicate that java island is usually under energy limited conditions rather than water limited ones even though the monthly mean precipitation decreased from june to august the monthly estimated eta slightly increased over the three month one possible reason could be that the soil moisture memory lasts weeks to months mahanama and koster 2003 the spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation over java island is presented in fig 4 a the highest annual precipitation was found in the south of central java island with around 2582 mm year 1 whereas the smallest annual precipitation in eastern java island with around 1536 mm year 1 the spatial pattern of annual precipitation over java tended to decline in an eastward direction this agrees with takama et al 2015takama et al 2015 reporting that a shorter wet season happen in eastern java november to april whereas western and central java usually have longer wet seasons october to may fig 4b displays the distribution of the mean annual gcr eta the highest annual eta was found in the coastline especially in eastern java island with around 1712 mm year 1 while the smallest annual eta occurred in the central part of java island with around 1367 mm year 1 fig 4c displays the ratio of eta estimated by the gcr method to eta from gleam overall the eta estimated by the gcr method was higher than the eta from gleam aschonitis et al 2015 argued that the α value could change across seasons with variations of solar radiation and air temperature however the fixed value of 1 26 was used for this study this can be an error source for the estimation by the gcr method a further study on how the α value could be determined across land surfaces over java island for each season is recommended however the gcr eta estimates could be deemed acceptable based on the validation in kim et al 2019 in which α 1 26 and the same rn estimation methods were used they showed that the gcr method could be even more reliable than interpolated flux observations and sophisticated land surface model products the distribution of ratios between annual eta and precipitation presented in fig 4d shows that eta could be considerably water limited in eastern java providing an indication that the land atmospheric feedback mechanism underpinning the gcr could exist at least a half of the island 3 2 estimation of the root zone water storage smax and kl values calibrated against the gleam root zone soil moisture are displayed in fig 5 overall the pearson correlation coefficient r values were around 0 9 with the highest value of 0 95 in the south of central java high pearson r values were found with the era5 reanalysis data which are independent of the modeled soil moisture but a slightly larger range those high correlations imply that the single bucket model linked from the gcr seems to acceptably perform in java despite its simplicity the actual evapotranspiration is one of the most important components for the estimation of the root zone water storage by the proposed approach in this study the gcr method has been validated over the world kim et al 2019 ma et al 2019 these studies showed that the gcr method can accurately provide evapotranspiration in a wide range of soil moisture availabilities i e both water and energy limited regions this led us to believe that the proposed approach can be applied to various soil moisture availabilities however the proposed approach should be replicated in the other regions fig 5c shows the calibrated kl values in java the greater kl value indicates the higher discharge capability of the root zone relatively higher kl values were found in the central part and the northeastern edge of the island due to more rapid soil responses to precipitation those regions could be flood prone the high water storage capacity smax were in the south of central java around 525 mm and the lowest value was in eastern java around 214 mm this indicates that the high eta to precipitation ratios in eastern java fig 4d and the relatively small storage capacity fig 5d could result in rapid depletion of soil moisture when a drying condition persists implying a high risk of water shortage in the eastern part of the island in dry season the root zone water storage in the period 1984 2017 was compared with the monthly precipitation and the result is presented in fig 6 the two patterns appear to have two to three months shift from january to july and approximately one month shift from august this is different from the changes of monthly precipitation and eta changes shown in fig 3 a similar reduction in the monthly precipitation from january to february would be followed by a reduction in the root zone water storage from april to may and this rate of decrease lasted until july the lowest monthly precipitation occurred in august while the lowest root zone water storage was found in september these results indicate that the root zone water storage from february to april may be close to the smax the root zone water storage was used to develop a drought assessment first the monthly mean root zone water storage anomalies for each grid cell was calculated by subtracting monthly mean root zone water storage of the whole study period 1984 2017 in a corresponding grid cell from the monthly mean root zone water storage in each grid cell respectively and we then estimated the drought area in each month assumed as grid cells less than the 10th percentile of the monthly mean root zone water storage anomalies for each grid cell finally the years when the drought areas were larger than 90 of the total island area were compared with the observed drought years 1986 1987 1991 1992 1994 1995 1997 1998 and 2015 2016 based on the available references lestari et al 2018 kishore et al 2000 the estimated drought years by the proposed approach well identified those drought years fig 7 these results suggest that the proposed approach can be useful for a monitoring and early warning system for drought we investigated the influence of el niño southern oscillation enso on the root zone water storage variability for the period 1984 2017 monthly niño 3 4 anomaly indices ersstv5 1981 2010 base period were collected from the climate prediction center https www cpc ncep noaa gov data indices for the period 1984 2017 wet and dry seasons were defined as december to february djf and january to september jas respectively based on the monthly precipitation the scatter plots of the root zone water storage anomalies versus niño 3 4 anomaly indices for each season are presented in fig 8 the correlations between the root zone water storage anomalies and niño 3 4 anomaly indices were 0 54 and 0 48 for the wet season djf and the dry season jas respectively the correlation for the wet season was higher than that for the dry season this result implies that because el niño is generally peak in the wet season the el niño influence on the root zone water storage could be stronger in the wet season than in the dry season a lag correlation analysis with a seasonal scale of the mean root zone water storage anomalies and the mean niño 3 4 anomalies was performed to investigate any time lags between el niño and the root zone water storage the results showed that the highest correlation was found at a lag of two months in the wet season djf while no improvement found in the dry season jas the lagged correlation was 0 56 for the wet season and slightly improved 0 54 for no lag correlation coefficient due to the somewhat small increase in the correlation coefficient it may be hard to determine whether any lags exist between the root zone water storage anomalies and niño 3 4 anomalies a further study is recommended to address this issue a linear relationship in the wet season seems to be present over the entire range of niño 3 4 anomaly indices for this study while a relatively weaker relationship between the root zone water storage and niño 3 4 anomaly index in the dry season was found fig 8 especially a linear relationship between nino 3 4 and the anomaly was not discernable in the dry season for indices less than 0 resulting in an overall weaker relationship compared to the wet season one possible reason could be that indonesia is a region clearly influenced by indian ocean dipole iod as well as el niño nur utami and hidayat 2016 however an influence by iod on the root zone water storage was not addressed in this study a further study on the influence of iod is recommended 4 conclusions this study attempted to assess eta from the generalized complementary relationship gcr and the root zone water storage based on a single bucket model with eta from gcr in java the variation of the monthly eta estimated by the gcr method was much smaller than that of the monthly precipitation suggesting that that java island may be an energy limited region a single bucket model was used to estimate monthly root zone water storage in java these results were compared with the era5 reanalysis soil moisture data the results showed that the root zone water storage and the era5 root zone soil moisture in java were highly correlated the correlations were greater than 0 8 lower maximum water storage values and higher ratios of eta to precipitation in eastern java imply that the eastern part of the island could have a high risk of water shortage in a dry season this study found that enso clearly contributed to the variability of the root zone water storage in java especially in the wet season djf we concluded that this study can be useful to operationally provide detailed soil water availability with meteorological variables which are generally available

10722,aquaculture effluent irrigation has been widely adopted to replace freshwater irrigation to save water and providing additional fertilizer to the crop there is limited information on the performance of fertilizer supply levels under fishpond effluent irrigation the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of reducing a rate of fertilizer on the purification of wastewater from fishponds by paddy fields and the yield of rice under fishpond effluent irrigation in central china in 2015 the treatments included 100 80 and 60 of the normal fertilizer rate nfr 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 75 kg k2o ha 1 with fishpond freshwater pond aquaculture effluent as an irrigation source designated nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e respectively with an additional nfr with freshwater as an irrigation source nfr f the results showed that 5700 m3 ha 1 freshwater was saved by the use of the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphorus dp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and particulate phosphorus pp in the surface water and seepage water of the paddy field and the residual soil n and p in the 0 60 cm soil depth after the rice harvest decreased with the decreasing nfr the removal rates of the tn in the surface water across the tillering booting heading and filling stages were 25 1 38 9 and 50 5 on average for the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments respectively the corresponding removal rates of the tp were 56 4 71 2 and 76 2 respectively these increased removal efficiencies were related to the lower n and p concentrations in the surface water of the paddy field and the efficient use of nutrients by rice under the reduced fertilization treatments compared to the nfr f treatment the 0 8nfr e treatment resulted in a comparable accumulation of n and p and grain yield of rice while decreasing the contents of n and p in the water of paddy fields and the residual soil n and p in the 0 60 cm soil depth after the rice harvest thus reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 could improve the water quality of the paddy field without deleterious effects on the rice yield and save 5700 m3 ha 1 of fresh water under fishpond effluent irrigation these results can also provide a basis for in depth understanding of the mechanism of aquaculture effluent purification through paddy field ecosystem in response to fertilizer supply levels keywords fishpond effluent paddy w ater nutrient harvest index nutrient removal rates grain yield 1 introduction the use of freshwater pond aquaculture has grown greatly worldwide the productivity of freshwater pond aquaculture in china was 4 17 megatons in 1990 and it reached 20 08 megatons in 2006 an increase of almost five fold cafm 2006 however pond aquaculture has also produced a lot of effluent which resulted in serious environmental problems untreated effluent discharged from pond aquaculture operations often resulted in the eutrophication of the waters that received it naylor et al 2002 mcintosh and fitzsimmons 2003 to combat effluent pollution the united states environmental protection agency epa began the process of gathering data from the aquaculture industry on february 2000 and released a proposed ruling concerning aquaculture effluent on september 2002 epa 2002 mcintosh and fitzsimmons 2003 it has been proven that aquaculture effluent could be purified using approaches such as pond based recirculating systems feng et al 2014 constructed wetlands sindilariu et al 2009 liu et al 2014 water discharge reduction lin et al 2001 particle removal via sedimentation and bivalves jones et al 2001 and improve aquaculture feed and feeding practices froehlich et al 2018 however none of these solutions provide an additional use for the effluent water mcintosh and fitzsimmons 2003 moreover these approaches may not be adopted by most fish farms because of the expensive facility inputs or a failure to provide additional economic returns castro et al 2006 li et al 2001 thus it is desirable to explore an appropriate way to manage the effluent that is highly efficient and inexpensive integrating aquaculture into agriculture appears to be a potential solution the influence of the integrated farms on already scarce freshwater resources ingram et al 2000 and their dependence on expensive chemical fertilizers can be decreased fernando and halwart 2000 resulting in improved economic return per unit of water mcintosh and fitzsimmons 2003 following substantial research and practice freshwater aquaculture effluent is utilized to irrigate several crops such as cherry tomatoes castro et al 2006 wheat lin and yang 2003 and cowpeas vigna unguiculata azevedo et al 2002 moreover the water quality of the effluent is obviously improved by the crops because a significant fraction of nutrients from the effluent are taken up by the crops wang et al 2011 therefore using aquaculture effluent as an irrigation source is of substantial importance for both environmental and economic benefits which has produced strong interest over the previous decades numerous studies have shown that the accumulation of soil nitrogen n and phosphorus p caused by the excessive application of fertilizers are the primary causes for the nutrient loss by surface runoff or seepage in many agricultural areas li et al 2008 ju et al 2009 chirinda et al 2010 moreover earlier studies have shown that the efficiency of n fertilizer use of the cereal crops is only 20 40 in china jiang and cao 2002 and at least 75 more than the p applied is retained as different forms of residue in the soil shafqat and pierzynski 2013 therefore the management of soil fertility in modern agriculture is different from that of traditional agriculture it is important to ensure that the soil fertility not only meets the nutrient demands of the crop but also does not ruin the environment through excessive nutrient accumulation in the soil ju et al 2009 thus appropriately reducing fertilizer inputs should be an effective way to improve the water quality of paddy fields and their surroundings a shortage of water resources is a serious problem in china and its spatial and temporal distribution is extremely uneven dou 2018 moreover the rice planting system accounts for 45 50 of the total water consumption in china yao et al 2015 in addition intensive breeding technology models that utilize high density and a high input of bait are very popular in chinese pond farming an earlier report has shown that 70 80 of the feed input discharged into water bodies in the form of dissolved matter and particulate matter and approximately 51 of n and 64 of p in the feed will eventually turn into the waste liu et al 2002 thus the water shortage in rice planting and the water waste in fish breeding are simultaneous problems in addition lin and yang 2003 illustrated that the requirements of mineral nutrients by rice growth can be completely replaced by the effluent from hybrid catfish ponds however wang et al 2011 studied the efficiency of rice fields at treating pond aquaculture effluent and its responses to different fertilizer treatments mineral fertilizer and potassium chloride and found that paddy fields can purify pond aquaculture effluent efficiently without compromising the rice yield when supplied with a certain rate of mineral fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 0 6 0 5 0 8 the reason behind this contradiction remains unclear and the amount of mineral fertilizer that can be saved without compromising crop yield if aquaculture effluent is used as an irrigation source remains largely unknown the jianghan plain of china is rich with water and soil resources and therefore is suitable for rice planting and aquaculture breeding whereas rice planting and fish breeding have faced many contradictions such as unexpected seasonal drought and increasing no point pollution in this region in previous years wu et al 2008 yao et al 2015 moreover the average rates of application of n and p have now increased to 200 360 kg n ha 1 and 140 200 kg p2o5 ha 1 owing to the fertilization practices of farmers in intensive rice cropping systems in the jianghan plain liu et al 2019 which 80 170 higher the recommended fertilizer rate based on site specific nutrient management dobermann et al 2002 liu et al 2009 large amounts of external n inputs and the unscientific use of fertilizers have contributed to low n and p use efficiency resulting in serious soil degradation eutrophication groundwater pollution and the emission of ammonia and greenhouse gases ju et al 2009 spiertz 2010 ye et al 2013 wang et al 2018 in addition based on the constitution of national scientific and technological innovation alliance for fertilizer reduction and its high efficient use sponsored by the government of china stakeholders are striving to achieve zero growth and gradually reduce fertilizer consumption for the primary crops by 2020 however to the best of our knowledge little information is available on the combined effects of reducing fertilizer inputs and aquaculture effluent irrigation on the removal of n and p by paddy fields as well as their effects on the yield of rice the objectives of this study were to investigate the surface and seepage water quality of paddy fields during the rice growing season and the yield of rice in response to reduced fertilizer rates under fishpond effluent irrigation we hypothesized that with fewer fertilizer inputs the paddy fields could more effectively remove the nutrients from fishpond effluent consequently the fertilizer inputs for rice production could be significantly reduced without deleterious effects on crop yields 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental plot was located in the farm of taihu lake jingzhou city in hubei province central china 29 41 25 2 n 112 39 40 8 e which is

included 100 80 and 60 of the normal fertilizer rate nfr with effluent from a fishpond freshwater pond aquaculture as an irrigation source designated nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e respectively with an additional nfr using freshwater as an irrigation source nfr f the nfr with 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 75 kg k2o ha 1 was determined based on the local farming practices fertilizer applications were split over two developmental stages of the rice crop ye et al 2013 basal on before transplant on june 26 2015 and the tillering on july 15 2015 the size of the rice field used in this experiment was 0 67 ha 133 m 50 m the experimental field was divided into 12 plots on average each plot had an area of 320 m2 40 m 8 m the exact amount of nutrient input for each treatment is shown in table 2 2 3 experimental management a fishpond was located northwest of the paddy field with a total area of 2000 m2 the fish that were raised were primarily composed of approximately 1000 kg black grass silver and bighead carp in total the fish were fed at approximately 8 00 am each day the feed was primarily composed of chicken and pig manure and wheat weeds and crop straw that had been fermented a total of 20 kg of feed was used at each feeding the circumference of each plot was isolated by double layer plastic sheeting placed in backfilled trenches to a depth of 0 5 m to form a barrier the experimental rice used was late rice oryza sativa l variety jingchuyou148 the rice was sown on june 1 2015 the 4 week old seedings were artificially transplanted on june 30 2015 with a planting space of 25 cm 30 cm the panicles were initiated on august 24 2015 and harvested on october 22 2015 the whole growth period was 142 d in all the treatments disease weeds and pests were well controlled in each treatment the fishpond was connected to the rice field by water pipes and pumps and the effluent from the fishpond was pumped to irrigate the wastewater the rice was irrigated 15 31 56 71 82 and 93 days after transplanting dat 95 mm each time the amount of irrigation water was measured with a water meter installed at the discharging end of the pipe in the freshwater irrigation the irrigated water from a reservoir in the local area yaoxin reservoir with an electrical conductivity of 251 μs cm 1 ph of 7 1 total suspended solids tss of 3 4 mg l 1 and contents of total n tn and total p tp of 0 18 mg l 1 and 0 02 mg l 1 respectively in the fishpond effluent irrigation the contents of tn and tp in the fishpond effluent were 2 80 3 40 mg l 1 and 0 2 0 3 mg l 1 respectively the effluent had an electrical conductivity of 401 446 μs cm 1 a ph of 7 1 8 2 a chemical oxygen demand cod of 7 5 10 1 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen do of 3 3 5 0 mg l 1 and tss of 78 2 82 5 mg l 1 the contents of tn and tp in the aquaculture effluent in the local area were 2 50 4 00 mg l 1 and 0 18 0 35 mg l 1 respectively zhao and zeng 2012 thus the concentrations of n and p in the effluent used in this study are representative 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 water quality and soil nutrients the surface water and leakage water samples were sampled at the tillering booting heading and filling stages of rice at 34 58 73 and 95 dat respectively the concentrations of n and p in the different forms were determined immediately after sampling a 500 ml plastic bottle was used to collect water samples along the long side of the plot at 0 m at the water inlet and at 10 20 30 and 40 m at the water outlet the soil seepage solution was collected at the clay head which was pressed into 30 cm in the soil depth to collect seepage water samples at 10 20 and 30 m along the long side of the plot soil samples were collected after the rice harvest on october 23 2015 using a stainless auger the s shaped 5 point collection method was used for the sampling the samples were collected from 0 to 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil depths in each plot the root debris and soil samples were sieved and stored as described by si et al 2018 briefly the plant root remnants and rocks were removed and the samples were passed through a 0 85 mm sieve and stored at 4 c to determine the relevant indices the water quality parameters determined included the following tp tn dissolved phosphorus dp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and particulate phosphorus pp the tn concentration was determined with a unico uv 2800 spectrophotometer after digestion using potassium peroxodisulfate the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and the tp in the water samples were analyzed by the indophenol blue disulfonic acid phenol and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric methods using a uv 2800 spectrophotometer sepa 2002 the dp was determined using colorimetry as described by murphy and riley 1962 the pp was calculated as the difference between the tp and dp soil nutrient parameters that were monitored included the following tn tp and available n and p the tn was determined by the semi micro kjeldahl method and the tp was determined colorimetrically after wet digestion with h2so4 hclo4 parkinson and allen 1975 the available n nh4 n no3 n was determined using a micro diffusion technique after alkaline hydrolysis conway 1978 the available p was determined using the olsen method emteryd 1989 2 4 2 nutrient uptake yield and yield components five representative plants in each plot were cut at the maturity stage harvest on october 22 2015 for the determination of the accumulation of nutrients the plants were divided into stems leaves and panicles all the plant samples were oven dried at 70 c to a constant biomass and weighed the samples were passed through a 0 15 mm sieve and then the subsamples were collected for the total determination of n and total p as described by ye et al 2013 the concentration of n in the tissues was analyzed using the semi micro kjeldahl method and the concentration of p in the tissues was analyzed using the vanadium molybdate yellow colorimetric method bao 2000 the total n uptake was calculated from the sum of the products of dry matter and n concentration of the different plant parts the total p uptake was calculated from the sum of the products of dry matter and the p concentration of the different plant parts the grain yield was measured from a 10 m2 area in the center of each plot at the maturity stage on october 22 2015 the rice was harvested and the yield component determined as described by ye et al 2013 in short the rice was harvested manually and the grains were air dried the yield components included the effective panicle number per plant spikelet number per panicle grain filling percentage and 1000 grain weight 2 5 data analysis the removal rates r of the n and p in different forms from the fishpond effluent by paddy field were calculated as follows 1 r c 0 c d c 0 100 where c 0 is an initial concentration of the n and p in the wastewater from the fishpond effluent before fishpond irrigation mg l 1 and cd is the concentration of the n and p in the surface water of paddy field after fishpond irrigation mg l 1 which was the means of the concentrations along the long side of the plot at 0 m at the water inlet and 10 20 30 and 40 m at the water outlet in the paddy field an analysis of variance anova was performed by a one way anova using spss 17 0 software the mean values among the different treatments were compared for significant differences p 0 05 using least significant difference tests 3 results 3 1 total irrigation amount there were six irrigation events 950 m3 ha 1 per time during the rice growing season for each treatment resulting in a total irrigation amount of 5700 m3 for all the treatments thus 5700 m3 of freshwater could be saved from the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments 3 2 n and p content in the surface water compared to the nfr f treatment nh4 n no3 n tn dissolved phosphorus dp particulate phosphorus pp and tp contents in the surface water at the tillering booting heading and filling stages were comparable in the nfr e treatment with the exception of no3 n at the tillering stage and dp at the booting stage table 3 the 0 8nfr e treatment decreased the no3 n content at the tillering stage by 21 8 the tn content at the booting stage by 9 4 and the no3 n and tp contents at the filling stage by 14 9 and 37 1 respectively the slight increase in the n and p measured were also observed for the 0 8nfr e treatment however the 0 6nfr e treatment decreased the nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp contents at the four growth stages with the exception of the content of no3 n at the heading stage table 3 across the four growth stages the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments decreased the tn content by 14 6 and 23 4 on average respectively and decreased the tp content on average by 22 3 and 35 5 respectively in comparison with the nfr f treatment 3 3 n and p removal by the paddy fields the removal rate of nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp in the effluent from fishpond by the paddy field at the tillering booting heading and filling stages increased as the nfr decreased the removal rate was the greatest for no3 n followed by nh4 n tn or pp dp and tp at the four growth stages the removal rates of the nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp were the greatest at the tillering stage followed by the booting filling and heading stages table 4 across the four growth stages the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments resulted in the following average removal rates nh4 n 34 3 42 5 and 54 0 respectively no3 n 74 3 79 0 and 83 0 respectively tn 25 1 38 9 and 50 5 respectively dp 44 9 61 6 and 72 3 respectively pp 60 1 73 1 and 76 0 respectively and tp 56 4 71 2 and 76 2 respectively these results suggest that the efficiency of the removal of tn and tp in the effluent by the paddy field increased with the decrease in the normal fertilizer rate 3 4 n and p contents in the seepage water compared to the nfr f treatment the nfr e treatment increased the nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp contents in the seepage water at the tillering booting heading and filling stages although most of the differences did not reach a significant level however the nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp content were decreased by the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments table 5 the tn and tp contents at the four growth stages were significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment than in the nfr f treatment table 5 across the four growth stages the 0 8nfr e and 0 6 nfr e treatments decreased the tn content by 18 3 and 27 5 respectively and decreased the tp content by 23 1 and 45 8 on average respectively in comparison with the nfr f treatment 3 5 grain yield and yield components the effective panicle numbers per plant and 100 grain weight were comparable among the different treatments compared with the nfr f treatment spikelet number grain filling percentage and grain yield were comparable in the nfr e and 0 8nfr e treatments while these values were significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment table 6 this suggests that reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 did not compromise the yield of rice under fishpond effluent irrigation 3 6 n and p accumulation in rice n harvest index nhi and p harvest index phi the accumulation of n and p in the leaves and the accumulation of n in the stems at the maturity stage were comparable among the different treatments however the accumulation of p in the stems and panicles was significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment than in the other treatments table 7 the nfr e treatment produced the greatest accumulation of n in the panicles among the four treatments table 7 compared with the nfr f treatment the accumulation of n and p in the shoot the n harvest index nhi ratio of panicles n to total n accumulation in rice and the p harvest index phi ratio of panicles p to total p accumulation in rice were comparable in the nfr e and 0 8nfr e treatments while these values were significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment 3 7 residual soil n and p in the 0 60 cm soil depth the soil tn available n tp and available p contents after the rice harvest in all the treatments decreased with the deepening of soil depth the nfr e treatment generated the greatest tn available n tp and available p contents in the each soil depth fig 1 the soil available n in the 0 20 cm soil depth soil tn content in the 40 60 cm soil depth and soil available p content in the 20 40 cm soil depth were significantly greater in the nfr f and nfr e treatments than those in the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments fig 1a b and d compared with the nfr f treatment the soil tn and available n contents in the 20 40 cm soil depth soil tp and available p contents in the 0 20 cm soil depth and the soil available p content in the 40 60 cm soil depth were significantly greater in the nfr e treatment while these values were smaller in the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments fig 1a d the soil tp content in the 20 60 cm soil depths was significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment compared with the other treatments fig 1c 4 discussion 4 1 water quality of the paddy field the paddy field ecosystem is an important artificial wetland which not only mediates important grain production functions but also plays a unique role in purifying water quality wang et al 2011 liu et al 2019 the previous work showed that after aquaculture pond effluent water was restored by the paddy field the tn and tp contents in the effluent decreased by 66 0 69 3 and 41 4 42 5 chen 2009 consistently in this study the removal rates of tn in the effluent from fishponds across the tillering booting heading and filling stages by the paddy field were 25 1 38 9 and 50 5 on average for the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments respectively the corresponding removal rates of tp were 56 4 71 2 and 76 2 respectively these indicate that the 0 8nrf e and 0 6nrf e treatments performed better on the removal of tn and tp compared to the nfr e treatment in addition an earlier study demonstrated that the rice crop removed 32 of tn and 24 of tp from hybrid catfish pond effluent lin and yang 2003 in which the removal efficiencies of n and p were lower compared to those in the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments the enhanced nutrients removal rates may be explained as follows first reducing the fertilizer inputs resulted in a reduced concentration of n and p from the source malhi et al 2002 wang et al 2014 the relatively lower nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp contents in the surface water of paddy field under the reduced fertilizer treatments table 3 confirmed this second this was attributed to nutrients that could be better utilized by the crop under reduced fertilization treatments luo et al 2018 as indicated by the 0 8nrf e treatment which had a comparable n and p accumulation in the shoots of rice compared to the nfr f treatment table 7 our earlier work has shown that reduced fertilization treatments improve the leaf area index at the post stages of rice growth in reduced fertilization treatments under fishpond effluent irrigation zhou et al 2011 moreover appropriate n fertilizer reduction can enhance the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate of cotton and thereby delay leaf senescence and increase nitrogen use efficiency luo et al 2018 however the mechanism behind the respective contributions of input mineral nutrients and nutrients from the fishponds to nutrient requirements by the crop under reduced fertilization treatments is not clear and merits further study in this study the nh4 n and no3 n contents accounted for approximately 70 of the tn content and the dp content only accounted for approximately 30 of the tp content in the initial effluent from fishpond table 4 this is consistent with the findings of bergheim and brinker 2003 that more than 80 of the tn was nh4 n and no3 n in aquaculture effluent and that 30 84 of the tp was bound in particles moreover the removal efficiencies of the nh4 n no3 n and pp were all the highest at the tillering followed by the booting filling and heading stages table 4 since nutrient demand and the uptake rate by rice vary among the different growth stages generally the most important uptake happens at the tillering stage shimono et al 2012 in addition the original concentrations of n and p in different forms in the effluent as an irrigation source were comparable among the six irrigation events thus it is still not clear whether the removal efficiencies of n and p by the paddy field are related to the load of nutrients in the fishpond effluent and environmental factors such as light temperature and microorganisms which merit additional study before this study little information was available on the n and p dynamics in response to reducing the fertilizer rate under aquaculture effluent irrigation in this study we found that compared with the nfr f treatment both the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments decreased the contents of tn and tp in the surface and seepage water tables 3 and 5 this suggests that reducing fertilizer inputs could effectively lower the concentrations of n and p of the discharge water from paddy fields if fishpond effluent is used as an irrigation source 4 2 grain yield of rice n and p are the two essential fertilizer resources for regulating plant growth and development it has been proven that the management of water and nutrients has a substantial influence on rice yield formation ye et al 2013 in this study the accumulation of n and p in the shoots of rice at the maturity stage harvest were comparable between the nfr f and 0 8nfr e treatments table 7 suggesting that reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 could meet the nutrient requirements of rice under fishpond effluent irrigation moreover herein we observed that the nhi and phi were comparable between the nfr f and 0 8nfr e treatments table 7 based on an analysis from the perspective of physiology when a certain nutrient is deficient the rice will prioritize the transfer of the nutrient lacking to the grain to promote its differentiation and maturation whitbread et al 2003 this indicates that reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 did not induce a deficiency of n and p in rice under aquaculture effluent irrigation we also observed that the nfr e and 0 8nfr e treatments resulted in a comparable grain yield of rice while the 0 6nfr e treatment significantly decreased the grain yield compared with that of the nfr f treatment table 6 suggesting that the normal fertilizer rate of rice could be reduced by 20 without deleterious effects on yield under fishpond effluent irrigation in addition the fact that the nfr e treatment did not lead to a greater rice yield could be related to a sufficient amount of fertilizer that supplied all the nutrients needed by the plant so that irrigation with the aquaculture effluent did not influence the crop yield castro et al 2006 4 3 residual soil n and p an earlier study had shown that the long term or excessive use of sewage from livestock and poultry breeding as an irrigation source leads to a significant increase in the accumulation of n and p in the 0 40 cm soil depths of paddy fields zhang et al 2014 however in this study the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments effectively reduced the contents of tn in the 20 60 cm soil depths and tp in the 0 20 cm soil depth in the paddy soil compared with the nfr f treatment fig 1 indicating that reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 40 would not result in the accumulation of n and p in the soil profile under fishpond effluent irrigation thereby reducing the possibility of n and p leaching this contradiction may be explained by the differences in crop varieties soil types soil microorganisms nutrient load in water bodies and environmental factors such as light and temperature in addition our study primarily focused on the monitoring and evaluation of water quality and rice yield and the test was only conducted for one year therefore further research is needed to study the soil quality status of the return of long term aquaculture effluent to farmland 5 conclusions a paddy field system could effectively remove nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp from fishpond effluent and the removal efficiencies of tn and tp all increased with the decreasing normal fertilizer rate nfr at the tillering booting heading and filling stages of rice the improved removal efficiencies were attributed to the lower n and p contents in the surface water of paddy field and the efficient n and p uptake by rice under reduced fertilization treatments using fishpond effluent as an irrigation source the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp in the surface water and seepage water of the paddy field and the residual soil n and p in the 0 60 cm soil depths after the rice harvest decreased with the decrease in the nfr the n and p concentration in the fishpond effluent could meet the n and p requirement of rice and obtain a comparable grain yield with a 20 reduction in the nfr input under fishpond effluent irrigation therefore considering the yield effect of rice and the environmental risk 20 of the fertilizer input and 5700 m3 ha 1 of fresh water could be saved under aquaculture effluent irrigation during the rice growing season these results can also provide a basis for in depth understanding of the

10722,aquaculture effluent irrigation has been widely adopted to replace freshwater irrigation to save water and providing additional fertilizer to the crop there is limited information on the performance of fertilizer supply levels under fishpond effluent irrigation the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of reducing a rate of fertilizer on the purification of wastewater from fishponds by paddy fields and the yield of rice under fishpond effluent irrigation in central china in 2015 the treatments included 100 80 and 60 of the normal fertilizer rate nfr 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 75 kg k2o ha 1 with fishpond freshwater pond aquaculture effluent as an irrigation source designated nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e respectively with an additional nfr with freshwater as an irrigation source nfr f the results showed that 5700 m3 ha 1 freshwater was saved by the use of the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphorus dp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and particulate phosphorus pp in the surface water and seepage water of the paddy field and the residual soil n and p in the 0 60 cm soil depth after the rice harvest decreased with the decreasing nfr the removal rates of the tn in the surface water across the tillering booting heading and filling stages were 25 1 38 9 and 50 5 on average for the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments respectively the corresponding removal rates of the tp were 56 4 71 2 and 76 2 respectively these increased removal efficiencies were related to the lower n and p concentrations in the surface water of the paddy field and the efficient use of nutrients by rice under the reduced fertilization treatments compared to the nfr f treatment the 0 8nfr e treatment resulted in a comparable accumulation of n and p and grain yield of rice while decreasing the contents of n and p in the water of paddy fields and the residual soil n and p in the 0 60 cm soil depth after the rice harvest thus reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 could improve the water quality of the paddy field without deleterious effects on the rice yield and save 5700 m3 ha 1 of fresh water under fishpond effluent irrigation these results can also provide a basis for in depth understanding of the mechanism of aquaculture effluent purification through paddy field ecosystem in response to fertilizer supply levels keywords fishpond effluent paddy w ater nutrient harvest index nutrient removal rates grain yield 1 introduction the use of freshwater pond aquaculture has grown greatly worldwide the productivity of freshwater pond aquaculture in china was 4 17 megatons in 1990 and it reached 20 08 megatons in 2006 an increase of almost five fold cafm 2006 however pond aquaculture has also produced a lot of effluent which resulted in serious environmental problems untreated effluent discharged from pond aquaculture operations often resulted in the eutrophication of the waters that received it naylor et al 2002 mcintosh and fitzsimmons 2003 to combat effluent pollution the united states environmental protection agency epa began the process of gathering data from the aquaculture industry on february 2000 and released a proposed ruling concerning aquaculture effluent on september 2002 epa 2002 mcintosh and fitzsimmons 2003 it has been proven that aquaculture effluent could be purified using approaches such as pond based recirculating systems feng et al 2014 constructed wetlands sindilariu et al 2009 liu et al 2014 water discharge reduction lin et al 2001 particle removal via sedimentation and bivalves jones et al 2001 and improve aquaculture feed and feeding practices froehlich et al 2018 however none of these solutions provide an additional use for the effluent water mcintosh and fitzsimmons 2003 moreover these approaches may not be adopted by most fish farms because of the expensive facility inputs or a failure to provide additional economic returns castro et al 2006 li et al 2001 thus it is desirable to explore an appropriate way to manage the effluent that is highly efficient and inexpensive integrating aquaculture into agriculture appears to be a potential solution the influence of the integrated farms on already scarce freshwater resources ingram et al 2000 and their dependence on expensive chemical fertilizers can be decreased fernando and halwart 2000 resulting in improved economic return per unit of water mcintosh and fitzsimmons 2003 following substantial research and practice freshwater aquaculture effluent is utilized to irrigate several crops such as cherry tomatoes castro et al 2006 wheat lin and yang 2003 and cowpeas vigna unguiculata azevedo et al 2002 moreover the water quality of the effluent is obviously improved by the crops because a significant fraction of nutrients from the effluent are taken up by the crops wang et al 2011 therefore using aquaculture effluent as an irrigation source is of substantial importance for both environmental and economic benefits which has produced strong interest over the previous decades numerous studies have shown that the accumulation of soil nitrogen n and phosphorus p caused by the excessive application of fertilizers are the primary causes for the nutrient loss by surface runoff or seepage in many agricultural areas li et al 2008 ju et al 2009 chirinda et al 2010 moreover earlier studies have shown that the efficiency of n fertilizer use of the cereal crops is only 20 40 in china jiang and cao 2002 and at least 75 more than the p applied is retained as different forms of residue in the soil shafqat and pierzynski 2013 therefore the management of soil fertility in modern agriculture is different from that of traditional agriculture it is important to ensure that the soil fertility not only meets the nutrient demands of the crop but also does not ruin the environment through excessive nutrient accumulation in the soil ju et al 2009 thus appropriately reducing fertilizer inputs should be an effective way to improve the water quality of paddy fields and their surroundings a shortage of water resources is a serious problem in china and its spatial and temporal distribution is extremely uneven dou 2018 moreover the rice planting system accounts for 45 50 of the total water consumption in china yao et al 2015 in addition intensive breeding technology models that utilize high density and a high input of bait are very popular in chinese pond farming an earlier report has shown that 70 80 of the feed input discharged into water bodies in the form of dissolved matter and particulate matter and approximately 51 of n and 64 of p in the feed will eventually turn into the waste liu et al 2002 thus the water shortage in rice planting and the water waste in fish breeding are simultaneous problems in addition lin and yang 2003 illustrated that the requirements of mineral nutrients by rice growth can be completely replaced by the effluent from hybrid catfish ponds however wang et al 2011 studied the efficiency of rice fields at treating pond aquaculture effluent and its responses to different fertilizer treatments mineral fertilizer and potassium chloride and found that paddy fields can purify pond aquaculture effluent efficiently without compromising the rice yield when supplied with a certain rate of mineral fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 0 6 0 5 0 8 the reason behind this contradiction remains unclear and the amount of mineral fertilizer that can be saved without compromising crop yield if aquaculture effluent is used as an irrigation source remains largely unknown the jianghan plain of china is rich with water and soil resources and therefore is suitable for rice planting and aquaculture breeding whereas rice planting and fish breeding have faced many contradictions such as unexpected seasonal drought and increasing no point pollution in this region in previous years wu et al 2008 yao et al 2015 moreover the average rates of application of n and p have now increased to 200 360 kg n ha 1 and 140 200 kg p2o5 ha 1 owing to the fertilization practices of farmers in intensive rice cropping systems in the jianghan plain liu et al 2019 which 80 170 higher the recommended fertilizer rate based on site specific nutrient management dobermann et al 2002 liu et al 2009 large amounts of external n inputs and the unscientific use of fertilizers have contributed to low n and p use efficiency resulting in serious soil degradation eutrophication groundwater pollution and the emission of ammonia and greenhouse gases ju et al 2009 spiertz 2010 ye et al 2013 wang et al 2018 in addition based on the constitution of national scientific and technological innovation alliance for fertilizer reduction and its high efficient use sponsored by the government of china stakeholders are striving to achieve zero growth and gradually reduce fertilizer consumption for the primary crops by 2020 however to the best of our knowledge little information is available on the combined effects of reducing fertilizer inputs and aquaculture effluent irrigation on the removal of n and p by paddy fields as well as their effects on the yield of rice the objectives of this study were to investigate the surface and seepage water quality of paddy fields during the rice growing season and the yield of rice in response to reduced fertilizer rates under fishpond effluent irrigation we hypothesized that with fewer fertilizer inputs the paddy fields could more effectively remove the nutrients from fishpond effluent consequently the fertilizer inputs for rice production could be significantly reduced without deleterious effects on crop yields 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental plot was located in the farm of taihu lake jingzhou city in hubei province central china 29 41 25 2 n 112 39 40 8 e which is

representative 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 water quality and soil nutrients the surface water and leakage water samples were sampled at the tillering booting heading and filling stages of rice at 34 58 73 and 95 dat respectively the concentrations of n and p in the different forms were determined immediately after sampling a 500 ml plastic bottle was used to collect water samples along the long side of the plot at 0 m at the water inlet and at 10 20 30 and 40 m at the water outlet the soil seepage solution was collected at the clay head which was pressed into 30 cm in the soil depth to collect

1978 the available p was determined using the olsen method emteryd 1989 2 4 2 nutrient uptake yield and yield components five representative plants in each plot were cut at the maturity stage harvest on october 22 2015 for the determination of the accumulation of nutrients the plants were divided into stems leaves and panicles all the plant samples were oven dried at 70 c to a constant biomass and weighed the samples were passed through a 0 15 mm sieve and then the subsamples were collected for the total determination of n and total p as described by ye et al 2013 the concentration of n in the

number per panicle grain filling percentage and 1000 grain weight 2 5 data analysis the removal rates r of the n and p in different forms from the fishpond effluent by paddy field were calculated as follows 1 r c 0 c d c 0 100 where c 0 is an initial concentration of the n and p in the wastewater from the fishpond effluent before fishpond irrigation mg l 1 and cd is the concentration of the n and p in the surface water of paddy field after fishpond irrigation mg l 1 which was the means of the concentrations along the long side of the plot at 0 m at the water inlet and 10 20 30 and 40 m at the water outlet in the paddy field an analysis of variance anova was performed by a one way anova using spss 17 0 software the mean values among the different treatments were compared for significant differences p 0 05 using least significant difference tests 3 results 3 1 total irrigation amount there were six irrigation events 950 m3 ha 1 per time during the rice growing season for each treatment resulting in a total irrigation amount of 5700 m3 for all the treatments thus 5700 m3 of freshwater could be saved from the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments 3 2 n and p content in the surface water compared to the nfr f treatment nh4 n no3 n tn dissolved phosphorus dp particulate phosphorus pp and tp contents in the surface water at the tillering booting heading and filling stages were comparable in the nfr e treatment with the exception of no3 n at the tillering stage and dp at the booting stage table 3 the 0 8nfr e treatment decreased the no3 n content at the tillering stage by 21 8 the tn content at the booting stage by 9 4 and the no3 n and tp contents at the filling stage by 14 9 and 37 1 respectively the slight increase in the n and p measured were also observed for the 0 8nfr e treatment however the 0 6nfr e treatment decreased the nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp contents at the four growth stages with the exception of the content of no3 n at the heading stage table 3 across the four growth stages the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments decreased the tn content by 14 6 and 23 4 on average respectively and decreased the tp content on average by 22 3 and 35 5 respectively in comparison with the nfr f treatment 3 3 n and p removal by the paddy fields the removal rate of nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp in the effluent from fishpond by the paddy field at the tillering booting heading and filling stages increased as the nfr decreased the removal rate was the greatest for no3 n followed by nh4 n tn or pp dp and tp at the four growth stages the removal rates of the nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp were the greatest at the tillering stage followed by the booting filling and heading stages table 4 across the four growth stages the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments resulted in the following average removal rates nh4 n 34 3 42 5 and 54 0 respectively no3 n 74 3 79 0 and 83 0 respectively tn 25 1 38 9 and 50 5 respectively dp 44 9 61 6 and 72 3 respectively pp 60 1 73 1 and 76 0 respectively and tp 56 4 71 2 and 76 2 respectively these results suggest that the efficiency of the removal of tn and tp in the effluent by the paddy field increased with the decrease in the normal fertilizer rate 3 4 n and p contents in the seepage water compared to the nfr f treatment the nfr e treatment increased the nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp contents in the seepage water at the tillering booting heading and filling stages although most of the differences did not reach a significant level however the nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp content were decreased by the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments table 5 the tn and tp contents at the four growth stages were significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment than in the nfr f treatment table 5 across the four growth stages the 0 8nfr e and 0 6 nfr e treatments decreased the tn content by 18 3 and 27 5 respectively and decreased the tp content by 23 1 and 45 8 on average respectively in comparison with the nfr f treatment 3 5 grain yield and yield components the effective panicle numbers per plant and 100 grain weight were comparable among the different treatments compared with the nfr f treatment spikelet number grain filling percentage and grain yield were comparable in the nfr e and 0 8nfr e treatments while these values were significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment table 6 this suggests that reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 did not compromise the yield of rice under fishpond effluent irrigation 3 6 n and p accumulation in rice n harvest index nhi and p harvest index phi the accumulation of n and p in the leaves and the accumulation of n in the stems at the maturity stage were comparable among the different treatments however the accumulation of p in the stems and panicles was significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment than in the other treatments table 7 the nfr e treatment produced the greatest accumulation of n in the panicles among the four treatments table 7 compared with the nfr f treatment the accumulation of n and p in the shoot the n harvest index nhi ratio of panicles n to total n accumulation in rice and the p harvest index phi ratio of panicles p to total p accumulation in rice were comparable in the nfr e and 0 8nfr e treatments while these values were significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment 3 7 residual soil n and p in the 0 60 cm soil depth the soil tn available n tp and available p contents after the rice harvest in all the treatments decreased with the deepening of soil depth the nfr e treatment generated the greatest tn available n tp and available p contents in the each soil depth fig 1 the soil available n in the 0 20 cm soil depth soil tn content in the 40 60 cm soil depth and soil available p content in the 20 40 cm soil depth were significantly greater in the nfr f and nfr e treatments than those in the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments fig 1a b and d compared with the nfr f treatment the soil tn and available n contents in the 20 40 cm soil depth soil tp and available p contents in the 0 20 cm soil depth and the soil available p content in the 40 60 cm soil depth were significantly greater in the nfr e treatment while these values were smaller in the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments fig 1a d the soil tp content in the 20 60 cm soil depths was significantly smaller in the 0 6nfr e treatment compared with the other treatments fig 1c 4 discussion 4 1 water quality of the paddy field the paddy field ecosystem is an important artificial wetland which not only mediates important grain production functions but also plays a unique role in purifying water quality wang et al 2011 liu et al 2019 the previous work showed that after aquaculture pond effluent water was restored by the paddy field the tn and tp contents in the effluent decreased by 66 0 69 3 and 41 4 42 5 chen 2009 consistently in this study the removal rates of tn in the effluent from fishponds across the tillering booting heading and filling stages by the paddy field were 25 1 38 9 and 50 5 on average for the nfr e 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments respectively the corresponding removal rates of tp were 56 4 71 2 and 76 2 respectively these indicate that the 0 8nrf e and 0 6nrf e treatments performed better on the removal of tn and tp compared to the nfr e treatment in addition an earlier study demonstrated that the rice crop removed 32 of tn and 24 of tp from hybrid catfish pond effluent lin and yang 2003 in which the removal efficiencies of n and p were lower compared to those in the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments the enhanced nutrients removal rates may be explained as follows first reducing the fertilizer inputs resulted in a reduced concentration of n and p from the source malhi et al 2002 wang et al 2014 the relatively lower nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp contents in the surface water of paddy field under the reduced fertilizer treatments table 3 confirmed this second this was attributed to nutrients that could be better utilized by the crop under reduced fertilization treatments luo et al 2018 as indicated by the 0 8nrf e treatment which had a comparable n and p accumulation in the shoots of rice compared to the nfr f treatment table 7 our earlier work has shown that reduced fertilization treatments improve the leaf area index at the post stages of rice growth in reduced fertilization treatments under fishpond effluent irrigation zhou et al 2011 moreover appropriate n fertilizer reduction can enhance the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate of cotton and thereby delay leaf senescence and increase nitrogen use efficiency luo et al 2018 however the mechanism behind the respective contributions of input mineral nutrients and nutrients from the fishponds to nutrient requirements by the crop under reduced fertilization treatments is not clear and merits further study in this study the nh4 n and no3 n contents accounted for approximately 70 of the tn content and the dp content only accounted for approximately 30 of the tp content in the initial effluent from fishpond table 4 this is consistent with the findings of bergheim and brinker 2003 that more than 80 of the tn was nh4 n and no3 n in aquaculture effluent and that 30 84 of the tp was bound in particles moreover the removal efficiencies of the nh4 n no3 n and pp were all the highest at the tillering followed by the booting filling and heading stages table 4 since nutrient demand and the uptake rate by rice vary among the different growth stages generally the most important uptake happens at the tillering stage shimono et al 2012 in addition the original concentrations of n and p in different forms in the effluent as an irrigation source were comparable among the six irrigation events thus it is still not clear whether the removal efficiencies of n and p by the paddy field are related to the load of nutrients in the fishpond effluent and environmental factors such as light temperature and microorganisms which merit additional study before this study little information was available on the n and p dynamics in response to reducing the fertilizer rate under aquaculture effluent irrigation in this study we found that compared with the nfr f treatment both the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments decreased the contents of tn and tp in the surface and seepage water tables 3 and 5 this suggests that reducing fertilizer inputs could effectively lower the concentrations of n and p of the discharge water from paddy fields if fishpond effluent is used as an irrigation source 4 2 grain yield of rice n and p are the two essential fertilizer resources for regulating plant growth and development it has been proven that the management of water and nutrients has a substantial influence on rice yield formation ye et al 2013 in this study the accumulation of n and p in the shoots of rice at the maturity stage harvest were comparable between the nfr f and 0 8nfr e treatments table 7 suggesting that reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 could meet the nutrient requirements of rice under fishpond effluent irrigation moreover herein we observed that the nhi and phi were comparable between the nfr f and 0 8nfr e treatments table 7 based on an analysis from the perspective of physiology when a certain nutrient is deficient the rice will prioritize the transfer of the nutrient lacking to the grain to promote its differentiation and maturation whitbread et al 2003 this indicates that reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 did not induce a deficiency of n and p in rice under aquaculture effluent irrigation we also observed that the nfr e and 0 8nfr e treatments resulted in a comparable grain yield of rice while the 0 6nfr e treatment significantly decreased the grain yield compared with that of the nfr f treatment table 6 suggesting that the normal fertilizer rate of rice could be reduced by 20 without deleterious effects on yield under fishpond effluent irrigation in addition the fact that the nfr e treatment did not lead to a greater rice yield could be related to a sufficient amount of fertilizer that supplied all the nutrients needed by the plant so that irrigation with the aquaculture effluent did not influence the crop yield castro et al 2006 4 3 residual soil n and p an earlier study had shown that the long term or excessive use of sewage from livestock and poultry breeding as an irrigation source leads to a significant increase in the accumulation of n and p in the 0 40 cm soil depths of paddy fields zhang et al 2014 however in this study the 0 8nfr e and 0 6nfr e treatments effectively reduced the contents of tn in the 20 60 cm soil depths and tp in the 0 20 cm soil depth in the paddy soil compared with the nfr f treatment fig 1 indicating that reducing the normal fertilizer rate by 20 40 would not result in the accumulation of n and p in the soil profile under fishpond effluent irrigation thereby reducing the possibility of n and p leaching this contradiction may be explained by the differences in crop varieties soil types soil microorganisms nutrient load in water bodies and environmental factors such as light and temperature in addition our study primarily focused on the monitoring and evaluation of water quality and rice yield and the test was only conducted for one year therefore further research is needed to study the soil quality status of the return of long term aquaculture effluent to farmland 5 conclusions a paddy field system could effectively remove nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp from fishpond effluent and the removal efficiencies of tn and tp all increased with the decreasing normal fertilizer rate nfr at the tillering booting heading and filling stages of rice the improved removal efficiencies were attributed to the lower n and p contents in the surface water of paddy field and the efficient n and p uptake by rice under reduced fertilization treatments using fishpond effluent as an irrigation source the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n tn dp pp and tp in the surface water and seepage water of the paddy field and the residual soil n and p in the 0 60 cm soil depths after the rice harvest decreased with the decrease in the nfr the n and p concentration in the fishpond effluent could meet the n and p requirement of rice and obtain a comparable grain yield with a 20 reduction in the nfr input under fishpond effluent irrigation therefore considering the yield effect of rice and the environmental risk 20 of the fertilizer input and 5700 m3 ha 1 of fresh water could be saved under aquaculture effluent irrigation during the rice growing season these results can also provide a basis for in depth understanding of the mechanism of aquaculture effluent purification through paddy field ecosystem in response to fertilizer supply levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing

10723,ridge furrow farming systems with transparent plastic film have been used extensively for maize zea mays l production in semi arid areas however with climate warming problems may arise associated with premature senescence and reduced production this study examined whether dual mulching of ridges with black plastic film and furrows with straw can delay senescence and increase summer maize yield summer maize cultivation experiments were conducted in 2014 2015 by ridge furrow planting with black brm or transparent trm plastic film mulch over the ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow flat planting with black bm or transparent plastic film mulch tm and flat planting without mulch control treatment ck the objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of the different mulching treatments on soil water and temperature evapotranspiration et leaf photosynthesis rate yield and water use efficiency of summer maize the brm and trm treatments were superior to the bm and tm treatments in terms of soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil profile the brm reduced the diurnal variation in the soil temperature and lowered the soil temperature in the root zone the brm treatment extended the maize reproductive growth period by 5 days compared with tm and 2 3 days longer than for the other mulched and control treatments the brm also increased the leaf area and dry matter accumulation per plant while significantly increasing the leaf photosynthesis rate moreover brm increased the 100 seed dry weight and significantly improved yield and water use efficiency the 2 year average yield of the brm treatment was 6 7 13 4 18 4 and 72 9 greater than yield of the trm bm tm and ck treatments respectively the corresponding water use efficiency improved by 11 2 13 1 20 3 and 72 1 respectively applying the brm cultivation practice will effectively delay senescence and increase summer maize yield in the agricultural production area of the study region keywords dual

and sub humid areas especially where irrigation is not available and spring temperatures are low dong et al 2018 black film mulch can effectively reduce soil temperature during the hot summer months when compared with transparent film mulch with that result being attributed to the lower light transmittance through and lower solar radiation beneath black film mulch ban et al 2009 yaghi et al 2013 qin et al 2018 additionally black film has been shown to improve soil water and temperature conditions resulting in increased crop yield and water use efficiency anikwe et al 2007 zhang et al 2017b

of the furrow at 52 000 plants ha 1 with a row spacing of 60 cm and 40 cm spacing between seeds within rows maize was planted on 19 june 2014 and 11 june 2015 and harvested on 11 october 2014 and 13 october 2015 chemical fertilizers were applied in all treatments at rates of 225 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 one day before maize planting the planting rate and fertilization rate were the same for each treatment no irrigation was used and all water inputs were natural rainfall during this study 2 3 sampling measurements and data analysis 2 3 1 soil temperature and soil water during the summer maize growing season em50 data loggers were used to continuously monitor soil temperature both the data logger and the capacitance probes were manufactured by decagon devices pullman wa usa which is now meter group www metergroup com soil temperatures were measured hourly at soil depths of 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm and then averaged as daily values the sensors were installed horizontally at the center of each plot in the middle of the planted rows to minimize variations caused by the soil profile and soil structure the soil was excavated layer by layer at 10 cm intervals with soil from each layer being kept separate from soil obtained from other layers after all of the sensors were installed the excavated soil from each layer was replaced and packed to approximately the original bulk density the volumetric soil water contents swc were also measured using a soil moisture profile measurement system trime pico iph tdr germany with soil water measurements at 0 2 m intervals within the

all determinations reported were the means of three replicates all figures were made using sigmaplot 12 2 systat software inc https systatsoftware com products sigmaplot 3 results and analysis 3 1 soil moisture the most pronounced effects on the swc were observed at v3 growth stage in both years fig 3 during the v3 growth stage the brm and trm had significantly higher swc than other treatments at 0 100 cm soil depth in 2014 and 0 80 cm in 2015 p 0 05 at r1 in 2014 and v12 in 2015 brm and trm treatments had significantly lower swc than ck at 140 200 cm soil depth at r3 in 2014 mulched treatments had significantly higher swc than ck treatment at 0 80 cm soil depth this may be due to increased precipitation during this period at r6 in 2015 ridge furrow treatments were observed to have lower soil moisture in deep soil layer than flat and ck treatments i e no significant differences between brm and trm generally the changes in profile soil water storage and precipitation exhibited consistent trends fig 4 in 2014 sws reached the highest level at the r6 stage whereas in 2015 the greatest sws was observed at the v3 stage during the v12 r1 stages sws declined due to increased water consumption by the crop in 2014 precipitation was concentrated in the later maize growth periods at the r3 stage sws increased due to increased precipitation in 2015 precipitation distribution was more uniform during the v12 and r1 stages precipitation increased while the crop grew vigorously with increased water consumption together these two factors led to only small changes in sws during the later maize growth periods 3 2 soil temperature 3 2 1 soil temperature in typical weather different mulching treatments showed varying effects on soil temperature during sunny and rainy days thus typical sunny days and rainy days during the growing season were selected to compare the effects of different mulching measures on soil temperature we compared the diurnal variation in soil temperature fig 5 on 30 july 2014 and 30 july 2015 sunny days and on 9 august 2014 and 18 august 2015 rainy days the pattern of diurnal soil temperature change was similar for both the sunny and rainy days however the amplitude of the variation in soil temperature was greater on sunny days compared with that on rainy days specifically the diurnal variation in the soil temperature on sunny days was greater than that on rainy days by 1 2 1 5 c brm 2 2 2 7 c trm 3 4 4 7 c bm 5 1 5 3 c tm and 2 6 3 0 c ck irrespective of whether the days were sunny or rainy the tm treatment exhibited the greatest amplitude in diurnal variation of soil temperature followed by bm ck and trm the least diurnal variation of soil temperature was observed with brm 3 2 2 soil temperature during the growing season during the 2014 and 2015 maize growing seasons the daily mean soil temperature fluctuated from day to day but generally increased up to the beginning of silking and then decreased until physiological maturity fig 6 the daily mean soil temperatures of brm and trm were markedly lower than those of bm and tm the tm treatment produced the highest daily mean soil temperature the bm treatment also produced warmer soil than the ck treatment but was markedly lower than tm the lowest daily mean soil temperature was observed with brm for the entire 2014 growing season the daily mean soil temperature with brm was 0 7 c 2 2 c 0 9 c and 0 4 c lower than with trm tm bm and ck respectively whereas in 2015 the soil temperature with brm was 0 4 c 2 4 c 1 4 c and 0 5 c lower than with trm tm bm and ck respectively 3 3 maize growth progress soil environment changes due to different mulching treatments ultimately affect maize growth processes table 2 compared with the control the three leaf period was shortened by 1 3 days while the 12 leaf period was shortened by 1 5 days under mulched treatments however marked differences occurred between the mulched treatments from the time of silking compared with ck the r1 and r3 periods were delayed by 2 3 days and 3 5 days respectively with brm no significant differences from ck were observed with trm and bm while these two periods were shortened by 4 5 days and 6 9 days respectively with tm the entire growing season was lengthened by 4 5 days with brm compared with ck the length of the entire growing season with trm and bm was comparable to that with ck in contrast the growing season was shortened by 7 8 days with tm the period from r1 to r6 lasted 42 43 days with brm 40 41 days with trm 39 40 days with bm 37 38 days with tm and 40 41 days with ck this r1 to r6 growth period was lengthened by approximately 2 days for brm compared with trm and ck by approximately 3 days compared with bm and by approximately 5 days compared with tm 3 4 leaf area index in both years the mulched treatments brm trm bm and tm increased leaf area index lai relative to the ck treatment fig 7 at 25 days after planting summer maize plants had very small lai with no significant differences in the lai due to the mulching treatments p 0 05 however after v12 more than 50 days after planting maize leaves were wide large and growing vigorously with treatment differences evident for lai the brm treatment produced the largest lai with maximum lai values for the different treatments recorded at r1 i e approximately 65 days after planting after r1 maize plants entered the reproductive growth period when brm delayed leaf senescence and the decline in lai keeping the lai at relatively high levels in contrast the tm treatment resulted in the highest rate of leaf senescence in maize thus causing the most rapid decline in lai 3 5 aboveground dry matter different mulching treatments significantly affected the accumulation of aboveground dry matter in maize fig 8 dry matter accumulation per plant was significantly greater for the mulched treatments than for the control treatment during different growth periods p 0 05 in the early growth stages within 50 days after planting the transparent film mulching treatments trm and tm had greater aboveground dry matter compared with the black film mulching treatments brm and bm after r1 65 d after planting the ridge furrow planting treatments brm and trm had significantly greater biomass than seen with the flat planting treatments bm and tm whereas the treatments with black plastic film mulch had greater biomass than seen with transparent plastic film mulch the highest dry matter accumulation per maize plant was observed with brm at maturity brm increased dry matter accumulation by 4 5 7 4 9 5 14 6 18 2 21 8 and 30 4 31 6 compared with trm bm tm and ck respectively for the two years of the study 3 6 net photosynthesis rate the net photosynthesis rate pn of maize leaves first increased and then decreased for all treatments as growth proceeded during the two years of the study maximum values occurred at r1 after which pn gradually decreased as plants senesced fig 9 the pn values of all mulched treatments were significantly greater than those of the control p 0 05 no significant difference was observed in pn between the mulched treatments at the v12 stage however pn under brm and trm were significantly higher than under bm and tm during the r1 and r3 stages except for trm at r3 in 2014 moreover significant differences were detected among all treatments at maturity especially during the r3 and r6 periods brm resulted in significantly greater pn compared with the other treatments 3 7 grain yield and water use efficiency table 3 summarizes maize grain yield yield components et and water use efficiency wue of summer maize under different mulching treatments all mulched treatments were superior to the control in terms of ear length kernel number and 100 seed dry weight the brm treatment had the highest values and the ck treatment had the lowest values ridge furrow planting with dual mulching relative to flat planting with single mulching and black plastic film mulching on the ridges relative to transparent plastic film mulching on ridges significantly increased maize grain yield compared with the ck treatment brm trm bm and tm significantly increased grain yield by 85 3 75 2 70 3 and 65 1 respectively in 2014 p 0 05 whereas in 2015 those treatments significantly increased grain yield by 60 6 49 1 35 9 and 28 9 respectively p 0 05 the wues of the different treatments in descending order were as follows ridge furrow planting with dual mulching brm and trm flat planting with single mulching bm and tm ck for the 2014 growing season the wues of brm trm bm and tm exceeded those of ck by 83 2 67 6 68 0 and 61 6 respectively p 0 05 likewise for the 2015 growing season the corresponding wues increased by 60 7 42 1 35 6 and 26 3 respectively p 0 05 over the control treatment 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture and temperature compared with planting on bare land plastic film mulching of ridges with straw mulching of furrows can effectively enhance the water storage and moisture conservation capacity of soil during the maize growing season thereby improving wue in rainfed dryland regions jia et al 2006 hu et al 2014 li et al 2016 in the loess plateau where serious water deficits limit agricultural production plastic film mulching has been utilized in the cultivation of maize and wheat li et al 2013 it has been reported that straw mulching can reduce evaporation especially when the soil surface is wet and when the leaf area is small during the early part of the crop growing season dong et al 2018 in the present study brm and trm enabled plants to utilize soil water from deep soil especially in dry periods of the growing season fig 3 we also found the ridge furrow planting treatments with dual mulching performed better than flat planting treatments with single mulching regarding rainwater harvesting and soil moisture conservation fig 4 in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons plants were short and small as seedlings such that the exposed land areas were large and the evaporation occurring from the soil surface between plants was large in addition to efficient rainwater harvesting both brm and trm could markedly reduce soil evaporation ineffective water loss compared with transpiration resulting in significantly greater sws than with bm tm and ck p 0 05 black and transparent plastic film mulches had the same effect on soil moisture conservation nonetheless there can be negative effects on maize growth and yield due to transparent mulching induced temperature increases steinmetz et al 2016 qin et al 2018 maize is a temperature sensitive crop maize can exhibit high growth rates under high temperature conditions leading to higher respiratory consumption than accumulation of photosynthate resulting in nutrition deficits and premature senescence bu et al 2013b the daily mean soil temperature at a depth of 15 cm under black mulch was an average of 1 03 1 24 c lower than under transparent mulch in particular brm lowered the soil temperature by 2 18 2 43 c relative to tm and by 0 40 0 74 c relative to trm fig 6 our results are consistent with previously reported findings for potato and maize díaz pérez 2010 miles et al 2012 yin et al 2015 this may be because black plastic film mulch can absorb more solar radiation and thus lower soil temperature under the mulch compared with transparent plastic film mulch moreno and moreno 2008 kar and kumar 2007 studied the dynamic variation in soil temperature under straw mulching and found that this practice diminished diurnal variation in soil temperature showing a warming effect in winter and a cooling effect in summer moreover li et al 2013 found that the soil temperature at depths of 5 25 cm under the dual mulching of ridges with plastic film and furrows with straw was always lower than the soil temperatures under single mulching with plastic film we came to a similar conclusion in this study i e that compared with plastic film mulching straw mulching on furrows could effectively lower the soil temperature and reduce the diurnal variation of soil temperature the smallest diurnal variation of soil temperature was observed with brm fig 5 this result indicates that brm could effectively reduce the diurnal variation of soil temperature diminish the temperature difference between day and night and attenuate sudden changes in soil temperature ultimately creating a relatively more stable soil temperature environment for the growth and development of summer maize the average soil temperature at a depth of 15 cm under dual mulching treatments with plastic film and straw brm and trm dropped by 0 94 1 40 c and 1 45 2 03 c respectively compared with single mulching treatments with plastic film bm and tm this was mainly because straw mulching formed a physical isolation layer at the soil surface which could effectively intercept and absorb direct solar radiation reduce surface effective radiation and reduce the exchange of water vapor and heat between the soil and the atmosphere thus lowering soil temperature gao et al 2009 chen et al 2005 showed that straw mulching resulted in lower soil temperature than the optimum temperature for crop growth which is likely to reduce crop yield however in this study we found that the soil temperature under straw mulching of the furrows brm and trm was lower than soil temperature in the control yet this did not diminish improvements in maize yield and wue table 3 this different result from the previously published result may be related to differences in crop variety used and growth period the summer maize growing season is between june and october when hot summer conditions prevail thus a lower summer soil temperature is conducive to plant growth the brm treatment markedly improved the soil temperature and moisture environment for maize growth thereby effectively reducing seasonal drought stress and excessive daytime soil temperature stress 4 2 maize growth and pn liu et al 2010b indicated that plastic film mulching can greatly increase soil temperature and markedly accelerate maize growth processes however excessive soil temperatures also cause premature senescence of maize and especially accelerate the decrease in maize leaf area during the reproductive growth period feng et al 2016 found that although the maize dry matter accumulation rate of the straw mulching treatment was lower than that of plastic film mulching in the early stages of crop growth it increased rapidly and exceeded that of plastic film mulching in the middle and late stages of growth eventually increasing the seed setting rate and grain yield the results of the current two year study showed that the maize growing season was lengthened by 4 5 days and the growing period of r1 r6 was extended by 2 5 days this extension is likely due to cooler soil temperatures observed under the black plastic mulch compared with the transparent plastic mulch while ridge furrow planting was more effective in conserving soil moisture compared with flat planting and the control combined with the cooling effect of the straw used in ridge furrow planting the brm treatment could slow down root and plant senescence lengthen the r1 to r6 growth period and thereby extend the grain filling stage of maize additionally both lai and aboveground dry matter accumulation with brm were significantly greater than those of other treatments during the reproductive growth period this greater accumulation under brm may be mainly due to changes in soil physical properties and maize root growth caused by lower soil temperature in the root zone together these effects slowed leaf senescence prolonged growth processes and increased aboveground dry matter accumulation the photosynthetic capacity of plant leaves is closely related to leaf senescence rate delaying leaf senescence in maize is an important approach for improving the photosynthetic capacity of leaves mulching can increase reflectivity of solar radiation and air resistance to water vapor exchange while reducing heat and moisture dissipation and thereby increase leaf area enhance photosynthetic rate and improve photosynthetic capacity of crops kante et al 2016 showed that during later maize growth stages leaf senescence rate increased while pn decreased with increasing bulk density in deep soil layers bu et al 2013b indicated that due to the warming effect of transparent plastic film mulch soil nutrients were less available and the maize growing season was shortened during later growth stages leading to premature senescence and reduced maize yield the results from the current study revealed that compared with other treatments brm could significantly delay leaf senescence rate after r1 and increase the leaf area in the middle to late growing season thereby ensuring higher maize photosynthetic capacity during later growth stages 4 3 yield and wue precipitation is a major factor affecting maize yield in rainfed dryland regions for the 2014 maize growing season precipitation was mainly concentrated in the grain filling period which accounted for 55 7 of the precipitation during the entire growing season fig 1 little precipitation occurred during the seedling to r1 period the lack of sufficient water supply to meet the growth and development of maize over this critical period directly affected maize ear characteristics and yield in contrast precipitation was distributed more uniformly during the 2015 maize growing season and 2015 maize yield exceeded that in 2014 table 3 therefore for maize cultivation under rainfed dryland conditions ensuring that the maximum water demand period for maize coincides with precipitation is important for increasing maize yield and wue lu et al 2017 optimized cultivation measures are important for increasing maize yield our results showed that planting with mulch significantly increased maize yield compared with the control treatment p 0 05 which is consistent with previous studies xie et al 2005 liu et al 2016 qin et al 2018 many studies have confirmed that straw mulch conserves soil moisture and reduces weed growth rahman et al 2005 unger et al 2006 however the effect of straw mulch on crop yield has been inconsistent compared to the no mulching treatment straw mulching increased annual crop yields over the two wheat and maize rotation cycles chen et al 2017 in contrast other studies have reported that straw mulch decreased winter wheat yield but increased maize yield gao and li 2005 han 2002 zhou et al 2011 one explanation is that during the hot summer the unique cooling effect of straw mulching likely increases root activity and delays plant senescence thereby improving maize growth and yield zhou et al 2011 li et al 2013 observed significant yield increasing effects in spring maize when ridges were mulched with plastic film and furrows were mulched with biodegradable film plastic film and straw in that study the 3 year average yield increased by 13 8 13 0 and 15 0 respectively for those three treatments compared with the yield of the control our study also showed that a rainwater harvesting cultivation practice with dual mulching of ridges and furrows could significantly increase maize grain yield compared with flat planting with single mulching the wues of the different treatments in descending order were as follows brm and trm bm and tm ck these results indicate that the ridge furrow treatments combined the advantages of greater soil water storage and moisture conservation while inhibiting weed growth to significantly improve precipitation effectiveness in producing maize yield we found that black plastic film mulch produced higher yield than transparent film mulch in the same planting mode ridge furrow or flat planting table 3 however mbah et al 2010 reported the opposite result with lower grain yield when black plastic was used instead of transparent film mulch primarily because cool temperatures limited maize growth in their area southeast nigeria mo et al 2017 found that transparent film mulching significantly increased topsoil temperature compared with ck facilitating maize growth and grain formation in a long but cool growing season in the east african plateau in contrast black film mulching lowered soil temperature compared with ck in a relatively warm growing season which created better soil thermal conditions to improve crop growth maize growth is severely impaired at temperatures below 15 c and ceases at root zone temperatures below 9 c imran et al 2013 mean air temperatures below 19 c reduce maize biomass accumulation and grain filling rate tsimba et al 2013 the average temperatures in the current study were 23 95 c and 23 43 c during the summer maize growing period in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 1 there are generally enough accumulated heat units for summer maize growth on the loess plateau therefore the higher soil temperatures produced by the transparent film mulch led to premature senescence the lower soil temperatures produced by the black film mulch and straw fig 5 and 6 produced significantly greater lai and aboveground dry matter during the later growing season fig 7 and 8 longer reproductive period table 2 and more grain yield table 2 in the same planting configuration ridge furrow or flat planting the increase in maize yield under brm cultivation was mainly attributable to a significant increase in 100 seed dry weight p 0 05 lu et al 2017 showed that the 100 seed dry weight was closely related to the accumulation of photoassimilates during the grain filling period and that maintaining leaf area and photosynthetic capacity at relatively high levels was the basis for the assimilate production furthermore the increase in the 100 seed dry weight reversely corroborated our conclusion regarding the delayed leaf senescence and increased leaf photosynthetic rate at the grain filling stage under brm cultivation hence the use of brm for maize cultivation in the rainfed dryland area of the loess plateau can effectively delay plant senescence during later growth stages and further promote grain filling thereby achieving increased yield and water use efficiency 5 conclusions ridge furrow farming systems with transparent plastic film have been used extensively for maize production in semi arid areas but with climate warming there are a series of problems associated with premature senescence and reduced production the dual mulching of ridges with black plastic film and furrows with straw proved to be an effective practice for increasing soil moisture yield wue lai and dry matter accumulation of summer maize while also improving the photosynthetic rate meanwhile the brm cultivation practice lowered average soil temperature extended the reproductive periods of summer maize and delayed premature senescence therefore the brm practice can be applied as a promising approach to delay premature senescence and increase the summer maize yield in this region of the loess plateau however further research on the brm practice will

10723,ridge furrow farming systems with transparent plastic film have been used extensively for maize zea mays l production in semi arid areas however with climate warming problems may arise associated with premature senescence and reduced production this study examined whether dual mulching of ridges with black plastic film and furrows with straw can delay senescence and increase summer maize yield summer maize cultivation experiments were conducted in 2014 2015 by ridge furrow planting with black brm or transparent trm plastic film mulch over the ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow flat planting with black bm or transparent plastic film mulch tm and flat planting without mulch control treatment ck the objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of the different mulching treatments on soil water and temperature evapotranspiration et leaf photosynthesis rate yield and water use efficiency of summer maize the brm and trm treatments were superior to the bm and tm treatments in terms of soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil profile the brm reduced the diurnal variation in the soil temperature and lowered the soil temperature in the root zone the brm treatment extended the maize reproductive growth period by 5 days compared with tm and 2 3 days longer than for the other mulched and control treatments the brm also increased the leaf area and dry matter accumulation per plant while significantly increasing the leaf photosynthesis rate moreover brm increased the 100 seed dry weight and significantly improved yield and water use efficiency the 2 year average yield of the brm treatment was 6 7 13 4 18 4 and 72 9 greater than yield of the trm bm tm and ck treatments respectively the corresponding water use efficiency improved by 11 2 13 1 20 3 and 72 1 respectively applying the brm cultivation practice will effectively delay senescence and increase summer maize yield in the agricultural production area of the study region keywords dual

increase soil temperature and reduce soil evaporation in vegetable and crop production in northwest china plastic film mulching is becoming a well developed technique for agriculture in arid semiarid and sub humid areas especially where irrigation is not available and spring temperatures are low dong et al 2018 black film mulch can effectively reduce soil temperature during the hot summer months when compared with transparent film mulch with that result being attributed to the lower light transmittance through and lower solar radiation beneath black film mulch ban et al 2009 yaghi et al 2013 qin et al 2018 additionally black film has been shown to improve soil water and temperature conditions resulting in increased crop yield and water use efficiency anikwe et al 2007 zhang et al 2017b

watermelon ban et al 2009 etc however at present there have been only a few studies reporting on the application of black film mulch on maize production especially in conjunction with ridge furrow rainwater harvesting systems additionally straw mulching can keep the soil warmer in winter and cooler in summer and reduce the range of soil temperature variation hu et al 2019 straw mulch has been shown to reduce the solar energy reaching the soil surface resulting in a reduction in the magnitude of soil temperature increases kar and kumar 2007 wang et al 2015a but those effects have not been

mulched with black or transparent plastic film 1 m width and 0 01 mm thickness and the furrows 60 cm width were mulched with wheat straw 4000 kg ha 1 fig 2 maize cv qinlong 11 was planted on the edges of the furrow at 52 000 plants ha 1 with a row spacing of 60 cm and 40 cm spacing between seeds within rows maize was planted on 19 june 2014 and 11 june 2015 and harvested on 11 october 2014 and 13 october 2015 chemical fertilizers were applied in all treatments at rates of 225 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 one day before maize planting the planting rate and fertilization rate were the same for each treatment no irrigation was used and all water inputs were natural rainfall during this study 2 3 sampling measurements and data analysis 2 3 1 soil temperature and soil water during the summer maize growing season em50 data loggers were used to continuously monitor soil temperature both the data logger and the capacitance probes were manufactured by decagon devices pullman wa usa which is now meter group www metergroup com soil temperatures were measured hourly at soil depths of 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm and then averaged as daily values the sensors were installed horizontally at the center of each plot in the middle of the planted rows to minimize variations caused by the soil profile and soil structure the soil was excavated layer by layer at 10 cm intervals with soil from each layer being kept separate from soil obtained from other layers after all of the sensors were installed the excavated soil from each layer was replaced and packed to approximately the original bulk density the volumetric soil water contents swc were also measured using a soil moisture profile measurement system trime pico iph tdr germany with soil water measurements at 0 2 m intervals within the

all determinations reported were the means of three replicates all figures were made using sigmaplot 12 2 systat software inc https systatsoftware com products sigmaplot 3 results and analysis 3 1 soil moisture the most pronounced effects on the swc were observed at v3 growth stage in both years fig 3 during the v3 growth stage the brm and trm had significantly higher swc than other treatments at 0 100 cm soil depth in 2014 and 0 80 cm in 2015 p 0 05 at r1 in 2014 and v12 in 2015 brm and trm treatments had significantly lower swc than ck at 140 200 cm soil depth at r3 in 2014 mulched treatments had significantly higher swc than ck treatment at 0 80 cm soil depth this may be due to increased precipitation during this period at r6 in 2015 ridge furrow treatments were observed to have lower soil moisture in deep soil layer than flat and ck treatments i e no significant differences between brm and trm generally the changes in profile soil water storage and precipitation exhibited consistent trends fig 4 in 2014 sws reached the highest level at the r6 stage whereas in 2015 the greatest sws was observed at the v3 stage during the v12 r1 stages sws declined due to increased water consumption by the crop in 2014 precipitation was concentrated in the later maize growth periods at the r3 stage sws increased due to increased precipitation in 2015 precipitation distribution was more uniform during the v12 and r1 stages precipitation increased while the crop grew vigorously with increased water consumption together these two factors led to only small changes in sws during the later maize growth periods 3 2 soil temperature 3 2 1 soil temperature in typical weather different mulching treatments showed varying effects on soil temperature during sunny and rainy days thus typical sunny days and rainy days during the growing season were selected to compare the effects of different mulching measures on soil temperature we compared the diurnal variation in soil temperature fig 5 on 30 july 2014 and 30 july 2015 sunny days and on 9 august 2014 and 18 august 2015 rainy days the pattern of diurnal soil temperature change was similar for both the sunny and rainy days however the amplitude of the variation in soil temperature was greater on sunny days compared with that on rainy days specifically the diurnal variation in the soil temperature on sunny days was greater than that on rainy days by 1 2 1 5 c brm 2 2 2 7 c trm 3 4 4 7 c bm 5 1 5 3 c tm and 2 6 3 0 c ck irrespective of whether the days were sunny or rainy the tm treatment exhibited the greatest amplitude in diurnal variation of soil temperature followed by bm ck and trm the least diurnal variation of soil temperature was observed with brm 3 2 2 soil temperature during the growing season during the 2014 and 2015 maize growing seasons the daily mean soil temperature fluctuated from day to day but generally increased up to the beginning of silking and then decreased until physiological maturity fig 6 the daily mean soil temperatures of brm and trm were markedly lower than those of bm and tm the tm treatment produced the highest daily mean soil temperature the bm treatment also produced warmer soil than the ck treatment but was markedly lower than tm the lowest daily mean soil temperature was observed with brm for the entire 2014 growing season the daily mean soil temperature with brm was 0 7 c 2 2 c 0 9 c and 0 4 c lower than with trm tm bm and ck respectively whereas in 2015 the soil temperature with brm was 0 4 c 2 4 c 1 4 c and 0 5 c lower than with trm tm bm and ck respectively 3 3 maize growth progress soil environment changes due to different mulching treatments ultimately affect maize growth processes table 2 compared with the control the three leaf period was shortened by 1 3 days while the 12 leaf period was shortened by 1 5 days under mulched treatments however marked differences occurred between the mulched treatments from the time of silking compared with ck the r1 and r3 periods were delayed by 2 3 days and 3 5 days respectively with brm no significant differences from ck were observed with trm and bm while these two periods were shortened by 4 5 days and 6 9 days respectively with tm the entire growing season was lengthened by 4 5 days with brm compared with ck the length of the entire growing season with trm and bm was comparable to that with ck in contrast the growing season was shortened by 7 8 days with tm the period from r1 to r6 lasted 42 43 days with brm 40 41 days with trm 39 40 days with bm 37 38 days with tm and 40 41 days with ck this r1 to r6 growth period was lengthened by approximately 2 days for brm compared with trm and ck by approximately 3 days compared with bm and by approximately 5 days compared with tm 3 4 leaf area index in both years the mulched treatments brm trm bm and tm increased leaf area index lai relative to the ck treatment fig 7 at 25 days after planting summer maize plants had very small lai with no significant differences in the lai due to the mulching treatments p 0 05 however after v12 more than 50 days after planting maize leaves were wide large and growing vigorously with treatment differences evident for lai the brm treatment produced the largest lai with maximum lai values for the different treatments recorded at r1 i e approximately 65 days after planting after r1 maize plants entered the reproductive growth period when brm delayed leaf senescence and the decline in lai keeping the lai at relatively high levels in contrast the tm treatment resulted in the highest rate of leaf senescence in maize thus causing the most rapid decline in lai 3 5 aboveground dry matter different mulching treatments significantly affected the accumulation of aboveground dry matter in maize fig 8 dry matter accumulation per plant was significantly greater for the mulched treatments than for the control treatment during different growth periods p 0 05 in the early growth stages within 50 days after planting the transparent film mulching treatments trm and tm had greater aboveground dry matter compared with the black film mulching treatments brm and bm after r1 65 d after planting the ridge furrow planting treatments brm and trm had significantly greater biomass than seen with the flat planting treatments bm and tm whereas the treatments with black plastic film mulch had greater biomass than seen with transparent plastic film mulch the highest dry matter accumulation per maize plant was observed with brm at maturity brm increased dry matter accumulation by 4 5 7 4 9 5 14 6 18 2 21 8 and 30 4 31 6 compared with trm bm tm and ck respectively for the two years of the study 3 6 net photosynthesis rate the net photosynthesis rate pn of maize leaves first increased and then decreased for all treatments as growth proceeded during the two years of the study maximum values occurred at r1 after which pn gradually decreased as plants senesced fig 9 the pn values of all mulched treatments were significantly greater than those of the control p 0 05 no significant difference was observed in pn between the mulched treatments at the v12 stage however pn under brm and trm were significantly higher than under bm and tm during the r1 and r3 stages except for trm at r3 in 2014 moreover significant differences were detected among all treatments at maturity especially during the r3 and r6 periods brm resulted in significantly greater pn compared with the other treatments 3 7 grain yield and water use efficiency table 3 summarizes maize grain yield yield components et and water use efficiency wue of summer maize under different mulching treatments all mulched treatments were superior to the control in terms of ear length kernel number and 100 seed dry weight the brm treatment had the highest values and the ck treatment had the lowest values ridge furrow planting with dual mulching relative to flat planting with single mulching and black plastic film mulching on the ridges relative to transparent plastic film mulching on ridges significantly increased maize grain yield compared with the ck treatment brm trm bm and tm significantly increased grain yield by 85 3 75 2 70 3 and 65 1 respectively in 2014 p 0 05 whereas in 2015 those treatments significantly increased grain yield by 60 6 49 1 35 9 and 28 9 respectively p 0 05 the wues of the different treatments in descending order were as follows ridge furrow planting with dual mulching brm and trm flat planting with single mulching bm and tm ck for the 2014 growing season the wues of brm trm bm and tm exceeded those of ck by 83 2 67 6 68 0 and 61 6 respectively p 0 05 likewise for the 2015 growing season the corresponding wues increased by 60 7 42 1 35 6 and 26 3 respectively p 0 05 over the control treatment 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture and temperature compared with planting on bare land plastic film mulching of ridges with straw mulching of furrows can effectively enhance the water storage and moisture conservation capacity of soil during the maize growing season thereby improving wue in rainfed dryland regions jia et al 2006 hu et al 2014 li et al 2016 in the loess plateau where serious water deficits limit agricultural production plastic film mulching has been utilized in the cultivation of maize and wheat li et al 2013 it has been reported that straw mulching can reduce evaporation especially when the soil surface is wet and when the leaf area is small during the early part of the crop growing season dong et al 2018 in the present study brm and trm enabled plants to utilize soil water from deep soil especially in dry periods of the growing season fig 3 we also found the ridge furrow planting treatments with dual mulching performed better than flat planting treatments with single mulching regarding rainwater harvesting and soil moisture conservation fig 4 in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons plants were short and small as seedlings such that the exposed land areas were large and the evaporation occurring from the soil surface between plants was large in addition to efficient rainwater harvesting both brm and trm could markedly reduce soil evaporation ineffective water loss compared with transpiration resulting in significantly greater sws than with bm tm and ck p 0 05 black and transparent plastic film mulches had the same effect on soil moisture conservation nonetheless there can be negative effects on maize growth and yield due to transparent mulching induced temperature increases steinmetz et al 2016 qin et al 2018 maize is a temperature sensitive crop maize can exhibit high growth rates under high temperature conditions leading to higher respiratory consumption than accumulation of photosynthate resulting in nutrition deficits and premature senescence bu et al 2013b the daily mean soil temperature at a depth of 15 cm under black mulch was an average of 1 03 1 24 c lower than under transparent mulch in particular brm lowered the soil temperature by 2 18 2 43 c relative to tm and by 0 40 0 74 c relative to trm fig 6 our results are consistent with previously reported findings for potato and maize díaz pérez 2010 miles et al 2012 yin et al 2015 this may be because black plastic film mulch can absorb more solar radiation and thus lower soil temperature under the mulch compared with transparent plastic film mulch moreno and moreno 2008 kar and kumar 2007 studied the dynamic variation in soil temperature under straw mulching and found that this practice diminished diurnal variation in soil temperature showing a warming effect in winter and a cooling effect in summer moreover li et al 2013 found that the soil temperature at depths of 5 25 cm under the dual mulching of ridges with plastic film and furrows with straw was always lower than the soil temperatures under single mulching with plastic film we came to a similar conclusion in this study i e that compared with plastic film mulching straw mulching on furrows could effectively lower the soil temperature and reduce the diurnal variation of soil temperature the smallest diurnal variation of soil temperature was observed with brm fig 5 this result indicates that brm could effectively reduce the diurnal variation of soil temperature diminish the temperature difference between day and night and attenuate sudden changes in soil temperature ultimately creating a relatively more stable soil temperature environment for the growth and development of summer maize the average soil temperature at a depth of 15 cm under dual mulching treatments with plastic film and straw brm and trm dropped by 0 94 1 40 c and 1 45 2 03 c respectively compared with single mulching treatments with plastic film bm and tm this was mainly because straw mulching formed a physical isolation layer at the soil surface which could effectively intercept and absorb direct solar radiation reduce surface effective radiation and reduce the exchange of water vapor and heat between the soil and the atmosphere thus lowering soil temperature gao et al 2009 chen et al 2005 showed that straw mulching resulted in lower soil temperature than the optimum temperature for crop growth which is likely to reduce crop yield however in this study we found that the soil temperature under straw mulching of the furrows brm and trm was lower than soil temperature in the control yet this did not diminish improvements in maize yield and wue table 3 this different result from the previously published result may be related to differences in crop variety used and growth period the summer maize growing season is between june and october when hot summer conditions prevail thus a lower summer soil temperature is conducive to plant growth the brm treatment markedly improved the soil temperature and moisture environment for maize growth thereby effectively reducing seasonal drought stress and excessive daytime soil temperature stress 4 2 maize growth and pn liu et al 2010b indicated that plastic film mulching can greatly increase soil temperature and markedly accelerate maize growth processes however excessive soil temperatures also cause premature senescence of maize and especially accelerate the decrease in maize leaf area during the reproductive growth period feng et al 2016 found that although the maize dry matter accumulation rate of the straw mulching treatment was lower than that of plastic film mulching in the early stages of crop growth it increased rapidly and exceeded that of plastic film mulching in the middle and late stages of growth eventually increasing the seed setting rate and grain yield the results of the current two year study showed that the maize growing season was lengthened by 4 5 days and the growing period of r1 r6 was extended by 2 5 days this extension is likely due to cooler soil temperatures observed under the black plastic mulch compared with the transparent plastic mulch while ridge furrow planting was more effective in conserving soil moisture compared with flat planting and the control combined with the cooling effect of the straw used in ridge furrow planting the brm treatment could slow down root and plant senescence lengthen the r1 to r6 growth period and thereby extend the grain filling stage of maize additionally both lai and aboveground dry matter accumulation with brm were significantly greater than those of other treatments during the reproductive growth period this greater accumulation under brm may be mainly due to changes in soil physical properties and maize root growth caused by lower soil temperature in the root zone together these effects slowed leaf senescence prolonged growth processes and increased aboveground dry matter accumulation the photosynthetic capacity of plant leaves is closely related to leaf senescence rate delaying leaf senescence in maize is an important approach for improving the photosynthetic capacity of leaves mulching can increase reflectivity of solar radiation and air resistance to water vapor exchange while reducing heat and moisture dissipation and thereby increase leaf area enhance photosynthetic rate and improve photosynthetic capacity of crops kante et al 2016 showed that during later maize growth stages leaf senescence rate increased while pn decreased with increasing bulk density in deep soil layers bu et al 2013b indicated that due to the warming effect of transparent plastic film mulch soil nutrients were less available and the maize growing season was shortened during later growth stages leading to premature senescence and reduced maize yield the results from the current study revealed that compared with other treatments brm could significantly delay leaf senescence rate after r1 and increase the leaf area in the middle to late growing season thereby ensuring higher maize photosynthetic capacity during later growth stages 4 3 yield and wue precipitation is a major factor affecting maize yield in rainfed dryland regions for the 2014 maize growing season precipitation was mainly concentrated in the grain filling period which accounted for 55 7 of the precipitation during the entire growing season fig 1 little precipitation occurred during the seedling to r1 period the lack of sufficient water supply to meet the growth and development of maize over this critical period directly affected maize ear characteristics and yield in contrast precipitation was distributed more uniformly during the 2015 maize growing season and 2015 maize yield exceeded that in 2014 table 3 therefore for maize cultivation under rainfed dryland conditions ensuring that the maximum water demand period for maize coincides with precipitation is important for increasing maize yield and wue lu et al 2017 optimized cultivation measures are important for increasing maize yield our results showed that planting with mulch significantly increased maize yield compared with the control treatment p 0 05 which is consistent with previous studies xie et al 2005 liu et al 2016 qin et al 2018 many studies have confirmed that straw mulch conserves soil moisture and reduces weed growth rahman et al 2005 unger et al 2006 however the effect of straw mulch on crop yield has been inconsistent compared to the no mulching treatment straw mulching increased annual crop yields over the two wheat and maize rotation cycles chen et al 2017 in contrast other studies have reported that straw mulch decreased winter wheat yield but increased maize yield gao and li 2005 han 2002 zhou et al 2011 one explanation is that during the hot summer the unique cooling effect of straw mulching likely increases root activity and delays plant senescence thereby improving maize growth and yield zhou et al 2011 li et al 2013 observed significant yield increasing effects in spring maize when ridges were mulched with plastic film and furrows were mulched with biodegradable film plastic film and straw in that study the 3 year average yield increased by 13 8 13 0 and 15 0 respectively for those three treatments compared with the yield of the control our study also showed that a rainwater harvesting cultivation practice with dual mulching of ridges and furrows could significantly increase maize grain yield compared with flat planting with single mulching the wues of the different treatments in descending order were as follows brm and trm bm and tm ck these results indicate that the ridge furrow treatments combined the advantages of greater soil water storage and moisture conservation while inhibiting weed growth to significantly improve precipitation effectiveness in producing maize yield we found that black plastic film mulch produced higher yield than transparent film mulch in the same planting mode ridge furrow or flat planting table 3 however mbah et al 2010 reported the opposite result with lower grain yield when black plastic was used instead of transparent film mulch primarily because cool temperatures limited maize growth in their area southeast nigeria mo et al 2017 found that transparent film mulching significantly increased topsoil temperature compared with ck facilitating maize growth and grain formation in a long but cool growing season in the east african plateau in contrast black film mulching lowered soil temperature compared with ck in a relatively warm growing season which created better soil thermal conditions to improve crop growth maize growth is severely impaired at temperatures below 15 c and ceases at root zone temperatures below 9 c imran et al 2013 mean air temperatures below 19 c reduce maize biomass accumulation and grain filling rate tsimba et al 2013 the average temperatures in the current study were 23 95 c and 23 43 c during the summer maize growing period in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 1 there are generally enough accumulated heat units for summer maize growth on the loess plateau therefore the higher soil temperatures produced by the transparent film mulch led to premature senescence the lower soil temperatures produced by the black film mulch and straw fig 5 and 6 produced significantly greater lai and aboveground dry matter during the later growing season fig 7 and 8 longer reproductive period table 2 and more grain yield table 2 in the same planting configuration ridge furrow or flat planting the increase in maize yield under brm cultivation was mainly attributable to a significant increase in 100 seed dry weight p 0 05 lu et al 2017 showed that the 100 seed dry weight was closely related to the accumulation of photoassimilates during the grain filling period and that maintaining leaf area and photosynthetic capacity at relatively high levels was the basis for the assimilate production furthermore the increase in the 100 seed dry weight reversely corroborated our conclusion regarding the delayed leaf senescence and increased leaf photosynthetic rate at the grain filling stage under brm cultivation hence the use of brm for maize cultivation in the rainfed dryland area of the loess plateau can effectively delay plant senescence during later growth stages and further promote grain filling thereby achieving increased yield and water use efficiency 5 conclusions ridge furrow farming systems with transparent plastic film have been used extensively for maize production in semi arid areas but with climate warming there are a series of problems associated with premature senescence and reduced production the dual mulching of ridges with black plastic film and furrows with straw proved to be an effective practice for increasing soil moisture yield wue lai and dry matter accumulation of summer maize while also improving the photosynthetic rate meanwhile the brm cultivation practice lowered average soil temperature extended the reproductive periods of summer maize and delayed premature senescence therefore the brm practice can be applied as a promising approach to delay premature senescence and increase the summer maize yield in this region of the loess plateau however further research on the brm practice will be required using a variety of crops over multiple sites and years conflict of interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work we declare that we do not have any

10724,efficiency is one of the most important assessment indicators in irrigation systems classical efficiency ce is not an exact index due to the lack of consideration of the return flows therefore the neoclassical concepts of the efficiency are considered to take a part of losses of irrigation water as a return flow into account quality of the return flows may change in their path and it must be considered in evaluating the efficiency and productivity of irrigation water this research was carried out to investigate this challenge sustainable efficiency se was applied based on the water balance and quality of return flows the methodology and detail for computing different parameters and their quality and beneficial coefficients in water balance equation were presented moghan irrigation and drainage network in the northwest of iran was selected as the study area and ce and se were calculated in meso and micro levels using the meteorological data cropping pattern irrigation water volume natural and artificial drainages infiltration and return flow quality in addition the irrigation water productivity was calculated by considering the volume of water based on the different concepts of efficiency quality coefficient related to return flow had different values in different months 0 85 in august and 1 in november and december the results showed that about 87 of inflow 91 of the rainfall 89 of the evapotranspiration 13 of the non reusable water and 91 of the return flow were useful in the study area the highest and the lowest efficiencies are occurred in september and november respectively the average of meso and micro sefficiencies were 72 and 47 5 respectively and the ce was 37 9 the results showed that water productivity based on the se is more than that of the ce the water productivity at the meso level also showed a higher value than at the micro level keywords sefficiency productivity return flow water quality water usefulness 1 introduction as water resources systems become more complex competition among different water users increases and need to food increases in the world simple efficiency indicators have recognized insufficient in supporting an effective water resources systems design and evaluation the efficiency is one of the most important evaluation indicators in the irrigation systems israelsen 1932 presented a concept that is nowadays regarded as the classical efficiency ce many researchers willardson et al 1994 seckler 1996 perry 1999 jensen 2007 molden et al 2010 huffaker 2008 ward and pulido velázquez 2008 reported examples of misunderstandings in water management activities and water conservation programs due to the inadequacy of ce concept because of the lack of attention to the return flows in irrigation there are three sources of water losses including evaporation from the surfaces of land water and plants that do not contribute to cultivated crop evapotranspiration drainage losses runoff and deep percolation and spillage losses due to mismatches between water supply and demand in ce they are considered water losses to the system as a whole ce at the farm can provide a meaningful concept of the efficiency however applying classical efficiency for water basins as a general principle may guide us to wrong decisions keller and keller 1995 various attempts have been made to solve these errors and mistakes which has eventually led to the concept of neoclassical efficiency several scholars have proposed a distinction between the concept of classical and neoclassical irrigation efficiency keller et al 1996 seckler et al 2003 haie and keller 2008 mateos 2008 the concept of neoclassical efficiency has led to a shift in irrigation perspective from the water delivery systems to a wider perspective that considers irrigation planning and management along with all the water resources within a particular basin in neoclassical efficiencies the water losses of ce are not necessarily real water losses to the system as a whole and many of these losses are captured and recycled elsewhere in the system which called return flows seckler et al 2003 also in the neoclassical concept of efficiency introduced by keller and keller 1995 all water losses are not considered to be unnecessary losses keller and keller 1995 believed that all water losses should not be considered as losses because some of them are returned to the hydrological cycle again the important point is that the return flow during this process has a different quality from the initial source therefore it is necessary to consider water quality of return flows which may be re used in calculating neoclassical efficiencies in other words return flow may not have the same value relative to irrigation water due to its lower quality e g higher salinity keller and keller 1995 developed a new relationship with considering the return flow and created an evolution in the calculations of efficiency in this relationship leaching has been described as a quality related parameter they evaluated this relationship in the grand valley at the downstream of the colorado river and the imperial irrigation district at the upstream of the colorado river in the united states and egypt s nile valley irrigation system haie and keller 2008 described a new relationship for the efficiency and introduced a coefficient w for the water quality in the relationship in order to calculate this coefficient the amount of leaching requirement lr is used the obtained relationship was tested in three regions of grand valley at downstream of the colorado river the imperial irrigation district at the upstream of the colorado river in the united states and the nile river in egypt in that research the coefficient of w was considered for the inflow water to the region and outflow from the region but the calculation method was not mentioned molden et al 1998 2003 and 2010 presented many approaches to increase water productivity and efficiency they stated that the effect of water quality on the calculation of water productivity and efficiency is one of the basic issues to be considered but did not examine how it was affected haie and keller 2011 presented a relationship for the calculation of the efficiency based on the principle of mass conservation and by considering the dimension of the usefulness of the parameters they investigated their relationship in the great region downstream of the colorado river nile river in egypt and a hypothetical city and a hypothetical agricultural area they estimated the quality and beneficial coefficients for a number of parameters but did not provide a methodology for calculating these coefficients they also calculated the efficiency at three macro meso and micro levels with and without considering the return flow and two states of simultaneous consideration of the beneficial and quality dimensions and taking into account only the beneficial dimension mokari ghahroodi et al 2015 evaluated irrigation systems in qazvin plain in iran by determining the classical and neoclassical irrigation efficiencies net and effective efficiencies in this research different components of water balance were measured in different irrigation methods and details of the calculation method for efficiency were presented however the water quality was not considered in the calculation of irrigation efficiency haie 2016 introduced the concept of sustainable efficiency sefficiency and stated this concept in based on food energy and water nexus and related the calculation of efficiency to food security all of the aforementioned studies have proved the superiority of neoclassical efficiencies to the classical efficiency all researchers believed that the water quality must be considered in efficiency and productivity calculations in the studies on the neoclassical efficiencies the water quality and its importance have been pointed out also in the concept of water efficiency with considering the quality and beneficial dimensions it is explicitly referred to the necessity of considering the dimension of water quality in efficiency calculations however the methodology for this calculation is not presented iran has always encountered water scarcity increasing the irrigation efficiency is one of the solutions that have been addressed to solve this problem increasing efficiency requires the correct calculation of the current efficiency in irrigation and drainage networks the sefficiency provides a highly accurate estimation of irrigation efficiency and it should be calculated at different levels by taking into account the beneficial and quality dimensions due to the novelty of sefficiency indicator based on water balance the complexity of its calculations and the lack of its application in different study areas the main purpose of this study was to provide a methodology and details for computing various water balance components and sefficiency with considering the quality of return flows another purpose is evaluation of irrigation water productivity by taking into account the different concepts of efficiency for this purpose moghan irrigation and drainage network in the northwest of iran was selected as the study area because of its great importance in producing agricultural productions in this country 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the moghan irrigation and drainage network is located at the northwest of iran and the west of the caspian sea it has 72 000 ha agricultural lands and the aras river is the main water resource the aras river is from the bingol dagh mountains of turkey its catchment area is 10 020 km2 and iran s share is 39 the rest of the aras catchment in turkey is 23 and in azerbaijan and armenia is 38 the maximum and minimum flow rates of aras river in normal and dry years in the milo moghan dam is 2600 and 180 m3 s 1 respectively on average 400 m3 s the main canal of the moghan irrigation and drainage network is supplied by the milo moghan diversion dam and eight sluice gates with a maximum discharge of 80 m3 s 1 this canal which acts as a mother canal has a predominantly earth body and its total length of the main canal is 113 km table 1 shows the characteristics of the network canals in addition excessive water is collected through existing drains and transferred to the aras river after transferring to the boundary drain a portion of the excess water is also entered to the aras river through a natural drainage the milo moghan dam was constructed at a distance of 260 km downstream of the aras reservoir dam and 53 km in the west of parsabad moghan city in aslanezou area on the aras river it was jointly operated by the two governments of the islamic republic of iran and the republic of azerbaijan fig 1 shows the location of the moghan irrigation and drainage network and the milo moghan diversion dam the average rainfall and relative humidity in the region are 279 mm and 72 respectively the average annual minimum average and maximum temperatures in the region were reported as 9 6 15 and 20 5 c respectively the total area of agricultural land in 2015 2016 was 91 243 ha of which 40 150 ha were cultivated in autumn and the rest in the summer the highest cultivation is related to wheat with an area of 34 183 ha and the lowest is related to olive orchards with a cultivated area of 531 ha most of the agricultural land is irrigated by surface irrigation and the average water consumption is 10 000 m3 year 1 ha 1 2 2 efficiency based on water balance efficiency based on the water balance sefficiency se is calculated by eq 1 haie and keller 2011 1 s e e t n r i v 2 r p v 1 o s p p c v 2 r p s where et is evapotranspiration and nr is water which completely depleted from the system and cannot be reused non reusable such as wind draft and water evaporation losses in sprinkler irrigation water entering the salt lake water evaporated from the canals or reservoirs v2 is the output water which can be rf or vd based on the studied level as shown in fig 2 rf is the water released from the area and returns to the main source and vd is the volume of water at downstream of the area where rf returned to the main source the water balance parameters which used in eq 1 are illustrated in fig 2 rp is the potential return flow which can return but has not returned yet for example the water volume remaining in the soil storage capacity can either be removed by drains from the area or it can return to the main source as deep percolation as described for rf but has not yet returned however it has the potential to be returned v1 is the input volume of water which can be vu or va according to the studied level as shown in fig 2 va is the abstracted water from the main source for irrigating the area and vu is the volume of water at upstream os is the inflow water from additional sources other than the main source e g if the main source is the river the amount of water extracted from the underground aquifer through the wells can be considered as os pp is total rainfall and se is sefficiency the two coefficients i inflow models and c consumptive models correspond to two water balances useful inflow and effective consumption each coefficient is either zero or one with their sum equal to one the subscribe s indicates that the useful part of the parameters is considered in the calculation of se one of the most basic points in the eq 1 is usefulness dimensions of the parameters in order to define the practical indices such as the efficiency the usefulness of the parameters should be determined in eq 1 both beneficial and quality dimensions are considered for each parameter in order to be useful which are respectively denoted by b and q quality dimension is related to the water quality and it is about a system in which the water flows while the beneficial dimension depends on the place of consumption and the purpose of the water consumption given these two dimensions the useful part of a parameter xs which used in eq 1 is defined based on eqs 2 to 4 haie and keller 2011 2 x q w q x x 3 x b w b x x 4 x s w q x w b x x xq indicates the effective value of parameter x in terms of quality and wqx is quality weight this coefficient depends on the water compound and the path through which the water passes and determined by the frameworks and indices of the water quality in each region wqx is calculated based on downstream conditions for example when salt resistant crops are cultivated in downstream lands wqx is higher and when the salt sensitive crops are cultivated it decreases xb shows the beneficial part of the parameter x and wbx is beneficial weight defined according to the purpose of the project and divides the water consumption into two beneficial and non beneficial parts the value of the beneficial weight is obtained by dividing the beneficial part of a parameter by the total value of that parameter haie and keller 2011 were estimated the coefficient of wb and wq for a number of parameters however the method of calculation was not presented in the study of irrigation efficiency based on the water balance in the irrigation and drainage networks the accurate estimation of wbx and wqx is of great importance since geographic scale may affect the estimation of efficiency three levels of macro meso and micro were considered as the levels of sefficiency estimation and analysis haie and keller 2011 macro sefficiency eq 5 shows the relationship between the useful outflow and total inflow to a water resource such as a river at the macro level the water resource may have several outlets or branches for example a river can have several outlets for different irrigation networks fig 3 the macro sefficiency macrose is generally used for managers and authorities to decide on the water allocation and transfer eq 5 5 m a c r o s e e t n r i v d r p v u o s p p c v d r p s meso sefficiency eq 6 is the relation between the useful outflow and the total inflow within one of the branches in the macro level such as an irrigation network that abstracted the required water from a river fig 3 meso sefficiency mesose is commonly used by managers and authorities to operate a part of the water resource 6 m e s o s e e t n r i r f r p v a o s p p c r f r p s micro sefficiency eq 7 is to examine the relationship between the useful outflow and the total inflow within one of the branches in the meso level for example a farm or a part of the irrigation network fig 3 in fact the micro sefficiency microse is the calculation of efficiency in a field regardless of the return flows this efficiency is generally important for the operators of a water resource for example it is important for a farmer 7 m i c r o s e e t n r v a o s p p s all three levels of efficiency analysis are necessary for the management of the water resources this may lead to multi objective planning and multi purpose management by managers and operators according to the definition of efficiency levels moghan irrigation and drainage network is considered as a meso level fig 3 2 3 data collection and calculation of parameters in order to calculate irrigation efficiency of the moghan irrigation and drainage network all parameters of eq 6 and the quality and beneficial coefficients associated with the parameters were calculated for this purpose the data related to the cropping pattern table 2 water and soil quality of the region characteristics and dimensions of the water conveyance canals inflow rate into the network outflow rate from the artificial and natural drainages and meteorological data were collected using the meteorological data and eto calculator software raes 2009 the reference evapotranspiration of the area was calculated and the monthly evapotranspiration of each crop was determined according to the eq 8 allen et al 1998 8 e t e t o k c in which et is the crop evapotranspiration mm eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm and kc is the crop coefficient as mentioned before in order to calculate the coefficient wb the beneficial and non beneficial parts of the parameter must be determined the beneficial part of the et is the transpiration and non beneficial part is evaporation according to the eq 9 the transpiration rate of different crops was calculated and the evaporation rate was derived by subtracting the transpiration from the evapotranspiration on a monthly basis 9 t c k c b e t o where t c mm is transpiration and kcb is the basal crop coefficient due to the transpiration the amount of crop coefficients basal coefficients and growth period of each crop were extracted from fao report no 56 allen et al 1998 and adjusted with the study area with summation of evapotranspiration rates of various crops based on the value of cultivation area evapotranspiration and transpiration of the study area were calculated regionally in addition the evaporation rate was calculated by subtracting the transpiration from the evapotranspiration rate of the study area the coefficient wbet for the study area is derived from eq 10 10 w b e t t c e t due to the nature of the evapotranspiration and since the water transpiration due to the plant and the evaporation from the soil surface enter the atmosphere the coefficient wqet is considered as one the value of daily rainfall in the study area was obtained from parsabad meteorological station due to the good quality of the rainwater its wqpp value was considered one the beneficial part of the rainfall is directly consumed by the plant and it provides a portion of the required water and the rest is considered to be non beneficial part of the rainfall the beneficial part of the rainfall is in fact the effective rainfall hence the monthly effective rainfall was determined for each plant using the usda s method dastane 1974 in months when the plant requires water eq 11 11 p e f f p 125 125 0 02 p where peff is the effective rainfall mm and p is the monthly rainfall mm peff and pp was calculated regionally based on the values of cultivation area related to various crops and the coefficient wbpp was determined from eq 12 12 w b p p p e f f p p the study area is defined at the meso level fig 3 hence the inflow is denoted by va m 3 the amount of va is the volume of water entering the moghan irrigation and drainage network for agricultural use data related to the va and the volume of water delivered to the farmers fields vf m 3 was obtained monthly for 2015 2016 from the regional water authority of ardabil province table 3 in order to calculate the coefficient wbva the beneficial part is the water delivered to the farmers fields for irrigation and the non beneficial part is the water losses in the transfer path the wbva was calculated using eq 13 13 w b v a v f v a the coefficient wqva was calculated proportional to the reduction in crop yield due to the water salinity the reduction in crop yield due to the water salinity was calculated for each crop using eq 14 wqva was considered equivalent to the relative crop yield expected under e c e e c e t h r e s h o l d for each crop the river salinity has little fluctuations in different months of the year and its average salinity was 1 12 ds m 1 by weighting the wqva related to each crop based on the values of cultivation area the wqva was obtained regionally for the studied area 14 y a y m 1 e c e e c e t h r e s h o l d b 100 where ya is the actual crop yield kg ym is the maximum expected crop yield kg for ece ecethreshold b is the gradient of the reduction in the crop yield for increasing 1 ds m 1electrical conductivity of the soil saturated extract ece is the soil saturated extract salinity which is twice the salinity of the inflow water into the area ds m 1 ecethreshold is the threshold soil saturated extract the values of ecethreshold and b were extracted from the fao technical reports no 29 and 48 fao 1992 1989 for the crops of the study area according to the efficiency level in this study the outflow v2 is denoted by rf which consists of the return flow to the aras river through the artificial drainage network and natural drainage and also the recycle of a part of drained water in moghan irrigation and drainage network data related to the outflow of artificial drainage and their monthly salinity and also the amount of natural drainage of the area average of it is 0 065 l s ha were obtained from the regional water authority of ardabil province table 3 there was not recycling of drainage water in 2015 2016 by entering the return flow drainage water to the aras river the water quality for downstream users is changed and these changes indicate the usefulness of the return flow in terms of water quality considering the cropping pattern at the downstream the relative crop yield due to the reduction in the water salinity of the aras river was obtained using eq 14 and considered as wqrf therefore w q rf is calculated based on the downstream conditions when salt resistant crops are cultivated in downstream lands wqrf is higher in other words return flow is useful and when the salt sensitive crops are cultivated it decreases in other words return flow isn t useful the salinity of natural drainage was considered equivalent to average salinity of underground drains 4 7 ds m 1 and the salinity of the artificial drainage at the entrance to the river is 2 9 ds m 1 regional water authority of ardabil province 2015 by using eq 15 and assuming rapid mixing sharma and ahmad 2014 the changes in the salinity of the river after entering the return flow drainage water were estimated as follows 15 e c q r e c r q r f e c r f q r q r f where qr is the aras river flow rate m3 s 1 qrf is the return flow rate m3 s 1 including discharge of artificial and natural drainages ecr is the water salinity of aras river ds m 1 ecrf is the water salinity of the return flow ds m 1 artificial and natural drainages and ec is the water salinity of aras river after entering the return flows ds m 1 it should be noted since downstream lands are in azerbaijan and no data was available in this region it was assumed that the cropping pattern of downstream lands is the same as those of upstream it was also assumed that the return flow including artificial and natural drainages had no loss until reaching the aras river therefore the coefficient wbrf was considered equal to 1 there are three types of non reusable flow nr in the study area including evaporation from the water surface of canals deep percolation and evaporation from the soil surface the evaporation rate from the canals was calculated according to eq 16 allen et al 1998 16 e c k e p a n where ec is the evaporation from the water surface epan is the evaporation from the surface of the pan and k is the pan coefficient since irrigation of the lands is carried out only through irrigation networks and groundwater does not interfere with the irrigation of the land therefore the flowing water percolated deeply out of the area is considered as non reusable flow deep percolation dp rate was calculated based on the water balance equation in the study area evaporation from the soil surface was also estimated by subtracting the transpiration from evapotranspiration due to the fact that the purpose of the project is to produce the crop the evaporation from the canals and the soil surface were considered to be completely non beneficial and the coefficient wb for them were considered to be zero regarding the amount of water percolated deeply from the area a part of deep percolation which leaches the soil profile was considered beneficial the rest was non beneficial eq 17 was used to calculate the leaching water rhoades and merrill 1976 17 l r e c w 5 e c e e c w in which lr is leaching requirement ratio no dimension and ecw is the irrigation water salinity ds m 1 the lr was obtained regionally for the studied area and wbdp was calculated based on eq 18 18 w b d p l r d p for evaporation from the canal and soil surfaces the quality will not be affected and therefore wq coefficient for them was considered to be one due to high quality of water entering the study area the coefficient wqdp was also considered to be one in order to facilitate the calculation the area was considered as a separated region therefore the value of os was zero in addition in the study area rp can be the volume of water stored in the soil storage capacity at the end of a period and can be used in the next period for the following period this flow can be considered as a flow from other sources os since the calculation of efficiency is based on a water balance if some water remains in the soil capacity at the end of the year 2014 2015 it can be considered as os for the years 2015 2016 on the other hand the amount of water remaining at the end of the year 2015 2016 is considered as rp since these two parameters will be equal and deducted from each other in the calculation of efficiency based on eq 6 their calculation will not change in the efficiency therefore in the research the values of this flow were considered to be zero fig 4 presents a flowchart of the proposed methodology for computing sefficiency and different water balance parameters and their quality and beneficial coefficients 2 4 classical efficiency in order to better understand the difference in the calculation of the efficiency the classical efficiency i e was calculated according to the eq 19 and was compared with the sefficiency at the meso and micro levels 19 i e e t p e f f v a 2 5 water productivity since the calculation of physical water productivity wp is desirable in this research the average yield for each crop y a was obtained from organization of agriculture jihad of ardabil province then based on the calculated efficiency and gross irrigation requirement wp was calculated at the meso and micro levels based on eq 20 and compared with calculated wp according to conventional method by taking into account the classical efficiency in calculating the gross irrigation requirement 20 w p y a e t p e f f i e m i c r o s e m e s o s e 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiencies the values related to the parameters of the water balance equation the associated coefficients of wq and wb and the useful part of each parameter are given in table 4 the coefficient wqva had different values in different months because of the difference between crops cultivated in different months table 4 the wqva was equal to 1 in november and march this is due to the fact that during these months only wheat and barley were cultivated on the farm land whose salinity threshold was higher than that of the inflow while in other months this coefficient was less than one due to the cultivation of crops whose salinity thresholds were lower than the salinity of irrigation water therefore crop yield was less than its potential and the coefficient wqva decreased regarding coefficient wbva the difference among the values in the various months indicated the difference in the volume of inflow rate and the water allocated to the farmers in october 95 of the inflow rate was allocated to the farmers and there were 5 losses while coefficient wbva reached 89 in march 11 losses the high value of wbva indicated the proper water allocation to the network according to the needs of the operators on demand allocation of irrigation water about the coefficient wbpp increasing this coefficient indicates that more rainfall is used the low values in some months are due to the low level of cultivation in that month this coefficient in june is equivalent to 0 96 and in november is 0 53 while in the march all crops are on the farm land and use the rainfall while in november only autumn crops are on the farm land as a result the major part of precipitation in this month is non beneficial for our purpose irrigation the low value of wbet associated with the et in november is due to the low cultivation area in this month and low air temperature the reason for high rate of this coefficient in september is high cultivation area and high air temperature and consequently the transpiration rate is increased since the main purpose in the irrigation and drainage network is to irrigate the farms and produce the crops the evaporation from the soil surface and irrigation canals is non beneficial therefore the coefficient wb in these two components will be zero in other words the evaporation from the soil surface and irrigation canals was non beneficial the coefficient wbdp was calculated based on the leaching requirement in the months with high cultivation area leaching requirement is increased and a greater amount of dp is used for leaching and as a result the coefficient wbdp is increased the highest value of this coefficient is occurred in september which all crops are on the farm land and the smallest is occurred in november which the wheat and barley are just cultivated the coefficient wqrf in different months has different values because of the difference in cultivation area in different months and crop response to the salinity in november and december this coefficient is equal to one i e during these months all water has good quality for consumers the reason is that in these two months wheat and barley are cultivated in which the salinity threshold are higher than the salinity threshold for irrigation water mixing the return water with river water however in august the lowest value of wqrf is occurred which is due to the cultivation of summer crops salinity thresholds below the salinity of the irrigation water table 5 shows the percent of usefulness of each parameter per year in the years 2015 2016 as mentioned before the usefulness of each parameter indicates how the parameter was useful in the study area in terms of water quality and beneficially the highest amount of usefulness in the study area at the meso level is related to the rf and the lowest is related to the nr table 6 our results demonstrated that about 87 of inflow 91 of the rainfall 89 of the et 13 of the nr and 91 of the rf were useful in the study area the highest and the lowest efficiencies are respectively occurred in september and november fig 5 the average sefficiency at the meso level in the study area is 72 high efficiency in some months like september is due to the proper water allocation this means that in months with high water efficiency the water is allocated to the needs of the area but in the months with lower water efficiency more water is allocated than the water needs of the area in addition in the months with high rainfall this is more evident because a part of the needs for water is supplied by rainfall and it is not necessary to allocate the water the highest and the lowest values of micro sefficiency are occurred on september and november respectively the average micro sefficiency of the irrigation network is 47 5 the reduction in the efficiency especially in the seasons where there is a lower water requirement is clearly evident the reason for sharp reduction in the efficiency in november is low water requirement for irrigation in the region that could be compensated by effective rainfall table 4 however for mismanagement reasons the water allocation to the area without considering the values of irrigation water requirement and effective rainfall water enters to the network and the volume of drainage water increases in this month since the volume of outflow in terms of the study s level micro level is not useful the efficiency decreases sharply while in high consumption months such as september due to the high water requirement in the area and the low effective rainfall the volume of drainage water decreases as a result there will be a lower difference between the micro and meso sefficiencies the difference between the classical efficiency meso and micro sefficiencies are presented in fig 5 the highest and lowest classical efficiency is related to september and november respectively the average classical efficiency is obtained as 37 9 the reason for zero value of the classical efficiency in november is high effective rainfall in this month which supplies all water requirements while water is allocated to the network in this month due to mismanagement reasons as seen there is a large difference between the classical and micro and meso sefficiencies especially in the months with high water consumption in all months the classical efficiency shows a lower amount than the micro and meso sefficiencies according to the results of keller and keller 1995 in the grand valley at the downstream of the colorado river and egypt s nile valley irrigation system the reason for the difference between classical micro and meso sefficiencies in the region is the existence of the return flows of course the difference between the classical efficiency and meso sefficiency is greater than the difference between the classical efficiency and micro sefficiency due to the presence of the return flows in the meso level 3 2 water productivity the water productivity at the different concepts of efficiencyare presented in table 6 the maximum and minimum values of wp were obtained for meso sefficiency and the classical efficiency respectively according to the special situations of the aras river in terms of geographical location micro sefficiency will be representative efficiency for the study area therefore wp at the micro level in the study area represents the water productivity of the region the reason of higher wp at the micro sefficiency compared to the classical efficiency is that in classical efficiency all losses of the system are considered as non reusable losses while in the micro sefficiency the entire non reusable flow which includes losses of the system is not considered as losses and the portion required for leaching is deducted from the system losses 4 conclusion considering the assessment level of the efficiency in management decisions is very important the aras river is an international border river and is exited out of the country after the arrival of return flows and so the return flows are practically non useful for the country therefore micro sefficiency is the representative efficiency of the study area and making management decisions is necessary in the region based on micro sefficiency to increase the efficiency it can be noted that if the representative efficiency of the area is considered as the meso sefficiency the non reusable flow needs to be reduced however if the micro sefficiency is considered as the region s representative efficiency it is necessary to avoid the return flow losses out of the area this suggests that the correct calculation of the efficiency in the region can affect management decisions the effect of the return flow quality on the efficiency calculations represents itself with wqrf coefficient the higher the coefficient wqrf the greater usefulness of the return flow in the study area the coefficient wqrf was calculated on a monthly basis the difference in the value of coefficient wqrf in different months is due to the different cropping pattern at the downstream for example in november and march the coefficient wqrf is equal to one due to the cultivation of salt resistant crops with higher salinity thresholds than the return flow salinity while in the following months the coefficient wqrf decreased due to the cultivation of crops with lower salinity thresholds if some crops are cultivated in downstream reaches with more salinity thresholds than the salinity of return flow the coefficient wqrf and consequently the efficiency will increase the average classical efficiency in the moghan irrigation and drainage network was 37 9 percent furthermore the meso and micro sefficiencies were obtained as 72 0 and 47 5 percent respectively the reason for the high meso sefficiency compared to micro sefficiency and the classical efficiency is the lack of considering the return flows as losses in other words in meso sefficiency the return flow is considered to be a useful outflow hence water loss is reduced and efficiency is increased the reason for high micro sefficiency as compared to the classical efficiency is the lack of taking into account the leaching requirement as losses in micro sefficiency in other words a part of deep percolation used for leaching is considered as a useful outflow of the system increasing the efficiency while in the classical efficiency this part of the losses is considered non useful considering the assessment level of the water productivity in management decisions is very important since the micro sefficiency is a representative efficiency of the region the water productivity at the micro level can be considered as water productivity in the study area therefore water productivity at the micro level is the representative water productivity of the study area and making management decisions is necessary in the region based on it this recommends that the correct calculation of the efficiency and consequently water productivity in the region can affect management decisions also uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of input data for calculating the sefficiency at different levels macro meso and micro are recommend to be considered in

10724,efficiency is one of the most important assessment indicators in irrigation systems classical efficiency ce is not an exact index due to the lack of consideration of the return flows therefore the neoclassical concepts of the efficiency are considered to take a part of losses of irrigation water as a return flow into account quality of the return flows may change in their path and it must be considered in evaluating the efficiency and productivity of irrigation water this research was carried out to investigate this challenge sustainable efficiency se was applied based on the water balance and quality of return flows the methodology and detail for computing different parameters and their quality and beneficial coefficients in water balance equation were presented moghan irrigation and drainage network in the northwest of iran was selected as the study area and ce and se were calculated in meso and micro levels using the meteorological data cropping pattern irrigation water volume natural and artificial drainages infiltration and return flow quality in addition the irrigation water productivity was calculated by considering the volume of water based on the different concepts of efficiency quality coefficient related to return flow had different values in different months 0 85 in august and 1 in november and december the results showed that about 87 of inflow 91 of the rainfall 89 of the evapotranspiration 13 of the non reusable water and 91 of the return flow were useful in the study area the highest and the lowest efficiencies are occurred in september and november respectively the average of meso and micro sefficiencies were 72 and 47 5 respectively and the ce was 37 9 the results showed that water productivity based on the se is more than that of the ce the water productivity at the meso level also showed a higher value than at the micro level keywords sefficiency productivity return flow water quality water usefulness 1 introduction as water resources systems become more complex competition among different water users increases and need to food increases in the world simple efficiency indicators have recognized insufficient in supporting an effective water resources systems design and evaluation the efficiency is one of the most important evaluation indicators in the irrigation systems israelsen 1932 presented a concept that is nowadays regarded as the classical efficiency ce many researchers willardson et al 1994 seckler 1996 perry 1999 jensen 2007 molden et al 2010 huffaker 2008 ward and pulido velázquez 2008 reported examples of misunderstandings in water management activities and water conservation programs due to the inadequacy of ce concept because of the lack of attention to the return flows in irrigation there are three sources of water losses including evaporation from the surfaces of land water and plants that do not contribute to cultivated crop evapotranspiration drainage losses runoff and deep percolation and spillage losses due to mismatches between water supply and demand in ce they are considered water losses to the system as a whole ce at the farm can provide a meaningful concept of the efficiency however applying classical efficiency for water basins as a general principle may guide us to wrong decisions keller and keller 1995 various attempts have been made to solve these errors and mistakes which has eventually led to the concept of neoclassical efficiency several scholars have proposed a distinction between the concept of classical and neoclassical irrigation efficiency keller et al 1996 seckler et al 2003 haie and keller 2008 mateos 2008 the concept of neoclassical efficiency has led to a shift in irrigation perspective from the water delivery systems to a wider perspective that considers irrigation planning and management along with all the water resources within a particular basin in neoclassical efficiencies the water losses of ce are not necessarily real water losses to the system as a whole and many of these losses are captured and recycled elsewhere in the system which called return flows seckler et al 2003 also in the neoclassical concept of efficiency introduced by keller and keller 1995 all water losses are not considered to be unnecessary losses keller and keller 1995 believed that all water losses should not be considered as losses because some of them are returned to the hydrological cycle again the important point is that the return flow during this process has a different quality from the initial source therefore it is necessary to consider water quality of return flows which may be re used in calculating neoclassical efficiencies in other words return flow may not have the same value relative to irrigation water due to its lower quality e g higher salinity keller and keller 1995 developed a new relationship with considering the return flow and created an evolution in the calculations of efficiency in this relationship leaching has been described as a quality related parameter they evaluated this relationship in the grand valley at the downstream of the colorado river and the imperial irrigation district at the upstream of the colorado river in the united states and egypt s nile valley irrigation system haie and keller 2008 described a new relationship for the efficiency and introduced a coefficient w for the water quality in the relationship in order to calculate this coefficient the amount of leaching requirement lr is used the obtained relationship was tested in three regions of grand valley at downstream of the colorado river the imperial irrigation district at the upstream of the colorado river in the united states and the nile river in egypt in that research the coefficient of w was considered for the inflow water to the region and outflow from the region but the calculation method was not mentioned molden et al 1998 2003 and 2010 presented many approaches to increase water productivity and efficiency they stated that the effect of water quality on the calculation of water productivity and efficiency is one of the basic issues to be considered but did not examine how it was affected haie and keller 2011 presented a relationship for the calculation of the efficiency based on the principle of mass conservation and by considering the dimension of the usefulness of the parameters they investigated their relationship in the great region downstream of the colorado river nile river in egypt and a hypothetical city and a hypothetical agricultural area they estimated the quality and beneficial coefficients for a number of parameters but did not provide a methodology for calculating these coefficients they also calculated the efficiency at three macro meso and micro levels with and without considering the return flow and two states of simultaneous consideration of the beneficial and quality dimensions and taking into account only the beneficial dimension mokari ghahroodi et al 2015 evaluated irrigation systems in qazvin plain in iran by determining the classical and neoclassical irrigation efficiencies net and effective efficiencies in this research different components of water balance were measured in different irrigation methods and details of the calculation method for efficiency were presented however the water quality was not considered in the calculation of irrigation efficiency haie 2016 introduced the concept of sustainable efficiency sefficiency and stated this concept in based on food energy and water nexus and related the calculation of efficiency to food security all of the aforementioned studies have proved the superiority of neoclassical efficiencies to the classical efficiency all researchers believed that the water quality must be considered in efficiency and productivity calculations in the studies on the neoclassical efficiencies the water quality and its importance have been pointed out also in the concept of water efficiency with considering the quality and beneficial dimensions it is explicitly referred to the necessity of considering the dimension of water quality in efficiency calculations however the methodology for this calculation is not presented iran has always encountered water scarcity increasing the irrigation efficiency is one of the solutions that have been addressed to solve this problem increasing efficiency requires the correct calculation of the current efficiency in irrigation and drainage networks the sefficiency provides a highly accurate estimation of irrigation efficiency and it should be calculated at different levels by taking into account the beneficial and quality dimensions due to the novelty of sefficiency indicator based on water balance the complexity of its calculations and the lack of its application in different study areas the main purpose of this study was to provide a methodology and details for computing various water balance components and sefficiency with considering the quality of return flows another purpose is evaluation of irrigation water productivity by taking into account the different concepts of efficiency for this purpose moghan irrigation and drainage network in the northwest of iran was selected as the study area because of its great importance in producing agricultural productions in this country 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the moghan irrigation and drainage network is located at the northwest of iran and the west of the caspian sea it has 72 000 ha agricultural lands and the aras river is the main water resource the aras river is from the bingol dagh mountains of turkey its catchment area is 10 020 km2 and iran s share is 39 the rest of the aras catchment in turkey is 23 and in azerbaijan and armenia is 38 the maximum and minimum flow rates of aras river in normal and dry years in the milo moghan dam is 2600 and 180 m3 s 1 respectively on average 400 m3 s the main canal of the moghan irrigation and drainage network is supplied by the milo moghan diversion dam and eight sluice gates with a maximum discharge of 80 m3 s 1 this canal which acts as a mother canal has a predominantly earth body and its total length of the main canal is 113 km table 1 shows the characteristics of the network canals in addition excessive water is collected through existing drains and transferred to the aras river after transferring to the boundary drain a portion of the excess water is also entered to the aras river through a natural drainage the milo moghan dam was constructed at a distance of 260 km downstream of the aras reservoir dam and 53 km in the west of parsabad moghan city in aslanezou area on the aras river it was jointly operated by the two governments of the islamic republic of iran and the republic of azerbaijan fig 1 shows the location of the moghan irrigation and drainage network and the milo moghan diversion dam the average rainfall and relative humidity in the region are 279 mm and 72 respectively the average annual minimum average and maximum temperatures in the region were reported as 9 6 15 and 20 5 c respectively the total area of agricultural land in 2015 2016 was 91 243 ha of which 40 150 ha were cultivated in autumn and the rest in the summer the highest cultivation is related to wheat with an area of 34 183 ha and the lowest is related to olive orchards with a cultivated area of 531 ha most of the agricultural land is irrigated by surface irrigation and the average water consumption is 10 000 m3 year 1 ha 1 2 2 efficiency based on water balance efficiency based on the water balance sefficiency se is calculated by eq 1 haie and keller 2011 1 s e e t n r i v 2 r p v 1 o s p p c v 2 r p s where et is evapotranspiration and nr is water which completely depleted from the system and cannot be reused non reusable such as wind draft and water evaporation losses in sprinkler irrigation water entering the salt lake water evaporated from the canals or reservoirs v2 is the output water which can be rf or vd based on the studied level as shown in fig 2 rf is the water released from the area and returns to the main source and vd is the volume of water at downstream of the area where rf returned to the main source the water balance parameters which used in eq 1 are illustrated in fig 2 rp is the potential return flow which can return but has not returned yet for example the water volume remaining in the soil storage capacity can either be removed by drains from the area or it can return to the main source as deep percolation as described for rf but has not yet returned however it has the potential to be returned v1 is the input volume of water which can be vu or va according to the studied level as shown in fig 2 va is the abstracted water from the main source for irrigating the area and vu is the volume of water at upstream os is the inflow water from additional sources other than the main source e g if the main source is the river the amount of water extracted from the underground aquifer through the wells can be considered as os pp is total rainfall and se is sefficiency the two coefficients i inflow models and c consumptive models correspond to two water balances useful inflow and effective consumption each coefficient is either zero or one with their sum equal to one the subscribe s indicates that the useful part of the parameters is considered in the calculation of se one of the most basic points in the eq 1 is usefulness dimensions of the parameters in order to define the practical indices such as the efficiency the usefulness of the parameters should be determined in eq 1 both beneficial and quality dimensions are considered for each parameter in order to be useful which are respectively denoted by b and q quality dimension is related to the water quality and it is about a system in which the water flows while the beneficial dimension depends on the place of consumption and the purpose of the water consumption given these two dimensions the useful part of a parameter xs which used in eq 1 is defined based on eqs 2 to 4 haie and keller 2011 2 x q w q x x 3 x b w b x x 4 x s w q x w b x x xq indicates the effective value of parameter x in terms of quality and wqx is quality weight this coefficient depends on the water compound and the path through which the water passes and determined by the frameworks and indices of the water quality in each region wqx is calculated based on downstream conditions for example when salt resistant crops are cultivated in downstream lands wqx is higher and when the salt sensitive crops are cultivated it decreases xb shows the beneficial part of the parameter x and wbx is beneficial weight defined according to the purpose of the project and divides the water consumption into two beneficial and non beneficial parts the value of the beneficial weight is obtained by dividing the beneficial part of a parameter by the total value of that parameter haie and keller 2011 were estimated the coefficient of wb and wq for a number of parameters however the method of calculation was not presented in the study of irrigation efficiency based on the water balance in the irrigation and drainage networks the accurate estimation of wbx and wqx is of great importance since geographic scale may affect the estimation of efficiency three levels of macro meso and micro were considered as the levels of sefficiency estimation and analysis haie and keller 2011 macro sefficiency eq 5 shows the relationship between the useful outflow and total inflow to a water resource such as a river at the macro level the water resource may have several outlets or branches for example a river can have several outlets for different irrigation networks fig 3 the macro sefficiency macrose is generally used for managers and authorities to decide on the water allocation and transfer eq 5 5 m a c r o s e e t n r i v d r p v u o s p p c v d r p s meso sefficiency eq 6 is the relation between the useful outflow and the total inflow within one of the branches in the macro level such as an irrigation network that abstracted the required water from a river fig 3 meso sefficiency mesose is commonly used by managers and authorities to operate a part of the water resource 6 m e s o s e e t n r i r f r p v a o s p p c r f r p s micro sefficiency eq 7 is to examine the relationship between the useful outflow and the total inflow within one of the branches in the meso level for example a farm or a part of the irrigation network fig 3 in fact the micro sefficiency microse is the calculation of efficiency in a field regardless of the return flows this efficiency is generally important for the operators of a water resource for example it is important for a farmer 7 m i c r o s e e t n r v a o s p p s all three levels of efficiency analysis are necessary for the management of the water resources this may lead to multi objective planning and multi purpose management by managers and operators according to the definition of efficiency levels moghan irrigation and drainage network is considered as a meso level fig 3 2 3 data collection and calculation of parameters in order to calculate irrigation efficiency of the moghan irrigation and drainage network all parameters of eq 6 and the quality and beneficial coefficients associated with the parameters were calculated for this purpose the data related to the cropping pattern table 2 water and soil quality of the region characteristics and dimensions of the water conveyance canals inflow rate into the network outflow rate from the artificial and natural drainages and meteorological data were collected using the meteorological data and eto calculator software raes 2009 the reference evapotranspiration of the area was calculated and the monthly evapotranspiration of each crop was determined according to the eq 8 allen et al 1998 8 e t e t o k c in which et is the crop evapotranspiration mm eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm and kc is the crop coefficient as mentioned before in order to calculate the coefficient wb the beneficial and non beneficial parts of the parameter must be determined the beneficial part of the et is the transpiration and non beneficial part is evaporation according to the eq 9 the transpiration rate of different crops was calculated and the evaporation rate was derived by subtracting the transpiration from the evapotranspiration on a monthly basis 9 t c k c b e t o where t c mm is transpiration and kcb is the basal crop coefficient due to the transpiration the amount of crop coefficients basal coefficients and growth period of each crop were extracted from fao report no 56 allen et al 1998 and adjusted with the study area with summation of evapotranspiration rates of various crops based on the value of cultivation area evapotranspiration and transpiration of the study area were calculated regionally in addition the evaporation rate was calculated by subtracting the transpiration from the evapotranspiration rate of the study area the coefficient wbet for the study area is derived from eq 10 10 w b e t t c e t due to the nature of the evapotranspiration and since the water transpiration due to the plant and the evaporation from the soil surface enter the atmosphere the coefficient wqet is considered as one the value of daily rainfall in the study area was obtained from parsabad meteorological station due to the good quality of the rainwater its wqpp value was considered one the beneficial part of the rainfall is directly consumed by the plant and it provides a portion of the required water and the rest is considered to be non beneficial part of the rainfall the beneficial part of the rainfall is in fact the effective rainfall hence the monthly effective rainfall was determined for each plant using the usda s method dastane 1974 in months when the plant requires water eq 11 11 p e f f p 125 125 0 02 p where peff is the effective rainfall mm and p is the monthly rainfall mm peff and pp was calculated regionally based on the values of cultivation area related to various crops and the coefficient wbpp was determined from eq 12 12 w b p p p e f f p p the study area is defined at the meso level fig 3 hence the inflow is denoted by va m 3 the amount of va is the volume of water entering the moghan irrigation and drainage network for agricultural use data related to the va and the volume of water delivered to the farmers fields vf m 3 was obtained monthly for 2015 2016 from the regional water authority of ardabil province table 3 in order to calculate the coefficient wbva the beneficial part is the water delivered to the farmers fields for irrigation and the non beneficial part is the water losses in the transfer path the wbva was calculated using eq 13 13 w b v a v f v a the coefficient wqva was calculated proportional to the reduction in crop yield due to the water salinity the reduction in crop yield due to the water salinity was calculated for each crop using eq 14 wqva was considered equivalent to the relative crop yield expected under e c e e c e t h r e s h o l d for each crop the river salinity has little fluctuations in different months of the year and its average salinity was 1 12 ds m 1 by weighting the wqva related to each crop based on the values of cultivation area the wqva was obtained regionally for the studied area 14 y a y m 1 e c e e c e t h r e s h o l d b 100 where ya is the actual crop yield kg ym is the maximum expected crop yield kg for ece ecethreshold b is the gradient of the reduction in the crop yield for increasing 1 ds m 1electrical conductivity of the soil saturated extract ece is the soil saturated extract salinity which is twice the salinity of the inflow water into the area ds m 1 ecethreshold is the threshold soil saturated extract the values of ecethreshold and b were extracted from the fao technical reports no 29 and 48 fao 1992 1989 for the crops of the study area according to the efficiency level in this study the outflow v2 is denoted by rf which consists of the return flow to the aras river through the artificial drainage network and natural drainage and also the recycle of a part of drained water in moghan irrigation and drainage network data related to the outflow of artificial drainage and their monthly salinity and also the amount of natural drainage of the area average of it is 0 065 l s ha were obtained from the regional water authority of ardabil province table 3 there was not recycling of drainage water in 2015 2016 by entering the return flow drainage water to the aras river the water quality for downstream users is changed and these changes indicate the usefulness of the return flow in terms of water quality considering the cropping pattern at the downstream the relative crop yield due to the reduction in the water salinity of the aras river was obtained using eq 14 and considered as wqrf therefore w q rf is calculated based on the downstream conditions when salt resistant crops are cultivated in downstream lands wqrf is higher in other words return flow is useful and when the salt sensitive crops are cultivated it decreases in other words return flow isn t useful the salinity of natural drainage was considered equivalent to average salinity of underground drains 4 7 ds m 1 and the salinity of the artificial drainage at the entrance to the river is 2 9 ds m 1 regional water authority of ardabil province 2015 by using eq 15 and assuming rapid mixing sharma and ahmad 2014 the changes in the salinity of the river after entering the return flow drainage water were estimated as follows 15 e c q r e c r q r f e c r f q r q r f where qr is the aras river flow rate m3 s 1 qrf is the return flow rate m3 s 1 including discharge of artificial and natural drainages ecr is the water salinity of aras river ds m 1 ecrf is the water salinity of the return flow ds m 1 artificial and natural drainages and ec is the water salinity of aras river after entering the return flows ds m 1 it should be noted since downstream lands are in azerbaijan and no data was available in this region it was assumed that the cropping pattern of downstream lands is the same as those of upstream it was also assumed that the return flow including artificial and natural drainages had no loss until reaching the aras river therefore the coefficient wbrf was considered equal to 1 there are three types of non reusable flow nr in the study area including evaporation from the water surface of canals deep percolation and evaporation from the soil surface the evaporation rate from the canals was calculated according to eq 16 allen et al 1998 16 e c k e p a n where ec is the evaporation from the water surface epan is the evaporation from the surface of the pan and k is the pan coefficient since irrigation of the lands is carried out only through irrigation networks and groundwater does not interfere with the irrigation of the land therefore the flowing water percolated deeply out of the area is considered as non reusable flow deep percolation dp rate was calculated based on the water balance equation in the study area evaporation from the soil surface was also estimated by subtracting the transpiration from evapotranspiration due to the fact that the purpose of the project is to produce the crop the evaporation from the canals and the soil surface were considered to be completely non beneficial and the coefficient wb for them were considered to be zero regarding the amount of water percolated deeply from the area a part of deep percolation which leaches the soil profile was considered beneficial the rest was non beneficial eq 17 was used to calculate the leaching water rhoades and merrill 1976 17 l r e c w 5 e c e e c w in which lr is leaching requirement ratio no dimension and ecw is the irrigation water salinity ds m 1 the lr was obtained regionally for the studied area and wbdp was calculated based on eq 18 18 w b d p l r d p for evaporation from the canal and soil surfaces the quality will not be affected and therefore wq coefficient for them was considered to be one due to high quality of water entering the study area the coefficient wqdp was also considered to be one in order to facilitate the calculation the area was considered as a separated region therefore the value of os was zero in addition in the study area rp can be the volume of water stored in the soil storage capacity at the end of a period and can be used in the next period for the following period this flow can be considered as a flow from other sources os since the calculation of efficiency is based on a water balance if some water remains in the soil capacity at the end of the year 2014 2015 it can be considered as os for the years 2015 2016 on the other hand the amount of water remaining at the end of the year 2015 2016 is considered as rp since these two parameters will be equal and deducted from each other in the calculation of efficiency based on eq 6 their calculation will not change in the efficiency therefore in the research the values of this flow were considered to be zero fig 4 presents a flowchart of the proposed methodology for computing sefficiency and different water balance parameters and their quality and beneficial coefficients 2 4 classical efficiency in order to better understand the difference in the calculation of the efficiency the classical efficiency i e was calculated according to the eq 19 and was compared with the sefficiency at the meso and micro levels 19 i e e t p e f f v a 2 5 water productivity since the calculation of physical water productivity wp is desirable in this research the average yield for each crop y a was obtained from organization of agriculture jihad of ardabil province then based on the calculated efficiency and gross irrigation requirement wp was calculated at the meso and micro levels based on eq 20 and compared with calculated wp according to conventional method by taking into account the classical efficiency in calculating the gross irrigation requirement 20 w p y a e t p e f f i e m i c r o s e m e s o s e 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiencies the values related to the parameters of the water balance equation the associated coefficients of wq and wb and the useful part of each parameter are given in table 4 the coefficient wqva had different values in different months because of the difference between crops cultivated in different months table 4 the wqva was equal to 1 in november and march this is due to the fact that during these months only wheat and barley were cultivated on the farm land whose salinity threshold was higher than that of the inflow while in other months this coefficient was less than one due to the cultivation of crops whose salinity thresholds were lower than the salinity of irrigation water therefore crop yield was less than its potential and the coefficient wqva decreased regarding coefficient wbva the difference among the values in the various months indicated the difference in the volume of inflow rate and the water allocated to the farmers in october 95 of the inflow rate was allocated to the farmers and there were 5 losses while coefficient wbva reached 89 in march 11 losses the high value of wbva indicated the proper water allocation to the network according to the needs of the operators on demand allocation of irrigation water about the coefficient wbpp increasing this coefficient indicates that more rainfall is used the low values in some months are due to the low level of cultivation in that month this coefficient in june is equivalent to 0 96 and in november is 0 53 while in the march all crops are on the farm land and use the rainfall while in november only autumn crops are on the farm land as a result the major part of precipitation in this month is non beneficial for our purpose irrigation the low value of wbet associated with the et in november is due to the low cultivation area in this month and low air temperature the reason for high rate of this coefficient in september is high cultivation area and high air temperature and consequently the transpiration rate is increased since the main purpose in the irrigation and drainage network is to irrigate the farms and produce the crops the evaporation from the soil surface and irrigation canals is non beneficial therefore the coefficient wb in these two components will be zero in other words the evaporation from the soil surface and irrigation canals was non beneficial the coefficient wbdp was calculated based on the leaching requirement in the months with high cultivation area leaching requirement is increased and a greater amount of dp is used for leaching and as a result the coefficient wbdp is increased the highest value of this coefficient is occurred in september which all crops are on the farm land and the smallest is occurred in november which the wheat and barley are just cultivated the coefficient wqrf in different months has different values because of the difference in cultivation area in different months and crop response to the salinity in november and december this coefficient is equal to one i e during these months all water has good quality for consumers the reason is that in these two months wheat and barley are cultivated in which the salinity threshold are higher than the salinity threshold for irrigation water mixing the return water with river water however in august the lowest value of wqrf is occurred which is due to the cultivation of summer crops salinity thresholds below the salinity of the irrigation water table 5 shows the percent of usefulness of each parameter per year in the years 2015 2016 as mentioned before the usefulness of each parameter indicates how the parameter was useful in the study area in terms of water quality and beneficially the highest amount of usefulness in the study area at the meso level is related to the rf and the lowest is related to the nr table 6 our results demonstrated that about 87 of inflow 91 of the rainfall 89 of the et 13 of the nr and 91 of the rf were useful in the study area the highest and the lowest efficiencies are respectively occurred in september and november fig 5 the average sefficiency at the meso level in the study area is 72 high efficiency in some months like september is due to the proper water allocation this means that in months with high water efficiency the water is allocated to the needs of the area but in the months with lower water efficiency more water is allocated than the water needs of the area in addition in the months with high rainfall this is more evident because a part of the needs for water is supplied by rainfall and it is not necessary to allocate the water the highest and the lowest values of micro sefficiency are occurred on september and november respectively the average micro sefficiency of the irrigation network is 47 5 the reduction in the efficiency especially in the seasons where there is a lower water requirement is clearly evident the reason for sharp reduction in the efficiency in november is low water requirement for irrigation in the region that could be compensated by effective rainfall table 4 however for mismanagement reasons the water allocation to the area without considering the values of irrigation water requirement and effective rainfall water enters to the network and the volume of drainage water increases in this month since the volume of outflow in terms of the study s level micro level is not useful the efficiency decreases sharply while in high consumption months such as september due to the high water requirement in the area and the low effective rainfall the volume of drainage water decreases as a result there will be a lower difference between the micro and meso sefficiencies the difference between the classical efficiency meso and micro sefficiencies are presented in fig 5 the highest and lowest classical efficiency is related to september and november respectively the average classical efficiency is obtained as 37 9 the reason for zero value of the classical efficiency in november is high effective rainfall in this month which supplies all water requirements while water is allocated to the network in this month due to mismanagement reasons as seen there is a large difference between the classical and micro and meso sefficiencies especially in the months with high water consumption in all months the classical efficiency shows a lower amount than the micro and meso sefficiencies according to the results of keller and keller 1995 in the grand valley at the downstream of the colorado river and egypt s nile valley irrigation system the reason for the difference between classical micro and meso sefficiencies in the region is the existence of the return flows of course the difference between the classical efficiency and meso sefficiency is greater than the difference between the classical efficiency and micro sefficiency due to the presence of the return flows in the meso level 3 2 water productivity the water productivity at the different concepts of efficiencyare presented in table 6 the maximum and minimum values of wp were obtained for meso sefficiency and the classical efficiency respectively according to the special situations of the aras river in terms of geographical location micro sefficiency will be representative efficiency for the study area therefore wp at the micro level in the study area represents the water productivity of the region the reason of higher wp at the micro sefficiency compared to the classical efficiency is that in classical efficiency all losses of the system are considered as non reusable losses while in the micro sefficiency the entire non reusable flow which includes losses of the system is not considered as losses and the portion required for leaching is deducted from the system losses 4 conclusion considering the assessment level of the efficiency in management decisions is very important the aras river is an international border river and is exited out of the country after the arrival of return flows and so the return flows are practically non useful for the country therefore micro sefficiency is the representative efficiency of the study area and making management decisions is necessary in the region based on micro sefficiency to increase the efficiency it can be noted that if the representative efficiency of the area is considered as the meso sefficiency the non reusable flow needs to be reduced however if the micro sefficiency is considered as the region s representative efficiency it is necessary to avoid the return flow losses out of the area this suggests that the correct calculation of the efficiency in the region can affect management decisions the effect of the return flow quality on the efficiency calculations represents itself with wqrf coefficient the higher the coefficient wqrf the greater usefulness of the return flow in the study area the coefficient wqrf was calculated on a monthly basis the difference in the value of coefficient wqrf in different months is due to the different cropping pattern at the downstream for example in november and march the coefficient wqrf is equal to one due to the cultivation of salt resistant crops with higher salinity thresholds than the return flow salinity while in the following months the coefficient wqrf decreased due to the cultivation of crops with lower salinity thresholds if some crops are cultivated in downstream reaches with more salinity thresholds than the salinity of return flow the coefficient wqrf and consequently the efficiency will increase the average classical efficiency in the moghan irrigation and drainage network was 37 9 percent furthermore the meso and micro sefficiencies were obtained as 72 0 and 47 5 percent respectively the reason for the high meso sefficiency compared to micro sefficiency and the classical efficiency is the lack of considering the return flows as losses in other words in meso sefficiency the return flow is considered to be a useful outflow hence water loss is reduced and efficiency is increased the reason for high micro sefficiency as compared to the classical efficiency is the lack of taking into account the leaching requirement as losses in micro sefficiency in other words a part of deep percolation used for leaching is considered as a useful outflow of the system increasing the efficiency while in the classical efficiency this part of the losses is considered non useful considering the assessment level of the water productivity in management decisions is very important since the micro sefficiency is a representative efficiency of the region the water productivity at the micro level can be considered as water productivity in the study area therefore water productivity at the micro level is the representative water productivity of the study area and making management decisions is necessary in the region based on it this recommends that the correct calculation of the efficiency and consequently water productivity in the region can affect management decisions also uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of input data for calculating the sefficiency at different levels macro meso and micro are recommend to be considered in
