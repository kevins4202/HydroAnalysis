23055,in this paper the free chloride concentrations at different depths and the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in tensile concrete zone of reinforced concrete rc beams under flexural loads in a simulated and natural tidal environment are tested by considering the influence of time dependent reinforcement corrosion the time to corrosion initiation and critical chloride concentration c cr in tensile concrete zone of rc beams under different exposure conditions can be obtained the probability distribution forms of c cr of tensile reinforcement corrosion initiation subjected to different exposure environments and flexural load levels have been compared by using the kolmogorov smirnov ks hypothesis test method results indicate that the values of c cr from the field exposure tests are lower than those obtained from the artificial simulation experiments in a natural tidal environment the chloride transport in concrete shows a stronger randomness and the effect of flexural loads on the probability distribution forms of c cr are also more significant moreover under the flexural loads c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment obeys a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 382 by weight of concrete and a normal distribution with mean value of 0 328 by weight of concrete respectively however without flexural loads the values of c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment are found to follow a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 572 by weight of concrete and a log normal distribution with mean value of 0 356 by weight of concrete respectively

a chloride environment may result in cracks of concrete otieno et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 and reduction of structural capacity zhu et al 2016 and further affect the service life of rc structures kwon et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 previous research indicated that the maximum corrosion loss in a reinforcing bar conditional on beam collapse was no more than 16 stewart and al harthy 2008 long term investigation showed that the mean annual mass loss rate of reinforcements was 0 50 in the natural corrosion environment papadopoulos et al 2011 furthermore some structural properties such as mass loss and degradation of mechanical properties were found to be below the minimum thresholds required by international standards papadopoulos et al 2011 reinforcement corrosion has been a major influencing factor for the service life of marine structures at present the time to corrosion initiation has been regarded as an important reference for estimating the service life of rc structures engelund and sφrensen 1998 muthulingam and rao 2014 valipour et al 2014 othmen et al 2018 the major factors influencing corrosion initiation and corrosion speed mass or section loss of reinforcement per unit time included water cement ratio valipour et al 2014 otieno et al 2016 pang and li 2016 concrete cover thickness muthulingam and rao 2014 zhu et al 2016 surface chloride concentration kwon et al 2009 yang et al 2016 chloride diffusion coefficient kwon et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 critical chloride concentration c cr muthulingam and rao 2014 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 external environment including relative humidity and temperature etc valipour et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and external loads du et al 2013 shi et al 2017 yao et al 2017 research results of long term field kwon et al 2009 wang et al 2013 pang and li 2016 indoor accelerated tests vu and stewart 2005 yao et al 2017 theoretical prediction models engelund and sφrensen 1998 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 and numerical simulations nogueira and leonel 2013 liberati et al 2014 all suggested that it is necessary to take the influences of different factors and multi factor coupling as well as the randomness of these influencing factors into consideration to predict the time to corrosion initiation and corrosion speed of reinforcements accurately based on long term exposure tests of rc members in the artificial salt spray environment with sustained loading zhu et al 2016 tested surface chloride concentrations and cracking of concrete cover of rc members with ages up to 28 years results indicated that the bearing capacity of corroded beams will fall below the design requirements at about the 48th year but the research did not consider the randomness of chloride concentrations and cracks distribution in concrete zhu et al 2016 to determine the service life i e the time to corrosion initiation of rc structures two reliability algorithms including the first order reliability method form and monte carlo mc simulation had been studied nogueira and leonel 2013 nogueira and leonel 2013 pointed out that the prediction results of the time to corrosion initiation are greatly influenced by relevant parameters including critical chloride concentration surface chloride concentration concrete cover thickness and chloride diffusion coefficient and the inherent randomness in corrosion process according to the statistical investigations of parameters influencing corroded rc members including concrete cover thickness critical chloride concentration surface chloride concentration chloride diffusion coefficient and age reduction factor in the on site wharf structures kwon et al 2009 predicted the service life of cracked concrete structures by using mc simulation and compared with the service life predicted by the deterministic method yang et al 2016 analyzed the mechanism of chloride induced reinforcement corrosion initiation and deduced a time varying limit state function meanwhile a random prediction model of service life was established by considering the influences of various random parameters including surface chloride concentration concrete cover thickness chloride diffusion coefficient and critical chloride concentration zhang et al 2015 obtained the failure probability of rc structures based on the time dependent random influencing factors by using the third moment method results indicated that the third moment method with improved analytical solutions was simpler and more efficient than traditional approaches such as mc simulation in analyzing the corrosion induced probability moreover as a direct factor affecting reinforcement corrosion initiation c cr was sensitive to temperature relative humidity concrete cover thickness diameter of reinforcement corrosion speed and expansion rate of the corrosion products zhang et al 2015 c cr can be defined as the concentration of chloride at the steel depth that is necessary to sustain local passive film breakdown and hence initiate the corrosion process ann and song 2007 muthulingam and rao 2014 yang et al 2016 which is one of the key parameters to predict the time to corrosion initiation of reinforcement much research effort has focused on ascertaining c cr at which corrosion commences ann and song 2007 conservatively considered the value of c cr was 0 20 or 0 40 by weight of cement thomas 1996 determined c cr of rc members to be 0 7 by weight of cement according to a long term exposure test in a natural tidal environment kwon et al 2009 and markeset 2009 tested the reinforcement corrosion of on site wharf structures and obtained the value of c cr was 1 20 kg m3 and 0 34 0 67 by weight of cement respectively meira et al 2014 pointed out that the value of c cr depends on the location such as splash zone tidal zone and atmosphere zone in addition the values of c cr obtained from field exposure tests were lower than those obtained from wetting and drying cycles in laboratory actually most of the marine structures were often affected by coupling external loads and chloride action shi et al 2017 on the one hand the field exposure environment had a strong variability and uncertainty on the other hand the forms of external loads were complex and diverse leading to different values of c cr under different load types jiang et al 2014 fu et al 2017 yao et al 2017 and load levels jiang et al 2014 moreover except for environmental influencing factors concrete cover thickness muthulingam and rao 2014 pang and li 2016 types and diameter of reinforcements muthulingam and rao 2014 figueira et al 2017 types and content of mineral admixtures thomas 1996 meira et al 2014 water cement ratios angst et al 2009 meira et al 2014 and test methods alonso and sanchez 2009 angst et al 2009 etc all can affect the value of c cr in different degrees when predicting the service life of rc members under chloride environment the probability distribution forms of relevant influencing factors including critical chloride concentration chloride diffusion coefficient and surface chloride concentration etc were generally analyzed at first then a limit state function was established to predict the time to corrosion initiation expressing by a random variable kwon et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 it is worth noting that the statistical characteristics of influencing factors are different among different exposure environments leading to different prediction results of the time to corrosion initiation engelund and sφrensen 1998 muthulingam and rao 2014 valipour et al 2014 in order to further improve the accuracy of service life prediction model it is necessary to analyze the statistical characteristics of relevant parameters affecting the failure probability of rc structures or the time to corrosion initiation in different exposure environments especially for the c cr of reinforcement corrosion initiation however in the existing research the statistical parameters and probability distribution forms of c cr were quite different without a consistent conclusion moreover the time to corrosion initiation was generally predicted based on the statistical results of field exposure tests vu and stewart 2005 kwon et al 2009 wang et al 2013 or relevant researches and codes markeset 2009 yang et al 2016 yao et al 2017 and the influence of statistical characteristics of c cr on reinforcement corrosion initiation was also insufficient when predicting the service life of rc structure different distribution patterns of c cr were adopted for example normal distribution vu and stewart 2005 kwon et al 2009 yang et al 2016 log normal distribution markeset 2009 fuzzy log normal distribution wang et al 2013 beta distribution pang and li 2016 yao et al 2017 and uniform distribution vu and stewart 2000 in addition vu and stewart 2000 also analyzed the probability distribution forms of random influencing factors such as humidity load forms and concrete cover thickness etc to improve the accuracy of estimating structural failure probability however the influence of these factors on the probability distribution form of c cr was not considered moreover chloride penetration into concrete pores was controlled by complex physical and chemical mechanisms but modelling of this phenomenon was often simplified liberati et al 2014 yao et al 2017 pointed out that the effect of stress state should be considered to predict the service life of rc structures under external loads in other words the mean value of apparent chloride diffusion coefficients should be calculated with a stress factor which depends on load conditions and load levels however instead of taking the influence of load conditions and load levels on c cr into account yao et al 2017 assumed that c cr of rc members subjected to chloride action subordinated to a beta distribution with mean value of 0 6 by weight of concrete and standard deviation of 0 15 by weight of concrete regardless of the exerted load yao et al 2017 in addition little research has been conducted to explore the random distribution of c cr in different exposure environments or the same exposure environment with different flexural load levels although flexural load was the most common and important load type shi et al 2017 in fact the main reason causing the strongly randomness of c cr is just the sole factor or coupling actions therefore it is significant to accurately predict the reinforcement corrosion initiation and the service life of rc structures by studying the randomness of c cr under the single factor and coupling actions and analyzing the influence of different factors on the probability distribution forms of c cr according to the research results mentioned above it can be seen that the randomness such as the statistical parameter and probability distribution form etc of c cr in different exposure environments was quite different which may affect the prediction accuracy of the time to corrosion initiation of rc structures vu and stewart 2000 kwon et al 2009 markeset 2009 moreover previous researches rarely considered the influence of different environmental factors when analyzing the statistical parameters and probability distribution forms of c cr meira et al 2014 and the influence of the external loads and the coupling external loads and environmental factors was even less studied therefore it is necessary to conduct in depth research to analyze the influence of external loads environmental factors and multi factor coupling on the randomness of c cr in this paper the corrosion rates percentage mass loss of reinforcement and c cr of tensile reinforcements in tensile concrete zone of rc members with different exposure times and flexural load levels are studied based on the field exposure tests in zhoushan city zhejiang province china and the laboratory experiment in the simulated tidal environment the tests and analysis procedures are as follows first drilling cores from the pure bending section of each rc beam and testing the free chloride concentrations at different depths including the reinforcement surface second corroded reinforcements are obtained after breaking the tested rc beams and the uniform corrosion rates are measured by the weighing method the time dependent model of corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in rc beams under different flexural load levels is established based on the corrosion rates of reinforcements at different exposure times then according to the time dependent model of corrosion rates the times to corrosion initiation of reinforcement with different flexural load levels are analyzed and the free chloride concentrations at steel depth in corresponding time to corrosion initiation i e critical chloride concentration are also obtained finally the probability distribution forms of c cr in tensile concrete zone of rc beams with different exposure environments and flexural load levels are determined by using the ks hypothesis test method 2 test materials and methods 2 1 raw materials and mix proportion of tested concrete tested rc beams were cast based on the chinese code design specification for hydraulic concrete structures dl t 5057 2009 cement used in the tested concrete is qian chao complex portland cement pc 32 5 the fineness modulus of sand is 2 4 with an apparent density of 2600 kg m3 the maximum size of coarse aggregates is 40 mm with an apparent density of 2700 kg m3 the water used in the mix as well as for curing is the laboratory tap water table 1 gives the concrete mix proportions compressive strength of concrete specimens for 28 days in a standard laboratory curing condition and ultimate bearing capacity of rc beams after curing 28 days in the indoor environment 2 2 exposure environment two environments including the simulated and natural tidal environments were used to analyze the chloride ion penetration and reinforcement corrosion in rc beams the field exposure test was carried out in zhoushan city zhejiang province china gao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 table 2 gives the major climatic parameters based on the local meteorological data zhoushan meteorological bureau may 24 2017 according to the meteorological and hydrological data the annual average temperature water temperature and salinity in this area is about 20 c 18 c and 27 respectively in addition the annual average wind speed and maximum wind speed is 4 50 m s and 35 m s respectively the annual mean free chloride content in the seawater with density of 1 025 g cm3 is approximately 13 g l in other words the chloride concentration in situ at sea is 1 27 i e a nacl solution with concentration of 2 1 in laboratory experiment in the tidal zone of test site the seawater immersion time is 4 5 h per day and the time ratio of dry to wet in a cycle is about 5 1 the exposure times of tested rc beams in the natural tidal environment are 240 d 480 d 630 d and 780 d respectively an artificial multifunctional climatic test room is used to conduct the simulated tidal experiment mainly considering the influences of temperature relative humidity and chloride concentration in order to accelerate corrosion of rc beams the concentration of nacl solution is 12 50 in the simulation test which is about 6 times of that in field exposure test four different temperature and humidity parameters are set in the artificial multifunctional climate test room corresponding to the spring mar may summer jun aug autumn sept nov and winter dec feb respectively as shown in table 3 among them the temperature and relative humidity in the artificial simulation experiment are twice as much as seasonal average temperature and average relative humidity in field exposure environment respectively in addition in the artificial simulation experiment the temperature and humidity are adjusted every 48 h by the computer operating platform of artificial multifunctional climate chamber with 4 h immersed in 12 50 nacl solution and 44 h in indoor drying environment 10 exposure times of tested rc beams in the simulated tidal environment are set from 40 d to 400 d with an interval of 40 d 2 3 testing methods to investigate the time dependent c cr and corrosion process of reinforcements in rc beams subjected to external loads and chloride action 82 rc beams 10 4 2 2 representing ten different exposure times four different flexural loads two beams with the same test conditions and two reference beams respectively were cast for artificial simulation experiment and 34 rc beams 4 4 2 2 representing four different exposure times four different flexural loads two beams with the same test conditions and two reference beams respectively were cast for field exposure test to eliminate the influence of raw material randomness two tested beams for each exposure time and flexural load level were cast one was used to measure chloride concentration in concrete and the other was applied to test the bearing capacity and analyze the corrosion of the steel bars besides two additional reference beams were cast at the same time after standard curing for 28 d the ultimate bearing capacity average value of 2 rc beams was tested as shown in table 1 four different flexural loads 0 30 f max 45 f max and 60 f max f max is the ultimate bearing capacity of reference beams were applied to the tested beams with an anchor drawing instrument after loading the side faces of tested beams were coated with epoxy resin to ensure that chloride penetration occurs only in top and bottom surface then all tested beams were exposed to the selected natural tidal zone and artificial multifunctional climate test room fig 1 and fig 2 show the schematic diagram of loading method and photos of tested rc beams in different exposure environments respectively 2 4 measured procedure of free chloride concentrations in concrete it is well known that total and free chloride concentrations can both actually reflect the characteristics of chloride transport in concrete however it is generally recognized that free chloride ions have an influence on the corrosion process lu et al 2002 mohammed and hamada 2003 thus according to the test methods of free chloride concentrations proposed by arya and newman 1990 the free chloride concentrations in concrete were measured in this paper after reaching the expected exposure time the beams were taken to the laboratory and then at least five cores from the pure bending section of each beam were drilled to analyze the randomness of chloride ion penetration the cores were grinded into powder starting from the exposed surface into the inside of the core with 2 mm interval by using a concrete grinding miller the powder sample at each depth having a mass of approximately 6 8 g was selected to measure the content of chloride ions the powder was kept for 2 h in a 150 c oven after sieving with 0 63 mm screen after then it was cooled down in indoor temperature to measure the concentrations of free chloride ions at different depths gao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2018 the test equipment was the american ion concentration meter thermo orion dual star ph which measured the free chloride concentration in the configured powder solution i e the mass percentage of chloride to concrete 2 5 measured procedure of corrosion rate of reinforcements after breaking the tested rc beams the reinforcements were taken out and the concrete on the surface of reinforcements was cleaned and the reinforcements with a length of about 240 mm were cut on the pure bending sections of rc beams based on the chinese code standard for test methods of long term performance and durability of ordinary concrete gb t 50 082 2009 the corrosion products on the surface of corroded reinforcements should be removed before measuring the corrosion rates of reinforcements afterwards the reinforcements were immersed into 12 hydrochloric acid solution for 15 min and then washed in water to remove the acid and neutralized with lime water finally the reinforcements were washed in water again and dried for 4 h and then the corrosion rates of reinforcements were measured at present the corrosion degree of reinforcements can be represented by uniform corrosion rate which was measured by the weighing method du et al 2013 liu et al 2016 1 η s ρ l m ρ l where η s is the uniform corrosion rate ρ is the line density of uncorroded reinforcement g mm in this paper the line density of uncorroded tensile reinforcement ribbed steel bar with diameter of 10 mm was measured to be 0 399 g mm with length of 288 9 mm and weighting mass of 115 13 g l is the length of the cut reinforcement in the pure bending section mm m is the mass of reinforcement after removing the rust g 3 test results and discussion previous researches have pointed out that under coupling flexural loads and chloride environment the reinforcement corrosion in tensile concrete zone of rc beams will be more serious ye et al 2015 shi et al 2017 therefore to study the randomness of c cr in rc members under flexural loads it is necessary to analyze the free chloride concentrations in concrete under different exposure conditions i e different exposure environments and flexural load levels at first and then the time dependent corrosion characteristics of tensile reinforcements in tensile concrete zone of rc beams hereinafter referred to as tensile reinforcements at corresponding exposure conditions should be studied to explore the corresponding times to corrosion initiation 3 1 free chloride concentrations in concrete according to the artificial simulation experiment and field exposure test the free chloride concentration at each depth in concrete of rc beams under different flexural loads and exposure times can be obtained fig 3 shows the average free chloride concentrations at each depth in concrete of rc beams at 240 d exposure time in different exposure environments it can be observed from fig 3 that no matter in the simulated or natural tidal environments the peak values of chloride concentration in tensile concrete zone increase with flexural loads at the same depth the free chloride concentrations generally increase with flexural loads which is consistent with the conclusions of relevant researches wang et al 2011 ye et al 2015 moreover it can be seen that the free chloride concentrations at different depths in the natural tidal environment are lower than those in the simulated tidal environment with the same exposure time and flexural load level among them the peak values of chloride concentration in the simulated tidal environment are 3 4 times of that in the natural tidal environment under different flexural load levels due to the fact that the exposure conditions in simulated environment are much harsher than that in site in addition fig 4 shows the distribution profiles of average free chloride concentration in tensile concrete zone with 30 f max and different exposure times in the simulated and natural tidal environment respectively it can be seen that the free chloride concentrations generally increase with exposure time it is worth noting that the ingress depths of chloride are different both in different exposure environments and the same exposure environment with different exposure times thus in the simulated tidal environment the sampling depths are 20 mm and 30 mm at the exposure times of 40 d 120 d and 160 d 400 d respectively while the sampling depths are 20 mm at the exposure times of 240 d and 480 d and 30 mm at the exposure times of 630 d and 780 d in the natural tidal environment respectively as observed in fig 4 under the flexural load of 30 f max the gradually increasing peak values of chloride concentration reflect the effect of exposure time on the chloride concentrations in concrete in different exposure environments in addition comparing fig 4 a and fig 4 b it can be seen that the convection zone depth gradually increases with exposure time in the simulated tidal environment however in the natural tidal environment the convection zone depth after exposure 240 d 480 d and 600 d is 4 mm and becomes 6 mm after exposure 780 d thus exposure time has an obvious effect on convection zone depth in concrete in the natural tidal environment but has little effect in the simulated tidal environment according to figs 3 and 4 it can be seen that exposure environment has an obvious influence on the distribution profiles of average free chloride concentration in concrete in addition the test results also indicate that randomness is existed in the distribution profiles of free chloride concentration fig 5 shows the free chloride concentrations at different depths of different cores and their average values in rc beams with the flexural load of 60 f max in simulated and field environments with 120 d and 480 d exposure time respectively it can be seen from fig 5 that under the same exposure condition there is a strong randomness of free chloride profiles in tensile concrete zone which is stronger in the former surface concrete of convection zone than that in the stable diffusion zone moreover it can be seen that the randomness of free chloride profiles in tensile concrete zone in the natural tidal environment is stronger than that in the simulated tidal environment this phenomenon can be attributed to the following the drying wetting cycles in simulated experiment can be artificially controlled however the tested rc beams in the natural tide environment are affected by various environmental factors with strong variability for example the drastic changes in temperature and humidity will lead to more frequent wetting drying cycles resulting in stronger randomness of chloride penetration in tested rc beams exposed to the natural tidal environment alonso and sanchez 2009 meira et al 2014 otieno et al 2016 3 2 uniform corrosion rate of reinforcements test results indicate that there is no obvious corrosion in tensile reinforcements of rc beams after exposure to 40 d in the simulated tidal environment and 240 d in the natural tidal environment respectively tensile reinforcements began to corrode after exposure to 80 d in the simulated tidal environment and 480 d in the natural tidal environment respectively the corrosion rates of reinforcements in different exposure environments exposure times and flexural load levels can be obtained according to eq 1 as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements of tested rc beams in the simulated tidal environment can be accelerated compared with that in the natural tidal environment exposure time and flexural load levels have some influences on the corrosion degree of tensile reinforcements moreover the corrosion rate of tensile reinforcements in rc beams increases with exposure time in both exposure environments which is consistent with the conclusions of relevant research papadopoulos et al 2011 among them in the natural tidal environment the corrosion rate of tensile reinforcements quickly increases at first and then tends to be steady with exposure time the main reason can be summarized as follows the transportation of oxygen and moisture is retarded due to the dense corrosion layer in the process of corrosion development when the equilibrium between rates of consumption and transportation of oxygen is reached the corrosion speed tends to be steady liu and weyers 1998a b yuan et al 2009 in addition it can also be observed from fig 6 that the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in rc beams with the same exposure time and exposure environment increase with flexural load levels when the flexural load reaches to 60 f max the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in rc beams increase significantly this phenomenon can be attributed to the following reasons firstly when the flexural load level increases to a certain level the micro cracks on the concrete surface develop rapidly and even form accesses for transforming external chloride into inner concrete ismail et al 2008 xu et al 2018 secondly flexural loads can change the distribution of micro pore structure in concrete increase the content of oxygen and moisture in concrete accelerate the destroying of passive film and then accelerate the corrosion of reinforcements zhao and ba 2011 liberati et al 2014 3 3 time dependent uniform corrosion rate according to the actual corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in fig 6 the relationship between uniform corrosion rates and exposure time are in good agreement with logarithms under different exposure conditions which can be described as follows 2 η s a ln t b where a and b are the fitting coefficients t is the exposure time d moreover a brief description of relevant classical models proposed by other researchers is shown in appendix 1 based on eq 2 the time dependent model of uniform corrosion rates of rc beams under different exposure conditions can be obtained and the fitting coefficients are shown in table 4 in the simulated tidal environment the relationship between fitting coefficients a and b and flexural load levels can be fitted as eq 3 3 a 6 013 δ 2 3 307 δ 2 947 r 2 0 753 b 22 733 δ 2 18 718 δ 12 120 r 2 0 861 where δ is the flexural load level combining eq 2 and eq 3 the time dependent model of uniform corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements of tested rc beams in the simulated tidal environment can be described in eq 4 4 η s t 6 013 δ 2 3 307 δ 2 947 ln t 22 733 δ 2 18 718 δ 12 120 where η s t is the uniform corrosion rate based on the corrosion amount of reinforcement at the exposure time t similarly the time dependent model of uniform corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements of tested rc beams in the natural tidal environment can be obtained 5 η s t 13 317 δ 2 3 448 δ 3 515 ln t 79 744 δ 2 23 739 δ 21 049 3 4 time to corrosion initiation of reinforcements supposing the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements to be zero i e η s t 0 then the corresponding exposure time of reinforcement corrosion initiation can be obtained fig 7 shows the time to corrosion initiation of reinforcements in different exposure environments as shown in fig 7 the corrosion initiation of tensile reinforcements in the simulated tidal environment is accelerated by comparing with that in the natural tidal environment moreover the corrosion is generally accelerated with the increasing of flexural loads in both exposure environments it is worth noting that the change of the time to corrosion initiation of tensile reinforcements is most significant at the flexural load level of 0 30 3 5 critical chloride concentrations in concrete based on the section design of tested rc beam the thickness of concrete cover is 10 mm thus when corrosion initiated free chloride concentration at the depth of 10 mm from concrete surface is the c cr according to the test results of free chloride concentrations in concrete the measured values of free chloride concentration at the depth of 10 mm i e the surface of tensile reinforcements in different concrete cores under different exposure conditions can be obtained subsequently the relationship between free chloride concentrations on the surface of tensile reinforcements and different exposure times of corresponding concrete cores as well as the time to corrosion initiation under different exposure conditions in fig 7 is analyzed then c cr of different concrete cores under different exposure conditions can be obtained using linear interpolation method fig 8 gives the distribution profiles of c cr for different concrete cores with flexural load levels of 30 and 45 under different exposure conditions it can be seen from fig 8 that the distribution profiles of c cr of tensile reinforcements under the same or different exposure conditions have a strong randomness in order to accurately predict the time to corrosion initiation of reinforcements it is necessary to further analyze the probability distribution forms of c cr of tensile reinforcements by considering different influencing factors 4 randomness of critical chloride concentrations based on the method mentioned above the values of c cr at different concrete cores under different flexural load levels and exposure environments are obtained among them 5 concrete cores are tested under the same exposure conditions i e the same exposure environment and flexural load level thus 5 corresponding c cr can be determined first assuming c cr obeys some kinds of probability distribution forms including normal log normal uniform distribution and gumbel distribution and then the ks hypothesis test is adopted to identify the optimal distribution form if the original hypothesis is not rejected by different distributions the distribution form with the minimum d max can be chosen as the optimal distribution therefore the statistical parameters and probability distribution forms of c cr under the corresponding exposure conditions can be obtained as shown in table 5 analyzing the relevant statistical parameters in table 5 it can be seen that the average value of c cr in different exposure environments generally decreases with the increasing flexural load which indicates that higher flexural load levels may increase the total porosity of inner concrete and even turn the closed pores into connected pores as well as accelerate the transportation of oxygen and moisture into inner concrete angst et al 2009 meira et al 2014 and then lead to a much earlier corrosion of reinforcements moreover the natural tests mainly connected with environmental interaction like deeper concrete carbonation and more suitable moisture and oxygen contents for starting corrosion meira et al 2014 making depassivation easier besides the test results in table 5 also indicate that the mean value of c cr in the natural tidal environment is generally lower than that in the simulated tidal environment based on the statistical analysis in table 5 the probability density function pdf of c cr under different exposure conditions can be obtained as shown in fig 9 to further analyze the effect of flexural loads on the distribution forms of c cr in different exposure environments an alternative statistical analysis is conducted as shown in table 6 among them in different exposure environments the distribution forms of c cr corresponding to 20 concrete cores 4 5 representing four different flexural loads and five concrete cores corresponding to each flexural load respectively are analyzed for the flexural load level of 0 60 and the distribution forms of c cr corresponding to 15 concrete cores 3 5 representing three different flexural loads and five concrete cores corresponding to each flexural load respectively are analyzed for the flexural load level of 30 60 it can be seen from tables 5 and 6 that the critical chloride concentrations in the simulated tidal environments are largely to follow the gumbel distribution when a higher flexural load level is exerted the distribution forms will change showing that the c cr in the simulated tidal environment obeys a normal distribution with mean value of 0 382 by weight of concrete however the distribution forms of c cr in the natural tidal environment show a stronger randomness moreover analyzing the effect of flexural loads on the distribution forms of c cr in different exposure environments it can be seen that under the flexural loads the c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment subordinate to a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 382 by weight of concrete and a normal distribution with mean value of 0 328 by weight of concrete respectively however without flexural loads c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment is found to follow a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 572 by weight of concrete and a log normal distribution with mean value of 0 356 by weight of concrete respectively 5 conclusions 1 under the same exposure conditions there is a strong randomness of free chloride profiles in tensile concrete zone of the rc beam and the randomness of free chloride profiles in the former surface concrete of convection zone is stronger than that in the stable diffusion zone moreover the randomness of free chloride profiles in the natural tidal environment is stronger than that in the simulated tidal environment 2 due to the dense corrosion layer in the process of corrosion development with exposure time the corrosion rate of tensile reinforcements quickly increases at first and then tends to be steady with exposure time under the long term natural exposure condition 3 the critical chloride concentrations c cr are tested in the two exposure environments described in this paper and the test results indicate that the value of c cr in the natural tidal environment is generally lower than that in the simulated tidal environment 4 the distribution forms of c cr of tested rc beams in different exposure environments all affected by flexural loads especially in the natural tidal environment considering the effect of flexural loads the c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment obeys a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 382 by weight of concrete and a normal distribution with mean value of 0 328 by weight of

according to the established approaches as shown in the following 1 theoretical models model 1 1 liu and weyers 1998a b according to the principle that the increase rate of rust weight was inversely

2003 2007 the mass of consumed reinforcement is related to the amount of the current that flows through the electrochemical corrosion cell many researchers have used faraday s law to estimate the weight loss of reinforcement from applied current density and its ability to predict the actual loss of steel at different current density levels had also been confirmed in study ahmed et al 2007 chen and mahadevan 2008 lu et al 2011 hence faraday s law can be also used to describe the corrosion amount maaddawy and soudki 2003 2007 1 9 m loss 10 7 π d i corr m z f t where m loss is the weight loss

t is the corrosion time 2 empirical models model 2 1 vu and stewart 2000 vu and stewart 2000 suggested that the steel loss can be evaluated by assuming that reinforcement was corroded either uniformly or by pits along its perimeter for uniform corrosion model the diameter reduction of corroded reinforcement section was determined as follows 2 1 δ d t 0 0232 t t 0 i corr the corrosion ratio can be determined empirically 2 2 i corr 37 8 1 w c 1 64 cov er where δ d t is the diameter reduction of corroded reinforcement section t is the corrosion time t 0 is the time to corrosion initiation i corr

researches di and zhou 1996 established the relationship between section loss rate of reinforcement and relevant parameters including concrete cover thickness concrete strength and reinforcement diameter moreover after considering the influence of curing condition cement types and environmental condition the empirical model of section loss rate of reinforcement was obtained as described in eq 2 3 2 3 λ β 1 β 2 β 3 4 18 f cu k 0 073 1 85 0 04 c 5 18 d 0 13 t where λ is the section loss rate of reinforcement β 1 β 2 and β 3 are the correction coefficient of curing condition cement type and

of surface reinforcement t is the corrosion time c is the concrete cover thickness r is the radius of reinforcement d c is the carbonation depth based on theoretical and empirical models above it can be seen that the theoretical models consider the influencing factors more comprehensive but these theoretical parameters are often difficult to determine and the theoretical models cannot be used in practical applications the empirical models focus on analyzing the influencing factors based on experimental results and engineering investigation therefore the influencing factors considered in the empirical models are limited leading to a difficult application of the empirical models to other experimental research in addition when speaking about corrosion rate of steel in concrete bertolini et al 2005 suggested that there are two different definitions i e average corrosion rate and instantaneous corrosion rate have to be distinguished the average corrosion rate can be determined as the average value over a long period of time by measuring weight loss or loss of cross section of the steel on site and the instantaneous corrosion rate i corr can be determined using electrochemical methods in particular polarization resistance determined by stationary or nonstationary electrochemical methods the theoretical models model 1 1 1 5 and experience models model 2 1 and 2 3 mentioned above calculated corrosion speed in concrete i e instantaneous corrosion rate i corr based on the electrochemical principle besides it is difficult to determine the relevant parameters such as β 1 β 2 and β 3 etc in model 2 2 for the calculation model of average corrosion rate therefore the relationship between average corrosion rate and exposure time should be further analyzed 
23055,in this paper the free chloride concentrations at different depths and the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in tensile concrete zone of reinforced concrete rc beams under flexural loads in a simulated and natural tidal environment are tested by considering the influence of time dependent reinforcement corrosion the time to corrosion initiation and critical chloride concentration c cr in tensile concrete zone of rc beams under different exposure conditions can be obtained the probability distribution forms of c cr of tensile reinforcement corrosion initiation subjected to different exposure environments and flexural load levels have been compared by using the kolmogorov smirnov ks hypothesis test method results indicate that the values of c cr from the field exposure tests are lower than those obtained from the artificial simulation experiments in a natural tidal environment the chloride transport in concrete shows a stronger randomness and the effect of flexural loads on the probability distribution forms of c cr are also more significant moreover under the flexural loads c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment obeys a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 382 by weight of concrete and a normal distribution with mean value of 0 328 by weight of concrete respectively however without flexural loads the values of c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment are found to follow a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 572 by weight of concrete and a log normal distribution with mean value of 0 356 by weight of concrete respectively

a chloride environment may result in cracks of concrete otieno et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 and reduction of structural capacity zhu et al 2016 and further affect the service life of rc structures kwon et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 previous research indicated that the maximum corrosion loss in a reinforcing bar conditional on beam collapse was no more than 16 stewart and al harthy 2008 long term investigation showed that the mean annual mass loss rate of reinforcements was 0 50 in the natural corrosion environment papadopoulos et al 2011 furthermore some structural properties such as mass loss and degradation of mechanical properties were found to be below the minimum thresholds required by international standards papadopoulos et al 2011 reinforcement corrosion has been a major influencing factor for the service life of marine structures at present the time to corrosion initiation has been regarded as an important reference for estimating the service life of rc structures engelund and sφrensen 1998 muthulingam and rao 2014 valipour et al 2014 othmen et al 2018 the major factors influencing corrosion initiation and corrosion speed mass or section loss of reinforcement per unit time included water cement ratio valipour et al 2014 otieno et al 2016 pang and li 2016 concrete cover thickness muthulingam and rao 2014 zhu et al 2016 surface chloride concentration kwon et al 2009 yang et al 2016 chloride diffusion coefficient kwon et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 critical chloride concentration c cr muthulingam and rao 2014 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 external environment including relative humidity and temperature etc valipour et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and external loads du et al 2013 shi et al 2017 yao et al 2017 research results of long term field kwon et al 2009 wang et al 2013 pang and li 2016 indoor accelerated tests vu and stewart 2005 yao et al 2017 theoretical prediction models engelund and sφrensen 1998 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 and numerical simulations nogueira and leonel 2013 liberati et al 2014 all suggested that it is necessary to take the influences of different factors and multi factor coupling as well as the randomness of these influencing factors into consideration to predict the time to corrosion initiation and corrosion speed of reinforcements accurately based on long term exposure tests of rc members in the artificial salt spray environment with sustained loading zhu et al 2016 tested surface chloride concentrations and cracking of concrete cover of rc members with ages up to 28 years results indicated that the bearing capacity of corroded beams will fall below the design requirements at about the 48th year but the research did not consider the randomness of chloride concentrations and cracks distribution in concrete zhu et al 2016 to determine the service life i e the time to corrosion initiation of rc structures two reliability algorithms including the first order reliability method form and monte carlo mc simulation had been studied nogueira and leonel 2013 nogueira and leonel 2013 pointed out that the prediction results of the time to corrosion initiation are greatly influenced by relevant parameters including critical chloride concentration surface chloride concentration concrete cover thickness and chloride diffusion coefficient and the inherent randomness in corrosion process according to the statistical investigations of parameters influencing corroded rc members including concrete cover thickness critical chloride concentration surface chloride concentration chloride diffusion coefficient and age reduction factor in the on site wharf structures kwon et al 2009 predicted the service life of cracked concrete structures by using mc simulation and compared with the service life predicted by the deterministic method yang et al 2016 analyzed the mechanism of chloride induced reinforcement corrosion initiation and deduced a time varying limit state function meanwhile a random prediction model of service life was established by considering the influences of various random parameters including surface chloride concentration concrete cover thickness chloride diffusion coefficient and critical chloride concentration zhang et al 2015 obtained the failure probability of rc structures based on the time dependent random influencing factors by using the third moment method results indicated that the third moment method with improved analytical solutions was simpler and more efficient than traditional approaches such as mc simulation in analyzing the corrosion induced probability moreover as a direct factor affecting reinforcement corrosion initiation c cr was sensitive to temperature relative humidity concrete cover thickness diameter of reinforcement corrosion speed and expansion rate of the corrosion products zhang et al 2015 c cr can be defined as the concentration of chloride at the steel depth that is necessary to sustain local passive film breakdown and hence initiate the corrosion process ann and song 2007 muthulingam and rao 2014 yang et al 2016 which is one of the key parameters to predict the time to corrosion initiation of reinforcement much research effort has focused on ascertaining c cr at which corrosion commences ann and song 2007 conservatively considered the value of c cr was 0 20 or 0 40 by weight of cement thomas 1996 determined c cr of rc members to be 0 7 by weight of cement according to a long term exposure test in a natural tidal environment kwon et al 2009 and markeset 2009 tested the reinforcement corrosion of on site wharf structures and obtained the value of c cr was 1 20 kg m3 and 0 34 0 67 by weight of cement respectively meira et al 2014 pointed out that the value of c cr depends on the location such as splash zone tidal zone and atmosphere zone in addition the values of c cr obtained from field exposure tests were lower than those obtained from wetting and drying cycles in laboratory actually most of the marine structures were often affected by coupling external loads and chloride action shi et al 2017 on the one hand the field exposure environment had a strong variability and uncertainty on the other hand the forms of external loads were complex and diverse leading to different values of c cr under different load types jiang et al 2014 fu et al 2017 yao et al 2017 and load levels jiang et al 2014 moreover except for environmental influencing factors concrete cover thickness muthulingam and rao 2014 pang and li 2016 types and diameter of reinforcements muthulingam and rao 2014 figueira et al 2017 types and content of mineral admixtures thomas 1996 meira et al 2014 water cement ratios angst et al 2009 meira et al 2014 and test methods alonso and sanchez 2009 angst et al 2009 etc all can affect the value of c cr in different degrees when predicting the service life of rc members under chloride environment the probability distribution forms of relevant influencing factors including critical chloride concentration chloride diffusion coefficient and surface chloride concentration etc were generally analyzed at first then a limit state function was established to predict the time to corrosion initiation expressing by a random variable kwon et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 it is worth noting that the statistical characteristics of influencing factors are different among different exposure environments leading to different prediction results of the time to corrosion initiation engelund and sφrensen 1998 muthulingam and rao 2014 valipour et al 2014 in order to further improve the accuracy of service life prediction model it is necessary to analyze the statistical characteristics of relevant parameters affecting the failure probability of rc structures or the time to corrosion initiation in different exposure environments especially for the c cr of reinforcement corrosion initiation however in the existing research the statistical parameters and probability distribution forms of c cr were quite different without a consistent conclusion moreover the time to corrosion initiation was generally predicted based on the statistical results of field exposure tests vu and stewart 2005 kwon et al 2009 wang et al 2013 or relevant researches and codes markeset 2009 yang et al 2016 yao et al 2017 and the influence of statistical characteristics of c cr on reinforcement corrosion initiation was also insufficient when predicting the service life of rc structure different distribution patterns of c cr were adopted for example normal distribution vu and stewart 2005 kwon et al 2009 yang et al 2016 log normal distribution markeset 2009 fuzzy log normal distribution wang et al 2013 beta distribution pang and li 2016 yao et al 2017 and uniform distribution vu and stewart 2000 in addition vu and stewart 2000 also analyzed the probability distribution forms of random influencing factors such as humidity load forms and concrete cover thickness etc to improve the accuracy of estimating structural failure probability however the influence of these factors on the probability distribution form of c cr was not considered moreover chloride penetration into concrete pores was controlled by complex physical and chemical mechanisms but modelling of this phenomenon was often simplified liberati et al 2014 yao et al 2017 pointed out that the effect of stress state should be considered to predict the service life of rc structures under external loads in other words the mean value of apparent chloride diffusion coefficients should be calculated with a stress factor which depends on load conditions and load levels however instead of taking the influence of load conditions and load levels on c cr into account yao et al 2017 assumed that c cr of rc members subjected to chloride action subordinated to a beta distribution with mean value of 0 6 by weight of concrete and standard deviation of 0 15 by weight of concrete regardless of the exerted load yao et al 2017 in addition little research has been conducted to explore the random distribution of c cr in different exposure environments or the same exposure environment with different flexural load levels although flexural load was the most common and important load type shi et al 2017 in fact the main reason causing the strongly randomness of c cr is just the sole factor or coupling actions therefore it is significant to accurately predict the reinforcement corrosion initiation and the service life of rc structures by studying the randomness of c cr under the single factor and coupling actions and analyzing the influence of different factors on the probability distribution forms of c cr according to the research results mentioned above it can be seen that the randomness such as the statistical parameter and probability distribution form etc of c cr in different exposure environments was quite different which may affect the prediction accuracy of the time to corrosion initiation of rc structures vu and stewart 2000 kwon et al 2009 markeset 2009 moreover previous researches rarely considered the influence of different environmental factors when analyzing the statistical parameters and probability distribution forms of c cr meira et al 2014 and the influence of the external loads and the coupling external loads and environmental factors was even less studied therefore it is necessary to conduct in depth research to analyze the influence of external loads environmental factors and multi factor coupling on the randomness of c cr in this paper the corrosion rates percentage mass loss of reinforcement and c cr of tensile reinforcements in tensile concrete zone of rc members with different exposure times and flexural load levels are studied based on the field exposure tests in zhoushan city zhejiang province china and the laboratory experiment in the simulated tidal environment the tests and analysis procedures are as follows first drilling cores from the pure bending section of each rc beam and testing the free chloride concentrations at different depths including the reinforcement surface second corroded reinforcements are obtained after breaking the tested rc beams and the uniform corrosion rates are measured by the weighing method the time dependent model of corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in rc beams under different flexural load levels is established based on the corrosion rates of reinforcements at different exposure times then according to the time dependent model of corrosion rates the times to corrosion initiation of reinforcement with different flexural load levels are analyzed and the free chloride concentrations at steel depth in corresponding time to corrosion initiation i e critical chloride concentration are also obtained finally the probability distribution forms of c cr in tensile concrete zone of rc beams with different exposure environments and flexural load levels are determined by using the ks hypothesis test method 2 test materials and methods 2 1 raw materials and mix proportion of tested concrete tested rc beams were cast based on the chinese code design specification for hydraulic concrete structures dl t 5057 2009 cement used in the tested concrete is qian chao complex portland cement pc 32 5 the fineness modulus of sand is 2 4 with an apparent density of 2600 kg m3 the maximum size of coarse aggregates is 40 mm with an apparent density of 2700 kg m3 the water used in the mix as well as for curing is the laboratory tap water table 1 gives the concrete mix proportions compressive strength of concrete specimens for 28 days in a standard laboratory curing condition and ultimate bearing capacity of rc beams after curing 28 days in the indoor environment 2 2 exposure environment two environments including the simulated and natural tidal environments were used to analyze the chloride ion penetration and reinforcement corrosion in rc beams the field exposure test was carried out in zhoushan city zhejiang province china gao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 table 2 gives the major climatic parameters based on the local meteorological data zhoushan meteorological bureau may 24 2017 according to the meteorological and hydrological data the annual average temperature water temperature and salinity in this area is about 20 c 18 c and 27 respectively in addition the annual average wind speed and maximum wind speed is 4 50 m s and 35 m s respectively the annual mean free chloride content in the seawater with density of 1 025 g cm3 is approximately 13 g l in other words the chloride concentration in situ at sea is 1 27 i e a nacl solution with concentration of 2 1 in laboratory experiment in the tidal zone of test site the seawater immersion time is 4 5 h per day and the time ratio of dry to wet in a cycle is about 5 1 the exposure times of tested rc beams in the natural tidal environment are 240 d 480 d 630 d and 780 d respectively an artificial multifunctional climatic test room is used to conduct the simulated tidal experiment mainly considering the influences of temperature relative humidity and chloride concentration in order to accelerate corrosion of rc beams the concentration of nacl solution is 12 50 in the simulation test which is about 6 times of that in field exposure test four different temperature and humidity parameters are set in the artificial multifunctional climate test room corresponding to the spring mar may summer jun aug autumn sept nov and winter dec feb respectively as shown in table 3 among them the temperature and relative humidity in the artificial simulation experiment are twice as much as seasonal average temperature and average relative humidity in field exposure environment respectively in addition in the artificial simulation experiment the temperature and humidity are adjusted every 48 h by the computer operating platform of artificial multifunctional climate chamber with 4 h immersed in 12 50 nacl solution and 44 h in indoor drying environment 10 exposure times of tested rc beams in the simulated tidal environment are set from 40 d to 400 d with an interval of 40 d 2 3 testing methods to investigate the time dependent c cr and corrosion process of reinforcements in rc beams subjected to external loads and chloride action 82 rc beams 10 4 2 2 representing ten different exposure times four different flexural loads two beams with the same test conditions and two reference beams respectively were cast for artificial simulation experiment and 34 rc beams 4 4 2 2 representing four different exposure times four different flexural loads two beams with the same test conditions and two reference beams respectively were cast for field exposure test to eliminate the influence of raw material randomness two tested beams for each exposure time and flexural load level were cast one was used to measure chloride concentration in concrete and the other was applied to test the bearing capacity and analyze the corrosion of the steel bars besides two additional reference beams were cast at the same time after standard curing for 28 d the ultimate bearing capacity average value of 2 rc beams was tested as shown in table 1 four different flexural loads 0 30 f max 45 f max and 60 f max f max is the ultimate bearing capacity of reference beams were applied to the tested beams with an anchor drawing instrument after loading the side faces of tested beams were coated with epoxy resin to ensure that chloride penetration occurs only in top and bottom surface then all tested beams were exposed to the selected natural tidal zone and artificial multifunctional climate test room fig 1 and fig 2 show the schematic diagram of loading method and photos of tested rc beams in different exposure environments respectively 2 4 measured procedure of free chloride concentrations in concrete it is well known that total and free chloride concentrations can both actually reflect the characteristics of chloride transport in concrete however it is generally recognized that free chloride ions have an influence on the corrosion process lu et al 2002 mohammed and hamada 2003 thus according to the test methods of free chloride concentrations proposed by arya and newman 1990 the free chloride concentrations in concrete were measured in this paper after reaching the expected exposure time the beams were taken to the laboratory and then at least five cores from the pure bending section of each beam were drilled to analyze the randomness of chloride ion penetration the cores were grinded into powder starting from the exposed surface into the inside of the core with 2 mm interval by using a concrete grinding miller the powder sample at each depth having a mass of approximately 6 8 g was selected to measure the content of chloride ions the powder was kept for 2 h in a 150 c oven after sieving with 0 63 mm screen after then it was cooled down in indoor temperature to measure the concentrations of free chloride ions at different depths gao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2018 the test equipment was the american ion concentration meter thermo orion dual star ph which measured the free chloride concentration in the configured powder solution i e the mass percentage of chloride to concrete 2 5 measured procedure of corrosion rate of reinforcements after breaking the tested rc beams the reinforcements were taken out and the concrete on the surface of reinforcements was cleaned and the reinforcements with a length of about 240 mm were cut on the pure bending sections of rc beams based on the chinese code standard for test methods of long term performance and durability of ordinary concrete gb t 50 082 2009 the corrosion products on the surface of corroded reinforcements should be removed before measuring the corrosion rates of reinforcements afterwards the reinforcements were immersed into 12 hydrochloric acid solution for 15 min and then washed in water to remove the acid and neutralized with lime water finally the reinforcements were washed in water again and dried for 4 h and then the corrosion rates of reinforcements were measured at present the corrosion degree of reinforcements can be represented by uniform corrosion rate which was measured by the weighing method du et al 2013 liu et al 2016 1 η s ρ l m ρ l where η s is the uniform corrosion rate ρ is the line density of uncorroded reinforcement g mm in this paper the line density of uncorroded tensile reinforcement ribbed steel bar with diameter of 10 mm was measured to be 0 399 g mm with length of 288 9 mm and weighting mass of 115 13 g l is the length of the cut reinforcement in the pure bending section mm m is the mass of reinforcement after removing the rust g 3 test results and discussion previous researches have pointed out that under coupling flexural loads and chloride environment the reinforcement corrosion in tensile concrete zone of rc beams will be more serious ye et al 2015 shi et al 2017 therefore to study the randomness of c cr in rc members under flexural loads it is necessary to analyze the free chloride concentrations in concrete under different exposure conditions i e different exposure environments and flexural load levels at first and then the time dependent corrosion characteristics of tensile reinforcements in tensile concrete zone of rc beams hereinafter referred to as tensile reinforcements at corresponding exposure conditions should be studied to explore the corresponding times to corrosion initiation 3 1 free chloride concentrations in concrete according to the artificial simulation experiment and field exposure test the free chloride concentration at each depth in concrete of rc beams under different flexural loads and exposure times can be obtained fig 3 shows the average free chloride concentrations at each depth in concrete of rc beams at 240 d exposure time in different exposure environments it can be observed from fig 3 that no matter in the simulated or natural tidal environments the peak values of chloride concentration in tensile concrete zone increase with flexural loads at the same depth the free chloride concentrations generally increase with flexural loads which is consistent with the conclusions of relevant researches wang et al 2011 ye et al 2015 moreover it can be seen that the free chloride concentrations at different depths in the natural tidal environment are lower than those in the simulated tidal environment with the same exposure time and flexural load level among them the peak values of chloride concentration in the simulated tidal environment are 3 4 times of that in the natural tidal environment under different flexural load levels due to the fact that the exposure conditions in simulated environment are much harsher than that in site in addition fig 4 shows the distribution profiles of average free chloride concentration in tensile concrete zone with 30 f max and different exposure times in the simulated and natural tidal environment respectively it can be seen that the free chloride concentrations generally increase with exposure time it is worth noting that the ingress depths of chloride are different both in different exposure environments and the same exposure environment with different exposure times thus in the simulated tidal environment the sampling depths are 20 mm and 30 mm at the exposure times of 40 d 120 d and 160 d 400 d respectively while the sampling depths are 20 mm at the exposure times of 240 d and 480 d and 30 mm at the exposure times of 630 d and 780 d in the natural tidal environment respectively as observed in fig 4 under the flexural load of 30 f max the gradually increasing peak values of chloride concentration reflect the effect of exposure time on the chloride concentrations in concrete in different exposure environments in addition comparing fig 4 a and fig 4 b it can be seen that the convection zone depth gradually increases with exposure time in the simulated tidal environment however in the natural tidal environment the convection zone depth after exposure 240 d 480 d and 600 d is 4 mm and becomes 6 mm after exposure 780 d thus exposure time has an obvious effect on convection zone depth in concrete in the natural tidal environment but has little effect in the simulated tidal environment according to figs 3 and 4 it can be seen that exposure environment has an obvious influence on the distribution profiles of average free chloride concentration in concrete in addition the test results also indicate that randomness is existed in the distribution profiles of free chloride concentration fig 5 shows the free chloride concentrations at different depths of different cores and their average values in rc beams with the flexural load of 60 f max in simulated and field environments with 120 d and 480 d exposure time respectively it can be seen from fig 5 that under the same exposure condition there is a strong randomness of free chloride profiles in tensile concrete zone which is stronger in the former surface concrete of convection zone than that in the stable diffusion zone moreover it can be seen that the randomness of free chloride profiles in tensile concrete zone in the natural tidal environment is stronger than that in the simulated tidal environment this phenomenon can be attributed to the following the drying wetting cycles in simulated experiment can be artificially controlled however the tested rc beams in the natural tide environment are affected by various environmental factors with strong variability for example the drastic changes in temperature and humidity will lead to more frequent wetting drying cycles resulting in stronger randomness of chloride penetration in tested rc beams exposed to the natural tidal environment alonso and sanchez 2009 meira et al 2014 otieno et al 2016 3 2 uniform corrosion rate of reinforcements test results indicate that there is no obvious corrosion in tensile reinforcements of rc beams after exposure to 40 d in the simulated tidal environment and 240 d in the natural tidal environment respectively tensile reinforcements began to corrode after exposure to 80 d in the simulated tidal environment and 480 d in the natural tidal environment respectively the corrosion rates of reinforcements in different exposure environments exposure times and flexural load levels can be obtained according to eq 1 as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements of tested rc beams in the simulated tidal environment can be accelerated compared with that in the natural tidal environment exposure time and flexural load levels have some influences on the corrosion degree of tensile reinforcements moreover the corrosion rate of tensile reinforcements in rc beams increases with exposure time in both exposure environments which is consistent with the conclusions of relevant research papadopoulos et al 2011 among them in the natural tidal environment the corrosion rate of tensile reinforcements quickly increases at first and then tends to be steady with exposure time the main reason can be summarized as follows the transportation of oxygen and moisture is retarded due to the dense corrosion layer in the process of corrosion development when the equilibrium between rates of consumption and transportation of oxygen is reached the corrosion speed tends to be steady liu and weyers 1998a b yuan et al 2009 in addition it can also be observed from fig 6 that the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in rc beams with the same exposure time and exposure environment increase with flexural load levels when the flexural load reaches to 60 f max the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in rc beams increase significantly this phenomenon can be attributed to the following reasons firstly when the flexural load level increases to a certain level the micro cracks on the concrete surface develop rapidly and even form accesses for transforming external chloride into inner concrete ismail et al 2008 xu et al 2018 secondly flexural loads can change the distribution of micro pore structure in concrete increase the content of oxygen and moisture in concrete accelerate the destroying of passive film and then accelerate the corrosion of reinforcements zhao and ba 2011 liberati et al 2014 3 3 time dependent uniform corrosion rate according to the actual corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements in fig 6 the relationship between uniform corrosion rates and exposure time are in good agreement with logarithms under different exposure conditions which can be described as follows 2 η s a ln t b where a and b are the fitting coefficients t is the exposure time d moreover a brief description of relevant classical models proposed by other researchers is shown in appendix 1 based on eq 2 the time dependent model of uniform corrosion rates of rc beams under different exposure conditions can be obtained and the fitting coefficients are shown in table 4 in the simulated tidal environment the relationship between fitting coefficients a and b and flexural load levels can be fitted as eq 3 3 a 6 013 δ 2 3 307 δ 2 947 r 2 0 753 b 22 733 δ 2 18 718 δ 12 120 r 2 0 861 where δ is the flexural load level combining eq 2 and eq 3 the time dependent model of uniform corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements of tested rc beams in the simulated tidal environment can be described in eq 4 4 η s t 6 013 δ 2 3 307 δ 2 947 ln t 22 733 δ 2 18 718 δ 12 120 where η s t is the uniform corrosion rate based on the corrosion amount of reinforcement at the exposure time t similarly the time dependent model of uniform corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements of tested rc beams in the natural tidal environment can be obtained 5 η s t 13 317 δ 2 3 448 δ 3 515 ln t 79 744 δ 2 23 739 δ 21 049 3 4 time to corrosion initiation of reinforcements supposing the corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements to be zero i e η s t 0 then the corresponding exposure time of reinforcement corrosion initiation can be obtained fig 7 shows the time to corrosion initiation of reinforcements in different exposure environments as shown in fig 7 the corrosion initiation of tensile reinforcements in the simulated tidal environment is accelerated by comparing with that in the natural tidal environment moreover the corrosion is generally accelerated with the increasing of flexural loads in both exposure environments it is worth noting that the change of the time to corrosion initiation of tensile reinforcements is most significant at the flexural load level of 0 30 3 5 critical chloride concentrations in concrete based on the section design of tested rc beam the thickness of concrete cover is 10 mm thus when corrosion initiated free chloride concentration at the depth of 10 mm from concrete surface is the c cr according to the test results of free chloride concentrations in concrete the measured values of free chloride concentration at the depth of 10 mm i e the surface of tensile reinforcements in different concrete cores under different exposure conditions can be obtained subsequently the relationship between free chloride concentrations on the surface of tensile reinforcements and different exposure times of corresponding concrete cores as well as the time to corrosion initiation under different exposure conditions in fig 7 is analyzed then c cr of different concrete cores under different exposure conditions can be obtained using linear interpolation method fig 8 gives the distribution profiles of c cr for different concrete cores with flexural load levels of 30 and 45 under different exposure conditions it can be seen from fig 8 that the distribution profiles of c cr of tensile reinforcements under the same or different exposure conditions have a strong randomness in order to accurately predict the time to corrosion initiation of reinforcements it is necessary to further analyze the probability distribution forms of c cr of tensile reinforcements by considering different influencing factors 4 randomness of critical chloride concentrations based on the method mentioned above the values of c cr at different concrete cores under different flexural load levels and exposure environments are obtained among them 5 concrete cores are tested under the same exposure conditions i e the same exposure environment and flexural load level thus 5 corresponding c cr can be determined first assuming c cr obeys some kinds of probability distribution forms including normal log normal uniform distribution and gumbel distribution and then the ks hypothesis test is adopted to identify the optimal distribution form if the original hypothesis is not rejected by different distributions the distribution form with the minimum d max can be chosen as the optimal distribution therefore the statistical parameters and probability distribution forms of c cr under the corresponding exposure conditions can be obtained as shown in table 5 analyzing the relevant statistical parameters in table 5 it can be seen that the average value of c cr in different exposure environments generally decreases with the increasing flexural load which indicates that higher flexural load levels may increase the total porosity of inner concrete and even turn the closed pores into connected pores as well as accelerate the transportation of oxygen and moisture into inner concrete angst et al 2009 meira et al 2014 and then lead to a much earlier corrosion of reinforcements moreover the natural tests mainly connected with environmental interaction like deeper concrete carbonation and more suitable moisture and oxygen contents for starting corrosion meira et al 2014 making depassivation easier besides the test results in table 5 also indicate that the mean value of c cr in the natural tidal environment is generally lower than that in the simulated tidal environment based on the statistical analysis in table 5 the probability density function pdf of c cr under different exposure conditions can be obtained as shown in fig 9 to further analyze the effect of flexural loads on the distribution forms of c cr in different exposure environments an alternative statistical analysis is conducted as shown in table 6 among them in different exposure environments the distribution forms of c cr corresponding to 20 concrete cores 4 5 representing four different flexural loads and five concrete cores corresponding to each flexural load respectively are analyzed for the flexural load level of 0 60 and the distribution forms of c cr corresponding to 15 concrete cores 3 5 representing three different flexural loads and five concrete cores corresponding to each flexural load respectively are analyzed for the flexural load level of 30 60 it can be seen from tables 5 and 6 that the critical chloride concentrations in the simulated tidal environments are largely to follow the gumbel distribution when a higher flexural load level is exerted the distribution forms will change showing that the c cr in the simulated tidal environment obeys a normal distribution with mean value of 0 382 by weight of concrete however the distribution forms of c cr in the natural tidal environment show a stronger randomness moreover analyzing the effect of flexural loads on the distribution forms of c cr in different exposure environments it can be seen that under the flexural loads the c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment subordinate to a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 382 by weight of concrete and a normal distribution with mean value of 0 328 by weight of concrete respectively however without flexural loads c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment is found to follow a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 572 by weight of concrete and a log normal distribution with mean value of 0 356 by weight of concrete respectively 5 conclusions 1 under the same exposure conditions there is a strong randomness of free chloride profiles in tensile concrete zone of the rc beam and the randomness of free chloride profiles in the former surface concrete of convection zone is stronger than that in the stable diffusion zone moreover the randomness of free chloride profiles in the natural tidal environment is stronger than that in the simulated tidal environment 2 due to the dense corrosion layer in the process of corrosion development with exposure time the corrosion rate of tensile reinforcements quickly increases at first and then tends to be steady with exposure time under the long term natural exposure condition 3 the critical chloride concentrations c cr are tested in the two exposure environments described in this paper and the test results indicate that the value of c cr in the natural tidal environment is generally lower than that in the simulated tidal environment 4 the distribution forms of c cr of tested rc beams in different exposure environments all affected by flexural loads especially in the natural tidal environment considering the effect of flexural loads the c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment obeys a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 382 by weight of concrete and a normal distribution with mean value of 0 328 by weight of concrete respectively however without flexural loads c cr in the simulated and natural tidal environment is found to follow a gumbel distribution with mean value of 0 572 by weight of concrete and a log nomal distribution with mean value of 0 356 by weight of concrete respectively acknowledgments the authors acknowledge and appreciate support received from the research fund for the natural

according to the established approaches as shown in the following 1 theoretical models model 1 1 liu and weyers 1998a b according to the principle that the increase rate of rust weight was inversely

2003 2007 the mass of consumed reinforcement is related to the amount of the current that flows through the electrochemical corrosion cell many researchers have used faraday s law to estimate the weight loss of reinforcement from applied current density and its ability to predict the actual loss of steel at different current density levels had also been confirmed in study ahmed et al 2007 chen and mahadevan 2008 lu et al 2011 hence faraday s law can be also used to describe the corrosion amount maaddawy and soudki 2003 2007 1 9 m loss 10 7 π d i corr m z f t where m loss is the weight loss

or by pits along its perimeter for uniform corrosion model the diameter reduction of corroded reinforcement section was determined as follows 2 1 δ d t 0 0232 t t 0 i corr the corrosion ratio can be determined empirically 2 2 i corr 37 8 1 w c 1 64 cov er where δ d t is the diameter reduction of corroded reinforcement section t is the corrosion time t 0 is the time to corrosion initiation i corr

researches di and zhou 1996 established the relationship between section loss rate of reinforcement and relevant parameters including concrete cover thickness concrete strength and reinforcement diameter moreover after considering the influence of curing condition cement types and environmental condition the empirical model of section loss rate of reinforcement was obtained as described in eq

of surface reinforcement t is the corrosion time c is the concrete cover thickness r is the radius of reinforcement d c is the carbonation depth based on theoretical and empirical models above it can be seen that the theoretical models consider the influencing factors more comprehensive but these theoretical parameters are often difficult to determine and the theoretical models cannot be used in practical applications the empirical models focus on analyzing the influencing factors based on experimental results and engineering investigation therefore the influencing factors considered in the empirical models are limited leading to a difficult application of the empirical models to other experimental research in addition when speaking about corrosion rate of steel in concrete bertolini et al 2005 suggested that there are two different definitions i e average corrosion rate and instantaneous corrosion rate have to be distinguished the average corrosion rate can be determined as the average value over a long period of time by measuring weight loss or loss of cross section of the steel on site and the instantaneous corrosion rate i corr can be determined using electrochemical methods in particular polarization resistance determined by stationary or nonstationary electrochemical methods the theoretical models model 1 1 1 5 and experience models model 2 1 and 2 3 mentioned above calculated corrosion speed in concrete i e instantaneous corrosion rate i corr based on the electrochemical principle besides it is difficult to determine the relevant parameters such as β 1 β 2 and β 3 etc in model 2 2 for the calculation model of average corrosion rate therefore the relationship between average corrosion rate and exposure time should be further analyzed 
23056,collision avoidance in 3d environments is important to the problem of planning safe trajectories for an autonomous vehicle existing literature on collision avoidance assumed that obstacle shapes are known a priori and modeled obstacles as spheres or bounding boxes however in 3d environments an obstacle shape is unknown to the autonomous vehicle and the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using 3d sensors such as 3d sonar in this paper we introduce control laws for collision avoidance considering scenarios where a vehicle detects arbitrarily shaped and non convex obstacles using sensors moreover our control laws are designed considering motion constraints such as the maximum turn rate and the maximum speed rate of the vehicle the effectiveness of our control laws is verified using matlab simulations keywords collision avoidance 3d environment maximum turn rate maximum acceleration arbitrarily shaped obstacle 1 introduction in recent years significant advancements have been made in the capabilities of unmanned vehicles collision avoidance is important to the problem of planning safe trajectories for these vehicles many papers tackled collision avoidance in 2d environments kuchar and yang 2000 kuwata et al 2014 lalish 2009 van den berg et al 2011 guy et al 2009 kosecka et al 1997 chakravarthy and ghose 1998 chang et al 2003 lalish and morgansen 2012 eriksen 2015 the velocity obstacle vo approach has been adopted to avoid moving obstacles chakravarthy and ghose 1998 lalish 2009 van den berg et al 2011 in the vo approach it is assumed that an obstacle maintains its velocity at all future times the vo approach accounts for collision checks at all future times under the linear velocity assumption and is very fast to compute and is suitable for robotic applications where the algorithm is implemented on embedded systems that have limited computational resources and hard real time requirements kuwata et al 2014 sunkara and chakravarthy 2016 considered collision avoidance laws for objects with arbitrary shapes however sunkara and chakravarthy 2016 is restricted to an arbitrary obstacle in two dimensions several authors addressed 3d collision avoidance yang et al 2013 chakravarthy and ghose 2012 roelofsen et al 2016 lu et al 2017 xinggang et al 2014 existing literature on collision avoidance assumed that obstacle shapes are known a priori and modeled obstacles as spheres or bounding boxes chakravarthy and ghose 2012 yang et al 2013 choi et al 2006 lu et al 2017 ju et al 2001 however in 3d environments a vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using 3d sensors such as 3d sonar thus the vehicle can only access 3d points on an obstacle boundary not the entire obstacle dayangac et al 2016 darms et al 2009 pomerleau et al 2013 nobili et al 2017 granstrom and orguner 2012 our control laws are developed to avoid collision with each of these points as far as we know the collision avoidance controllers presented in this paper are novel in considering the fact that an obstacle shape is unknown a priori and that the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using sensors since we do not use shape approximations our approach is suitable for avoiding an arbitrary shaped and non convex obstacles a vehicle cannot turn or accelerate with infinite acceleration due to hardware limits considering the dynamic constraints of an uav lu et al 2017 xinggang et al 2014 roelofsen et al 2016 presented how to plan a global path for the uav so that it reaches a goal while avoiding collision however lu et al 2017 roelofsen et al 2016 xinggang et al 2014 did not consider a scenario where a vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using on board sensors note that a moving obstacle can change its velocity while it moves however the control laws in roelofsen et al 2016 xinggang et al 2014 did not use the velocity information of a moving obstacle thus may not be suitable for avoiding a fast moving obstacle lu et al 2017 is based on the dynamic rapidly exploring random tree rrt algorithm which expands the vehicle path iteratively until a path to the goal is found this approach assumes that obstacle environments are known to the vehicle a priori however this is not the case for our paper also there may be a case where the goal is too far from the vehicle position in 3d environments in this case it may not be feasible to generate a 3d path to the goal in real time thus lu et al 2017 may not be suitable for a case where the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary abruptly and the vehicle must re plan to avoid the obstacle this paper assumes that an obstacle maintains its velocity for a certain amount of time u time steps in the future under this assumption we provide control laws to achieve collision avoidance within u time steps in the future since we update control laws at each time step we achieve collision avoidance at each time step in the case where the vehicle does not detect an obstacle boundary the vehicle just moves toward its goal in our control laws we generate a safe velocity of the vehicle so that a collision is avoided using the generated velocity our control laws use the velocity information of a moving obstacle thus are suitable for avoiding a fast moving obstacle our control laws are designed considering motion constraints such as the maximum turn rate and the maximum speed rate of the vehicle moreover our control laws are designed to generate a safe velocity as fast as possible while minimizing the velocity change as far as we know the proposed collision avoidance controllers are novel in considering the fact that an obstacle shape is unknown a priori and that the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using sensors the effectiveness of our control laws is verified using matlab simulations the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the preliminary information of this paper section 3 discusses definitions and assumptions related to our paper section 4 introduces our control laws for collision avoidance section 5 introduces matlab simulations to verify our method section 6 provides conclusions 2 preliminary information 2 1 model this paper uses two reference frames an inertial reference frame i and a body fixed reference frame b fossen 1994 we introduce several definitions which are used in rigid body dynamics fossen 1994 the origin of i is an appropriate location with the axes pointing north east and down respectively the b frame is fixed to the vehicle and acts as the moving frame the origin of b frame is at the center of gravity of the vehicle ϕ θ ψ denote euler roll angle euler pitch angle and euler yaw angle in the inertial coordinate system ϕ θ ψ are used to place a 3 d body in any orientation let c η denote cos η also let s η denote sin η let t η denote tan η the counterclockwise rotation of ψ about the z axis in the inertial coordinate system is represented by the following rotation matrix r ψ 1 r ψ c ψ s ψ 0 s ψ c ψ 0 0 0 1 the

the heading vector of the vehicle η k is used to indicate η at time step k for instance a vehicle at time step k is located at q k r 3 the following equation shows the motion model of the vehicle in discrete time systems 5 q k 1 q k v k d t here d t denotes the sampling interval of our discrete time system considering the hardware information of the vehicle there are bounds for v k as follows the maximum speed of the vehicle is s m a x this implies that v k s m a x the maximum speed rate of the vehicle is a m a x which implies that 6 a m a x v k 1 v k d t a m a x the maximum turn rate of the vehicle is α this implies that 7 a v k v k 1 α d t for every time step k here a v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 denotes the angle formed by two vectors v 1 and v 2 recall that the vehicle can access 3d points on an obstacle boundary using sensors each point is called the obstacle point say o we assume that a vehicle can estimate the position and velocity of an obstacle point this assumption is commonly used in collision avoidance algorithms based on vo approaches chakravarthy and ghose 1998 lalish 2009 van den berg et al 2011 1 1 the velocity of an obstacle point is that of an obstacle which has the obstacle point on its boundary we can track an obstacle point with features to estimate the velocity of the associated obstacle opromolla et al 2015 dayangac et al 2016 granstrom and orguner 2012 used 3d sensor such as lidar to estimate the position and velocity of an obstacle the approach in opromolla et al 2015 dayangac et al 2016 granstrom and orguner 2012 can be used to estimate the velocity of an obstacle however estimating the velocity of an obstacle is not within the scope of this paper we say that the vehicle and an obstacle point collide in the case where the relative distance between the vehicle and the obstacle point is less than r to avoid collision with an obstacle it is assumed that the sensing range of a vehicle is bigger than r let obstacle sphere denote the sphere centered at an obstacle point o with radius r r is used to compensate for the inaccuracy of sensor measurements in other words r is determined by measurement error of 3d sensors on the vehicle many sensors lidar radar or any time of flight or vision sensors are bound to measurement error as we consider a 3d sensor with large measurement error we need to set r as a large value however considering a 3d sensor with small measurement error we can set r as a small value 4 control laws for collision avoidance 4 1 collision prediction we introduce how to predict collision between the vehicle q and an obstacle point say o within u time steps in the future the prediction window size u is related to the maneuverability of the vehicle in the case where α is small the vehicle cannot turn abruptly this case the vehicle must begin collision avoidance maneuver from an instant when the vehicle is far from an obstacle thus we need to set u as a large value for safe collision avoidance however in the case where α is large the vehicle can turn abruptly this case we can set u as a small value for safe collision avoidance let k denote the current time step let a k denote a at time step k we consider the case where q k o k r we assume that the vehicle moves with a constant velocity v within u time steps in the future also we assume that o moves with a constant velocity v o within u time steps since q k o k r q k is outside the obstacle sphere centered at o k since both q and o move with constant speeds a collision does not occur between two time steps k and k u in the case where 8 q k o k v v o u d t r for all u between 0 and u as we vary u in 8 from 0 to u q k v v o u d t forms the line l q k q k v v o u d t here l a b indicates the line segment connecting two points a and b using 8 we derive the following lemma which achieves collision avoidance between two time steps k and k u lemma 1 an obstacle point o moves with a constant velocity v o between two time steps k and k u also the vehicle q moves with a constant velocity v between two time steps k and k u suppose that q k is outside the obstacle sphere centered at o k the vehicle avoids colliding with the obstacle point between two time steps k and k u in the case where l q k q k v v o u d t does not meet the obstacle sphere we apply lemma 1 to provide a condition for collision avoidance within u time steps in the future we assume that v o does not change within u time steps under this assumption q can check whether it will collide within u time steps q checks if v which does not consider collision avoidance satisfies the following basic collision avoidance condition within u time steps l q k q k v v o u d t does not meet the obstacle sphere centered at o k in the case where l q k q k v v o u d t does not meet the obstacle sphere the vehicle uses v as its velocity command within one time step since collision is avoided using v in the case where l q k q k v v o u d t meets the obstacle sphere the vehicle searches for a feasible velocity to avoid collision using the method in the next subsection next lemma 2 presents the collision avoidance condition analytically using the basic collision avoidance condition lemma 2 let u c v k v o k o k q k d t v k v o k 2 if u c exists between 0 and u while satisfying that v k v o k then the vehicle avoids collision within u steps as long as the distance between q k u c d t v k v o k and o k is bigger than r otherwise the vehicle avoids collision within u steps as long as q k v v o u d t o k r proof let d m i n denote the minimum distance between o k and a point on l q k q k v v o u d t we present how to derive d m i n analytically let d u be defined as 9 d u o k q k v v o u d t where u is between 0 and u we next search for u minimizing d u to search for u minimizing d u we find u satisfying that d u u 0 let u c denote u satisfying this we get 10 u c v k v o k o k q k v k v o k 2 d t if u c exists between 0 and u while satisfying that v k v o k then d m i n is d u c otherwise the point on l q k q k v v o u d t which is the closest to o k is one end point of this line thus d m i n is m i n o k q k q k v v o u d t o k recall that d m i n denotes the minimum distance between o k and a point on l q k q k v v o u d t in the case where d m i n is bigger than r the vehicle avoids collision within u steps using the basic collision avoidance condition this lemma is proved using d m i n derived in the previous paragraph 4 2 search for a safe velocity vector avoiding collision in the case where the collision avoidance condition is not satisfied for at least one obstacle point the vehicle searches for a safe velocity to avoid collision once a safe velocity is found then the vehicle uses the found velocity as its velocity within one step this maneuver is called the collision avoidance maneuver to avoid an abrupt collision case the vehicle does not move toward the goal directly as the vehicle detects any obstacle using its sensors also we set the minimum time interval i for the collision avoidance maneuver once a collision avoidance maneuver is triggered at time step k the vehicle does not move toward the goal directly from k to k i time steps we introduce two collision avoidance maneuvers constant speed safe maneuver and variable speed safe maneuver the idea of these maneuvers is to search for a velocity satisfying the collision avoidance condition followed by using the velocity to move the vehicle within one time step the constant speed safe maneuver is to search for a feasible velocity to avoid collision while not changing its speed v the variable speed safe maneuver is to search for a feasible velocity to avoid collision while changing its speed v 4 2 1 constant speed safe maneuver we consider constant speed safe maneuver in section 4 2 1 let u 1 0 0 t denote the heading vector of the vehicle in the body fixed frame using 4 we have 11 v k r ψ k θ k ϕ k v k u we first search for the orientation of the body say ψ k θ k ϕ k associated to v k suppose that only the pitch and the yaw of the body are controlled to achieve the desired heading this implies that we set ϕ k in 11 as zero then using 11 we derive 12 h k h k 1 h k 2 h k 3 t where h k v k v k is the heading vector at time step k also h k 1 c ψ k c θ k h k 2 s ψ k c θ k and h k 3 s θ k here h k j denote the jth element of h k we solve 12 to get 13 θ k a t a n 2 h k 3 h k 1 2 h k 2 2 we further solve 12 to get ψ k in the case where c θ k 0 we get 14 ψ k a t a n 2 h k 2 h k 1 in the case where c θ k 0 we get 15 ψ k a t a

safe velocity vector using the decreased u s considering time efficiency we may stop decreasing u s before it reaches 1 we acknowledge that there may be a case where a collision is unavoidable for instance consider the case where the maximum turn rate and the maximum speed rate of the vehicle are too small due to the strict motion constraints the vehicle cannot avoid collision with an obstacle which appears in front of the vehicle abruptly 5 matlab simulations the effectiveness of our variable speed collision avoidance control laws in algorithm 2 is verified using matlab simulations d t 1 seconds and i 10 seconds the goal of the vehicle is 0 500 50 the task of the vehicle is to reach the goal while avoiding collision we say that a collision occurs in the case where the relative

speed of the vehicle is 12 75 m s initially we set u 300 the maximum speed rate is 0 12 m s 2 the maximum turn rate is 1 2 r a d s we consider a vehicle equipped with a forward looking sonar sensor for collision avoidance the maximum sensing range is 100 m in the simulations we consider limited fov of sonar sensors the sensor has 240 horizontal scan and 240 vertical scan 24 rays are evenly generated in the horizontal direction as well as in the vertical direction in total 24 24 rays are generated to detect an obstacle at each time step to make our simulation more realistic we simulated sensor rays with low detection rate 0 68 this implies that we randomly select 68 percents of all 24 24 sensor rays and use the selected rays to detect an obstacle boundary as a selected ray intersects an obstacle an obstacle point is generated at the intersection in other words an obstacle point is generated as a selected ray intersects an obstacle boundary obstacle points are then used as inputs of collision avoidance control laws in the following simulations we consider arbitrarily shaped obstacles each of which has distinct size also we generated a non convex tunnel in front of the goal

vertices of each box shaped obstacle also the trajectory of the vehicle is depicted with red circles the goal point is depicted with a green asterisk 5 1 the initial position of the vehicle is 0 50 90 this subsection considers the case where the vehicle starts from 0 50 90 fig 2 shows the top view of the 3d simulation result also fig 3 shows the 3d view of the simulation result these figures show that the vehicle reaches the goal point while avoiding collision see that obstacle points detected by on board sensors are generated on obstacle boundaries and that the vehicle moves over the top of the first obstacle that it encounters the height of the first obstacle is 100 m also the vehicle moves through the tunnel just before reaching the goal fig 4 shows the yaw pitch and speed of the vehicle with respect to time considering the scenario in fig 2 at 6 s the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary for the first time and begins to change its pitch to get over the detected obstacle at 22 s the vehicle detects the second obstacle located at 0 300 in fig 2 and changes its yaw to avoid the obstacle see that the vehicle changes its attitude and speed in order to achieve collision avoidance while approaching the goal 5 2 the initial position of the vehicle is 0 50 50 this subsection considers the case where the vehicle starts from 0 50 50 we first consider the case where all obstacles do not move fig 5 presents the top view of the 3d simulation result and fig 6 presents the 3d view of the simulation result in these figures obstacle points detected by on board sensors are generated on obstacle boundaries since the initial z coordinate of the vehicle is not so large the vehicle does not move over the top of the first obstacle that it encounters recall that the height of the first obstacle is 100 m also the vehicle moves through the tunnel just before reaching the goal fig 7 presents the yaw pitch and speed of the vehicle with respect to time considering the scenario in fig 5 at 6 s the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary for the first time and begins to change its yaw to avoid colliding with the detected obstacle at 42 s the vehicle changes its yaw to get into the tunnel safely note that the vehicle changes its attitude and speed to avoid colliding with obstacles while approaching the goal we next consider the case where one obstacle the first obstacle that the vehicle encounters in fig 5 move with velocity 0 1 0 in m s the changing position of an obstacle is plotted every 3 s fig 8 presents the top view of the 3d simulation result and fig 9 presents the 3d view of the simulation result two blue lines on top of the first obstacle that the vehicle encounters indicate the trajectory of vertices of the moving obstacle these figures verify that the

changes its yaw abruptly to avoid colliding with the moving obstacle see that the vehicle changes its attitude and speed to avoid colliding with obstacles lastly we observe the effect of changing d t we set d t 5 seconds instead of 1 s we consider the case where one obstacle the first obstacle that the vehicle encounters in fig 5 move with velocity 0 1 0 in m s the changing position of an obstacle is plotted every 15 s fig 11 shows the top view of the 3d simulation result and fig 12 shows the 3d view of the simulation result since we set d t 5 seconds the trajectory of the vehicle gets less smoothed than the case where d t 1 second also obstacle points are distributed more sparsely than the case where d t 1 second fig 13 shows the yaw pitch and speed of the vehicle with respect to time considering the scenario in fig 11 at 6 s the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary for the first time and change its pitch and yaw for collision avoidance fig 13 clearly shows that the vehicle s attitude and speed change at every d t 5 seconds 6 conclusions in this paper we introduce control laws for collision avoidance considering 3d scenarios where a vehicle detects arbitrarily shaped obstacles using on board sensors our control laws are designed considering the maximum turn rate and the maximum speed rate of the vehicle the effectiveness of our control laws is verified using matlab simulations as our future works we will verify the effectiveness of our control laws using experiments with underwater robots this paper considers an obstacle which is not a deforming object for an underwater application shape shifting aquatic life forms can be considered as such deforming obstacles considering a deforming object each obstacle point can move with different velocities as our future work we will consider collision avoidance with a deforming object 
23056,collision avoidance in 3d environments is important to the problem of planning safe trajectories for an autonomous vehicle existing literature on collision avoidance assumed that obstacle shapes are known a priori and modeled obstacles as spheres or bounding boxes however in 3d environments an obstacle shape is unknown to the autonomous vehicle and the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using 3d sensors such as 3d sonar in this paper we introduce control laws for collision avoidance considering scenarios where a vehicle detects arbitrarily shaped and non convex obstacles using sensors moreover our control laws are designed considering motion constraints such as the maximum turn rate and the maximum speed rate of the vehicle the effectiveness of our control laws is verified using matlab simulations keywords collision avoidance 3d environment maximum turn rate maximum acceleration arbitrarily shaped obstacle 1 introduction in recent years significant advancements have been made in the capabilities of unmanned vehicles collision avoidance is important to the problem of planning safe trajectories for these vehicles many papers tackled collision avoidance in 2d environments kuchar and yang 2000 kuwata et al 2014 lalish 2009 van den berg et al 2011 guy et al 2009 kosecka et al 1997 chakravarthy and ghose 1998 chang et al 2003 lalish and morgansen 2012 eriksen 2015 the velocity obstacle vo approach has been adopted to avoid moving obstacles chakravarthy and ghose 1998 lalish 2009 van den berg et al 2011 in the vo approach it is assumed that an obstacle maintains its velocity at all future times the vo approach accounts for collision checks at all future times under the linear velocity assumption and is very fast to compute and is suitable for robotic applications where the algorithm is implemented on embedded systems that have limited computational resources and hard real time requirements kuwata et al 2014 sunkara and chakravarthy 2016 considered collision avoidance laws for objects with arbitrary shapes however sunkara and chakravarthy 2016 is restricted to an arbitrary obstacle in two dimensions several authors addressed 3d collision avoidance yang et al 2013 chakravarthy and ghose 2012 roelofsen et al 2016 lu et al 2017 xinggang et al 2014 existing literature on collision avoidance assumed that obstacle shapes are known a priori and modeled obstacles as spheres or bounding boxes chakravarthy and ghose 2012 yang et al 2013 choi et al 2006 lu et al 2017 ju et al 2001 however in 3d environments a vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using 3d sensors such as 3d sonar thus the vehicle can only access 3d points on an obstacle boundary not the entire obstacle dayangac et al 2016 darms et al 2009 pomerleau et al 2013 nobili et al 2017 granstrom and orguner 2012 our control laws are developed to avoid collision with each of these points as far as we know the collision avoidance controllers presented in this paper are novel in considering the fact that an obstacle shape is unknown a priori and that the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using sensors since we do not use shape approximations our approach is suitable for avoiding an arbitrary shaped and non convex obstacles a vehicle cannot turn or accelerate with infinite acceleration due to hardware limits considering the dynamic constraints of an uav lu et al 2017 xinggang et al 2014 roelofsen et al 2016 presented how to plan a global path for the uav so that it reaches a goal while avoiding collision however lu et al 2017 roelofsen et al 2016 xinggang et al 2014 did not consider a scenario where a vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using on board sensors note that a moving obstacle can change its velocity while it moves however the control laws in roelofsen et al 2016 xinggang et al 2014 did not use the velocity information of a moving obstacle thus may not be suitable for avoiding a fast moving obstacle lu et al 2017 is based on the dynamic rapidly exploring random tree rrt algorithm which expands the vehicle path iteratively until a path to the goal is found this approach assumes that obstacle environments are known to the vehicle a priori however this is not the case for our paper also there may be a case where the goal is too far from the vehicle position in 3d environments in this case it may not be feasible to generate a 3d path to the goal in real time thus lu et al 2017 may not be suitable for a case where the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary abruptly and the vehicle must re plan to avoid the obstacle this paper assumes that an obstacle maintains its velocity for a certain amount of time u time steps in the future under this assumption we provide control laws to achieve collision avoidance within u time steps in the future since we update control laws at each time step we achieve collision avoidance at each time step in the case where the vehicle does not detect an obstacle boundary the vehicle just moves toward its goal in our control laws we generate a safe velocity of the vehicle so that a collision is avoided using the generated velocity our control laws use the velocity information of a moving obstacle thus are suitable for avoiding a fast moving obstacle our control laws are designed considering motion constraints such as the maximum turn rate and the maximum speed rate of the vehicle moreover our control laws are designed to generate a safe velocity as fast as possible while minimizing the velocity change as far as we know the proposed collision avoidance controllers are novel in considering the fact that an obstacle shape is unknown a priori and that the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using sensors the effectiveness of our control laws is verified using matlab simulations the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the preliminary information of this paper section 3 discusses definitions and assumptions related to our paper section 4 introduces our control laws for collision avoidance section 5 introduces matlab simulations to verify our method section 6 provides conclusions 2 preliminary information 2 1 model this paper uses two reference frames an inertial reference frame i and a body fixed reference frame b fossen 1994 we introduce several definitions which are used in rigid body dynamics fossen 1994 the origin of i is an appropriate location with the axes pointing north east and down respectively the b frame is fixed to the vehicle and acts as the moving frame the origin of b frame is at the center of gravity of the vehicle ϕ θ ψ denote euler roll angle euler pitch angle and euler yaw angle in the inertial coordinate system ϕ θ ψ are used to place a 3 d body in any orientation let c η denote cos η also let s η denote sin η let t η denote tan η the counterclockwise rotation of ψ about the z axis in the inertial coordinate system is represented by the following rotation matrix r ψ 1 r ψ c ψ s ψ 0 s ψ c ψ 0 0 0 1 the

the heading vector of the vehicle η k is used to indicate η at time step k for instance a vehicle at time step k is located at q k r 3 the following equation shows the motion model of the vehicle in discrete time systems 5 q k 1 q k v k d t here d t denotes the sampling interval of our discrete time system considering the hardware information of the vehicle there are bounds for v k as follows the maximum speed of the vehicle is s m a x this implies that v k s m a x the maximum speed rate of the vehicle is a m a x which implies that 6 a m a x v k 1 v k d t a m a x the maximum turn rate of the vehicle is α this implies that 7 a v k v k 1 α d t for every time step k here a v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 denotes the angle formed by two vectors v 1 and v 2 recall that the vehicle can access 3d points on an obstacle boundary using sensors each point is called the obstacle point say o we assume that a vehicle can estimate the position and velocity of an obstacle point this assumption is commonly used in collision avoidance algorithms based on vo approaches chakravarthy and ghose 1998 lalish 2009 van den berg et al 2011 1 1 the velocity of an obstacle point is that of an obstacle which has the obstacle point on its boundary we can track an obstacle point with features to estimate the velocity of the associated obstacle opromolla et al 2015 dayangac et al 2016 granstrom and orguner 2012 used 3d sensor such as lidar to estimate the position and velocity of an obstacle the approach in opromolla et al 2015 dayangac et al 2016 granstrom and orguner 2012 can be used to estimate the velocity of an obstacle however estimating the velocity of an obstacle is not within the scope of this paper we say that the vehicle and an obstacle point collide in the case where the relative distance between the vehicle and the obstacle point is less than r to avoid collision with an obstacle it is assumed that the sensing range of a vehicle is bigger than r let obstacle sphere denote the sphere centered at an obstacle point o with radius r r is used to compensate for the inaccuracy of sensor measurements in other words r is determined by measurement error of 3d sensors on the vehicle many sensors lidar radar or any time of flight or vision sensors are bound to measurement error as we consider a 3d sensor with large measurement error we need to set r as a large value however considering a 3d sensor with small measurement error we can set r as a small value 4 control laws for collision avoidance 4 1 collision prediction we introduce how to predict collision between the vehicle q and an obstacle point say o within u time steps in the future the prediction window size u is related to the maneuverability of the vehicle in the case where α is small the vehicle cannot turn abruptly this case the vehicle must begin collision avoidance maneuver from an instant when the vehicle is far from an obstacle thus we need to set u as a large value for safe collision avoidance however in the case where α is large the vehicle can turn abruptly this case we can set u as a small value for safe collision avoidance let k denote the current time step let a k denote a at time step k we consider the case where q k o k r we assume that the vehicle moves with a constant velocity v within u time steps in the future also we assume that o moves with a constant velocity v o within u time steps since q k o k r q k is outside the obstacle sphere centered at o k since both q and o move with constant speeds a collision does not occur between two time steps k and k u in the case where 8 q k o k v v o u d t r for all u between 0 and u as we vary u in 8 from 0 to u q k v v o u d t forms the line l q k q k v v o u d t here l a b indicates the line segment connecting two points a and b using 8 we derive the following lemma which achieves collision avoidance between two time steps k and k u lemma 1 an obstacle point o moves with a constant velocity v o between two time steps k and k u also the vehicle q moves with a constant velocity v between two time steps k and k u suppose that q k is outside the obstacle sphere centered at o k the vehicle avoids colliding with the obstacle point between two time steps k and k u in the case where l q k q k v v o u d t does not meet the obstacle sphere we apply lemma 1 to provide a condition for collision avoidance within u time steps in the future we assume that v o does not change within u time steps under this assumption q can check whether it will collide within u time steps q checks if v which does not consider collision avoidance satisfies the following basic collision avoidance condition within u time steps l q k q k v v o u d t does not meet the obstacle sphere centered at o k in the case where l q k q k v v o u d t does not meet the obstacle sphere the vehicle uses v as its velocity command within one time step since collision is avoided using v in the case where l q k q k v v o u d t meets the obstacle sphere the vehicle searches for a feasible velocity to avoid collision using the method in the next subsection next lemma 2 presents the collision avoidance condition analytically using the basic collision avoidance condition lemma 2 let u c v k v o k o k q k d t v k v o k 2 if u c exists between 0 and u while satisfying that v k v o k then the vehicle avoids collision within u steps as long as the distance between q k u c d t v k v o k and o k is bigger than r otherwise the vehicle avoids collision within u steps as long as q k v v o u d t o k r proof let d m i n denote the minimum distance between o k and a point on l q k q k v v o u d t we present how to derive d m i n analytically let d u be defined as 9 d u o k q k v v o u d t where u is between 0 and u we next search for u minimizing d u to search for u minimizing d u we find u satisfying that d u u 0 let u c denote u satisfying this we get 10 u c v k v o k o k q k v k v o k 2 d t if u c exists between 0 and u while satisfying that v k v o k then d m i n is d u c otherwise the point on l q k q k v v o u d t which is the closest to o k is one end point of this line thus d m i n is m i n o k q k q k v v o u d t o k recall that d m i n denotes the minimum distance between o k and a point on l q k q k v v o u d t in the case where d m i n is bigger than r the vehicle avoids collision within u steps using the basic collision avoidance condition this lemma is proved using d m i n derived in the previous paragraph 4 2 search for a safe velocity vector avoiding collision in the case where the collision avoidance condition is not satisfied for at least one obstacle point the vehicle searches for a safe velocity to avoid collision once a safe velocity is found then the vehicle uses the found velocity as its velocity within one step this maneuver is called the collision avoidance maneuver to avoid an abrupt collision case the vehicle does not move toward the goal directly as the vehicle detects any obstacle using its sensors also we set the minimum time interval i for the collision avoidance maneuver once a collision avoidance maneuver is triggered at time step k the vehicle does not move toward the goal directly from k to k i time steps we introduce two collision avoidance maneuvers constant speed safe maneuver and variable speed safe maneuver the idea of these maneuvers is to search for a velocity satisfying the collision avoidance condition followed by using the velocity to move the vehicle within one time step the constant speed safe maneuver is to search for a feasible velocity to avoid collision while not changing its speed v the variable speed safe maneuver is to search for a feasible velocity to avoid collision while changing its speed v 4 2 1 constant speed safe maneuver we consider constant speed safe maneuver in section 4 2 1 let u 1 0 0 t denote the heading vector of the vehicle in the body fixed frame using 4 we have 11 v k r ψ k θ k ϕ k v k u we first search for the orientation of the body say ψ k θ k ϕ k associated to v k suppose that only the pitch and the yaw of the body are controlled to achieve the desired heading this implies that we set ϕ k in 11 as zero then using 11 we derive 12 h k h k 1 h k 2 h k 3 t where h k v k v k is the heading vector at time step k also h k 1 c ψ k c θ k h k 2 s ψ k c θ k and h k 3 s θ k here h k j denote the jth element of

vehicle with respect to time considering the scenario in fig 2 at 6 s the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary for the first time and begins to change its pitch to get over the detected obstacle at 22 s the vehicle detects the second obstacle located at 0 300 in fig 2 and changes its yaw to avoid the obstacle see that the vehicle changes its attitude and speed in order to achieve collision avoidance while approaching the goal 5 2 the initial position of the vehicle is 0 50 50 this subsection considers the case where the vehicle starts from 0 50 50 we first consider the case where all obstacles do not move fig 5 presents the top view of the 3d simulation result and fig 6 presents the 3d view of the simulation result in these figures obstacle points detected by on board sensors are generated on obstacle boundaries since the initial z coordinate of the vehicle is not so large the vehicle does not move over the top of the first obstacle that it encounters recall that the height of the first obstacle is 100 m also the vehicle moves through the tunnel just before reaching the goal fig 7 presents the yaw pitch and speed of the vehicle with respect to time considering the scenario in fig 5 at 6 s the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary for the first time and begins to change its yaw to avoid colliding with the detected obstacle at 42 s the vehicle changes its yaw to get into the tunnel safely note that the vehicle changes its attitude and speed to avoid colliding with obstacles while approaching the goal we next consider the case where one obstacle the first obstacle that the vehicle encounters in fig 5 move with velocity 0 1 0 in m s the changing position of an obstacle is plotted every 3 s fig 8 presents the top view of the 3d simulation result and fig 9 presents the 3d view of the simulation result two blue lines on top of the first obstacle that the vehicle encounters indicate the trajectory of vertices of the moving obstacle these figures verify that the vehicle reaches the goal point while achieving collision avoidance to let the reader observe the vehicle s motion more clearly we uploaded the movie of our vehicle on the following website https youtu be 1itxmnkcjwy fig 10 presents the yaw pitch and speed of the vehicle with respect to time considering the scenario in fig 8 at 6 s the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary for the first time and changes its yaw abruptly to avoid colliding with the moving obstacle see that the vehicle changes its attitude and speed to avoid colliding with obstacles lastly we observe the effect of changing d t we set d t 5 seconds instead of 1 s we consider the case where one obstacle the first obstacle that the vehicle encounters in fig 5 move with velocity 0 1 0 in m s the changing position of an obstacle is plotted every 15 s fig 11 shows the top view of the 3d simulation result and fig 12 shows the 3d view of the simulation result since we set d t 5 seconds the trajectory of the vehicle gets less smoothed than the case where d t 1 second also obstacle points are distributed more sparsely than the case where d t 1 second fig 13 shows the yaw pitch and speed of the vehicle with respect to time considering the scenario in fig 11 at 6 s the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary for the first time and change its pitch and yaw for collision avoidance fig 13 clearly shows that the vehicle s attitude and speed change at every d t 5 seconds 6 conclusions in this paper we introduce control laws for collision avoidance considering 3d scenarios where a vehicle detects arbitrarily shaped obstacles using on board sensors our control laws are designed considering the maximum turn rate and the maximum speed rate of the vehicle the effectiveness of our control laws is verified using matlab simulations as our future works we will verify the effectiveness of our control laws using experiments with underwater robots this paper considers an obstacle which is not a deforming object for an underwater application shape shifting aquatic life forms can be considered as such deforming obstacles considering a deforming object each obstacle point can move with different velocities as our future work we will consider collision avoidance with a deforming object 
23057,a better understanding of the main factors and mechanisms that shape the long term cliff morphology is essential for effective responses to future coastal cliff erosion threats and occurrences in this study the interactions among sea cliff morphology beach morphology and coastal hydrodynamics were investigated for eight coastal sites near santa barbara california this investigation utilizes digital elevation model data and historical shoreline and cliff edge survey data it was found that for the study sites with similar meteorological characteristics the cliff slope is negatively correlated with the beach width and height and the cliff slope is governed by the inundation number which is the ratio of the effective wave run up height and beach cliff junction height distinct shoreline erosion or accretion trends were not observed for most of the eight sites buffer zones of beach cliff systems however have been widening mainly due to cliff erosion among the study sites the widening of the buffer zone was larger for wider beaches where cliff slopes were gentler our analysis indicated that long term cliff erosion in southern california may be estimated by using adequate wave induced cliff erosion models keywords coastal cliffs cliff slope cliff erosion beach width shoreline evolution 1 introduction sea cliffs are steep geological features with slopes typically larger than 40 goudie 2004 and around 80 of the earth s coastlines have sea cliffs emery and kuhn 1982 along the southern california coast of the united states sea cliffs with narrow beaches and uplifted marine terraces are common landforms muhs et al 1992 many communities have been built on uplifted terraces near the coastlines griggs et al 2005 however in this region coastlines and cliffs have been retreating landward for over 18 000 years due to rising sea levels griggs and patsch 2004 to prepare for and mitigate negative impacts of cliff erosion on the coastal communities properly a better understanding of cliff and beach morphology is a pressing requirement sea cliff morphodynamics especially slope angle and erosion rate are influenced by marine processes e g waves and tide subaerial processes e g mass movements weathering and bio erosion and characteristics of rock materials masselink et al 2011 emery and kuhn 1982 sea cliffs are steep when marine processes are predominant and are gentle when subaerial processes are predominant masselink et al 2011 the resistance to cliff erosion mainly depends on rock hardness sunamura 1992 the santa barbara littoral cell is an approximately 230 km long coastline from the mouth of the santa maria river to the mugu submarine canyon see fig 1 patsch and griggs 2007 the sea cliffs in this cell are comprised of mainly monterey shale miocene siliceous rocks or the sisquoc formation post monterey diatomaceous rocks that contains more mud rich siliceous rocks than the monterey formation as the bedrock unit and overlying unlithified marine terrace deposits and soils barron 1986 bramlette 1946 minor et al 2009 patsch and griggs 2007 the mean long term cliff erosion rate in the santa barbara cell which includes highly erodible cliffs is approximately 0 20 m yr hapke et al 2009 sea cliffs are important sediment sources for beach and coastal systems runyan and griggs 2003 young and ashford 2006 beaches protect the cliffs by dissipating part or the entirety of the wave energy before reaching the toe of the cliffs beach morphology responds dynamically to the coastal hydrodynamics and sediment mass balance by the cross shore and long shore sediment transports in the short term from seasonal to yearly timescales cliffs and beaches erode under high energy conditions with offshore movement of the eroded sediment during low energy conditions onshore sediment movement occurs which leads to beach accretion dean and dalrymple 2004 patsch and griggs 2006 despite the fact that cliff erosion is an irreversible unidirectional process beach morphology may be recovered in the long term from decades to centuries timescales beach volume and shoreline evolution are a result of the sediment budget and long term changes in the hydrodynamic conditions such as sea level rise in the santa barbara littoral cell sediment supply rate from rivers e g santa maria santa ynez ventura and santa clara rivers and sea cliffs decreased by 40 5 1 128 483 m3 year and 21 4 2 294 m3 year respectively due to dam constructions and cliff armouring patsch and griggs 2007 this translates to a 40 4 1 130 777 m3 year reduction of the total sediment supply rate in the santa barbara littoral cell the reduction of fluvial and coastal sediment supply due to such man made structures may lead to beach narrowing the primary mechanism of sea cliff erosion has been typically considered to be the wave abrasion at the base of a cliff smith et al 1994 sunamura 1992 1983 sunamura 1992 proposed an equation of wave induced cliff erosion rate as a function of the ratio of wave forces and compressive strength of the cliff ruggiero et al 2001 considering that wave attack is the primary factor for cliff bluff erosion for the oregon coast proposed predictions for the frequency of occurrence of wave induced erosion from relationships between effective wave run up i e sum of the wave run up height and water level and beach cliff junction height the beach cliff junction which is also referred to as the toe of a sea cliff is defined as the boundary between the beach and cliff ruggiero et al 2001 documented that the cliff erosion rate has a negative relationship with the beach cliff junction height there are various studies that consider cliff landslides as the primary mechanism for sea cliff erosion e g lee et al 2002 sajinkumar et al 2017 kuhn and shepard 1984 while confirming the importance of wave actions highlighted the effects of landslides and surface runoffs on cliff erosion in southern california more recently young et al 2009 challenged the primary role of wave abrasion for cliff erosion and suggested that groundwater seepage due to rainfall is the primary mechanism for cliff erosion occurrences at their study sites in southern california coast based on a four year lidar survey young et al however also noted that both marine and subaerial processes accelerate the cliff retreat rate as the waves remove cliff materials e g debris and talus from the cliff base which in turn favors subsequent landslides thus the governing roles of the marine and subaerial processes for the cliff morphodynamics are yet to be completely understood moreover detailed investigations on the relationship between the long term shoreline and cliff evolution are necessary because narrowing beaches lose effectiveness in protecting sea cliffs from wave attacks resulting in an acceleration of cliff erosion furthermore under the circumstances of decreasing sediment supply from rivers and cliffs due to human activities as for the case of santa barbara littoral cell it is necessary to have a better understanding and modeling capabilities of beach and cliff morphodynamic interactions this study investigates the complex interconnections among the cliff morphology beach morphology and coastal hydrodynamics for the santa barbara littoral cell using a digital elevation model dem with a goal to assess the long term shoreline evolutions and buffer zone changes of the beach cliff systems in the study sites in this article buffer zone of a beach cliff system or shortly buffer zone refers to the cross shore distance between the shoreline and cliff top of a beach cliff system 2 study sites the study sites are located to the north of the channel islands as shown in fig 1 eight sites fig 1 and table 1 which have sea cliffs with narrow beaches were selected in these sites the shorelines are nearly straight and cliff armouring and beach nourishment have been implemented minimally csmw 2010 although wood fences were partially used as cliff armours in the isla vista site we selected this site because cliff erosion in the isla vista site has been the most severe among the selected eight study sites moreover shoreline and beach profile evolutions in isla vista have been investigated in a number of studies e g barnard et al 2012 barnard et al 2009 revell and griggs 2006 resulting in a wealth of information for this site in the summerland 1 site sheet pilings were installed as cliff armours for approximately 0 1 km along the shore which corresponds to approximately 10 of the total shore length while young 2018 documented that cliff armouring substantially reduces the cliff erosion rate in southern california we expect limited effects of the armours in the summerland 1 site for our analyses as they provide protection for only a small portion of the site according to minor et al 2009 sea cliffs mainly consists of lithified miocene mudstone sandstone shale and diatomite in the lower units in the gato canyon 1 gato canyon 2 arroyo burro beach shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 sites the upper units comprise of unlithified marine terrace deposits and soils the upper units are typically weaker than the lower units and less resistant to cliff erosion the monterey formation contains 34 1 of sand content the sisquoc formation contains 21 9 of sand content and the marine terrace deposits contain 62 0 of sand content runyan and griggs 2003 in the isla vista site where cliff erosion was most severe among our sites the cliffs consist of the sisquoc formation and the unlithified pleistocene terrace deposits the hardness of which are lower than those of the monterey formation gato canyon 1 arroyo burro beach shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 sites the mean cliff retreat rate was 0 2 m yr in isla vista between 1965 and 1994 csb 2004 furthermore the mean beach width in this site was 25 m in 1938 and 12 m in 2003 revell and griggs 2006 seasonal shoreline evolutions typically lead to narrower beaches during the winter and spring seasons and wider beaches during the summer and fall seasons climate events with larger timescales such as el niño have major impacts on beach processes and shoreline evolution severe el niño storms in 1982 83 and 1997 98 caused distinct beach width changes in the vicinity of isla vista and the beach widths have not fully recovered since then barnard et al 2009 on the other hand large volumes of fluvial sediment were available in the southern california coast during the wet period between 1969 and 1998 inman and jenkins 1999 schwartz 2005 moreover sea level rise causes landward migration of the shoreline vitousek et al 2017 the mean grain size at different locations in the nearshore of the santa barbara littoral cell ranges from 0 15 to 0 43 mm fine to medium sand and the average of the mean grain sizes is 0 27 mm mustain et al 2007 the mean offshore significant wave height h s was 1 1 m and the mean dominant wave period t p was 10 6 s from july 2002 to may 2011 at the goleta point barnard et al 2012 which is the nearest wave buoy from the study sites and at the water depth h of 182 57 m see fig 1 during this time period the dominant wave direction θ was 257 6 since the channel islands prevent waves from propagating northward see fig 1 high amplitude waves approach mainly from west to east leading to unidirectional eastward littoral drift in the santa barbara harbour fig 1 the semi diurnal tide is predominant and the mean diurnal tide range is 1 65 m micro tidal coast noaa 2016a the near surface currents around our study sites predominantly flow northwestward along the coastlines of the santa barbara channel harms and winant 1998 however the tidal currents are considerably weak 0 05 m s münchow 1998 and are not taken into account in this study moreover the effects of sea level rise 1 1 1 3 mm yr from 1973 to 2015 in the santa barbara harbour according to noaa 2016a were also not taken into account in this study the study region has a semi arid climate that is classified as csb in the köppen geiger climate classification ryan 1994 the mean annual precipitation in the study region is approximately 450 mm ryan 1994 which is less than half of the global mean annual precipitation amount 1033 mm from 1961 to 1990 according to noaa 2016b over 90 of the rainfall amount occurs between the months of november and april 3 data and analysis methodology 3 1 topographic data to evaluate sea cliff and beach profiles a digital elevation model dem was used the dem data for the study sites is available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2013 the dem was created by integrating multiple observation systems such as topographic and bathymetric lidar and multi beam sonar most of the topographic data was collected in september 2010 the dem cell size is 1 m 1 m although the accuracy of the dem data varies horizontal accuracy is estimated to be less than 1 5 m noaa 2013 vertical accuracy of topographic lidar is estimated to be 0 15 m rmse root mean square error with 95 confidence level on flat terrain and 0 30 m rmse in hilly terrain noaa 2012 vertical accuracy of the bathymetric data is 0 30 m rmse our topographic analysis was carried out using arcgis map 10 2 esri 2016 historical shoreline in 1869 71 march june 1933 february 1976 and april 1998 and cliff edge in 1933 and 1998 data was documented by the united states geological survey usgs hapke et al 2006 hapke and reid 2007 the shorelines and cliff edges in 1869 71 1933 and 1976 were adjusted by hapke et al 2006 and hapke and reid 2007 using noaa topographic sheets t sheets and aerial photos so that data obtained at different times can be compared the maximum estimated horizontal measurement error for this data was within a range of 10 1 m and 13 9 m hapke et al 2006 hapke and reid 2007 the shoreline and cliff edge data for april 1998 was determined by hapke et al 2006 and for september 2010 was determined by our study from the available topographic lidar data which has a horizontal accuracy of 1 5 m in all of the shoreline determinations a mean high water level mhw of 1 33 m above navd88 was used to correct for water level fluctuations due to hydrodynamic conditions at the time of measurements shoreline movements due to sea level rise have a limited impact on our analysis as the expected increases in the mhw value for the timeframes 1869 1998 and 1998 2010 with different measurement methodologies are within the error ranges of these measurement methodologies therefore we neglected sea level rise effects in our analyses shoreline and cliff movements were evaluated by using cross shore transects that are 10 m apart in the alongshore direction in addition for each study site ten cross shore profiles were extracted from the dem data to calculate the characteristics of the sea cliff and beach profiles the alongshore distance between the cross shore profiles for calculating the sea cliff and beach profile characteristics was equal for a given site but ranged from 30 m to 140 m for different sites the definitions of cliff and beach profile characteristics are illustrated in fig 2 the cliff toe beach cliff junction and top are defined for our analysis as follows 1 cliff toe z i z i 1 x i x i 1 0 2 and z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 0 2 2 cliff top z i z i 1 x i x i 1 0 2 and z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 0 2 here the x axis origin was set at the shoreline mhw 1 33 m the offshore direction being positive x i and z i denote the cross shore distance from the shoreline and vertical elevation navd88 at the ith location respectively the index i increases in the offshore direction we used a low threshold value of 0 2 in eqs 1 and 2 to reduce the potential overestimations of beach height h be due to talus and depositions of rock debris near cliff toes when the criteria set in eqs 1 and 2 yielded multiple locations the positions of the cliff toe and cliff top were determined based upon visual judgments the percentage of visual judgements for the position determinations was approximately 34 visual judgments using beach and cliff profiles and aerial photos in such situations are still subject to errors due to the presence of features such as debris talus and undercut cliff and beach widths and heights were calculated using the cliff toe and top locations cliff and beach slopes were computed using linear regressions note that all of the values for the beach and cliff characteristics at a given site given in the figures and tables of this article are mean values that are calculated as specified in the relevant parts of section 4 3 2 hydrodynamic data in our analyses both offshore and nearshore wave conditions for the study sites were considered offshore wave conditions were utilized to classify the beach types and then select a suitable parameterization of wave run up height for our study sites see eqs 4 and 5 later in this section for offshore wave conditions we used the wave buoy measurements at the goleta point noaa 2016c which is the closest wave buoy to our study sites fig 1 in table 2 mean values of the offshore significant wave height h s dominant wave period t p and dominant wave direction θ for the wave records from 2005 until 2015 are provided nearshore wave conditions and water level data were utilized to estimate wave run up heights for our study sites for nearshore hydrodynamic conditions we used the simulation results of barnard et al 2014 for the severe el niño storm that occurred on january 18 25 2010 in their study barnard et al simulated maximum nearshore wave height and water level during this severe event using offshore wave conditions and considering the local bathymetry the maximum values of the nearshore wave height h s n and water level η max for each of our study sites are given in table 3 the mean offshore significant wave height during this event was within the top 0 5 of the daily significant wave heights reported for the observation period of 2005 2015 table 2 as a result this particular event caused one of the most severe coastal erosion occurrences in the southern california over the last several decades barnard et al 2011 therefore we considered these simulated hydrodynamic conditions as representative conditions for events that are associated with significant erosive activities and morphologic changes 3 3 analysis methodology according to ruggiero et al 2001 cliff erosion occurs when the effective wave run up height exceeds the beach cliff junction height the effective wave run up height r u max is defined by 3 r u max r u max η max here r u max is the maximum run up height and η max is the maximum water level rise above the mean high water level mhw due to factors such as wave set up surge effects and astronomical tidal level to estimate wave run up heights there are a number of parameterizations the selection of a suitable parameterization depends on the beach type as characterized by the surf similarity parameter ξ 0 which is defined in eq 4 4 ξ 0 tan γ 2 π h s g t 2 1 2 where tanγ is the nearshore beach slope h s is the offshore significant wave height g is the gravitational acceleration and t is the mean wave period guza and thornton 1982 suggested that significant wave run up height r s depends only on the nearshore significant wave height at 10 m water depth for the dissipative beaches of the southern california and provided the parameterization given in eq 5 5 r s 0 71 h s n 0 035 where h s n is the nearshore significant wave height we assumed that the run up height predictions by eq 5 for the el niño storm on january 18 25 2010 can be considered as the maximum run up heights r u max for our analyses in using eq 5 we utilized the maximum nearshore significant wave height values for this el niño storm that are provided by barnard et al 2014 wave induced cliff top erosion rate can be estimated using eq 6 which depends on the ratio of the wave forces per unit area p w and the compressive strength s c sunamura 2015 6 r t k p w s c ε here k is an empirical coefficient with the dimensions of length time and ε is a dimensionless threshold value the cliff erosion occurs when p w s c ε and henceforth ce p w s c is referred to as the cliff erosivity parameter note that ce can be considered to provide an indication of the relative importance of the erosive wave forces and resistive compressive forces in eq 6 in calculating the ce values means of the compressive strength value ranges s c for rock material classifications for each site as tabulated in table 1 are used to estimate the magnitude of the wave forces per unit area p w for broken waves rushing to a cliff face sunamura 2015 assumed a parameterization form similar to the one for the breaking waves against the cliff face this parameterization with the assumed form was adjusted to account for the difference in the physics of the two flow problems i e breaking waves against the cliff face and broken waves rushing to the cliff face by implementing a dimensionless empirical coefficient and height of the waves just in front of the cliff the values for both the dimensionless empirical coefficient and height of the waves in front of the cliffs for our study sites are unknown for our analyses therefore considering the physics of the impact and shear driven cliff erosion processes the magnitudes of the wave forces per unit area p w were assumed to be proportional to the dynamic pressure which can be approximated with the simplified expression provided in eq 7 for a first order analysis 7 p w 1 2 ρ s a l t u t o e 2 here ρ salt is the density of saltwater 1030 kg m3 in our calculations and u t o e is the flow speed at the cliff toe the flow velocity at a specific elevation u is estimated using a simple potential to kinetic energy conversion consideration without frictional losses for the vertical elevation difference from the run up height r u max to the elevation of interest z a e g van der meer 2011 as follows 8 u 2 g r u max z a here r u max and z a are elevations with respect to the mean water level mwl depending on the conditions the water level may or may not be higher than the cliff toe for example during the severe el niño storm on january 18 25 2010 the cliff toes were below the maximum water level η max h b e in four of our study sites gato canyon 1 isla vista shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 nevertheless in our study we approximated the flow speed at the cliff toe based upon the relationship between the effective run up height r u max and cliff toe height as parameterized in eq 9 9 u t o e 2 g r u max h b e while our ce estimates using the outlined procedure are not accurate as the estimated p w and s c values have a wide range and large uncertainties they still provide valuable information in analysing the erosion behaviour among the sites the mean long term buffer zone change rate for a given site d w d t w is defined as 10 d w d t d x s d t r t where dx s dt is the long term shoreline change rate 1869 2010 and r t is the long term cliff top erosion rate 1933 1998 using conservation of mass eq 10 can be modified as 11 d w d t 1 d s d q l d y q 0 r t here d is the depth of closure and y is the alongshore coordinate given its simplicity we estimated the depth of closure using the offshore wavelength d l 0 4 as proposed by komar 1976 from linear wave theory l 0 was calculated as 162 4 m for the 11 years averaged wave period of t 10 2 s this led to the depth of closure value as 40 61 m to be used in our calculations in eq 11 s is the sediment volume supplied from sea cliffs per unit alongshore distance per unit time as defined in eq 12 later dq l dy is the sediment transport rate change in the alongshore direction and q 0 is the cross shore sediment transport rate per unit alongshore distance for the sediment volume supplied by the cliffs we used eq 12 which does not consider bedrock lower unit and marine terrace deposits upper unit separately and also it does not take into account the percentages of the sand content as this information was not available to us for all of our study sites 12 s r t h cl where h cl is the cliff height as defined in fig 2 in our analysis we neglected the sediment transport rate change in the alongshore direction i e the second term on the right side of eq 11 by assuming that each selected beach is straight and the incident wave angles are not expected to change significantly along the beach in addition we assumed that cross shore sediment transport rate i e the third term on the right side of eq 11 can be represented in terms of the mobility parameter at the cliff toe ψ t o e u t o e 2 s 1 g d 50 here s is the specific gravity of the sediments and d 50 is the median grain diameter in our analysis the value of s is assumed to be 2 65 as for quartz sand and the value of d 50 in the study areas is assumed to be 0 27 mm based upon the average of mean grain size values reported by mustain et al 2007 moreover in our analysis the sediment loss under waves was assumed to be proportional to 3 2 power of the mobility parameter e g dyer 1986 consequently eq 11 can be expressed as 13 d w d t 1 d s ψ t o e 1 5 q r t where q is an unknown constant sediment transport rate per unit alongshore distance in the study sites eqs 9 and 13 yields 14 d w d t 1 d s 2 g r u max h b e s 1 g d 50 1 5 q r t 4 results and discussions 4 1 characteristics of cliff and beach profiles mean characteristics of cliff and beach profiles were calculated by averaging the relevant characteristics from the ten linear cross shore transects for each of the study sites table 4 the minimum mean cliff height 10 2 0 8 m was in the isla vista site and the maximum mean cliff height 44 5 2 3m was in the arroyo burro beach site see the mean cliff height h cl values provided in table 4 in the study sites mean cliff slopes tanα were relatively steep with values ranging from 0 95 to 1 68 43 5 mean cliff slope angle α 59 2 mean beach widths w be were relatively narrow in the isla vista shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 sites w be 10 0 m while beaches in the gato canyon 2 and summerland 1 sites were relatively wide w be 20 0 m as shown in fig 3 beach width has a strong positive relationship with beach height in the study sites with r squared r 2 0 90 and p value p 0 01 note that the significance level of p value is 0 05 in this study this strong relationship between the beach width and height may be explained by the fact that hydrodynamics in the nearshore zone does not differ substantially among the sites which results in small variations of the beach slopes in the study sites 0 06 tanβ 0 11 examining the relationships between the characteristics of cliff and beach profiles we found that the cliff slope has strong negative relationships with the beach width r squared r 2 0 83 p value p 0 01 and height r squared r 2 0 89 p value p 0 01 as shown in fig 4 this relationship would be explained through the governance of the cliff slopes by the magnitudes of the marine forces e g due to waves and tides at the cliff toe the study sites have highly dissipative beaches with ξ 0 values between 0 21 and 0 52 as tabulated in table 3 and the effective wave run up height r u max was calculated using eqs 3 and 5 the inundation number in r u max h b e provides a simple mean to estimate the relative importance of wave forces on the evolution of cliff morphology among the study sites the variation of the inundation number in value is mainly governed by the variation of the beach cliff junction height due to similar nearshore hydrodynamic conditions the dependency of the cliff slope on the inundation number for our study sites is shown in fig 5 as can be seen in this figure cliff slope has a clear positive correlation with the inundation number r 2 0 74 p 0 01 since the beach height was observed to have strong positive correlation with the beach width in the study sites in values for the sites with narrow beaches w be 10 0 m isla vista shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 sites are large in 3 1 and the cliff slopes in these sites are steep tanα 1 5 for the sites with wide beaches w be 20 0 m gato canyon 2 and summerland 1 sites the inundation numbers were small in 1 8 and the cliff slopes were gentle tanα 1 0 these observations demonstrate that wave forces acting on the cliffs and their erosive effects on the cliffs are larger for the sites with narrow beaches than the sites with wide beaches the physical explanation of this finding is the easier reach of the waves to the base of sea cliffs in the narrow beaches therefore one can conclude that when all other governing factors e g precipitation are the same the waves would more effectively undercut the cliffs and the cliff slopes become steeper as the beach width decreases 4 2 cliff top erosion rate the mean cliff top erosion rates r t for the study sites for the time period between 1933 and 1998 are calculated by averaging the cliff top erosion rate values at every 10 m as available along the site and are provided in table 5 r t is highest in the isla vista site 0 23 0 11 m yr and lowest in the summerland 2 site 0 06 0 03 m yr the mean cliff top erosion rate as a function of the inundation number for the study sites is shown in fig 6 a this figure indicates a poor correlation between r t and in r 2 0 11 p 0 42 in addition one would expect a negative correlation between the cliff erosion rate and cliff height as it would take more time for the waves to remove the larger quantities of materials e g debris and talus supplied by the erosion of higher cliffs the observational data from our study sites does not indicate such a relationship see fig 6b with r 2 0 01 p 0 79 sunamura 1992 suggested that the rate of cliff erosion mainly depends on the rock hardness e g unconfined compressive strength s c and rock structure the cliff top erosion rates at our study sites as a function of s c values are presented in fig 7 in the absence of available measurements we estimated the s c values based on the rock hardness category by minor et al 2009 and the national engineering handbook natural resources conservation service 2012 note that we could not estimate the s c values for the summerland 1 and summerland 2 sites because the rock hardness categories for these sites are unknown to us fig 7 indicates a clear correlation between the r t and estimated s c values r 2 0 63 p 0 06 and the controlling role of s c in cliff erosion rates for the study sites note that we may have significantly overestimated the s c values as we did not take into account the reduction of the rock strength due to factors such joints and faults nevertheless the data in fig 7 spreads such that even though there may be significant uncertainties in the s c values for a quantitative analysis our qualitative conclusion of the correlation between the r t and s c values would not be altered therefore our results provide further support for the benumof et al s 2000 finding that material properties are the primary factor for long term cliff erosion rate in southern california indeed fig 8 shows that r t and ce are correlated r 2 0 75 p 0 03 therefore the long term cliff top erosion rate for our study sites where the rock hardness on the lower cliff units is categorized from soft to very hard see table 1 can be explained by the cliff erosivity parameter moreover the continued progression of cliff erosion necessitates the removal of debris and talus from the cliff base by marine processes and to a lesser extent by subaerial processes as such this observed correlation between r t and ce can be considered as a support for the adoption of wave induced cliff erosion models to estimate the long term erosion of rocky cliffs in southern california 4 3 shoreline evolution and buffer zone change the shoreline evolutions for the study sites from 1869 to 2010 are shown in fig 9 the mean shoreline change value for each site was calculated by averaging the shoreline change at every 10 m as available along the site although the shoreline data may have large errors rmse 10 0 m before 1998 and include seasonal variations this figure indicates a clear retreat trend more than 30 m of shoreline retreat for the isla vista site from 1869 until 2010 and accretion trends more than 20 m of shoreline accretion for the summerland 1 and summerland 2 sites since 1976 long term 1869 2010 and mid term 1976 2010 shoreline changes were considered using linear regressions table 5 despite the fact that sediment supply from the fluvial and coastal environment has decreased approximately 40 in the santa barbara littoral cell due to man made activities patsch and griggs 2007 there are no evident long term shoreline erosion or accretion trends except for the isla vista site which experienced a 0 26 m yr shoreline retreat r 2 0 93 p 0 01 regarding the mid term 1976 2010 shoreline changes rapid beach recoveries 0 5 m yr shoreline accretion see table 5 occurred in the summerland 1 and summerland 2 sites and no significant shoreline change trend was observed for the rest of the sites historical shoreline data from 1933 1976 and 1998 were collected in the spring and the data from 2010 were collected in the fall the exact observation dates for the data collected during 1869 1871 were not available to us while the collected historical shoreline data includes seasonal effects these short term i e seasonal to multiannual effects were suppressed notably by the long timescale i e from 1869 until 2010 used in our linear regression analysis in particular our analysis showed that the shoreline change rate estimated using the data for the time period of 1869 2010 is identical to the shoreline change rate estimated using the data for the time period of 1869 1998 indicating the suppression of the seasonal effects fig 10 shows the observed mean long term buffer zone change calculated using eq 10 and the measured values of dx s dt and r t as a function of the beach width for our study sites as can be seen in this figure the buffer zones widened on most of the beaches in particular the buffer zone changes on wider beaches are larger since long term rates of shoreline change and cliff erosion see eq 10 are responsible for the buffer zone change the observed behaviour of buffer zone change in this figure indicates that the volumes of sediment supplied from sea cliffs cover more of and sometimes exceed the sediment volume washed out by waves as the beach width increases while we do not have the means to quantitatively evaluate for our study sites wider beaches are expected to dissipate more of the wave energy as compared to the narrower ones consequently one would expect that our study sites with wider beaches provide a less favourable environment for the wash out of sediment eroded from cliffs and shoreline recession moreover while beaches may provide protection of cliffs against wave driven erosion a correlation between the beach width and cliff erosion rates was not apparent for our study sites indeed for southern and central california that covers our study region young 2018 reported that cliffs fronted by beaches retreated more than cliffs without beaches our calculations using eq 12 indicate that sea cliffs supplied roughly between 1 09 and 7 12 m3 m yr of sediments among the study sites see table 5 in the arroyo burro beach site the cliff supplied a significantly larger volume of sediment than the other sites table 5 although most of the supplied sediments are washed away by offshore and long shore sediment transport a portion of the supplied sediment volume may remain on the beaches and in the nearshore zones to determine the main underlying factor s responsible for the observed buffer zone change variations among the study sites multiple regression analyses were conducted using eq 14 in these analyses we considered the value of q as unity note that conducting a sensitivity analysis we showed that assumed q value has no significant effect on our results the shapiro wilk test showed that residuals of the multiple regression analyses were normally distributed with p 0 51 for the 8 study sites since the normal distribution was confirmed by the shapiro wilk test the anova test with a stepwise regression was conducted and two of the resulting models are tabulated in table 6 the anova test indicated that while the cliff erosion rate has a small impact on the buffer zone change variation p 0 37 see model 1 in table 6 the term with the mobility parameter at the cliff toe in eq 14 has the most significant impact p 0 05 see models 1 and 2 in table 6 therefore the buffer zone change variations in the study sites may be attributed mainly to the washout effects related to the wave activities and the marine processes in general the regression analyses also indicated that the sediment supply term in eq 14 is also significant in model 2 p 0 04 the mobility parameter and sediment supply terms in model 2 see table 6 can explain w with the largest adjusted r square r 2 adj value of 0 75 nevertheless runyan and griggs 2003 argue that the bedrock materials of cliffs do not have significant impacts on the sediment budget in the santa barbara littoral cell because bedrock fragments would be broken down into finer sediments such as clay therefore although our analyses indicate its statistical significance the sediment volume supply from the cliffs s may not be a major contributor to the buffer zone change variations here we would like to note that the shoreline data has large measurement errors rmse 10 0 m before 1998 which has significant effects on the calculated buffer zone change values 0 03 m yr w 0 25 m yr for the study sites 4 4 limitations of the analysis various factors such as the complex nature of the relevant processes and their interactions availability of the data and measurement uncertainties complicate the analyses of typical geophysical flows such as the one considered in this study moreover long standing challenges in the theoretical modeling of the erosion deposition and transport of sediment in the coastal zone set additional complications for our relevant analyses in this study therefore our analyses necessitated implementation of various assumptions which set limitations in the quantitative aspects of our results due to the lack of field measurements our analyses considered estimated values for the compressive strength s c of the cliff rock at the study sites these estimations were using minor et al 2009 and nrcs 2012 clearly one would expect large uncertainties in the estimated s c values nevertheless as can be seen in fig 7 the data points are clustered in two groups the first group has larger r t values approx 0 15 0 25 m yr with smaller estimated s c values approx 25 60 mpa and the second group has smaller r t values approx 0 10 0 15 m yr with significantly larger estimated s c values approx 125 mpa since there is a very large range of s c values and a large gap between the s c values of the two groups even if the s c values for this data might have been overestimated as pointed out earlier in this section the qualitative conclusion presented in the article i e material properties are the primary factor for long term cliff erosion rate in the southern california would still be valid for quantitative results on the dependency of long term cliff erosion rates on cliff material properties accurate field measurements of cliff rock compressive strength are necessary our analysis for the long term buffer zone change neglected spatial i e alongshore change of longshore sediment transport rate i e the second term on the right side of eq 11 neglecting this term implies an assumption of straight beach and incident wave angle that does not change along a given beach all of the beaches considered in our study are straight beaches and the incident wave angles are not expected to change significantly along these beaches moreover given the complexity of the cross shore sediment transport modeling for our analyses purposes we assumed that cross shore sediment transport rate i e the third term on the right side of eq 11 can be represented in terms of the mobility parameter previous studies have shown that cross shore sediment transport and relevant sedimentary features e g ripples can be modeled using mobility parameter e g dyer 1986 voropayev et al 2003 testik et al 2005 van rijn 2007 moreover mobility parameter is related to the shields parameter i e the ratio of the shear forces on the sediment particle to the submerged weight of the particle see dean and dalrymple 2004 which is used in a number of sediment transport rate models e g madsen and grant 1976 sleath 1984 therefore while there would be clear limitations in the relevant quantitative interpretations this assumed dependency of the cross shore sediment transport on the mobility parameter is reasonable for the qualitative discussions presented in this article detailed numerical studies with hydrodynamic and sediment transport models are needed for relevant quantitative conclusions 5 conclusions this study investigates the interactions among coastal cliffs beaches and hydrodynamics near santa barbara california characteristics of cliff and beach profiles were examined using a digital elevation model it is concluded that the cliff slope is negatively correlated with the beach width and height although the exact effective run up height r u max values were unknown it is shown that the inundation number in r u max h b e alone which represents the wave effects can explain the observed cliff slope behaviour our analysis indicated that the inundation number and cliff height are not primary factors for determining the long term cliff top erosion rates at the study sites while the estimated compressive strength s c values had large uncertainties a relatively strong relationship between the cliff top erosion rate and the compressive strength was observed r 2 0 63 p 0 06 our findings are in agreement with the findings of benumof et al 1999 2000 which showed that the material properties are a primary factor for the long term erosion rates of cliff toes in southern california to elucidate the governing physical mechanism for the cliff erosion at the study sites the correlation between the observed cliff top erosion rate r t and the cliff erosivity parameter i e ce p w s c which is associated with the wave induced cliff erosion rate as proposed by sunamura 2015 was examined showing a relatively strong correlation between r t and ce at the study sites r 2 0 75 p 0 03 our analysis indicated that long term cliff erosion in southern california may be estimated by using adequate wave induced cliff erosion models the shoreline evolution and buffer zone changes in the study sites showed a significant long term 1869 2010 retreat trend in the isla vista site 0 26 m yr nevertheless distinct shoreline erosion or accretion trends were not observed at the other sites despite the approximately 40 reduction of sediment supply from rivers and cliffs as reported by patsch and griggs 2007 the long term buffer zone change rates d w d t were also investigated using the long term shoreline change rates and long term 1933 1998 cliff top erosion rates the buffer zones widened at most of the study sites particularly a large buffer zone widening was observed in the summerland 1 site where the cliff slopes were gentle and the current beach width is the largest among the study sites multiple regression analyses indicated that the mobility parameter at the cliff toe which represents the washout effects and the sediment supply from the sea cliffs were the important factors for the buffer zone change variations among the study sites acknowledgements this research was supported by the funds provided by the college of engineering

23057,a better understanding of the main factors and mechanisms that shape the long term cliff morphology is essential for effective responses to future coastal cliff erosion threats and occurrences in this study the interactions among sea cliff morphology beach morphology and coastal hydrodynamics were investigated for eight coastal sites near santa barbara california this investigation utilizes digital elevation model data and historical shoreline and cliff edge survey data it was found that for the study sites with similar meteorological characteristics the cliff slope is negatively correlated with the beach width and height and the cliff slope is governed by the inundation number which is the ratio of the effective wave run up height and beach cliff junction height distinct shoreline erosion or accretion trends were not observed for most of the eight sites buffer zones of beach cliff systems however have been widening mainly due to cliff erosion among the study sites the widening of the buffer zone was larger for wider beaches where cliff slopes were gentler our analysis indicated that long term cliff erosion in southern california may be estimated by using adequate wave induced cliff erosion models keywords coastal cliffs cliff slope cliff erosion beach width shoreline evolution 1 introduction sea cliffs are steep geological features with slopes typically larger than 40 goudie 2004 and around 80 of the earth s coastlines have sea cliffs emery and kuhn 1982 along the southern california coast of the united states sea cliffs with narrow beaches and uplifted marine terraces are common landforms muhs et al 1992 many communities have been built on uplifted terraces near the coastlines griggs et al 2005 however in this region coastlines and cliffs have been retreating landward for over 18 000 years due to rising sea levels griggs and patsch 2004 to prepare for and mitigate negative impacts of cliff erosion on the coastal communities properly a better understanding of cliff and beach morphology is a pressing requirement sea cliff morphodynamics especially slope angle and erosion rate are influenced by marine processes e g waves and tide subaerial processes e g mass movements weathering and bio erosion and characteristics of rock materials masselink et al 2011 emery and kuhn 1982 sea cliffs are steep when marine processes are predominant and are gentle when subaerial processes are predominant masselink et al 2011 the resistance to cliff erosion mainly depends on rock hardness sunamura 1992 the santa barbara littoral cell is an approximately 230 km long coastline from the mouth of the santa maria river to the mugu submarine canyon see fig 1 patsch and griggs 2007 the sea cliffs in this cell are comprised of mainly monterey shale miocene siliceous rocks or the sisquoc formation post monterey diatomaceous rocks that contains more mud rich siliceous rocks than the monterey formation as the bedrock unit and overlying unlithified marine terrace deposits and soils barron 1986 bramlette 1946 minor et al 2009 patsch and griggs 2007 the mean long term cliff erosion rate in the santa barbara cell which includes highly erodible cliffs is approximately 0 20 m yr hapke et al 2009 sea cliffs are important sediment sources for beach and coastal systems runyan and griggs 2003 young and ashford 2006 beaches protect the cliffs by dissipating part or the entirety of the wave energy before reaching the toe of the cliffs beach morphology responds dynamically to the coastal hydrodynamics and sediment mass balance by the cross shore and long shore sediment transports in the short term from seasonal to yearly timescales cliffs and beaches erode under high energy conditions with offshore movement of the eroded sediment during low energy conditions onshore sediment movement occurs which leads to beach accretion dean and dalrymple 2004 patsch and griggs 2006 despite the fact that cliff erosion is an irreversible unidirectional process beach morphology may be recovered in the long term from decades to centuries timescales beach volume and shoreline evolution are a result of the sediment budget and long term changes in the hydrodynamic conditions such as sea level rise in the santa barbara littoral cell sediment supply rate from rivers e g santa maria santa ynez ventura and santa clara rivers and sea cliffs decreased by 40 5 1 128 483 m3 year and 21 4 2 294 m3 year respectively due to dam constructions and cliff armouring patsch and griggs 2007 this translates to a 40 4 1 130 777 m3 year reduction of the total sediment supply rate in the santa barbara littoral cell the reduction of fluvial and coastal sediment supply due to such man made structures may lead to beach narrowing the primary mechanism of sea cliff erosion has been typically considered to be the wave abrasion at the base of a cliff smith et al 1994 sunamura 1992 1983 sunamura 1992 proposed an equation of wave induced cliff erosion rate as a function of the ratio of wave forces and compressive strength of the cliff ruggiero et al 2001 considering that wave attack is the primary factor for cliff bluff erosion for the oregon coast proposed predictions for the frequency of occurrence of wave induced erosion from relationships between effective wave run up i e sum of the wave run up height and water level and beach cliff junction height the beach cliff junction which is also referred to as the toe of a sea cliff is defined as the boundary between the beach and cliff ruggiero et al 2001 documented that the cliff erosion rate has a negative relationship with the beach cliff junction height there are various studies that consider cliff landslides as the primary mechanism for sea cliff erosion e g lee et al 2002 sajinkumar et al 2017 kuhn and shepard 1984 while confirming the importance of wave actions highlighted the effects of landslides and surface runoffs on cliff erosion in southern california more recently young et al 2009 challenged the primary role of wave abrasion for cliff erosion and suggested that groundwater seepage due to rainfall is the primary mechanism for cliff erosion occurrences at their study sites in southern california coast based on a four year lidar survey young et al however also noted that both marine and subaerial processes accelerate the cliff retreat rate as the waves remove cliff materials e g debris and talus from the cliff base which in turn favors subsequent landslides thus the governing roles of the marine and subaerial processes for the cliff morphodynamics are yet to be completely understood moreover detailed investigations on the relationship between the long term shoreline and cliff evolution are necessary because narrowing beaches lose effectiveness in protecting sea cliffs from wave attacks resulting in an acceleration of cliff erosion furthermore under the circumstances of decreasing sediment supply from rivers and cliffs due to human activities as for the case of santa barbara littoral cell it is necessary to have a better understanding and modeling capabilities of beach and cliff morphodynamic interactions this study investigates the complex interconnections among the cliff morphology beach morphology and coastal hydrodynamics for the santa barbara littoral cell using a digital elevation model dem with a goal to assess the long term shoreline evolutions and buffer zone changes of the beach cliff systems in the study sites in this article buffer zone of a beach cliff system or shortly buffer zone refers to the cross shore distance between the shoreline and cliff top of a beach cliff system 2 study sites the study sites are located to the north of the channel islands as shown in fig 1 eight sites fig 1 and table 1 which have sea cliffs with narrow beaches were selected in these sites the shorelines are nearly straight and cliff armouring and beach nourishment have been implemented minimally csmw 2010 although wood fences were partially used as cliff armours in the isla vista site we selected this site because cliff erosion in the isla vista site has been the most severe among the selected eight study sites moreover shoreline and beach profile evolutions in isla vista have been investigated in a number of studies e g barnard et al 2012 barnard et al 2009 revell and griggs 2006 resulting in a wealth of information for this site in the summerland 1 site sheet pilings were installed as cliff armours for approximately 0 1 km along the shore which corresponds to approximately 10 of the total shore length while young 2018 documented that cliff armouring substantially reduces the cliff erosion rate in southern california we expect limited effects of the armours in the summerland 1 site for our analyses as they provide protection for only a small portion of the site according to minor et al 2009 sea cliffs mainly consists of lithified miocene mudstone sandstone shale and diatomite in the lower units in the gato canyon 1 gato canyon 2 arroyo burro beach shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 sites the upper units comprise of unlithified marine terrace deposits and soils the upper units are typically weaker than the lower units and less resistant to cliff erosion the monterey formation contains 34 1 of sand content the sisquoc formation contains 21 9 of sand content and the marine terrace deposits contain 62 0 of sand content runyan and griggs 2003 in the isla vista site where cliff erosion was most severe among our sites the cliffs consist of the sisquoc formation and the unlithified pleistocene terrace deposits the hardness of which are lower than those of the monterey formation gato canyon 1 arroyo burro beach shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 sites the mean cliff retreat rate was 0 2 m yr in isla vista between 1965 and 1994 csb 2004 furthermore the mean beach width in this site was 25 m in 1938 and 12 m in 2003 revell and griggs 2006 seasonal shoreline evolutions typically lead to narrower beaches during the winter and spring seasons and wider beaches during the summer and fall seasons climate events with larger timescales such as el niño have major impacts on beach processes and shoreline evolution severe el niño storms in 1982 83 and 1997 98 caused distinct beach width changes in the vicinity of isla vista and the beach widths have not fully recovered since then barnard et al 2009 on the other hand large volumes of fluvial sediment were available in the southern california coast during the wet period between 1969 and 1998 inman and jenkins 1999 schwartz 2005 moreover sea level rise causes landward migration of the shoreline vitousek et al 2017 the mean grain size at different locations in the nearshore of the santa barbara littoral cell ranges from 0 15 to 0 43 mm fine to medium sand and the average of the mean grain sizes is 0 27 mm mustain et al 2007 the mean offshore significant wave height h s was 1 1 m and the mean dominant wave period t p was 10 6 s from july 2002 to may 2011 at the goleta point barnard et al 2012 which is the nearest wave buoy from the study sites and at the water depth h of 182 57 m see fig 1 during this time period the dominant wave direction θ was 257 6 since the channel islands prevent waves from propagating northward see fig 1 high amplitude waves approach mainly from west to east leading to unidirectional eastward littoral drift in the santa barbara harbour fig 1 the semi diurnal tide is predominant and the mean diurnal tide range is 1 65 m micro tidal coast noaa 2016a the near surface currents around our study sites predominantly flow northwestward along the coastlines of the santa barbara channel harms and winant 1998 however the tidal currents are considerably weak 0 05 m s münchow 1998 and are not taken into account in this study moreover the effects of sea level rise 1 1 1 3 mm yr from 1973 to 2015 in the santa barbara harbour according to noaa 2016a were also not taken into account in this study the study region has a semi arid climate that is classified as csb in the köppen geiger climate classification ryan 1994 the mean annual precipitation in the study region is approximately 450 mm ryan 1994 which is less than half of the global mean annual precipitation amount 1033 mm from 1961 to 1990 according to noaa 2016b over 90 of the rainfall amount occurs between the months of november and april 3 data and analysis methodology 3 1 topographic data to evaluate sea cliff and beach profiles a digital elevation model dem was used the dem data for the study sites is available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2013 the dem was created by integrating multiple observation systems such as topographic and bathymetric lidar and multi beam sonar most of the topographic data was collected in september 2010 the dem cell size is 1 m 1 m although the accuracy of the dem data varies horizontal accuracy is estimated to be less than 1 5 m noaa 2013 vertical accuracy of topographic lidar is estimated to be 0 15 m rmse root mean square error with 95 confidence level on flat terrain and 0 30 m rmse in hilly terrain noaa 2012 vertical accuracy of the bathymetric data is 0 30 m rmse our topographic analysis was carried out using arcgis map 10 2 esri 2016 historical shoreline in 1869 71 march june 1933 february 1976 and april 1998 and cliff edge in 1933 and 1998 data was documented by the united states geological survey usgs hapke et al 2006 hapke and reid 2007 the shorelines and cliff edges in 1869 71 1933 and 1976 were adjusted by hapke et al 2006 and hapke and reid 2007 using noaa topographic sheets t sheets and aerial photos so that data obtained at different times can be compared the maximum estimated horizontal measurement error for this data was within a range of 10 1 m and 13 9 m hapke et al 2006 hapke and reid 2007 the shoreline and cliff edge data for april 1998 was determined by hapke et al 2006 and for september 2010 was determined by our study from the available topographic lidar data which has a horizontal accuracy of 1 5 m in all of the shoreline determinations a mean high water level mhw of 1 33 m above navd88 was used to correct for water level fluctuations due to hydrodynamic conditions at the time of measurements shoreline movements due to sea level rise have a limited impact on our analysis as the expected increases in the mhw value for the timeframes 1869 1998 and 1998 2010 with different measurement methodologies are within the error ranges of these measurement methodologies therefore we neglected sea level rise effects in our analyses shoreline and cliff movements were evaluated by using cross shore transects that are 10 m apart in the alongshore direction in addition for each study site ten cross shore profiles were extracted from the dem data to calculate the characteristics of the sea cliff and beach profiles the alongshore distance between the cross shore profiles for calculating the sea cliff and beach profile characteristics was equal for a given site but ranged from 30 m to 140 m for different sites the definitions of cliff and beach profile characteristics are illustrated in fig 2 the cliff toe beach cliff junction and top are defined for our analysis as follows 1 cliff toe z i z i 1 x i x i 1 0 2 and z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 0 2 2 cliff top z i z i 1 x i x i 1 0 2 and z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 0 2 here the x axis origin was set at the shoreline mhw 1 33 m the offshore direction being positive x i and z i denote the cross shore distance from the shoreline and vertical elevation navd88 at the ith location respectively the index i increases in the offshore direction we used a low threshold value of 0 2 in eqs 1 and 2 to reduce the potential overestimations of beach height h be due to talus and depositions of rock debris near cliff toes when the criteria set in eqs 1 and 2 yielded multiple locations the positions of the cliff toe and cliff top were determined based upon visual judgments the percentage of visual judgements for the position determinations was approximately 34 visual judgments using beach and cliff profiles and aerial photos in such situations are still subject to errors due to the presence of features such as debris talus and undercut cliff and beach widths and heights were calculated using the cliff toe and top locations cliff and beach slopes were computed using linear regressions note that all of the values for the beach and cliff characteristics at a given site given in the figures and tables of this article are mean values that are calculated as specified in the relevant parts of section 4 3 2 hydrodynamic data in our analyses both offshore and nearshore wave conditions for the study sites were considered offshore wave conditions were utilized to classify the beach types and then select a suitable parameterization of wave run up height for our study sites see eqs 4 and 5 later in this section for offshore wave conditions we used the wave buoy measurements at the goleta point noaa 2016c which is the closest wave buoy to our study sites fig 1 in table 2 mean values of the offshore significant wave height h s dominant wave period t p and dominant wave direction θ for the wave records from 2005 until 2015 are provided nearshore wave conditions and water level data were utilized to estimate wave run up heights for our study sites for nearshore hydrodynamic conditions we used the simulation results of barnard et al 2014 for the severe el niño storm that occurred on january 18 25 2010 in their study barnard et al simulated maximum nearshore wave height and water level during this severe event using offshore wave conditions and considering the local bathymetry the maximum values of the nearshore wave height h s n and water level η max for each of our study sites are given in table 3 the mean offshore significant wave height during this event was within the top 0 5 of the daily significant wave heights reported for the observation period of 2005 2015 table 2 as a result this particular event caused one of the most severe coastal erosion occurrences in the southern california over the last several decades barnard et al 2011 therefore we considered these simulated hydrodynamic conditions as representative conditions for events that are associated with significant erosive activities and morphologic changes 3 3 analysis methodology according to ruggiero et al 2001 cliff erosion occurs when the effective wave run up height exceeds the beach cliff junction height the effective wave run up height r u max is defined by 3 r u max r u max η max here r u max is the maximum run up height and η max is the maximum water level rise above the mean high water level mhw due to factors such as wave set up surge effects and astronomical tidal level to estimate wave run up heights there are a number of parameterizations the selection of a suitable parameterization depends on the beach type as characterized by the surf similarity parameter ξ 0 which is defined in eq 4 4 ξ 0 tan γ 2 π h s g t 2 1 2 where tanγ is the nearshore beach slope h s is the offshore significant wave height g is the gravitational acceleration and t is the mean wave period guza and thornton 1982 suggested that significant wave run up height r s depends only on the nearshore significant wave height at 10 m water depth for the dissipative beaches of the southern california and provided the parameterization given in eq 5 5 r s 0 71 h s n 0 035 where h s n is the nearshore significant wave height we assumed that the run up height predictions by eq 5 for the el niño storm on january 18 25 2010 can be considered as the maximum run up heights r u max for our analyses in using eq 5 we utilized the maximum nearshore significant wave height values for this el niño storm that are provided by barnard et al 2014 wave induced cliff top erosion rate can be estimated using eq 6 which depends on the ratio of the wave forces per unit area p w and the compressive strength s c sunamura 2015 6 r t k p w s c ε here k is an empirical coefficient with the dimensions of length time and ε is a dimensionless threshold value the cliff erosion occurs when p w s c ε and henceforth ce p w s c is referred to as the cliff erosivity parameter note that ce can be considered to provide an indication of the relative importance of the erosive wave forces and resistive compressive forces in eq 6 in calculating the ce values means of the compressive strength value ranges s c for rock material classifications for each site as tabulated in table 1 are used to estimate the magnitude of the wave forces per unit area p w for broken waves rushing to a cliff face sunamura 2015 assumed a parameterization form similar to the one for the breaking waves against the cliff face this parameterization with the assumed form was adjusted to account for the difference in the physics of the two flow problems i e breaking waves against the cliff face and broken waves rushing to the cliff face by implementing a dimensionless empirical coefficient and height of the waves just in front of the cliff the values for both the dimensionless empirical coefficient and height of the waves in front of the cliffs for our study sites are unknown for our analyses therefore considering the physics of the impact and shear driven cliff erosion processes the magnitudes of the wave forces per unit area p w were assumed to be proportional to the dynamic pressure which can be approximated with the simplified expression provided in eq 7 for a first order analysis 7 p w 1 2 ρ s a l t u t o e 2 here ρ salt is the density of saltwater 1030 kg m3 in our calculations and u t o e is the flow speed at the cliff toe the flow velocity at a specific elevation u is estimated using a simple potential to kinetic energy conversion consideration without frictional losses for the vertical elevation difference from the run up height r u max to the elevation of interest z a e g van der meer 2011 as follows 8 u 2 g r u max z a here r u max and z a are elevations with respect to the mean water level mwl depending on the conditions the water level may or may not be higher than the cliff toe for example during the severe el niño storm on january 18 25 2010 the cliff toes were below the maximum water level η max h b e in four of our study sites gato canyon 1 isla vista shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 nevertheless in our study we approximated the flow speed at the cliff toe based upon the relationship between the effective run up height r u max and cliff toe height as parameterized in eq 9 9 u t o e 2 g r u max h b e while our ce estimates using the outlined procedure are not accurate as the estimated p w and s c values have a wide range and large uncertainties they still provide valuable information in analysing the erosion behaviour among the sites the mean long term buffer zone change rate for a given site d w d t w is defined as 10 d w d t d x s d t r t where dx s dt is the long term shoreline change rate 1869 2010 and r t is the long term cliff top erosion rate 1933 1998 using conservation of mass eq 10 can be modified as 11 d w d t 1 d s d q l d y q 0 r t here d is the depth of closure and y is the alongshore coordinate given its simplicity we estimated the depth of closure using the offshore wavelength d l 0 4 as proposed by komar 1976 from linear wave theory l 0 was calculated as 162 4 m for the 11 years averaged wave period of t 10 2 s this led to the depth of closure value as 40 61 m to be used in our calculations in eq 11 s is the sediment volume supplied from sea cliffs per unit alongshore distance per unit time as defined in eq 12 later dq l dy is the sediment transport rate change in the alongshore direction and q 0 is the cross shore sediment transport rate per unit alongshore distance for the sediment volume supplied by the cliffs we used eq 12 which does not consider bedrock lower unit and marine terrace deposits upper unit separately and also it does not take into account the percentages of the sand content as this information was not available to us for all of our study sites 12 s r t h cl where h cl is the cliff height as defined in fig 2 in our analysis we neglected the sediment transport rate change in the alongshore direction i e the second term on the right side of eq 11 by assuming that each selected beach is straight and the incident wave angles are not expected to change significantly along the beach in addition we assumed that cross shore sediment transport rate i e the third term on the right side of eq 11 can be represented in terms of the mobility parameter at the cliff toe ψ t o e u t o e 2 s 1 g d 50 here s is the specific gravity of the sediments and d 50 is the median grain diameter in our analysis the value of s is assumed to be 2 65 as for quartz sand and the value of d 50 in the study areas is assumed to be 0 27 mm based upon the average of mean grain size values reported by mustain et al 2007 moreover in our analysis the sediment loss under waves was assumed to be proportional to 3 2 power of the mobility parameter e g dyer 1986 consequently eq 11 can be expressed as 13 d w d t 1 d s ψ t o e 1 5 q r t where q is an unknown constant sediment transport rate per unit alongshore distance in the study sites eqs 9 and 13 yields 14 d w d t 1 d s 2 g r u max h b e s 1 g d 50 1 5 q r t 4 results and discussions 4 1 characteristics of cliff and beach profiles mean characteristics of cliff and beach profiles were calculated by averaging the relevant characteristics from the ten linear cross shore transects for each of the study sites table 4 the minimum mean cliff height 10 2 0 8 m was in the isla vista site and the maximum mean cliff height 44 5 2 3m was in the arroyo burro beach site see the mean cliff height h cl values provided in table 4 in the study sites mean cliff slopes tanα were relatively steep with values ranging from 0 95 to 1 68 43 5 mean cliff slope angle α 59 2 mean beach widths w be were relatively narrow in the isla vista shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 sites w be 10 0 m while beaches in the gato canyon 2 and summerland 1 sites were relatively wide w be 20 0 m as shown in fig 3 beach width has a strong positive relationship with beach height in the study sites with r squared r 2 0 90 and p value p 0 01 note that the significance level of p value is 0 05 in this study this strong relationship between the beach width and height may be explained by the fact that hydrodynamics in the nearshore zone does not differ substantially among the sites which results in small variations of the beach slopes in the study sites 0 06 tanβ 0 11 examining the relationships between the characteristics of cliff and beach profiles we found that the cliff slope has strong negative relationships with the beach width r squared r 2 0 83 p value p 0 01 and height r squared r 2 0 89 p value p 0 01 as shown in fig 4 this relationship would be explained through the governance of the cliff slopes by the magnitudes of the marine forces e g due to waves and tides at the cliff toe the study sites have highly dissipative beaches with ξ 0 values between 0 21 and 0 52 as tabulated in table 3 and the effective wave run up height r u max was calculated using eqs 3 and 5 the inundation number in r u max h b e provides a simple mean to estimate the relative importance of wave forces on the evolution of cliff morphology among the study sites the variation of the inundation number in value is mainly governed by the variation of the beach cliff junction height due to similar nearshore hydrodynamic conditions the dependency of the cliff slope on the inundation number for our study sites is shown in fig 5 as can be seen in this figure cliff slope has a clear positive correlation with the inundation number r 2 0 74 p 0 01 since the beach height was observed to have strong positive correlation with the beach width in the study sites in values for the sites with narrow beaches w be 10 0 m isla vista shoreline park 1 and shoreline park 2 sites are large in 3 1 and the cliff slopes in these sites are steep tanα 1 5 for the sites with wide beaches w be 20 0 m gato canyon 2 and summerland 1 sites the inundation numbers were small in 1 8 and the cliff slopes were gentle tanα 1 0 these observations demonstrate that wave forces acting on the cliffs and their erosive effects on the cliffs are larger for the sites with narrow beaches than the sites with wide beaches the physical explanation of this finding is the easier reach of the waves to the base of sea cliffs in the narrow beaches therefore one can conclude that when all other governing factors e g precipitation are the same the waves would more effectively undercut the cliffs and the cliff slopes become steeper as the beach width decreases 4 2 cliff top erosion rate the mean cliff top erosion rates r t for the study sites for the time period between 1933 and 1998 are calculated by averaging the cliff top erosion rate values at every 10 m as available along the site and are provided in table 5 r t is highest in the isla vista site 0 23 0 11 m yr and lowest in the summerland 2 site 0 06 0 03 m yr the mean cliff top erosion rate as a function of the inundation number for the study sites is shown in fig 6 a this figure indicates a poor correlation between r t and in r 2 0 11 p 0 42 in addition one would expect a negative correlation between the cliff erosion rate and cliff height as it would take more time for the waves to remove the larger quantities of materials e g debris and talus supplied by the erosion of higher cliffs the observational data from our study sites does not indicate such a relationship see fig 6b with r 2 0 01 p 0 79 sunamura 1992 suggested that the rate of cliff erosion mainly depends on the rock hardness e g unconfined compressive strength s c and rock structure the cliff top erosion rates at our study sites as a function of s c values are presented in fig 7 in the absence of available measurements we estimated the s c values based on the rock hardness category by minor et al 2009 and the national engineering handbook natural resources conservation service 2012 note that we could not estimate the s c values for the summerland 1 and summerland 2 sites because the rock hardness categories for these sites are unknown to us fig 7 indicates a clear correlation between the r t and estimated s c values r 2 0 63 p 0 06 and the controlling role of s c in cliff erosion rates for the study sites note that we may have significantly overestimated the s c values as we did not take into account the reduction of the rock strength due to factors such joints and faults nevertheless the data in fig 7 spreads such that even though there may be significant uncertainties in the s c values for a quantitative analysis our qualitative conclusion of the correlation between the r t and s c values would not be altered therefore our results provide further support for the benumof et al s 2000 finding that material properties are the primary factor for long term cliff erosion rate in southern california indeed fig 8 shows that r t and ce are correlated r 2 0 75 p 0 03 therefore the long term cliff top erosion rate for our study sites where the rock hardness on the lower cliff units is categorized from soft to very hard see table 1 can be explained by the cliff erosivity parameter moreover the continued progression of cliff erosion necessitates the removal of debris and talus from the cliff base by marine processes and to a lesser extent by subaerial processes as such this observed correlation between r t and ce can be considered as a support for the adoption of wave induced cliff erosion models to estimate the long term erosion of rocky cliffs in southern california 4 3 shoreline evolution and buffer zone change the shoreline evolutions for the study sites from 1869 to 2010 are shown in fig 9 the mean shoreline change value for each site was calculated by averaging the shoreline change at every 10 m as available along the site although the shoreline data may have large errors rmse 10 0 m before 1998 and include seasonal variations this figure indicates a clear retreat trend more than 30 m of shoreline retreat for the isla vista site from 1869 until 2010 and accretion trends more than 20 m of shoreline accretion for the summerland 1 and summerland 2 sites since 1976 long term 1869 2010 and mid term 1976 2010 shoreline changes were considered using linear regressions table 5 despite the fact that sediment supply from the fluvial and coastal environment has decreased approximately 40 in the santa barbara littoral cell due to man made activities patsch and griggs 2007 there are no evident long term shoreline erosion or accretion trends except for the isla vista site which experienced a 0 26 m yr shoreline retreat r 2 0 93 p 0 01 regarding the mid term 1976 2010 shoreline changes rapid beach recoveries 0 5 m yr shoreline accretion see table 5 occurred in the summerland 1 and summerland 2 sites and no significant shoreline change trend was observed for the rest of the sites historical shoreline data from 1933 1976 and 1998 were collected in the spring and the data from 2010 were collected in the fall the exact observation dates for the data collected during 1869 1871 were not available to us while the collected historical shoreline data includes seasonal effects these short term i e seasonal to multiannual effects were suppressed notably by the long timescale i e from 1869 until 2010 used in our linear regression analysis in particular our analysis showed that the shoreline change rate estimated using the data for the time period of 1869 2010 is identical to the shoreline change rate estimated using the data for the time period of 1869 1998 indicating the suppression of the seasonal effects fig 10 shows the observed mean long term buffer zone change calculated using eq 10 and the measured values of dx s dt and r t as a function of the beach width for our study sites as can be seen in this figure the buffer zones widened on most of the beaches in particular the buffer zone changes on wider beaches are larger since long term rates of shoreline change and cliff erosion see eq 10 are responsible for the buffer zone change the observed behaviour of buffer zone change in this figure indicates that the volumes of sediment supplied from sea cliffs cover more of and sometimes exceed the sediment volume washed out by waves as the beach width increases while we do not have the means to quantitatively evaluate for our study sites wider beaches are expected to dissipate more of the wave energy as compared to the narrower ones consequently one would expect that our study sites with wider beaches provide a less favourable environment for the wash out of sediment eroded from cliffs and shoreline recession moreover while beaches may provide protection of cliffs against wave driven erosion a correlation between the beach width and cliff erosion rates was not apparent for our study sites indeed for southern and central california that covers our study region young 2018 reported that cliffs fronted by beaches retreated more than cliffs without beaches our calculations using eq 12 indicate that sea cliffs supplied roughly between 1 09 and 7 12 m3 m yr of sediments among the study sites see table 5 in the arroyo burro beach site the cliff supplied a significantly larger volume of sediment than the other sites table 5 although most of the supplied sediments are washed away by offshore and long shore sediment transport a portion of the supplied sediment volume may remain on the beaches and in the nearshore zones to determine the main underlying factor s responsible for the observed buffer zone change variations among the study sites multiple regression analyses were conducted using eq 14 in these analyses we considered the value of q as unity note that conducting a sensitivity analysis we showed that assumed q value has no significant effect on our results the shapiro wilk test showed that residuals of the multiple regression analyses were normally distributed with p 0 51 for the 8 study sites since the normal distribution was confirmed by the shapiro wilk test the anova test with a stepwise regression was conducted and two of the resulting models are tabulated in table 6 the anova test indicated that while the cliff erosion rate has a small impact on the buffer zone change variation p 0 37 see model 1 in table 6 the term with the mobility parameter at the cliff toe in eq 14 has the most significant impact p 0 05 see models 1 and 2 in table 6 therefore the buffer zone change variations in the study sites may be attributed mainly to the washout effects related to the wave activities and the marine processes in general the regression analyses also indicated that the sediment supply term in eq 14 is also significant in model 2 p 0 04 the mobility parameter and sediment supply terms in model 2 see table 6 can explain w with the largest adjusted r square r 2 adj value of 0 75 nevertheless runyan and griggs 2003 argue that the bedrock materials of cliffs do not have significant impacts on the sediment budget in the santa barbara littoral cell because bedrock fragments would be broken down into finer sediments such as clay therefore although our analyses indicate its statistical significance the sediment volume supply from the cliffs s may not be a major contributor to the buffer zone change variations here we would like to note that the shoreline data has large measurement errors rmse 10 0 m before 1998 which has significant effects on the calculated buffer zone change values 0 03 m yr w 0 25 m yr for the study sites 4 4 limitations of the analysis various factors such as the complex nature of the relevant processes and their interactions availability of the data and measurement uncertainties complicate the analyses of typical geophysical flows such as the one considered in this study moreover long standing challenges in the theoretical modeling of the erosion deposition and transport of sediment in the coastal zone set additional complications for our relevant analyses in this study therefore our analyses necessitated implementation of various assumptions which set limitations in the quantitative aspects of our results due to the lack of field measurements our analyses considered estimated values for the compressive strength s c of the cliff rock at the study sites these estimations were using minor et al 2009 and nrcs 2012 clearly one would expect large uncertainties in the estimated s c values nevertheless as can be seen in fig 7 the data points are clustered in two groups the first group has larger r t values approx 0 15 0 25 m yr with smaller estimated s c values approx 25 60 mpa and the second group has smaller r t values approx 0 10 0 15 m yr with significantly larger estimated s c values approx 125 mpa since there is a very large range of s c values and a large gap between the s c values of the two groups even if the s c values for this data might have been overestimated as pointed out earlier in this section the qualitative conclusion presented in the article i e material properties are the primary factor for long term cliff erosion rate in the southern california would still be valid for quantitative results on the dependency of long term cliff erosion rates on cliff material properties accurate field measurements of cliff rock compressive strength are necessary our analysis for the long term buffer zone change neglected spatial i e alongshore change of longshore sediment transport rate i e the second term on the right side of eq 11 neglecting this term implies an assumption of straight beach and incident wave angle that does not change along a given beach all of the beaches considered in our study are straight beaches and the incident wave angles are not expected to change significantly along these beaches moreover given the complexity of the cross shore sediment transport modeling for our analyses purposes we assumed that cross shore sediment transport rate i e the third term on the right side of eq 11 can be represented in terms of the mobility parameter previous studies have shown that cross shore sediment transport and relevant sedimentary features e g ripples can be modeled using mobility parameter e g dyer 1986 voropayev et al 2003 testik et al 2005 van rijn 2007 moreover mobility parameter is related to the shields parameter i e the ratio of the shear forces on the sediment particle to the submerged weight of the particle see dean and dalrymple 2004 which is used in a number of sediment transport rate models e g madsen and grant 1976 sleath 1984 therefore while there would be clear limitations in the relevant quantitative interpretations this assumed dependency of the cross shore sediment transport on the mobility parameter is reasonable for the qualitative discussions presented in this article detailed numerical studies with hydrodynamic and sediment transport models are needed for relevant quantitative conclusions 5 conclusions this study investigates the interactions among coastal cliffs beaches and hydrodynamics near santa barbara california characteristics of cliff and beach profiles were examined using a digital elevation model it is concluded that the cliff slope is negatively correlated with the beach width and height although the exact effective run up height r u max values were unknown it is shown that the inundation number in r u max h b e alone which represents the wave effects can explain the observed cliff slope behaviour our analysis indicated that the inundation number and cliff height are not primary factors for determining the long term cliff top erosion rates at the study sites while the estimated compressive strength s c values had large uncertainties a relatively strong relationship between the cliff top erosion rate and the compressive strength was observed r 2 0 63 p 0 06 our findings are in agreement with the findings of benumof et al 1999 2000 which showed that the material properties are a primary factor for the long term erosion rates of cliff toes in southern california to elucidate the governing physical mechanism for the cliff erosion at the study sites the correlation between the observed cliff top erosion rate r t and the cliff erosivity parameter i e ce p w s c which is associated with the wave induced cliff erosion rate as proposed by sunamura 2015 was examined showing a relatively strong correlation between r t and ce at the study sites r 2 0 75 p 0 03 our analysis indicated that long term cliff erosion in southern california may be estimated by using adequate wave induced cliff erosion models the shoreline evolution and buffer zone changes in the study sites showed a significant long term 1869 2010 retreat trend in the isla vista site 0 26 m yr nevertheless distinct shoreline erosion or accretion trends were not observed at the other sites despite the approximately 40 reduction of sediment supply from rivers and cliffs as reported by patsch and griggs 2007 the long term buffer zone change rates d w d t were also investigated using the long term shoreline change rates and long term 1933 1998 cliff top erosion rates the buffer zones widened at most of the study sites particularly a large buffer zone widening was observed in the summerland 1 site where the cliff slopes were gentle and the current beach width is the largest among the study sites multiple regression analyses indicated that the mobility parameter at the cliff toe which represents the washout effects and the sediment supply from the sea cliffs were the important factors for the buffer zone change variations among the study sites acknowledgements this research was supported by the funds provided by the college of engineering

23058,the coordinated control of multiple auvs systems is the key to guarantee the consensus of auv s motion status this paper proposes coordinated control protocols with or without time delay for the coordination control problem of multiple auvs under switching communication topologies based on discrete information firstly the state feedback linearization method is used to convert coupled nonlinear auv kinematics and kinetic equations into second order affine forms and a mathematical model is given in discrete time because the leader auv is equipped with more accurate sensors the leader follower type of formation structure is adopted leader auv sends status information to followers and the follower auvs communicate with themselves randomly secondly the coordination control protocols are designed for the cases of no time delay and time delay and sufficient conditions for the consensus algorithm are analyzed and given based on the matrix theory finally the correctness of the proposed coordinated control protocols is proved by simulation experiments and the trajectories of multiple auvs converge to the desired trajectory keywords autonomous underwater vehicles discrete time coordinated control switching topologies communication delay 1 introduction auv has been widely used in the military and commercial fields as its advantages of small size high autonomy and flexible deployment which is an important tool for submarine escort target detection deep sea resource development and other applications sariel et al 2008 manzanilla et al 2018 jain et al 2018 the auv can sense the location and the external environment by using installed sensors to complete the specified task however due to the limited detection range of the single auv sensor it cannot complete the task well in the complex applications such as large area ocean exploration deep sea target search and ocean mapping to compensate for the physical limitations of a single auv multi auv formations could accomplish complex tasks together fiorelli et al 2004 zhu et al 2013 multiple auvs transmit information through the sonar to ensure that the auvs can coordinate and maintain a consistent state however the information of sonar affected by the actual sea conditions may be delayed or interrupted the status information of multi auvs cannot be received in time so coordination of the system should be guaranteed in the case of communication delay in recent years the motion control of a single auv has made remarkable progress some tasks of tracking or searching can be accomplished by such control methods as robust control backstepping control sliding mode control and adaptive control in complex sea environment guo et al 2003 li and pan 2005 lapierre and soetanto 2007 ghommam and saad 2014 joe et al 2014 li et al 2014 however the above methods cannot deal well with the coordination of multiple auv systems the earliest consensus algorithm was applied to a single integration multi agent systems under the condition of random communication structure and communication noise hatano and mesbahi 2005 porfiri and stilwell 2007 huang 2010 which is the foundation of the proposed control algorithm under communication delay and packet loss of multi agent for the second order system peng et al 2015 feng et al 2016 hu et al 2016 xu and li 2013 inspired by multiple uavs some consensus algorithm has been used in auvs system das et al 2014 shojaei 2016a b tang et al 2017 fabiani et al 2018 such as neural network control shojaei 2016a b neuro fuzzy control pandian and sakagami 2011 because the communication between multiple agents will be disturbed by the environment and the input will be affected therefore the problem of time delay during the process of exchange of information needs to be solved the communication information of multiple auvs in the deep water is discrete data spread by sonar however most studies of the multi auv consistency controls are based on continuous time cui et al 2010 hu et al 2015 chen and ho 2016 in our past papers we have been working on the problem of path following formation control and coordinated target tracking of multiple uuvs bian et al 2012 yan et al 2016 2017 2018a b but the system model of the uuv and the control methods are based on continuous time the actual engineering problems can t be directly solved by the traditional formation control algorithm therefore the studies of consensus algorithm under discrete time conditions have practical significance it is important to obtain the position and velocity measured by sensors loaded in each auv for cooperative formation the leader follower auv cooperative navigation type is used in this paper which is unlike the parallel cooperative navigation system that the position information of the leader auv is sent to the follow auvs in the leader follow cooperative navigation system the amount of communication information is reduced without bi directional communication and the cost and weight of the follower auvs equipped with low precision navigation equipment can be cut down to the minimum the velocity of each auv is obtained by specific sensors such like fibre optic gyroscopes and tri axis accelerometers the position and velocity of each auv are obtained by using the coordinated control protocol based on the mathematical model of discrete time and the information is transmitted to other auvs by sonar then the position and speed are brought into the coordinate control of each auv and the force and torque of each actuator can be obtained and input to the corresponding driving devices however due to the complex and varied underwater environment and the influence of communication distance the communication between multiple auvs through sonar transmission will be affected by the communication delay which should be considered in this paper a multiple auvs coordinate control protocol under switching communication topology and time delay in discrete time conditions is designed according to the characteristics of underwater communication first the nonlinear model of auv is simplified to a second order affine system by state feedback linearization and then the topology is specified since the leader auv has a higher precision sensor we let all the followers receive the information of the leader auv so the followers can use more accurate information from the leader auv and take the form of random communication to simulate underwater communications which may be interrupted in order to reduce the amount of communication information the position information and speed information are independently spread second as the transmission information between auvs is discrete sampling information the auv continuous model is expressed as a discrete model using a direct discretization method furthermore the multiple auvs coordinate control protocols under switching communication topology and time delay in discrete time conditions are proposed and sufficient conditions for the consensus algorithms are analyzed and given in the case of no time delay and time delay finally simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the control law in the two cases 2 background and model description 2 1 notations the variables related to the theoretical and mathematical representation of the paper are defined in table 1 2 2 graph theory notions the communication topologies between auvs are described using topology graph it is an important method to analyze the relation of multiagent systems suppose a system

a graph where every node has exactly one parent except for the root which has no parent and has a directed path to every other node a directed spanning tree of a graph is a directed tree formed by graph edges that connect all the nodes of the graph a graph has a directed spanning tree if there exists at least one node having a directed path to all the other nodes l has exactly one zero eigenvalue and only if the directed graph associated with g has a spanning tree all of the nonzero eigenvalues are in the open left half plane ren and beard 2005 the communication topology in this paper consists of two parts one is the position topology and the other is velocity topology g p and g v represent the position and velocity interaction topologies respectively similarly l p and l v represent the laplacian matrix of g p and g v respectively n i p and n i v respectively represent the neighbor set of the i th auv in the position and velocity topologies 2 3 the model of auv and feedback linearization the dynamic model of auv can typically be described by a 6 dof model according to the body fixed and earth fixed coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 as rolling has little influence on translational motion the roll speed is ignored in this paper fossen 2011 thus the nonlinear and coupled kinematics and kinetics equation are presented as follows kinematics equation 2 η j η v where η x 0 y 0 z 0 θ φ t ℜ 5 represents the states of position and euler angles j η is the jacobian matrix from body fixed frame to earth fixed frame kinetics equation 3 m v c v v d v v g η τ where v u 0 v 0 w 0 q r t ℜ 5 represents the states of velocities matrix m c v and d v denote inertia matrix coriolis and centripetal matrix and damping matrix respectively g η is a vector of generalized gravitational and buoyancy forces and moments τ is the control input in this paper the type of auv is common torpedo like which is symmetrical in plane and vertical that means the matrix m is symmetric and c v is skew symmetric meanwhile the center gravity and buoyancy of auv is coincident so g η is zero the details of the parameters are presented in fossen 1994 2011 the mathematical model of auv now can be represented as 4 η v i 0 0 m 1 j η v w v v 0 m 1 γ ξ u τ then the nonlinear model of auv can be described to an affine system as 5 ξ p ξ q ξ u τ μ r ξ where ξ η τ v τ τ p ξ i 0

according to the equation 5 the specific numerical q i j ξ can be computed so γ ξ is nonsingular matrix and the relative degree of the system is followed as 7 ρ 1 2 ρ 2 2 ρ 3 2 ρ 4 2 ρ 5 2 so ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 3 ρ 4 ρ 5 10 which is same as the dimension of the system according to lemma 1 the nonlinear model of auv can be linear by feedback linearization method and the transformation of the new coordinates is 8 x r 1 ξ r 2 ξ r 3 ξ r 4 ξ r 5 ξ v l p r 1 ξ l p r 2 ξ l p r 3 ξ l p r 4 ξ l p r 5 ξ the control input in the new linearization system can be defined as 9 u τ ξ γ ξ u τ where τ ξ l p 2 r 1 ξ l p 2

coordination control system from the analysis of the formation coordination control system as shown in fig 2 the coordination controller in the coordinated control system is responsible for the control on the coordination layer and gives the formation coordination control u u 1 t u 2 t u n t t u 1 t u 2 t u n t as the control input of each auv in the formation respectively as can be seen from the above the linearized model of auv is based on the system state after the coordinate transformation which changes the physical meanings of the system state and the system input so the input of the coordination controller cannot directly act on the original system model it is necessary to carry out inverse coordinate transformation and use the control input u i τ i 1 2 n that can be used by the original system to meet the formation coordination control all auvs output state ξ i i 1 2 n in the formation is linearized by feedback linearization to obtain state information x i v i i 1 2 n as a control input for formation coordination control in the new coordinate therefore the formation coordination control system of the multiple auvs based on the feedback linearization model can be realized 3 2 consensus algorithm without communication delay in this paper we consider discrete time dynamic model of the auv for the data of measurements and communication in the water is discrete

according to 19 we know h q p so 20 h k 1 q p k 1 j 1 2 k 1 h ˆ j where h ˆ j is the product of k 1 matrix by choosing q or p according to the properties of infinite norm the infinite norm of h ˆ j can be represented as 21 h ˆ j q k 0 q k m 1 m p p n where m n k 1 according to the definition of q k i q k i is a row stochastic matrix so the equation can be simplified as 22 h ˆ j p p n p 0 as n because the condition 3 p 1 so h ˆ j 0 as n the matrix q and p are non negative matrix and 0 therefore h ˆ j 0 as k n when k approaches infinite and n is finite h ˆ j exists a set of product of

2 h k 2 h k 2 h k 2 note that the directed graph of q k i is same as that of q k i it then follows from lemma 4 that q k i has a directed spanning tree therefore the directed graph of q k i also has a directed spanning tree it then follows from lemma 3 that q k i is sia according to the properties of sia there exists a vector y ℜ 2 n follows that 24 q k i l 1 2 n y τ l i 1 2 n define the matrix q as 25 q i q k i q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 where the all rows of q i i 1 2 3 4 are same then h ˆ j can be written as 26 h ˆ j u q o where both u and o are the products of a finite number of matrices by choosing either q k i or p we use the fact that l q i 0 and d p d v i and according to the definition of q k i and p we can have four product of the matrices 27 q k i q 1 t α p τ 2 2 q 1 t α v τ 2 2 q 3 1 t α

submatrices are same the same property also holds for 26 which contains a finite number of p therefore h ˆ j can be separated into four submatrices that all rows of every one of the four submatrices are the same combining the previous equations shows that as k all rows of h k i i 1 2 3 4 are the same lemma 6 assuming parameters α p α v and period t are exist that the matrix h ˆ k 1 h ˆ k 2 h ˆ k

34 x ˆ 1 k 1 x ˆ 2 k 1 x ˆ n k 1 v ˆ 1 k 1 v ˆ 2 k 1 v ˆ n k 1 so as k we have 35 x 1 k x 2 k x n k v 1 k v 2 k v n k for the definition 2 the multi auvs system can be consensus theorem 1 assume that the directed graph of the multi auvs system has a directed spanning tree if the parameters α p α v and period t satisfy the conditions as following the consensus of the multi auvs system can be obtained 1 α 1 1 d p max 1 α 2 1 d v max 1 2 t 1 2 proof when the multi auvs system are consensus all rows of the submatrices of system matrix n ˆ k n ˆ k 1 n ˆ k 2 n ˆ k 3 n ˆ k 4 should be the same as k according to lemma 6 the same conditions above is equal to that all rows of the submatrices of matrix h ˆ k 1 h ˆ k 2 h ˆ k 3 h ˆ k 4 are the same if condition 1 is satisfied the condition 1 2 in lemma 5 can be satisfied if condition 2 is satisfied the condition 3 in lemma 5 can be satisfied therefore all rows of the matrices h ˆ k 1 h ˆ k 2 h ˆ k 3 h ˆ k 4 are the same the consensus ability of multiple auvs system is guaranteed 3 3 consensus algorithm with communication time varying delay as the extreme underwater communication environment of auvs may cause delays during the information transmission it is necessary to consider the consensus of multiple auv systems in the case of communication delays the communication delay between auvs is defined as τ i j k when receiving messages we assume that the communication is bounded where t τ i j k τ 0 τ 0 is a positive constant in the presence of bounded communication delay the discrete dynamic equation is expressed in the following form 36 x i k 1 x i k t v i k t τ i j k 2 2 u i k v i k 1 v i k t τ i j k u i k to consensus the multi auvs system at t k t k 1 t by using the control law as follow 37 u i k β 1 j n i p σ i j k a i j k x i

as 38 l i j k 2 t τ i j k l i j k i j l i j k j 1 j i n l i j k i j combining equations 36 38 the discrete time dynamic equation of the multiple auvs system in the case of communication delays can be represented as 39 x τ k 1 v τ k 1 i n i 5 l p d p α 1 i 5 t i n i 5 l v d v α 2 i 5 l p d p α 1 i 5 i n l v d v α 2 i 5 x τ k v τ k combining 38 we know that laplacian matrix l is time varying matrix but the structure of l is same as l therefore the topology of l also has a spanning tree so equation 39 can be written as 40 x τ k 1 v τ k 1 i 5 n l p k α 1 t i 5 n l v k α 2 l p k α 1 l v k α 2 x τ k v τ k where l p k k 1 l p d p α 1 i 5 l v k k 2 l v d v α 2 i 5 theorem 2 assume that the directed graph of the multi auvs system has a directed spanning tree if the parameters α p α v and period t satisfy the conditions as following the consensus of the multi auvs system can be obtained 1 α 1 t τ 0 2 d p max 1 α 2 1 t τ 0 2 d v max 1 2 t 1 2 proof we use a similar proof method in theorem 1 define the system matrix m k at t k as 41 m k i 5 n l p k α 1 t i 5 n l v k α 2 l p k α 1 i n 5 l v k α 2 if the multiple auv system is consensus all rows of the matrices m ˆ k 1 m ˆ k 2 m ˆ k 3 m ˆ k 4 must be the same at k 42 m k m k 1 m 0 m ˆ k 1 m ˆ k 2 m ˆ k 3 m ˆ k 4 combining the lemma 6 it is the same condition if all rows of the matrices h k 1 m h k 2 m h k 3 m h k 4 m are the same 43 h m k h m k 1 h m 0 h ˆ k 1 m h ˆ k 2 m h ˆ k 3 m h ˆ k 4 m where h m k h k 1 m h k 2 m h k 3 m h k 4 m i n α 1 l p k t i n α 2 l v k α 1 l p k i n α 2 l v k the matrix h m k can be decomposed by two matrices r m k and s as 44 h m k r m k s where r m k i 5 n l p k α 1 t i n t i 5 n l v k α 2 t i n l p k α 1 i n l v k α 2 t i n h k 1 m t i n h k 2 m h k 3 m t i n h k 4 m t i n condition 2 of the theorem ensures that the infinite norm of s is less than 1 combining the definition of l k its largest in degree d max can satisfy d max τ 0 d max 1 2 therefore if the directed graph of the multi auvs system has a directed spanning tree and the condition 1 is satisfied every r m k is sia applied lemma 2 we can have a vector y that 45 r m k r m k 1 r m 0 1 y τ τ k combining lemma 5 the theorem is proved 4 simulation to testify the correctness of the coordinate control protocols in this paper two cases of simulation experiments will be given the formation of multiple auvs system has six vehicles which consist of one leader auv0 and five followers auv1 5 as the leader auv is equipped with high precision navigation devices the information of leader s position will be spread to all the followers that means the construction of topology from leader to followers is fixed fig 3 shows the more precise information from the leader auv is sent to the followers while the five followers auvs exchange their information randomly to illustrate the random information between the auvs the set of topologies covers ten forms as shown in fig 4 fig 5 is the number of the state topologies about position and velocity that chosen from the set randomly the first case is that the information exchange between multiple auvs has no time delay the initial value of position and attitude of the leader auv is x 0 50 0 0 π 20 π 2 and the initial value of velocity is v 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 the initial value of x i 0 is randomly distributed in the 0 70 y i 0 is randomly distributed in the 0 70 z i 0 is randomly distributed in the 20 10 θ 0 and ψ 0 of the followers auvs are in the interval 0 1 0 1 and 0 4 respectively the coordinate control parameters are chosen as α 1 0 002 α 2 0 8 the formation order is designed as a straight line so the coordinates of each following auvs should be add a relative distance item s i the position is written as x i x i s i s 1 10 0 0 0 0 s 2 10 0 0 0 0 s 3 20 0

0 02 π t z t 0 08 t fig 6 proposes the position and attitude states of multiple auvs the position states converge to the desired helical curve and the attitude states converge to a fixed value the velocity states of all auvs are shown in fig 7 in fig 8 the three dimensional trajectories of all auvs shows that the leader auv can converge to the desired path and the follower auvs can keep the formation order in one straight line the second case is that the information exchange between multiple auvs has the time delay the simulation curve and the initial value of multiple auvs are same as first case the coordinate control parameters are chosen the same value in the first simulation and let τ 0 0 1 s fig 9 is the switching topologies of position and velocity in this simulation the position and attitude states of multiple auvs can also converge but it takes more time to stabilization comparing with the first case in fig 10 the position states converge to the desired helical curve and the attitude states converge to a fixed value the velocity states shown in fig 11 converge to a fixed value at 500 s it is later than the first case obviously fig 12 shows that all auvs also can converge to the desired curve and stay in the formation order with random initial value in the time delay situation 5 conclusions the coordinate control methods of multi auv system with no time delay and time delay under the switching communication topology using discrete information are discussed in this paper since the information is sampled data the nonlinear model of auv is simplified as second order affine forms by state feedback linearization method then the mathematical model is given in discrete time the coordination control protocols are given in the two cases and sufficient conditions for the consensus algorithm are analyzed and given based on the matrix theory the position and velocity can be brought into the controller of each auv then the driving force and torque of each actuator can be obtained finally the correctness of the proposed coordinated control protocols is proved by simulation experiments and the trajectories of multiple auvs converge to the desired

23058,the coordinated control of multiple auvs systems is the key to guarantee the consensus of auv s motion status this paper proposes coordinated control protocols with or without time delay for the coordination control problem of multiple auvs under switching communication topologies based on discrete information firstly the state feedback linearization method is used to convert coupled nonlinear auv kinematics and kinetic equations into second order affine forms and a mathematical model is given in discrete time because the leader auv is equipped with more accurate sensors the leader follower type of formation structure is adopted leader auv sends status information to followers and the follower auvs communicate with themselves randomly secondly the coordination control protocols are designed for the cases of no time delay and time delay and sufficient conditions for the consensus algorithm are analyzed and given based on the matrix theory finally the correctness of the proposed coordinated control protocols is proved by simulation experiments and the trajectories of multiple auvs converge to the desired trajectory keywords autonomous underwater vehicles discrete time coordinated control switching topologies communication delay 1 introduction auv has been widely used in the military and commercial fields as its advantages of small size high autonomy and flexible deployment which is an important tool for submarine escort target detection deep sea resource development and other applications sariel et al 2008 manzanilla et al 2018 jain et al 2018 the auv can sense the location and the external environment by using installed sensors to complete the specified task however due to the limited detection range of the single auv sensor it cannot complete the task well in the complex applications such as large area ocean exploration deep sea target search and ocean mapping to compensate for the physical limitations of a single auv multi auv formations could accomplish complex tasks together fiorelli et al 2004 zhu et al 2013 multiple auvs transmit information through the sonar to ensure that the auvs can coordinate and maintain a consistent state however the information of sonar affected by the actual sea conditions may be delayed or interrupted the status information of multi auvs cannot be received in time so coordination of the system should be guaranteed in the case of communication delay in recent years the motion control of a single auv has made remarkable progress some tasks of tracking or searching can be accomplished by such control methods as robust control backstepping control sliding mode control and adaptive control in complex sea environment guo et al 2003 li and pan 2005 lapierre and soetanto 2007 ghommam and saad 2014 joe et al 2014 li et al 2014 however the above methods cannot deal well with the coordination of multiple auv systems the earliest consensus algorithm was applied to a single integration multi agent systems under the condition of random communication structure and communication noise hatano and mesbahi 2005 porfiri and stilwell 2007 huang 2010 which is the foundation of the proposed control algorithm under communication delay and packet loss of multi agent for the second order system peng et al 2015 feng et al 2016 hu et al 2016 xu and li 2013 inspired by multiple uavs some consensus algorithm has been used in auvs system das et al 2014 shojaei 2016a b tang et al 2017 fabiani et al 2018 such as neural network control shojaei 2016a b neuro fuzzy control pandian and sakagami 2011 because the communication between multiple agents will be disturbed by the environment and the input will be affected therefore the problem of time delay during the process of exchange of information needs to be solved the communication information of multiple auvs in the deep water is discrete data spread by sonar however most studies of the multi auv consistency controls are based on continuous time cui et al 2010 hu et al 2015 chen and ho 2016 in our past papers we have been working on the problem of path following formation control and coordinated target tracking of multiple uuvs bian et al 2012 yan et al 2016 2017 2018a b but the system model of the uuv and the control methods are based on continuous time the actual engineering problems can t be directly solved by the traditional formation control algorithm therefore the studies of consensus algorithm under discrete time conditions have practical significance it is important to obtain the position and velocity measured by sensors loaded in each auv for cooperative formation the leader follower auv cooperative navigation type is used in this paper which is unlike the parallel cooperative navigation system that the position information of the leader auv is sent to the follow auvs in the leader follow cooperative navigation system the amount of communication information is reduced without bi directional communication and the cost and weight of the follower auvs equipped with low precision navigation equipment can be cut down to the minimum the velocity of each auv is obtained by specific sensors such like fibre optic gyroscopes and tri axis accelerometers the position and velocity of each auv are obtained by using the coordinated control protocol based on the mathematical model of discrete time and the information is transmitted to other auvs by sonar then the position and speed are brought into the coordinate control of each auv and the force and torque of each actuator can be obtained and input to the corresponding driving devices however due to the complex and varied underwater environment and the influence of communication distance the communication between multiple auvs through sonar transmission will be affected by the communication delay which should be considered in this paper a multiple auvs coordinate control protocol under switching communication topology and time delay in discrete time conditions is designed according to the characteristics of underwater communication first the nonlinear model of auv is simplified to a second order affine system by state feedback linearization and then the topology is specified since the leader auv has a higher precision sensor we let all the followers receive the information of the leader auv so the followers can use more accurate information from the leader auv and take the form of random communication to simulate underwater communications which may be interrupted in order to reduce the amount of communication information the position information and speed information are independently spread second as the transmission information between auvs is discrete sampling information the auv continuous model is expressed as a discrete model using a direct discretization method furthermore the multiple auvs coordinate control protocols under switching communication topology and time delay in discrete time conditions are proposed and sufficient conditions for the consensus algorithms are analyzed and given in the case of no time delay and time delay finally simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the control law in the two cases 2 background and model description 2 1 notations the variables related to the theoretical and mathematical representation of the paper are defined in table 1 2 2 graph theory notions the communication topologies between auvs are described using topology graph it is an important method to analyze the relation of multiagent systems suppose a system with n nodes vehicles the directed graph g ν ε consists of a node set ν 1 2 n and an edge set ε i j i j ν ν ν in directed graph g ν ε a direct edge i j represents node j can receive information from node i matrix a a i j r n n is defined as a adjacency matrix where a i j 1 if i j ε while a i j 0 if i j ε moreover a i i 0 where i 1 2 n ν define the neighbor set of nodes i as n i j ν where i j ε the in degree matrix is defined as d d i a g d 1 d 2 d i i 1 n where d i j 1 n a i j is the in degree of the node i define the laplacian matrix l l i j of a weighted graph as 1 l i j k 1 k i n σ i k a i k j i σ i j a i j j i where zero is an eigenvalue of l with an associated eigenvector 1 n a sequence of edges i 1 i 2 i 2 3 i 3 i 4 in graph g ν ε is called a directed path g s is called strongly connected if any two distinct nodes are connected from a directed path if there is a directed edge from node i to node j node i is called parent node and node j is called child node a directed tree is a graph where every node has exactly one parent except for the root which has no parent and has a directed path to every other node a directed spanning tree of a graph is a directed tree formed by graph edges that connect all the nodes of the graph a graph has a directed spanning tree if there exists at least one node having a directed path to all the other nodes l has exactly one zero eigenvalue and only if the directed graph associated with g has a spanning tree all of the nonzero eigenvalues are in the open left half plane ren and beard 2005 the communication topology in this paper consists of two parts one is the position topology and the other is velocity topology g p and g v represent the position and velocity interaction topologies respectively similarly l p and l v represent the laplacian matrix of g p and g v respectively n i p and n i v respectively represent the neighbor set of the i th auv in the position and velocity topologies 2 3 the model of auv and feedback linearization the dynamic model of auv can typically be described by a 6 dof model according to the body fixed and earth fixed coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 as rolling has little influence on translational motion the roll speed is ignored in this paper fossen 2011 thus the nonlinear and coupled kinematics and kinetics equation are presented as follows kinematics equation 2 η j η v where η x 0 y 0 z 0 θ φ t ℜ 5 represents the states of position and euler angles j η is the jacobian matrix from body fixed frame to earth fixed frame kinetics equation 3 m v c v v d v v g η τ where v u 0 v 0 w 0 q r t ℜ 5 represents the states of velocities matrix m c v and d v denote inertia matrix coriolis and centripetal matrix and damping matrix respectively g η is a vector of generalized gravitational and buoyancy forces and moments τ is the control input in this paper the type of auv is common torpedo like which is symmetrical in plane and vertical that means the matrix m is symmetric and c v is skew symmetric meanwhile the center gravity and buoyancy of auv is coincident so g η is zero the details of the parameters are presented in fossen 1994 2011 the mathematical model of auv now can be represented as 4 η v i 0 0 m 1 j η v w v v 0 m 1 γ ξ u τ then the nonlinear model of auv can be described to an affine system as 5 ξ p ξ q ξ u τ μ r ξ where ξ η τ v τ τ p ξ i 0

according to the equation 5 the specific numerical q i j ξ can be computed so γ ξ is nonsingular matrix and the relative degree of the system is followed as 7 ρ 1 2 ρ 2 2 ρ 3 2 ρ 4 2 ρ 5 2 so ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 3 ρ 4 ρ 5 10 which is same as the dimension of the system according to lemma 1 the nonlinear model of auv can be linear by feedback linearization method and the transformation of the new coordinates

coordination control system from the analysis of the formation coordination control system as shown in fig 2 the coordination controller in the coordinated control system is responsible for the control on the coordination layer and gives the formation coordination control u u 1 t u 2 t u n t t u 1 t u 2 t u n t as the control input of each auv in the formation respectively as can be seen from the above the linearized model of auv is based on the system state after the coordinate transformation which changes the physical meanings of the system state and the system input so the input of the coordination controller cannot directly act on the original system model it is necessary to carry out inverse coordinate transformation and use the control input u i τ i 1 2 n that can be used by the original system to meet the formation coordination control all auvs output state ξ i i 1 2 n in the formation is linearized by feedback linearization to obtain state information x i v i i 1 2 n as a control input for formation coordination control in the new coordinate therefore the formation coordination control system of the multiple auvs based on the feedback linearization model can be realized 3 2 consensus algorithm without communication delay in this paper we consider discrete time dynamic model of the auv for the data of measurements and communication in the water is discrete

according to 19 we know h q p so 20 h k 1 q p k 1 j 1 2 k 1 h ˆ j where h ˆ j is the product of k 1 matrix by choosing q or p according to the properties of infinite norm the infinite norm of h ˆ j can be represented as 21 h ˆ j q k 0 q k m 1 m p p n where m n k 1 according to the definition of q k i q k i is a row stochastic matrix so the equation can be simplified as 22 h ˆ j p p n p 0 as n because the condition 3 p 1 so h ˆ j 0 as n the matrix q and p are non negative matrix and 0 therefore h ˆ j 0 as k n when k approaches infinite and n is finite h ˆ j exists a set of product of

2 h k 2 h k 2 h k 2 note that the directed graph of q k i is same as that of q k i it then follows from lemma 4 that q k i has a directed spanning tree therefore the directed graph of q k i also has a directed spanning tree it then follows from lemma 3 that q k i is sia according to the properties of sia there exists a vector y ℜ 2 n follows that 24 q k i l 1 2 n y τ l i 1 2 n define the matrix q as 25 q i q k i q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 where the all rows of q i i 1 2 3 4 are same then h ˆ j can be written as 26 h ˆ j u q o where both u and o are the products of a finite number of matrices by choosing either q k i or p we use the fact that l q i 0 and d p d v i and according to the definition of q k i and p we can have four product of the matrices 27 q k i q 1 t α p τ 2 2 q 1 t α v τ 2 2 q 3 1 t α

submatrices are same the same property also holds for 26 which contains a finite number of p therefore h ˆ j can be separated into four submatrices that all rows of every one of the four submatrices are the same combining the previous equations shows that as k all rows of h k i i 1 2 3 4 are the same lemma 6 assuming parameters α p α v and period t are exist that the matrix h ˆ k 1 h ˆ k 2 h ˆ k

34 x ˆ 1 k 1 x ˆ 2 k 1 x ˆ n k 1 v ˆ 1 k 1 v ˆ 2 k 1 v ˆ n k 1 so as k we have 35 x 1 k x 2 k x n k v 1 k v 2 k v n k for the definition 2 the multi auvs system can be consensus theorem 1 assume that the directed graph of the multi auvs system has a directed spanning tree if the parameters α p α v and period t satisfy the conditions as following the consensus of the multi auvs system can be obtained 1 α 1 1 d p max 1 α 2 1 d v max 1 2 t 1 2 proof when the multi auvs system are consensus all rows of the submatrices of system matrix n ˆ k n ˆ k 1 n ˆ k 2 n ˆ k 3 n ˆ k 4 should be the same as k according to lemma 6 the same conditions above is equal to that all rows of the submatrices of matrix h ˆ k 1 h ˆ k 2 h ˆ k 3 h ˆ k 4 are the same if condition 1 is satisfied the condition 1 2 in lemma 5 can be satisfied if condition 2 is satisfied the condition 3 in lemma 5 can be satisfied therefore all rows of the matrices h ˆ k 1 h ˆ k 2 h ˆ k 3 h ˆ k 4 are the same the consensus ability of multiple auvs system is guaranteed 3 3 consensus algorithm with communication time varying delay as the extreme underwater communication environment of auvs may cause delays during the information transmission it is necessary to consider the consensus of multiple auv systems in the case of communication delays the communication delay between auvs is defined as τ i j k when receiving messages we assume that the communication is bounded where t τ i j k τ 0 τ 0 is a positive constant in the presence of bounded communication delay the discrete dynamic equation is expressed in the following form 36 x i k 1 x i k t v i k t τ i j k 2 2 u i k v i k 1 v i k t τ i j k u i k to consensus the multi auvs system at t k t k 1 t by using the control law as follow 37 u i k β 1 j n i p σ i j k a i j k x i

satisfy the conditions as following the consensus of the multi auvs system can be obtained 1 α 1 t τ 0 2 d p max 1 α 2 1 t τ 0 2 d v max 1 2 t 1 2 proof we use a similar proof method in theorem 1 define the system matrix m k at t k as 41 m k i 5 n l p k α 1 t i 5 n l v k α 2 l p k α 1 i n 5 l v k α 2 if the multiple auv system is consensus all rows of the matrices m ˆ k 1 m ˆ k 2 m ˆ k 3 m ˆ k 4 must be the same at k 42 m k m k 1 m 0 m ˆ k 1 m ˆ k 2 m ˆ k 3 m ˆ k 4 combining the lemma 6 it is the same condition if all rows of the matrices h k 1 m h k 2 m h k 3 m h k 4 m are the same 43 h m k h m k 1 h m 0 h ˆ k 1 m h ˆ k 2 m h ˆ k 3 m h ˆ k 4 m where h m k h k 1 m h k 2 m h k 3 m h k 4 m i n α 1 l p k t i n α 2 l v k α 1 l p k i n α 2 l v k the matrix h m k can be decomposed by two

theorem ensures that the infinite norm of s is less than 1 combining the definition of l k its largest in degree d max can satisfy d max τ 0 d max 1 2 therefore if the directed graph of the multi auvs system has a directed spanning tree and the condition 1 is satisfied every r m k is sia applied lemma 2 we can have a vector y that 45 r m k r m k 1 r m 0 1 y τ τ k combining lemma 5 the theorem is proved 4 simulation to testify the correctness of the coordinate control protocols in this paper two cases of simulation experiments will be given the formation of multiple auvs system has six vehicles which consist of one leader auv0 and five followers auv1 5 as the leader auv is equipped with high precision navigation devices the information of leader s position will be spread to all the followers that means the construction of topology from leader to followers is fixed fig 3 shows the more precise information from the leader auv is sent to the followers while the five followers auvs exchange their information randomly to illustrate the random information between the auvs the set of topologies covers ten forms as shown in fig 4 fig 5 is the number of the state topologies about position and velocity that chosen from the set randomly the first case is that the information exchange between multiple auvs has no time delay the initial value of position and attitude of the leader auv is x 0 50 0 0 π 20 π 2 and the initial value of velocity is v 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 the initial value of x i 0 is randomly distributed in the 0 70 y i 0 is randomly distributed in the 0 70 z i 0 is randomly distributed in the 20 10 θ 0 and ψ 0 of the followers auvs are in the interval 0 1 0 1 and 0 4 respectively the coordinate control parameters are chosen as α 1 0 002 α 2 0 8 the formation order is designed as a straight line so the coordinates of each following auvs should be add a relative distance item s i the position is written as x i x i s i s 1 10 0 0 0 0 s 2 10 0 0 0 0 s 3 20 0

0 02 π t z t 0 08 t fig 6 proposes the position and attitude states of multiple auvs the position states converge to the desired helical curve and the attitude states converge to a fixed value the velocity states of all auvs are shown in fig 7 in fig 8 the three dimensional trajectories of all auvs shows that the leader auv can converge to the desired path and the follower auvs can keep the formation order in one straight line the second case is that the information exchange between multiple auvs has the time delay the simulation curve and the initial value of multiple auvs are same as first case the coordinate control parameters are chosen the same value in the first simulation and let τ 0 0 1 s fig 9 is the switching topologies of position and velocity in this simulation the position and attitude states of multiple auvs can also converge but it takes more time to stabilization comparing with the first case in fig 10 the position states converge to the desired helical curve and the attitude states converge to a fixed value the velocity states shown in fig 11 converge to a fixed value at 500 s it is later than the first case obviously fig 12 shows that all auvs also can converge to the desired curve and stay in the formation order with random initial value in the time delay situation 5 conclusions the coordinate control methods of multi auv system with no time delay and time delay under the switching communication topology using discrete information are discussed in this paper since the information is sampled data the nonlinear model of auv is simplified as second order affine forms by state feedback linearization method then the mathematical model is given in discrete time the coordination control protocols are given in the two cases and sufficient conditions for the consensus algorithm are analyzed and given based on the matrix theory the position and velocity can be brought into the controller of each auv then the driving force and torque of each actuator can be obtained finally the correctness of the proposed coordinated control protocols is proved by simulation experiments and the trajectories of multiple auvs converge to the desired trajectory in the future work we will consider and design a consensus algorithm in case of packet loss in the communication between multiple auvs author contributions zheping yan and zewen yang

23059,the exploitation of wave energy using arrays of wave energy converters wec which contain a large number of devices could have significant impact on the wave climate in the nearshore region this research investigates the impact of wec arrays at the westwave demonstration commercial site which is located on the west coast of ireland the methodology involves the determination of an appropriate transmission coefficient ct from a computational fluid dynamic cfd model of a numerical wave tank nwt simulation using ansys cfx and the subsequent implementation of wec arrays using swan version 41 01 within this analysis the ct value from the cfd nwt model was used in swan to represent wec arrays which are treated as obstacles hence a nested local wave model at the westwave site have been developed and validated for the period of december 2015 in order to accommodate the simulation of wec arrays three array configurations which contain 12 wecs single row two row arrays and three row arrays have been simulated and analysed to estimate the impact to the wave conditions at the nearshore area while also considering the effect of array configuration on power captured the results of the analysis suggest there is minor impact on the nearshore wave climate for all the scenarios where the reduction in wave height and wave power was below 1 at a distance of between 1 and 3 km from the shoreline at water depths varying from 20 to 60 m at a distance of 100 300 m from the shoreline at a water depth of approximately 10 m and below a decrease in wave height and wave power of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively was observed in addition the methodology can also be applied to other types of wec and study areas depending on the purpose of the project keywords westwave wave energy test site wec arrays nearshore impact numerical wave models wave climate 1 introduction a major potential for ocean wave energy exploitation exists in ireland this is evident with the existence of three wave energy sites for wave energy converters wecs on the west coast of ireland see fig 1 i the ¼ scale galway bay test site gbts in the vicinity of 9 067 w 53 249 n ii the full scale atlantic marine energy test site amets at belmullet 9 991 w 54 225 n and iii the westwave commercial demonstration site located off the coast of county clare 9 52 w 52 775 n additionally there are laboratory scale test facilities in the lir national ocean test facility which is located in cork on ireland s south coast seai 2014a and in six research institutions around ireland which operate as the centre for marine and renewable energy ireland marei marei 2017 the west coast of ireland experiences extremely energetic wave conditions due to its exposed location to the north eastern atlantic ocean where the 12 year annual mean wave power levels are between 30 and 70 kw m atan et al 2016a the wave power levels at the north west and south west of ireland varies from 20 to 100 kw m while off the eastern irish sea and southern coasts ranges between 10 and 50 kw m annually gallagher et al 2016 reguero et al 2015 the westwave site illustrated in fig 1 c is facing directly to the atlantic ocean and receives energetic wave events that travelled miles away across the ocean the 12 year annual mean power at the site was 50 kw m atan et al 2017a it is planned to deploy five wave energy converters wecs by 2018 at the site in a move towards commercialisation of wave power generation seai 2014b however the exploitation of wave energy using arrays of wecs which contain a large number of wecs could have significant impact on the wave climate in the nearshore area hence an analysis of imminent impacts due to the array of wecs should be investigated in order to preserve the natural morphological process at the site this occurs as the extraction of wave energy at an offshore area will decrease the magnitude of wave height and wave power that propagates from deep to shallow water the main aim of this research is to analyse the change of the wave climate in the nearshore area due to arrays of wecs as well as investigate the effects of various configurations for wec arrays on wave energy extraction at the westwave site this required the development of a far field numerical wave model using the simulating waves nearshore swan tudelft 2015a wave modelling software utilising an nesting methodology to replicate wave conditions at the westwave site for a local scale and a computational fluid dynamics cfd near field numerical wave tank nwt model using ansys cfx ansys inc 2013 cfd was chosen to model the near field effects of the wec on the incoming wave as it allows for potentially greater insights particularly when the model is developed further the methodology involves determination of an appropriate transmission coefficient ct from the cfd nwt model which was proceeded with one way coupling into swan to simulate arrays of wecs a single wec or multiple wecs in an array can be modelled in swan and treated as an obstacle line with the existence of a constant ct value millar et al 2007 tudelft 2015b a number of previous studies have implemented this methodology to simulate the impacts of wec arrays on the nearshore wave climate millar et al 2007 rusu and guedes soares 2013 rute bento et al 2014 diaconu and rusu 2013 abanades et al 2014 abanades et al 2015 while array configuration studies were performed using analytical and mathematical algorithm approaches child and venugopal 2010 porter et al 2012 renzi et al 2013 de andrés et al 2014 the ct value used in previous studies of wec impacts using swan millar et al 2007 rusu and guedes soares 2013 rute bento et al 2014 diaconu and rusu 2013 was mainly based on a generic absorption assumption of wec efficiency other studies smith et al 2012 chang et al 2016 o dea et al 2018 have modelled the wec using a frequency dependent energy extraction method where ct varies with sea state while carballo and iglesias 2013 used a ct value was obtained from experimental tests in this research the appropriate ct value was calculated from a cfd nwt model and the value was then used in simulations of wec arrays in swan to investigate the configuration of arrays at real sea states that would have minimum impact on the wave climate at the nearshore area however wec performance is not being examined in this research three arrays of wecs scenarios single row layout two rows layout and three rows layout have been simulated and analysed to measure the impact to the wave conditions at the nearshore area in this paper an overview of the methodology used in the two modelling approaches is presented in section 2 which includes the nwt used to calculate ct for one wave energy convertor and the swan model to investigate the impact of wec arrays the results of arrays of wecs are detailed in section 3 while a discussion from the analyses of ct and arrays of wecs is summarised in section 4 finally the main conclusions from the research are highlighted in section 5 2 materials and methods two modelling approaches have been performed for the purpose of i investigating the impact of wec arrays to the nearshore wave climate and ii analysing the effect of array configuration on power absorbed by the wecs a methodology involved a combination of far field modelling in order to replicate realistic wave conditions at the westwave site and near field modelling which simulates interaction between a wave and structure the swan wave modelling software was used in far field modelling while ansys cfx was applied in near field modelling a nested local wave model at the westwave site was developed from a coarse model resolution at 0 050 fig 1 a identified as the coarse model to a local scale at 0 0270 approximately 300 m fig 1 b identified as the gbts model and subsequently to a scale of 0 000050 approximately 5 m fig 1 c identified as the westwave model the development of the coarse and gbts wave models with model validation is discussed in atan et al 2017b a cfd nwt model was also developed to replicate irregular wave conditions at the site based on a validated cfd nwt model developed at amets finnegan and goggins 2015 using ansys cfx however since measured spectral data was not available at the westwave site spectral data from the westwave swan model were used to regenerate irregular waves that were inputted into the cfd nwt model selected wecs were then included in the cfd nwt model in order to calculate the transmission coefficient ct value which is then used in swan to model a single wec or multiple wecs in arrays finally three array configurations containing 12 wecs single row layout two rows layout and three rows layout were investigated in order to determine the impact of the array on the wave climate in the nearshore area an overview of the methodology utilised in this research for arrays of wecs analysis is shown in fig 2 2 1 nested local swan model at westwave a nested local wave model at the westwave site has been developed to replicate wave conditions at the site using swan version 41 01 with nesting method implementation swan is a third generation wave model that solves action balance equation and takes consideration of wave current interactions the action density spectrum n is equal to the energy density spectrum e divided by the relative frequency σ it is formulated in cartesian coordinates and optionally in spherical coordinates to accommodate small and large oceanic scales based on the area of interest the action balance equation may be written as 1 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ where c x c y c σ a n d c θ are the propagation velocities of the wave energy in spatial and spectral spaces and s is the total source term s is defined in terms of sources and sinks as follows 2 s σ θ s i n σ θ s n l 3 σ θ s n l 4 σ θ s w c σ θ s b f r σ θ s s u r f σ θ where s in σ θ represents atmospheric input to wave generation i e wave growth by wind s nl3 σ θ and s nl4 σ θ are the terms representing nonlinear wave wave interactions three wave and four wave interactions respectively and s wc σ θ s bfr σ θ and s surf σ θ are dissipation terms representing wave decay by white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking respectively the governing equations are solved using finite different schemes two dimensional rectangular grid which are simple robust and economical for application in oceanic waters in the present of an obstacle application to arrays of wecs in this work the action balance equation in curvilinear coordinates solves n as 3 1 δ t d x 1 d x 2 c x i j d y 1 d y 2 c y i j n i j n i j δ t d x 1 c x c t 1 2 n i 1 j d y 1 c y c t 1 2 n i 1 j d x 2 c x c t 2 2 n i j 1 d y 2 c y c t 2 2 n i j 1 s i j where 1 δt d s and ct correspond to the time derivative diffusion coefficient source term of depth induced breaking and transmission coefficient respectively while cx and cy are propagation speeds in geographical space x y tudelft 2015b the obstacles used to represent the wecs are treated as lines running through computational grids where a constant ct value will be applied to the flux between those nodes if and only if a grid point is crossed by an obstacle line tudelft 2015b which therefore causes interruption on waves propagation as a result these obstacles will affect the wave field in three ways such as the wave height of the waves that propagate through or over it will be reduced waves will be reflected and waves will also be diffracted around its corner hence these demonstrate that swan can reasonably account for propagation of waves around an obstacle if the directional spectrum of incoming waves is not too narrow tudelft 2015b moreover as swan solves action balance equation for the conservation of wave energy a representation of arrays of wecs is account for the energy absorbed in the present of ct folley et al 2012 and the impact to the nearshore wave climate can be analysed based on the remaining waves due to the absorption process the main objective of developing the model is to replicate wave conditions at the site and to simulate various wec arrays configuration as well as to investigate the impact of wec arrays on the wave climate in the nearshore area therefore an appropriate model resolution should be used in order to resolve a 10 m width device that was simulated in this work as well as to fit with the obstacle lines setup in swan where it needs to be placed across the computational grids as per described earlier hence the nested local wave model at the westwave site is resolved to a resolution of 0 000050 approximately 5 m and covers the extent of 9 72 x202f w 9 62 w and 52 68n 52 78n see fig 1 c with 2014 2014 grid points in the x axis easting grid and y axis northing grid similar to the two previously developed models at gbts atan et al 2017b and amets atan et al 2016a 2016b the bathymetry data was obtained from infomar datasets at 2 250 m resolution gsi 2013 and the blue kenue software nrc national research council canada nrc 2015 was used to interpolate processed bathymetry datasets in order to generate the 5 m resolution gridded model domain the open boundary conditions were taken from the nested spectral boundary outputs generated by the gbts wave model at 30 x202f min intervals while the nested boundary conditions for the gbts model were supplied from the coarse model the orientation of the model is 0 clockwise in a spherical geometrical coordinate system to ensure all open boundaries are close to 90 for all major in or out flow wave formations with the jonswap spectrum at the open boundaries 72 directions and 38 frequencies logarithmically spaced from 0 03 to 1 1 hz in addition a similar model setup to the gbts wave model was applied at the westwave wave model where janssen wave growth formulation the hasselmann white capping formulation and the jonswap bed friction model were used for white capping the dissipation coefficients used were cds 2 10 5 δ 1 5 and p 4 with the bed friction recommended value of cb 0 038 a summary of the key model settings for the coarse and gbts wave models are detailed in atan et al 2017b as a preliminary assessment to assess the impact of wec arrays at the nearshore wave climate the westwave model was simulated for the one month period of december 2015 the only period for which measured data is available at the site moreover the ultra fine model resolution requires significant computational time and a one month period was deemed sufficient for assessment of impacts furthermore based on the wave climate at the westwave site atan et al 2017a december 2015 period contributes to more energetic waves compared to the other months hence this preliminary assessment is focussing on the analysis during the energetic wave conditions rather than representative wave conditions at the site table 1 shows a summary of validation values against measured data for coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse bias and scatter index si for significant wave height hs and zero up crossing wave period tz energy wave period te measured data was not available the model achieved high accuracy overall with r2 of 0 9 0 8 and 0 7 for hs tz and mwd respectively while the bias values were 0 4 m for hs 0 1s for tz and 70 for mwd table 1 which is also shown in fig 3 thus the model can be used to simulate an array of wecs at the westwave site 2 2 cfd nwt model for transmission coefficient the cfd nwt model used in this study was developed using the finite volume commercial software ansys cfx which uses a solver based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the cfd nwt model was developed based on the methodology developed by finnegan and goggins 2012 and the methodology for generating linear irregular waves in a nwt was based on finnegan and goggins 2015 however as only spectral data was available for the westwave site which was obtained from the swan model it was necessary to use an inverse fourier transform to obtain the inputted wave elevation and associated water particle velocities that was used at the input boundary of the cfd nwt model similar to finnegan and goggins 2015 the cfd nwt model has a height of 100 m which allows for a water depth of 70 m length of 500 m maximum dimension as a result of a limitation in the ansys academic licence and an effectively infinitely wide domain by using a domain width of one element while minimising the solver computational time through the use of two symmetry boundaries specified on the sides a water depth of 70 x202f m was used in the cfd nwt model as this represents deep water conditions based on the linear wave theory of the wave conditions at the two locations analysed in this study as seen in fig 1 the water depth at the wave rider at the westwave site is approximately 70 m and at amets is approximately 100 m the structure used in the model was a single unrestrained floating rectangular prism that was free to heave and pitch which represents a point absorber wec that operates in the heave and pitch motions 2 2 1 the governing equations the method on which the solver in ansys cfx is based on is the finite volume technique ansys inc 2013 this technique divides the region of interest into sub regions and discretises the governing equations in order to solve them iteratively over each sub regions therefore an approximation of the value of each variable at points throughout the domain is achieved the governing equations that need to be solved by the ansys cfx solver are the mass continuity equation which is given as 4 ρ t ρ u 1 x ρ u 2 y 0 and the navier stokes equations which are given as 5 ρ u 1 t u 1 u 1 x u 2 u 1 y p x 2 μ 2 u 1 x 2 y μ u 1 y u 2 x f 1 6 ρ u 2 t u 1 u 2 x u 2 u 2 y p y 2 μ 2 u 2 y 2 x μ u 1 y u 2 x f 2 ρ g where t is time x is the horizontal distance from the wavemaker y is the vertical height from the swl and increases with depth u 1 is the horizontal flow velocity u 2 is the vertical flow velocity f 1 is the body force on the fluid in the horizontal direction f 2 ρ g is the body force on the fluid in the vertical direction p is pressure and μ is viscosity in order to determine the position of the free surface or air water boundary the volume of fluid method is applied this technique was also employed by liang et al hirt and nichols 1981 liang et al 2010 this method adds another governing equation given by 7 q i t u 1 q i x u 2 q i y 0 i 1 2 where q i is the volume fraction of the fluid i with i 1 2 q i 1 where 1 denotes air and 2 denoting water the free surface is then approximated as at the position of the minimum of value q 1 q 2 along the model 2 2 2 estimation of transmission coefficient the transmission coefficient ct was estimated using the methodology described in gadelho et al 2014 where 8 c t h s t h s i where hs i is the incident significant wave height and hs t is the transmitted significant wave height therefore it was necessary to run each model configuration twice the first run was in the absence of the structure in order to accurately determine the modelled incident wave elevation which allows for the calculation of hs i the second run included the structure in order to determine reflected and transmitted waves which allows for the calculation of hs t in total 12 configurations at two locations amets and westwave were modelled in order to estimate the transmission coefficient which range from 0 76 to 0 91 two geometries for the rectangular prism width of 30 m and submerged draft of 15 m and width of 10 m and submerged draft of 10 m were explored in order to determine a suitable ct value however when implementing the ct into swan model only the results for the smaller prism were used as they are of more suitable scale to a point absorber wec a summary detailing each of the cfd model arrangements and results are presented in table 2 and fig 4 from the results of the analysis presented in table 2 it is evident that smaller wecs have a higher ct value as they have less of an effect on the waves fig 4 displays the range of ct values 0 86 0 91 that were observed in the cfd analysis it is evident from fig 4 a that in general there is an increase in ct as both hs and te get larger and therefore there is a general increase in ct when wave power increase which can be seen in fig 4 b the hs and te have been calculated by performing a fast fourier transform of each wave record being analysed in order to vary both the hs and te a number of wave records from throughout the month of december 2015 have been used however it should be noted that the dataset is not large enough to definitively confirm this hypothesis and further investigation is required for the purpose of this study as the range of ct values 0 86 0 91 is quite narrow it was decided to use a constant ct value 0 86 which explores the effects of the worst case scenario and reduces the computational effort while remaining quiet accurate given the small variation in ct values for the simulated wec tt was concluded that the additional work involved in implementing a frequency dependant solution within swan for estimating the ct would not yield significantly more accurate results 2 3 wec arrays in swan a single wec in swan can be represented as an obstacle with a constant ct value millar et al 2007 folley et al 2012 and a series of obstacles therefore signifies multiple wecs in an array as described in millar millar et al 2007 the energy that will be absorbed by the wecs varies depending on the energy transmission percentage an energy transmission percentage of 0 indicates a complete absorption which is unlikely to be achieved 70 refers to highly efficient wecs which would be probably too optimistic to be attained 90 represents lower efficiency which is more achievable in reality and 40 suggest very highly efficient wec which is extremely unrealistic the obstacle is treated as a line in swan in a set of two points or a series of points running through computational grids with an appropriate ct value depending on wec types furthermore the obstacle line should be placed appropriately depending on a size of a wec to be modelled however for a wec that is sensitive to dominant wave directions drew et al 2009 falcão 2010 the obstacle line placement should be properly oriented or perpendicular to the dominant incoming wave directions at a site for the westwave site the dominant wave directions in december 2015 were coming from west and south west direction to the true north observed from a wave rose plot of hs and te against mwd shown in fig 3 b1 b2 respectively thus the obstacle lines in the model were set up perpendicular 900 clockwise off to the 00 model orientation to the incoming dominant wave directions in order to capitalise on the available energy for absorption in addition any incoming waves that run though the obstacle lines will also be absorbed by the model tudelft 2015b folley et al 2012 fig 3 b3 shows a wave rose plot between hs and mwd where the dominant wave direction were from west south west and north west at westwave which was retrieved from the developed gbts wave model atan et al 2017b for a 12 years period therefore it is justified that the perpendicular obstacle line setup at the westwave site should be able to capture most of the available energy at different periods of the year if such investigation is require to be analysed in the future for the purpose of investigating the impact of an array of wecs to the nearshore wave climate a small wec with 10 m width d was considered in this research babarit et al 2011 hence the selection of the ct values to be used in the obstacle lines setup in swan was based on the 10 m width wec only based on table 2 the lowest ct value of 0 86 was selected as the representative value due to its highest energy absorption rate compared to the other values for the 10 m width device which therefore signifies a conservative approach consideration a constant ct value of 0 86 was assigned in the obstacles lines setup in swan to simulate a single wec and multiple wecs in arrays in addition the wecs were modelled to absorb all the incoming waves and as such reflection and diffraction were not accounted in this research similar to the methodology applied in chang et al 2016 and carballo and iglesias 2013 table 3 shows 24 cases used when simulating wec arrays from a single wec case a1 to 12 devices in single two and three rows case d1 d3 as the final scenarios to investigate the impact to the nearshore wave climate for a one week period of the 1 7 december 2015 as a preliminary assessment the initial case a1 was first simulated with a single wec located near to the westwave station in order to observe the change in wave formation with the existence of the wec in the model an array with two wecs in a single row configuration with a vertical spacing ranging from 20 m 2d to 400 m 40d between wecs edge to edge was then simulated and analysed case a2 a8 in table 3 next a third wec was placed in a second row midway between the two wecs in the first row at a fixed distance of 50 m 5d perpendicular to the axis that joins the devices in the first row to avoid interaction effects between wecs stratigaki et al 2014 verbrugghe et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 5 cases b1 b6 b8 a similar approach was used to identify the placement of a fourth wec in the third row the final configurations of wec arrays to model 12 wecs in single two and three rows indicated as cases d1 d2 and d3 was determined based on case a6 b5 and c3 respectively a detailed analysis to investigate which of these configurations of wec arrays has the least impact to the nearshore wave climate is discussed in the next section 3 results in this section model results are presented based on 24 simulated scenarios which are summarised in table 3 the results were analysed based on one week simulation to investigate the configuration of wec arrays that will minimise the impact of the arrays on the nearshore wave climate while maximising wave power extraction specially 12 wecs in arrays were simulated such as 12 wecs in single row 12 wecs in two rows and 12 wecs in three rows see table 3 case d1 d3 an analysis of wave power and energy absorption is detailed in section 3 1 for a single wec while section 3 3 presents an investigation of wec spacing section 3 3 discusses the impact of wec arrays to the nearshore wave climate resulted from case d1 d3 and finally an analysis of the effect of array configuration on power captured is detailed in section 3 4 3 1 power and energy of wecs the ct value of 0 86 from the 10 m width wec was used to represent a single wec and subsequently multiple wecs in arrays using swan similar to the methodology in the previous studies millar et al 2007 rusu and guedes soares 2013 rute bento et al 2014 diaconu and rusu 2013 an analysis of a single wec was carried out based on case a1 table 3 where the wec was placed in the swan model close to the location of the wave measurement buoy at the westwave site a percentage change in mean significant wave height hs and mean wave power p was calculated based on equation 9 9 δ h s or p baseline case baseline 100 the total absorbed energy is assumed to be the difference between the total available energy and the total remaining energy 10 total absorbed energy total available energy total remaining energy the wave power at the site was calculated based on the deep water power equation of the linear wave theory demirbilek and vincent 2008 which assumes for deep water that d λ 1 2 d water depth 70 m λ mean wavelength 125 m for december 2015 and is given by cornett 2008 11 p 0 49 h s 2 t e where p is the wave power per unit width of wave crest kw m of a regular sea state at westwave fig 6 shows bi variate scatter plots of hs versus te for case a1 for a one week period with the energy contribution and wave power isolines for both the available energy and remaining energy the wave power isolines were obtained using the methodology developed in atan et al 2016c where the 90th and 99th quantiles were defined as operational e g average and extreme wave conditions respectively while additional information of the 25 50 and 70th quantiles were also presented the total available and absorbed energy from a single wec case a1 was 30 4mwhr m and 9 2mwhr m respectively as shown in fig 7 a fig 7 b and c illustrates the percentage change in mean hs δhs and mean p δp the δhs was between 12 and 17 at the grids where the wec is located fig 7 b while the corresponding value of δp was 25 30 fig 7 c the predominant wave direction varies between 240 and 270 during december 2015 see fig 3 therefore it is observed that the change in mean hs δhs was greater than 5 up to 50 m in the eastern direction from the wec location i e in the direction the incoming waves are travelling while in the orthogonal direction the corresponding distance was 5 20 m from the wec the higher value being in the northern direction due to the incoming wave direction as can be seen from fig 7 c a wider spread is observed in the percentage changes in mean p δp plot 3 2 investigation of device spacing and array configuration based on the case a1 analysis 7 cases case a2 a8 of two wecs in a row in the north south direction with different spacing varying from 20 to 400 m between wecs table 3 were simulated this was performed in order to determine their impact on the water waves and to determine the position of subsequent rows of wecs including the placement of a third wec in the second row when examining more than one row of wecs a fixed horizontal spacing between rows of wecs of 50 m has been assumed fig 8 a1 a5 shows an up close view of δhs while fig 8 b1 b5 shows the analysis of δp for case a2 to a8 based on fig 8 it is identified that a larger space between wecs signifies wider isolated grids with lower δhs and δp values compared to wecs that were close to each other for example in case a2 the remaining available energy to be absorbed for the third wec in the second row was lower 1 83 mwhr m than a case with a wider space between wecs such as in case a6 6 5 mwhr m this can be observed based on the δhs and δp values in fig 8 where higher values indicate a greater decrease in hs and p while lower values define a lower decrease in hs and p the spacing of the wecs in the second row of wecs has been simulated in cases b1 to b7 and the results of the simulations have been presented in fig 9 a in each case the wec in the second row was placed in the middle of the two wecs in the first row where the spacing in the north south direction i e orthogonal direction to the dominant incoming wave direction between two devices in the first row is illustrated in fig 5 fig 9 a shows the total available and absorbed energy at the third device in the second row for case b1 b7 as expected case b5 shows the highest absorbed energy of 6 5 mwhr m at the third device location due to the lowest δhs and δp values compared to case b1 b4 which was calculated in case a6 for case b6 b7 the total available energy are similar with case b5 while the total absorbed energy is slightly higher 6 9 mwhr m compared to case b5 due to a larger spacing between wecs fig 9 b and c shows an up close view plot of δhs for case b1 and b5 which shows that case b1 contributes to a higher decrease in hs δhs 4 at the location of the wec in the second row compared to b5 this justified the lowest total absorbed energy of 1 83 mwhr m at the third wec compared to the other cases b2 b7 due to the close space between the two wecs in the first row which affected the available energy to be absorbed by the wec in the second row a similar approach was applied for the placement of a wec in the third row of an array in order to facilitate a third row additional cases with two rows case b8 and b9 were examined which include an additional spacing in the east west direction i e dominant incoming wave direction of 100 m fig 10 shows analysis plots of δhs and δp for case b6 to b9 which summarised that a wider spacing in both the dominate wave direction and the orthogonal direction between wecs contribute a larger space of grids with a lower decrease in hs and p this may be suitable for the placement of the wec in the third row however a larger spacing between devices will lead to higher maintenance cost therefore a smaller vertical spacing of 50 m such as in case b6 and b7 were selected to further investigate the third row case case c1 c4 were developed and analysed in order to determine the wec arrays configuration for 4 wecs in three rows where a detailed configuration is tabulated in table 3 the total available and absorbed energy at the fourth device from case c1 c4 was calculated using the same method in case b1 b5 and is presented in fig 11 a in this analysis case c1 and c2 show lower total absorbed energy compared to case c3 and c4 due to higher decreased in hs at the fourth wec location as seen in fig 11 b1 b2 in contrast case c3 and c4 show a similar total absorbed energy at the fourth wec however case c3 was selected as the preferable configuration for four devices in three rows due to its smaller horizontal spacing compared to case c4 while retaining a similar level of absorbed energy 3 3 environmental impact area of wec arrays in order to examine the environmental impact area of an array of wecs on the wave climate at the nearshore area at the westwave site an analysis based on cases d1 d2 and d3 see table 3 was performed in these cases 12 wecs were located approximately 8 km from the shoreline at the westwave site and modelled in single two and three rows fig 12 a shows mean hs values for the baseline i e no wave farm while fig 12 b c d shows δhs for cases d1 d3 with contours depth of 10 70 m covering the model domain based on fig 12 the changes in mean hs values at the nearshore area for all cases was very small compared to the baseline case which is evident from the δhs plots the decrease in mean hs for all cases at 10 m depth and below approximately 100 300 m from a shoreline was less than 0 1 while at 20 40 m depth approximately 800 m 1 km from shoreline and 50 60 m depth which is approximately more than 1 km stretch from the shoreline this was less than 0 2 and between 0 2 and 0 4 respectively this shows that hs experienced a very minor reduction at the nearshore area with δhs between 0 1 and 0 4 for all cases and therefore should not lead to a major change to the coastal morphological processes at the nearshore area a similar impact in mean p is also observed for these three cases shown in fig 13 as expected a lower reduction in mean p occurred at the nearshore area which encompasses 10 m depth and below δp 0 2 for all cases a slight decrease in mean p was measured at 20 40 m depth with δp between 0 2 and 0 6 while at 50 60 m depth mean p decreased by up to 0 8 detailed plots of δp for cases d1 d2 and d3 are presented in fig 13 b c d respectively based on fig 13 it is determined that mean p decreased towards the nearshore area with a minor reduction that should not have a significant impact on the wave climate at the nearshore area overall the impact of the wec arrays to the nearshore wave climate is not prevalent based on a very small reduction in hs and p which was below 1 at a distance between 1 and 3 km from the shore while the lowest percentage was closed to 0 at 10 m depth and below approximately 100 x202f m from the shore hence it can be concluded that each scenario of case d1 d2 and d3 entails minimum impact to the nearshore wave climate contrarily case d1 shows the highest area of δp at 1 and above see table 4 compared to the other cases but this area existed at 60 70 m water depth approximately 5 km from the shore see fig 13 b which again does not effected the wave climate at the nearshore area and this is also similar to the area in case d2 and d3 see fig 13 c and d however a further investigation should be conducted in the future to inspect coastal morphological processes such as sedimentation and erosion which could occur simultaneously due to the change of wave formation and propagation with the existence of a wave farm gonzález santamaría et al 2012 for example a sediment transport model such as xbeach roelvink et al 2010 delft3d roelvink and banning 1994 and roms warner et al 2008 can be coupled with swan for sediment transport studies 3 3 1 effect of array configuration on power capture for 12 wecs the results of the analysis performed in section 3 2 have been used to inform the configuration for an array of 12 wecs in single two and three rows since the predominant wave direction of the incoming waves is perpendicular to the configuration of the arrays and the spacing between devices in each row is assumed to be large enough where radiation affects are negligible there is no interference between adjacent wecs therefore for 12 wecs in a single row since there is no interference between adjacent wecs and a minimum distance between wecs can be used is the configuration that is most optimum in terms of total power capture however there are other aspects that should be considered including mooring points and a central hub for power transfer to the shore and these may suggest that deploying wecs in arrays with multiple rows may be ultimately more efficient additionally each wec in the first row of each array acts similar to wecs deployed in a single row as they absorb the maximum amount of energy for an array of 12 wecs in two rows the total power absorbed mw as it varies with the orthogonal array width is presented in fig 14 a and the power per array width kw m and the power per array area kw m2 are presented in fig 14 b it is clear to see from these figures fig 14 a and b that as total power absorbed increases the power per array width decreases therefore it is necessary for developers to take into account the available array width when selecting the optimum spacing if using the configuration with two rows other considerations and influences on array efficiency have been included in table 4 for a selected two row configuration which has a spacing based on case b5 and is described in table 3 as case d2 for an array of 12 wecs in three rows the total power absorbed mw as it varies with the orthogonal array width is presented in fig 15 a and the power per array width kw m and the power per array area kw m2 are presented in fig 15 b similar to the case for an array with two rows of wecs the total power absorbed increases as the power per array width decreases therefore the same trade off exists for developers when selecting the optimum spacing if using the configuration with three rows again additional considerations and influences for optimum array efficiency have been included in table 4 for a selected array of 12 wecs in three rows which is based on the spacing of case c3 and is described in table 3 as case d3 4 discussion the methodology introduced in this paper which investigates the impact of arrays of wecs on the wave climate in the nearshore area delivers useful information to potential developers on wave farm planning and development furthermore the total absorbed energy should also provide a preliminary estimation of the total energy that could be extracted at the site depending on device types and simulation period however a larger device potentially contributes to a greater impact on the nearshore wave climate compared to a smaller device due to its size and array configuration spacing thus these factors should be considered in a wave farm development in order to avoid disruption to coastal morphological processes at the local shoreline 4 1 transmission coefficient ct ct values were estimated using a cfd nwt model described in section 2 2 and the results are presented for 8 different configurations in table 2 based on these 8 configurations the average value for ct was found to be 0 84 which ranged from 0 76 to 0 9 it is evident from the results that variations in ct values are dependent on the overall size of the structure i e smaller structures have a larger associated ct value however in this analysis a value of ct of 0 86 is taken as a 10 m structure has been used to represent a wec within the swan model as the structure used in the present study is an unrestrained structure the ct value of 0 86 is larger than those used by carballo and iglesias 2013 ct of 0 776 and 0 756 which were obtained from experimental wave tank testing of a scale model wec however the value of 0 86 is in line with the value used in the wec array analysis of rute bento et al 2014 where 0 9 is defined as a realistic scenario a spaced or low energy absorber wec array and 0 7 is defined as an optimistic scenario a narrow spaced or average energy absorber wec array nevertheless for future studies it would be beneficial to use a structure that was restrained by a mooring and power take off system to more accurately model the effect of wecs furthermore advancing the model to a full 3 d simulation and modelling a working or prototype wec similar to carballo and iglesias 2013 would yield more accurate and relevant results the presented cfd nwt model is developed using ansys cfx which is restricted with an academic license therefore it may be beneficial to using an unrestricted open source cfd software such as openfoam jasak 2009 in order to explore the affects using a larger domain which would permit the modelling of two or more inline structures 4 2 wec array analyses wec array configurations in single two and three rows have been explored when examining the interference between wecs the percentage difference in the reduction of hs and pas detailed in section 3 has been included the spacing for the optimum array configuration for 12 wecs in single row is the minimum specified distance between wecs which is assumed as 20 m in this study as a result of the wave direction being orthogonal to the wec array configuration a single row of devices with minimum spacing is the optimum array configuration in terms of absorbing the maximum total power a configuration of closely spaced arrays for 12 devices in three rows as per case c1 contributes to higher reduction in hs and p which then caused a lower total absorbed energy compared to an array with wecs more sparsely spaced as in case c4 however the sparse configuration could lead to higher installation and maintenance cost and therefore the operational cost should be considered in the optimum arrays configuration selection for wec arrays in two and three rows the total power absorbed and the power per array width and the power per array area as it varies with the orthogonal array width has been compared in both cases it is evident that as total power absorbed increases the power per array width decreases therefore based on this study it is necessary for developers to take into account the available array width when selecting the optimum spacing and configuration other considerations and influences on array efficiency have been included for 3 selected array configurations of 12 wecs for developers reference similar to the methodology in chang et al 2016 and carbalo and iglesias 2013 a reflection between waves and wecs was not taken into consideration and this limitation should also be accessed when modelling the wake of the structure hence if the reflection is required to be analysed a reflection setup can be activated in swan where either specular reflection when the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence or diffuse reflection a case when the incident waves are scattered over reflected direction may be considered tudelft 2015b tudelft 2015c similar to ct a reflection coefficient cr can be calculated from the cfd nwt model using the approach in gadelho et al 2014 furthermore a scenario in which the wecs in the first row act as a barrier in order to protect wecs in the rows behind it during extreme conditions can also be investigated in the future when integrating a combination of ct and cr using swan it is also noted that in swan a diffraction approximation does not properly capture diffraction in front of reflecting obstacles or in harbours and often converges poorly or not at all without proper considerations tudelft 2015b tudelft 2015c hence diffraction in wec arrays simulation in swan in the present work was not allowed similar to the methodology in chang et al 2016 carbalo and iglesias 2013 and rute bento et al 2014 an alternative approach of a phase decoupled refraction diffraction approximation tudelft 2015c can be implemented in swan if the diffraction is required to be investigated diaconu and rusu 2013 the latest swan version 40 10a has implemented additional options to specify frequency and direction dependent transmission coefficients to be applied to an obstacle this option could be used in an array of wecs simulation which takes into account a different ct value for each of spectral frequency band considered folley et al 2012 in addition the developed snl swan sandia national laboratories swan model ruehl et al 2013 porter et al 2014 has implemented several obstacle options to model wec arrays that takes into account device performance subjected to wec power matrix and wec relative capture width rcw at each frequency bin depending on wec types chang et al 2016 babarit 2015 the wec power matrix and rcw to be used in snl swan can be calculated using an open source boundary element method code called nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 therefore a further investigation using swan version 41 10a and snl swan will be progressed in the future as well as progressing the cfd nwt model to calculate wec power matrix to be used in snl swan another important aspect in a wave farm study is environmental impact assessment eia where a proposed wave farm should be screened for an eia due to the uncertainty effect to the environment o hagan et al 2016 depending on devices classification define as onshore devices intermediate water devices and offshore devices margheritini et al 2012 as the focus of this present study is the impact of arrays of wecs on the nearshore wave climate only the effect on coastal processes was evaluated a proposed wave farm location using offshore devices in this research is located at 8 km from the westwave site s shoreline which meets the distance from a shore requirement for offshore devices where the location should be further than 5 km from the shore as per detailed in an eia scoping in margheritini et al 2012 based on this requirement distance it is also expected that only a minor impact to coastal morphological processes will occur and it is proven that a very minor reduction in hs and p was observed in this study especially at the nearshore area for three scenarios with 12 wecs in arrays case d1 d2 and d3 hence a very minor change or small obstruction impacts in coastal morphological processes is expected to take place at the nearshore area of the westwave site however a further study on morphological processes such as sedimentation and erosion should be conducted to investigate these phenomena where the change in coastal morphological processes can be performed in the future using a sediment transport model such as xbeach roms and delft3d that can be coupled with swan 5 conclusions a detailed methodology of coupling a near field cfd nwt model using ans cfx and a far field wave model using swan in wave farm modelling to investigate the impact of arrays of wecs on the nearshore wave climate at westwave site is presented the cfd nwt model was developed based on the methodology in finnegan and goggins 2015 while the nested local model using swan was developed based on two developed models described in atan et al 2017b the ct value calculated from the cfd nwt model using the approach in gadelho et al 2014 was then applied to the obstacle lines setup in swan to represent multiple wecs in arrays three wec arrays configuration for 12 wecs in single two and three rows case d1 d2 and d3 were simulated where the impact of the arrays of wecs to the nearshore wave climate was analysed and the effect of array configuration was also investigated the methodology could be expanded for multiple wecs in multiple rows depending on wec types and project requirements as well as the site location the following are the main conclusions drawn from the research the ct value of 0 86 was used a constant transmission in the obstacle lines setup to represent single and multiple wecs with 10 m width using swan version 41 01 the obstacle lines were oriented at 900 clockwise off to the 00 model orientation which is perpendicular to the dominant incoming wave directions in order to fully absorb the available energy at the site it is recommended to orientate the obstacle lines depending on the dominant wave directions similar to this study based on case d1 d2 and d3 a very minor reduction in means hs δhs 0 1 and means p δp 0 2 was observed at the nearshore area which is approximately 100 300 m from the shoreline at 10 m depth and below while at a distance between 1 and 3 km from the shoreline δhs and δp was below than 1 for varying water depth of 20 60 m overall the wec arrays impact to the nearshore wave climate for all cases is not significant based on a very small reduction in hs and p this illustrates the environmental benefits of using smaller 10 m wecs rather than some of the current wecs greater than 30 m in width which are striving for commercial viability a limitation in wec arrays modelling such as a reflection and diffraction as well as device performance at each frequency bin has been discussed and a further investigation will be conducted in the future using swan version 41 10a and snl swan eia screening on the wec arrays impact to the nearshore wave climate depending on devices classification onshore intermediate water and offshore devices should be evaluated in order to investigate an obstruction level to coastal morphological processes this requirement was examined in this research and a very minor impediment impact in coastal morphological processes is expected to occur at the nearshore area of the westwave site acknowledgment this material is based upon works supported by science foundation ireland under grant no 12 rc

23059,the exploitation of wave energy using arrays of wave energy converters wec which contain a large number of devices could have significant impact on the wave climate in the nearshore region this research investigates the impact of wec arrays at the westwave demonstration commercial site which is located on the west coast of ireland the methodology involves the determination of an appropriate transmission coefficient ct from a computational fluid dynamic cfd model of a numerical wave tank nwt simulation using ansys cfx and the subsequent implementation of wec arrays using swan version 41 01 within this analysis the ct value from the cfd nwt model was used in swan to represent wec arrays which are treated as obstacles hence a nested local wave model at the westwave site have been developed and validated for the period of december 2015 in order to accommodate the simulation of wec arrays three array configurations which contain 12 wecs single row two row arrays and three row arrays have been simulated and analysed to estimate the impact to the wave conditions at the nearshore area while also considering the effect of array configuration on power captured the results of the analysis suggest there is minor impact on the nearshore wave climate for all the scenarios where the reduction in wave height and wave power was below 1 at a distance of between 1 and 3 km from the shoreline at water depths varying from 20 to 60 m at a distance of 100 300 m from the shoreline at a water depth of approximately 10 m and below a decrease in wave height and wave power of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively was observed in addition the methodology can also be applied to other types of wec and study areas depending on the purpose of the project keywords westwave wave energy test site wec arrays nearshore impact numerical wave models wave climate 1 introduction a major potential for ocean wave energy exploitation exists in ireland this is evident with the existence of three wave energy sites for wave energy converters wecs on the west coast of ireland see fig 1 i the ¼ scale galway bay test site gbts in the vicinity of 9 067 w 53 249 n ii the full scale atlantic marine energy test site amets at belmullet 9 991 w 54 225 n and iii the westwave commercial demonstration site located off the coast of county clare 9 52 w 52 775 n additionally there are laboratory scale test facilities in the lir national ocean test facility which is located in cork on ireland s south coast seai 2014a and in six research institutions around ireland which operate as the centre for marine and renewable energy ireland marei marei 2017 the west coast of ireland experiences extremely energetic wave conditions due to its exposed location to the north eastern atlantic ocean where the 12 year annual mean wave power levels are between 30 and 70 kw m atan et al 2016a the wave power levels at the north west and south west of ireland varies from 20 to 100 kw m while off the eastern irish sea and southern coasts ranges between 10 and 50 kw m annually gallagher et al 2016 reguero et al 2015 the westwave site illustrated in fig 1 c is facing directly to the atlantic ocean and receives energetic wave events that travelled miles away across the ocean the 12 year annual mean power at the site was 50 kw m atan et al 2017a it is planned to deploy five wave energy converters wecs by 2018 at the site in a move towards commercialisation of wave power generation seai 2014b however the exploitation of wave energy using arrays of wecs which contain a large number of wecs could have significant impact on the wave climate in the nearshore area hence an analysis of imminent impacts due to the array of wecs should be investigated in order to preserve the natural morphological process at the site this occurs as the extraction of wave energy at an offshore area will decrease the magnitude of wave height and wave power that propagates from deep to shallow water the main aim of this research is to analyse the change of the wave climate in the nearshore area due to arrays of wecs as well as investigate the effects of various configurations for wec arrays on wave energy extraction at the westwave site this required the development of a far field numerical wave model using the simulating waves nearshore swan tudelft 2015a wave modelling software utilising an nesting methodology to replicate wave conditions at the westwave site for a local scale and a computational fluid dynamics cfd near field numerical wave tank nwt model using ansys cfx ansys inc 2013 cfd was chosen to model the near field effects of the wec on the incoming wave as it allows for potentially greater insights particularly when the model is developed further the methodology involves determination of an appropriate transmission coefficient ct from the cfd nwt model which was proceeded with one way coupling into swan to simulate arrays of wecs a single wec or multiple wecs in an array can be modelled in swan and treated as an obstacle line with the existence of a constant ct value millar et al 2007 tudelft 2015b a number of previous studies have implemented this methodology to simulate the impacts of wec arrays on the nearshore wave climate millar et al 2007 rusu and guedes soares 2013 rute bento et al 2014 diaconu and rusu 2013 abanades et al 2014 abanades et al 2015 while array configuration studies were performed using analytical and mathematical algorithm approaches child and venugopal 2010 porter et al 2012 renzi et al 2013 de andrés et al 2014 the ct value used in previous studies of wec impacts using swan millar et al 2007 rusu and guedes soares 2013 rute bento et al 2014 diaconu and rusu 2013 was mainly based on a generic absorption assumption of wec efficiency other studies smith et al 2012 chang et al 2016 o dea et al 2018 have modelled the wec using a frequency dependent energy extraction method where ct varies with sea state while carballo and iglesias 2013 used a ct value was obtained from experimental tests in this research the appropriate ct value was calculated from a cfd nwt model and the value was then used in simulations of wec arrays in swan to investigate the configuration of arrays at real sea states that would have minimum impact on the wave climate at the nearshore area however wec performance is not being examined in this research three arrays of wecs scenarios single row layout two rows layout and three rows layout have been simulated and analysed to measure the impact to the wave conditions at the nearshore area in this paper an overview of the methodology used in the two modelling approaches is presented in section 2 which includes the nwt used to calculate ct for one wave energy convertor and the swan model to investigate the impact of wec arrays the results of arrays of wecs are detailed in section 3 while a discussion from the analyses of ct and arrays of wecs is summarised in section 4 finally the main conclusions from the research are highlighted in section 5 2 materials and methods two modelling approaches have been performed for the purpose of i investigating the impact of wec arrays to the nearshore wave climate and ii analysing the effect of array configuration on power absorbed by the wecs a methodology involved a combination of far field modelling in order to replicate realistic wave conditions at the westwave site and near field modelling which simulates interaction between a wave and structure the swan wave modelling software was used in far field modelling while ansys cfx was applied in near field modelling a nested local wave model at the westwave site was developed from a coarse model resolution at 0 050 fig 1 a identified as the coarse model to a local scale at 0 0270 approximately 300 m fig 1 b identified as the gbts model and subsequently to a scale of 0 000050 approximately 5 m fig 1 c identified as the westwave model the development of the coarse and gbts wave models with model validation is discussed in atan et al 2017b a cfd nwt model was also developed to replicate irregular wave conditions at the site based on a validated cfd nwt model developed at amets finnegan and goggins 2015 using ansys cfx however since measured spectral data was not available at the westwave site spectral data from the westwave swan model were used to regenerate irregular waves that were inputted into the cfd nwt model selected wecs were then included in the cfd nwt model in order to calculate the transmission coefficient ct value which is then used in swan to model a single wec or multiple wecs in arrays finally three array configurations containing 12 wecs single row layout two rows layout and three rows layout were investigated in order to determine the impact of the array on the wave climate in the nearshore area an overview of the methodology utilised in this research for arrays of wecs analysis is shown in fig 2 2 1 nested local swan model at westwave a nested local wave model at the westwave site has been developed to replicate wave conditions at the site using swan version 41 01 with nesting method implementation swan is a third generation wave model that solves action balance equation and takes consideration of wave current interactions the action density spectrum n is equal to the energy density spectrum e divided by the relative frequency σ it is formulated in cartesian coordinates and optionally in spherical coordinates to accommodate small and large oceanic scales based on the area of interest the action balance equation may be written as 1 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ where c x c y c σ a n d c θ are the propagation velocities of the wave energy in spatial and spectral spaces and s is the total source term s is defined in terms of sources and sinks as follows 2 s σ θ s i n σ θ s n l 3 σ θ s n l 4 σ θ s w c σ θ s b f r σ θ s s u r f σ θ where s in σ θ represents atmospheric input to wave generation i e wave growth by wind s nl3 σ θ and s nl4 σ θ are the terms representing nonlinear wave wave interactions three wave and four wave interactions respectively and s wc σ θ s bfr σ θ and s surf σ θ are dissipation terms representing wave decay by white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking respectively the governing equations are solved using finite different schemes two dimensional rectangular grid which are simple robust and economical for application in oceanic waters in the present of an obstacle application to arrays of wecs in this work the action balance equation in curvilinear coordinates solves n as 3 1 δ t d x 1 d x 2 c x i j d y 1 d y 2 c y i j n i j n i j δ t d x 1 c x c t 1 2 n i 1 j d y 1 c y c t 1 2 n i 1 j d x 2 c x c t 2 2 n i j 1 d y 2 c y c t 2 2 n i j 1 s i j where 1 δt d s and ct correspond to the time derivative diffusion coefficient source term of depth induced breaking and transmission coefficient respectively while cx and cy are propagation speeds in geographical space x y tudelft 2015b the obstacles used to represent the wecs are treated as lines running through computational grids where a constant ct value will be applied to the flux between those nodes if and only if a grid point is crossed by an obstacle line tudelft 2015b which therefore causes interruption on waves propagation as a result these obstacles will affect the wave field in three ways such as the wave height of the waves that propagate through or over it will be reduced waves will be reflected and waves will also be diffracted around its corner hence these demonstrate that swan can reasonably account for propagation of waves around an obstacle if the directional spectrum of incoming waves is not too narrow tudelft 2015b moreover as swan solves action balance equation for the conservation of wave energy a representation of arrays of wecs is account for the energy absorbed in the present of ct folley et al 2012 and the impact to the nearshore wave climate can be analysed based on the remaining waves due to the absorption process the main objective of developing the model is to replicate wave conditions at the site and to simulate various wec arrays configuration as well as to investigate the impact of wec arrays on the wave climate in the nearshore area therefore an appropriate model resolution should be used in order to resolve a 10 m width device that was simulated in this work as well as to fit with the obstacle lines setup in swan where it needs to be placed across the computational grids as per described earlier hence the nested local wave model at the westwave site is resolved to a resolution of 0 000050 approximately 5 m and covers the extent of 9 72 x202f w 9 62 w and 52 68n 52 78n see fig 1 c with 2014 2014 grid points in the x axis easting grid and y axis northing grid similar to the two previously developed models at gbts atan et al 2017b and amets atan et al 2016a 2016b the bathymetry data was obtained from infomar datasets at 2 250 m resolution gsi 2013 and the blue kenue software nrc national research council canada nrc 2015 was used to interpolate processed bathymetry datasets in order to generate the 5 m resolution gridded model domain the open boundary conditions were taken from the nested spectral boundary outputs generated by the gbts wave model at 30 x202f min intervals while the nested boundary conditions for the gbts model were supplied from the coarse model the orientation of the model is 0 clockwise in a spherical geometrical coordinate system to ensure all open boundaries are close to 90 for all major in or out flow wave formations with the jonswap spectrum at the open boundaries 72 directions and 38 frequencies logarithmically spaced from 0 03 to 1 1 hz in addition a similar model setup to the gbts wave model was applied at the westwave wave model where janssen wave growth formulation the hasselmann white capping formulation and the jonswap bed friction model were used for white capping the dissipation coefficients used were cds 2 10 5 δ 1 5 and p 4 with the bed friction recommended value of cb 0 038 a summary of the key model settings for the coarse and gbts wave models are detailed in atan et al 2017b as a preliminary assessment to assess the impact of wec arrays at the nearshore wave climate the westwave model was simulated for the one month period of december 2015 the only period for which measured data is available at the site moreover the ultra fine model resolution requires significant computational time and a one month period was deemed sufficient for assessment of impacts furthermore based on the wave climate at the westwave site atan et al 2017a december 2015 period contributes to more energetic waves compared to the other months hence this preliminary assessment is focussing on the analysis during the energetic wave conditions rather than representative wave conditions at the site table 1 shows a summary of validation values against measured data for coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse bias and scatter index si for significant wave height hs and zero up crossing wave period tz energy wave period te measured data was not available the model achieved high accuracy overall with r2 of 0 9 0 8 and 0 7 for hs tz and mwd respectively while the bias values were 0 4 m for hs 0 1s for tz and 70 for mwd table 1 which is also shown in fig 3 thus the model can be used to simulate an array of wecs at the westwave site 2 2 cfd nwt model for transmission coefficient the cfd nwt model used in this study was developed using the finite volume commercial software ansys cfx which uses a solver based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the cfd nwt model was developed based on the methodology developed by finnegan and goggins 2012 and the methodology for generating linear irregular waves in a nwt was based on finnegan and goggins 2015 however as only spectral data was available for the westwave site which was obtained from the swan model it was necessary to use an inverse fourier transform to obtain the inputted wave elevation and associated water particle velocities that was used at the input boundary of the cfd nwt model similar to finnegan and goggins 2015 the cfd nwt model has a height of 100 m which allows for a water depth of 70 m length of 500 m maximum dimension as a result of a limitation in the ansys academic licence and an effectively infinitely wide domain by using a domain width of one element while minimising the solver computational time through the use of two symmetry boundaries specified on the sides a water depth of 70 x202f m was used in the cfd nwt model as this represents deep water conditions based on the linear wave theory of the wave conditions at the two locations analysed in this study as seen in fig 1 the water depth at the wave rider at the westwave site is approximately 70 m and at amets is approximately 100 m the structure used in the model was a single unrestrained floating rectangular prism that was free to heave and pitch which represents a point absorber wec that operates in the heave and pitch motions 2 2 1 the governing equations the method on which the solver in ansys cfx is based on is the finite volume technique ansys inc 2013 this technique divides the region of interest into sub regions and discretises the governing equations in order to solve them iteratively over each sub regions therefore an approximation of the value of each variable at points throughout the domain is achieved the governing equations that need to be solved by the ansys cfx solver are the mass continuity equation which is given as 4 ρ t ρ u 1 x ρ u 2 y 0 and the navier stokes equations which are given as 5 ρ u 1 t u 1 u 1 x u 2 u 1 y p x 2 μ 2 u 1 x 2 y μ u 1 y u 2 x f 1 6 ρ u 2 t u 1 u 2 x u 2 u 2 y p y 2 μ 2 u 2 y 2 x μ u 1 y u 2 x f 2 ρ g where t is time x is the horizontal distance from the wavemaker y is the vertical height from the swl and increases with depth u 1 is the horizontal flow velocity u 2 is the vertical flow velocity f 1 is the body force on the fluid in the horizontal direction f 2 ρ g is the body force on the fluid in the vertical direction p is pressure and μ is viscosity in order to determine the position of the free surface or air water boundary the volume of fluid method is applied this technique was also employed by liang et al hirt and nichols 1981 liang et al 2010 this method adds another governing equation given by 7 q i t u 1 q i x u 2 q i y 0 i 1 2 where q i is the volume fraction of the fluid i with i 1 2 q i 1 where 1 denotes air and 2 denoting water the free surface is then approximated as at the position of the minimum of value q 1 q 2 along the model 2 2 2 estimation of transmission coefficient the transmission coefficient ct was estimated using the methodology described in gadelho et al 2014 where 8 c t h s t h s i where hs i is the incident significant wave height and hs t is the transmitted significant wave height therefore it was necessary to run each model configuration twice the first run was in the absence of the structure in order to accurately determine the modelled incident wave elevation which allows for the calculation of hs i the second run included the structure in order to determine reflected and transmitted waves which allows for the calculation of hs t in total 12 configurations at two locations amets and westwave were modelled in order to estimate the transmission coefficient which range from 0 76 to 0 91 two geometries for the rectangular prism width of 30 m and submerged draft of 15 m and width of 10 m and submerged draft of 10 m were explored in order to determine a suitable ct value however when implementing the ct into swan model only the results for the smaller prism were used as they are of more suitable scale to a point absorber wec a summary detailing each of the cfd model arrangements and results are presented in table 2 and fig 4 from the results of the analysis presented in table 2 it is evident that smaller wecs have a higher ct value as they have less of an effect on the waves fig 4 displays the range of ct values 0 86 0 91 that were observed in the cfd analysis it is evident from fig 4 a that in general there is an increase in ct as both hs and te get larger and therefore there is a general increase in ct when wave power increase which can be seen in fig 4 b the hs and te have been calculated by performing a fast fourier transform of each wave record being analysed in order to vary both the hs and te a number of wave records from throughout the month of december 2015 have been used however it should be noted that the dataset is not large enough to definitively confirm this hypothesis and further investigation is required for the purpose of this study as the range of ct values 0 86 0 91 is quite narrow it was decided to use a constant ct value 0 86 which explores the effects of the worst case scenario and reduces the computational effort while remaining quiet accurate given the small variation in ct values for the simulated wec tt was concluded that the additional work involved in implementing a frequency dependant solution within swan for estimating the ct would not yield significantly more accurate results 2 3 wec arrays in swan a single wec in swan can be represented as an obstacle with a constant ct value millar et al 2007 folley et al 2012 and a series of obstacles therefore signifies multiple wecs in an array as described in millar millar et al 2007 the energy that will be absorbed by the wecs varies depending on the energy transmission percentage an energy transmission percentage of 0 indicates a complete absorption which is unlikely to be achieved 70 refers to highly efficient wecs which would be probably too optimistic to be attained 90 represents lower efficiency which is more achievable in reality and 40 suggest very highly efficient wec which is extremely unrealistic the obstacle is treated as a line in swan in a set of two points or a series of points running through computational grids with an appropriate ct value depending on wec types furthermore the obstacle line should be placed appropriately depending on a size of a wec to be modelled however for a wec that is sensitive to dominant wave directions drew et al 2009 falcão 2010 the obstacle line placement should be properly oriented or perpendicular to the dominant incoming wave directions at a site for the westwave site the dominant wave directions in december 2015 were coming from west and south west direction to the true north observed from a wave rose plot of hs and te against mwd shown in fig 3 b1 b2 respectively thus the obstacle lines in the model were set up perpendicular 900 clockwise off to the 00 model orientation to the incoming dominant wave directions in order to capitalise on the available energy for absorption in addition any incoming waves that run though the obstacle lines will also be absorbed by the model tudelft 2015b folley et al 2012 fig 3 b3 shows a wave rose plot between hs and mwd where the dominant wave direction were from west south west and north west at westwave which was retrieved from the developed gbts wave model atan et al 2017b for a 12 years period therefore it is justified that the perpendicular obstacle line setup at the westwave site should be able to capture most of the available energy at different periods of the year if such investigation is require to be analysed in the future for the purpose of investigating the impact of an array of wecs to the nearshore wave climate a small wec with 10 m width d was considered in this research babarit et al 2011 hence the selection of the ct values to be used in the obstacle lines setup in swan was based on the 10 m width wec only based on table 2 the lowest ct value of 0 86 was selected as the representative value due to its highest energy absorption rate compared to the other values for the 10 m width device which therefore signifies a conservative approach consideration a constant ct value of 0 86 was assigned in the obstacles lines setup in swan to simulate a single wec and multiple wecs in arrays in addition the wecs were modelled to absorb all the incoming waves and as such reflection and diffraction were not accounted in this research similar to the methodology applied in chang et al 2016 and carballo and iglesias 2013 table 3 shows 24 cases used when simulating wec arrays from a single wec case a1 to 12 devices in single two and three rows case d1 d3 as the final scenarios to investigate the impact to the nearshore wave climate for a one week period of the 1 7 december 2015 as a preliminary assessment the initial case a1 was first simulated with a single wec located near to the westwave station in order to observe the change in wave formation with the existence of the wec in the model an array with two wecs in a single row configuration with a vertical spacing ranging from 20 m 2d to 400 m 40d between wecs edge to edge was then simulated and analysed case a2 a8 in table 3 next a third wec was placed in a second row midway between the two wecs in the first row at a fixed distance of 50 m 5d perpendicular to the axis that joins the devices in the first row to avoid interaction effects between wecs stratigaki et al 2014 verbrugghe et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 5 cases b1 b6 b8 a similar approach was used to identify the placement of a fourth wec in the third row the final configurations of wec arrays to model 12 wecs in single two and three rows indicated as cases d1 d2 and d3 was determined based on case a6 b5 and c3 respectively a detailed analysis to investigate which of these configurations of wec arrays has the least impact to the nearshore wave climate is discussed in the next section 3 results in this section model results are presented based on 24 simulated scenarios which are summarised in table 3 the results were analysed based on one week simulation to investigate the configuration of wec arrays that will minimise the impact of the arrays on the nearshore wave climate while maximising wave power extraction specially 12 wecs in arrays were simulated such as 12 wecs in single row 12 wecs in two rows and 12 wecs in three rows see table 3 case d1 d3 an analysis of wave power and energy absorption is detailed in section 3 1 for a single wec while section 3 3 presents an investigation of wec spacing section 3 3 discusses the impact of wec arrays to the nearshore wave climate resulted from case d1 d3 and finally an analysis of the effect of array configuration on power captured is detailed in section 3 4 3 1 power and energy of wecs the ct value of 0 86 from the 10 m width wec was used to represent a single wec and subsequently multiple wecs in arrays using swan similar to the methodology in the previous studies millar et al 2007 rusu and guedes soares 2013 rute bento et al 2014 diaconu and rusu 2013 an analysis of a single wec was carried out based on case a1 table 3 where the wec was placed in the swan model close to the location of the wave measurement buoy at the westwave site a percentage change in mean significant wave height hs and mean wave power p was calculated based on equation 9 9 δ h s or p baseline case baseline 100 the total absorbed energy is assumed to be the difference between the total available energy and the total remaining energy 10 total absorbed energy total available energy total remaining energy the wave power at the site was calculated based on the deep water power equation of the linear wave theory demirbilek and vincent 2008 which assumes for deep water that d λ 1 2 d water depth 70 m λ mean wavelength 125 m for december 2015 and is given by cornett 2008 11 p 0 49 h s 2 t e where p is the wave power per unit width of wave crest kw m of a regular sea state at westwave fig 6 shows bi variate scatter plots of hs versus te for case a1 for a one week period with the energy contribution and wave power isolines for both the available energy and remaining energy the wave power isolines were obtained using the methodology developed in atan et al 2016c where the 90th and 99th quantiles were defined as operational e g average and extreme wave conditions respectively while additional information of the 25 50 and 70th quantiles were also presented the total available and absorbed energy from a single wec case a1 was 30 4mwhr m and 9 2mwhr m respectively as shown in fig 7 a fig 7 b and c illustrates the percentage change in mean hs δhs and mean p δp the δhs was between 12 and 17 at the grids where the wec is located fig 7 b while the corresponding value of δp was 25 30 fig 7 c the predominant wave direction varies between 240 and 270 during december 2015 see fig 3 therefore it is observed that the change in mean hs δhs was greater than 5 up to 50 m in the eastern direction from the wec location i e in the direction the incoming waves are travelling while in the orthogonal direction the corresponding distance was 5 20 m from the wec the higher value being in the northern direction due to the incoming wave direction as can be seen from fig 7 c a wider spread is observed in the percentage changes in mean p δp plot 3 2 investigation of device spacing and array configuration based on the case a1 analysis 7 cases case a2 a8 of two wecs in a row in the north south direction with different spacing varying from 20 to 400 m between wecs table 3 were simulated this was performed in order to determine their impact on the water waves and to determine the position of subsequent rows of wecs including the placement of a third wec in the second row when examining more than one row of wecs a fixed horizontal spacing between rows of wecs of 50 m has been assumed fig 8 a1 a5 shows an up close view of δhs while fig 8 b1 b5 shows the analysis of δp for case a2 to a8 based on fig 8 it is identified that a larger space between wecs signifies wider isolated grids with lower δhs and δp values compared to wecs that were close to each other for example in case a2 the remaining available energy to be absorbed for the third wec in the second row was lower 1 83 mwhr m than a case with a wider space between wecs such as in case a6 6 5 mwhr m this can be observed based on the δhs and δp values in fig 8 where higher values indicate a greater decrease in hs and p while lower values define a lower decrease in hs and p the spacing of the wecs in the second row of wecs has been simulated in cases b1 to b7 and the results of the simulations have been presented in fig 9 a in each case the wec in the second row was placed in the middle of the two wecs in the first row where the spacing in the north south direction i e orthogonal direction to the dominant incoming wave direction between two devices in the first row is illustrated in fig 5 fig 9 a shows the total available and absorbed energy at the third device in the second row for case b1 b7 as expected case b5 shows the highest absorbed energy of 6 5 mwhr m at the third device location due to the lowest δhs and δp values compared to case b1 b4 which was calculated in case a6 for case b6 b7 the total available energy are similar with case b5 while the total absorbed energy is slightly higher 6 9 mwhr m compared to case b5 due to a larger spacing between wecs fig 9 b and c shows an up close view plot of δhs for case b1 and b5 which shows that case b1 contributes to a higher decrease in hs δhs 4 at the location of the wec in the second row compared to b5 this justified the lowest total absorbed energy of 1 83 mwhr m at the third wec compared to the other cases b2 b7 due to the close space between the two wecs in the first row which affected the available energy to be absorbed by the wec in the second row a similar approach was applied for the placement of a wec in the third row of an array in order to facilitate a third row additional cases with two rows case b8 and b9 were examined which include an additional spacing in the east west direction i e dominant incoming wave direction of 100 m fig 10 shows analysis plots of δhs and δp for case b6 to b9 which summarised that a wider spacing in both the dominate wave direction and the orthogonal direction between wecs contribute a larger space of grids with a lower decrease in hs and p this may be suitable for the placement of the wec in the third row however a larger spacing between devices will lead to higher maintenance cost therefore a smaller vertical spacing of 50 m such as in case b6 and b7 were selected to further investigate the third row case case c1 c4 were developed and analysed in order to determine the wec arrays configuration for 4 wecs in three rows where a detailed configuration is tabulated in table 3 the total available and absorbed energy at the fourth device from case c1 c4 was calculated using the same method in case b1 b5 and is presented in fig 11 a in this analysis case c1 and c2 show lower total absorbed energy compared to case c3 and c4 due to higher decreased in hs at the fourth wec location as seen in fig 11 b1 b2 in contrast case c3 and c4 show a similar total absorbed energy at the fourth wec however case c3 was selected as the preferable configuration for four devices in three rows due to its smaller horizontal spacing compared to case c4 while retaining a similar level of absorbed energy 3 3 environmental impact area of wec arrays in order to examine the environmental impact area of an array of wecs on the wave climate at the nearshore area at the westwave site an analysis based on cases d1 d2 and d3 see table 3 was performed in these cases 12 wecs were located approximately 8 km from the shoreline at the westwave site and modelled in single two and three rows fig 12 a shows mean hs values for the baseline i e no wave farm while fig 12 b c d shows δhs for cases d1 d3 with contours depth of 10 70 m covering the model domain based on fig 12 the changes in mean hs values at the nearshore area for all cases was very small compared to the baseline case which is evident from the δhs plots the decrease in mean hs for all cases at 10 m depth and below approximately 100 300 m from a shoreline was less than 0 1 while at 20 40 m depth approximately 800 m 1 km from shoreline and 50 60 m depth which is approximately more than 1 km stretch from the shoreline this was less than 0 2 and between 0 2 and 0 4 respectively this shows that hs experienced a very minor reduction at the nearshore area with δhs between 0 1 and 0 4 for all cases and therefore should not lead to a major change to the coastal morphological processes at the nearshore area a similar impact in mean p is also observed for these three cases shown in fig 13 as expected a lower reduction in mean p occurred at the nearshore area which encompasses 10 m depth and below δp 0 2 for all cases a slight decrease in mean p was measured at 20 40 m depth with δp between 0 2 and 0 6 while at 50 60 m depth mean p decreased by up to 0 8 detailed plots of δp for cases d1 d2 and d3 are presented in fig 13 b c d respectively based on fig 13 it is determined that mean p decreased towards the nearshore area with a minor reduction that should not have a significant impact on the wave climate at the nearshore area overall the impact of the wec arrays to the nearshore wave climate is not prevalent based on a very small reduction in hs and p which was below 1 at a distance between 1 and 3 km from the shore while the lowest percentage was closed to 0 at 10 m depth and below approximately 100 x202f m from the shore hence it can be concluded that each scenario of case d1 d2 and d3 entails minimum impact to the nearshore wave climate contrarily case d1 shows the highest area of δp at 1 and above see table 4 compared to the other cases but this area existed at 60 70 m water depth approximately 5 km from the shore see fig 13 b which again does not effected the wave climate at the nearshore area and this is also similar to the area in case d2 and d3 see fig 13 c and d however a further investigation should be conducted in the future to inspect coastal morphological processes such as sedimentation and erosion which could occur simultaneously due to the change of wave formation and propagation with the existence of a wave farm gonzález santamaría et al 2012 for example a sediment transport model such as xbeach roelvink et al 2010 delft3d roelvink and banning 1994 and roms warner et al 2008 can be coupled with swan for sediment transport studies 3 3 1 effect of array configuration on power capture for 12 wecs the results of the analysis performed in section 3 2 have been used to inform the configuration for an array of 12 wecs in single two and three rows since the predominant wave direction of the incoming waves is perpendicular to the configuration of the arrays and the spacing between devices in each row is assumed to be large enough where radiation affects are negligible there is no interference between adjacent wecs therefore for 12 wecs in a single row since there is no interference between adjacent wecs and a minimum distance between wecs can be used is the configuration that is most optimum in terms of total power capture however there are other aspects that should be considered including mooring points and a central hub for power transfer to the shore and these may suggest that deploying wecs in arrays with multiple rows may be ultimately more efficient additionally each wec in the first row of each array acts similar to wecs deployed in a single row as they absorb the maximum amount of energy for an array of 12 wecs in two rows the total power absorbed mw as it varies with the orthogonal array width is presented in fig 14 a and the power per array width kw m and the power per array area kw m2 are presented in fig 14 b it is clear to see from these figures fig 14 a and b that as total power absorbed increases the power per array width decreases therefore it is necessary for developers to take into account the available array width when selecting the optimum spacing if using the configuration with two rows other considerations and influences on array efficiency have been included in table 4 for a selected two row configuration which has a spacing based on case b5 and is described in table 3 as case d2 for an array of 12 wecs in three rows the total power absorbed mw as it varies with the orthogonal array width is presented in fig 15 a and the power per array width kw m and the power per array area kw m2 are presented in fig 15 b similar to the case for an array with two rows of wecs the total power absorbed increases as the power per array width decreases therefore the same trade off exists for developers when selecting the optimum spacing if using the configuration with three rows again additional considerations and influences for optimum array efficiency have been included in table 4 for a selected array of 12 wecs in three rows which is based on the spacing of case c3 and is described in table 3 as case d3 4 discussion the methodology introduced in this paper which investigates the impact of arrays of wecs on the wave climate in the nearshore area delivers useful information to potential developers on wave farm planning and development furthermore the total absorbed energy should also provide a preliminary estimation of the total energy that could be extracted at the site depending on device types and simulation period however a larger device potentially contributes to a greater impact on the nearshore wave climate compared to a smaller device due to its size and array configuration spacing thus these factors should be considered in a wave farm development in order to avoid disruption to coastal morphological processes at the local shoreline 4 1 transmission coefficient ct ct values were estimated using a cfd nwt model described in section 2 2 and the results are presented for 8 different configurations in table 2 based on these 8 configurations the average value for ct was found to be 0 84 which ranged from 0 76 to 0 9 it is evident from the results that variations in ct values are dependent on the overall size of the structure i e smaller structures have a larger associated ct value however in this analysis a value of ct of 0 86 is taken as a 10 m structure has been used to represent a wec within the swan model as the structure used in the present study is an unrestrained structure the ct value of 0 86 is larger than those used by carballo and iglesias 2013 ct of 0 776 and 0 756 which were obtained from experimental wave tank testing of a scale model wec however the value of 0 86 is in line with the value used in the wec array analysis of rute bento et al 2014 where 0 9 is defined as a realistic scenario a spaced or low energy absorber wec array and 0 7 is defined as an optimistic scenario a narrow spaced or average energy absorber wec array nevertheless for future studies it would be beneficial to use a structure that was restrained by a mooring and power take off system to more accurately model the effect of wecs furthermore advancing the model to a full 3 d simulation and modelling a working or prototype wec similar to carballo and iglesias 2013 would yield more accurate and relevant results the presented cfd nwt model is developed using ansys cfx which is restricted with an academic license therefore it may be beneficial to using an unrestricted open source cfd software such as openfoam jasak 2009 in order to explore the affects using a larger domain which would permit the modelling of two or more inline structures 4 2 wec array analyses wec array configurations in single two and three rows have been explored when examining the interference between wecs the percentage difference in the reduction of hs and pas detailed in section 3 has been included the spacing for the optimum array configuration for 12 wecs in single row is the minimum specified distance between wecs which is assumed as 20 m in this study as a result of the wave direction being orthogonal to the wec array configuration a single row of devices with minimum spacing is the optimum array configuration in terms of absorbing the maximum total power a configuration of closely spaced arrays for 12 devices in three rows as per case c1 contributes to higher reduction in hs and p which then caused a lower total absorbed energy compared to an array with wecs more sparsely spaced as in case c4 however the sparse configuration could lead to higher installation and maintenance cost and therefore the operational cost should be considered in the optimum arrays configuration selection for wec arrays in two and three rows the total power absorbed and the power per array width and the power per array area as it varies with the orthogonal array width has been compared in both cases it is evident that as total power absorbed increases the power per array width decreases therefore based on this study it is necessary for developers to take into account the available array width when selecting the optimum spacing and configuration other considerations and influences on array efficiency have been included for 3 selected array configurations of 12 wecs for developers reference similar to the methodology in chang et al 2016 and carbalo and iglesias 2013 a reflection between waves and wecs was not taken into consideration and this limitation should also be accessed when modelling the wake of the structure hence if the reflection is required to be analysed a reflection setup can be activated in swan where either specular reflection when the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence or diffuse reflection a case when the incident waves are scattered over reflected direction may be considered tudelft 2015b tudelft 2015c similar to ct a reflection coefficient cr can be calculated from the cfd nwt model using the approach in gadelho et al 2014 furthermore a scenario in which the wecs in the first row act as a barrier in order to protect wecs in the rows behind it during extreme conditions can also be investigated in the future when integrating a combination of ct and cr using swan it is also noted that in swan a diffraction approximation does not properly capture diffraction in front of reflecting obstacles or in harbours and often converges poorly or not at all without proper considerations tudelft 2015b tudelft 2015c hence diffraction in wec arrays simulation in swan in the present work was not allowed similar to the methodology in chang et al 2016 carbalo and iglesias 2013 and rute bento et al 2014 an alternative approach of a phase decoupled refraction diffraction approximation tudelft 2015c can be implemented in swan if the diffraction is required to be investigated diaconu and rusu 2013 the latest swan version 40 10a has implemented additional options to specify frequency and direction dependent transmission coefficients to be applied to an obstacle this option could be used in an array of wecs simulation which takes into account a different ct value for each of spectral frequency band considered folley et al 2012 in addition the developed snl swan sandia national laboratories swan model ruehl et al 2013 porter et al 2014 has implemented several obstacle options to model wec arrays that takes into account device performance subjected to wec power matrix and wec relative capture width rcw at each frequency bin depending on wec types chang et al 2016 babarit 2015 the wec power matrix and rcw to be used in snl swan can be calculated using an open source boundary element method code called nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 therefore a further investigation using swan version 41 10a and snl swan will be progressed in the future as well as progressing the cfd nwt model to calculate wec power matrix to be used in snl swan another important aspect in a wave farm study is environmental impact assessment eia where a proposed wave farm should be screened for an eia due to the uncertainty effect to the environment o hagan et al 2016 depending on devices classification define as onshore devices intermediate water devices and offshore devices margheritini et al 2012 as the focus of this present study is the impact of arrays of wecs on the nearshore wave climate only the effect on coastal processes was evaluated a proposed wave farm location using offshore devices in this research is located at 8 km from the westwave site s shoreline which meets the distance from a shore requirement for offshore devices where the location should be further than 5 km from the shore as per detailed in an eia scoping in margheritini et al 2012 based on this requirement distance it is also expected that only a minor impact to coastal morphological processes will occur and it is proven that a very minor reduction in hs and p was observed in this study especially at the nearshore area for three scenarios with 12 wecs in arrays case d1 d2 and d3 hence a very minor change or small obstruction impacts in coastal morphological processes is expected to take place at the nearshore area of the westwave site however a further study on morphological processes such as sedimentation and erosion should be conducted to investigate these phenomena where the change in coastal morphological processes can be performed in the future using a sediment transport model such as xbeach roms and delft3d that can be coupled with swan 5 conclusions a detailed methodology of coupling a near field cfd nwt model using ans cfx and a far field wave model using swan in wave farm modelling to investigate the impact of arrays of wecs on the nearshore wave climate at westwave site is presented the cfd nwt model was developed based on the methodology in finnegan and goggins 2015 while the nested local model using swan was developed based on two developed models described in atan et al 2017b the ct value calculated from the cfd nwt model using the approach in gadelho et al 2014 was then applied to the obstacle lines setup in swan to represent multiple wecs in arrays three wec arrays configuration for 12 wecs in single two and three rows case d1 d2 and d3 were simulated where the impact of the arrays of wecs to the nearshore wave climate was analysed and the effect of array configuration was also investigated the methodology could be expanded for multiple wecs in multiple rows depending on wec types and project requirements as well as the site location the following are the main conclusions drawn from the research the ct value of 0 86 was used a constant transmission in the obstacle lines setup to represent single and multiple wecs with 10 m width using swan version 41 01 the obstacle lines were oriented at 900 clockwise off to the 00 model orientation which is perpendicular to the dominant incoming wave directions in order to fully absorb the available energy at the site it is recommended to orientate the obstacle lines depending on the dominant wave directions similar to this study based on case d1 d2 and d3 a very minor reduction in means hs δhs 0 1 and means p δp 0 2 was observed at the nearshore area which is approximately 100 300 m from the shoreline at 10 m depth and below while at a distance between 1 and 3 km from the shoreline δhs and δp was below than 1 for varying water depth of 20 60 m overall the wec arrays impact to the nearshore wave climate for all cases is not significant based on a very small reduction in hs and p this illustrates the environmental benefits of using smaller 10 m wecs rather than some of the current wecs greater than 30 m in width which are striving for commercial viability a limitation in wec arrays modelling such as a reflection and diffraction as well as device performance at each frequency bin has been discussed and a further investigation will be conducted in the future using swan version 41 10a and snl swan eia screening on the wec arrays impact to the nearshore wave climate depending on devices classification onshore intermediate water and offshore devices should be evaluated in order to investigate an obstruction level to coastal morphological processes this requirement was examined in this research and a very minor impediment impact in coastal morphological processes is expected to occur at the nearshore area of the westwave site acknowledgment this material is based upon works supported by science foundation ireland under grant no 12 rc
