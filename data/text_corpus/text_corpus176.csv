880,it is well known that relative permeabilities can depend on the flow configuration and they are commonly lower during counter current flow as compared to co current flow conventional models must deal with this by manually changing the relative permeability curves depending on the observed flow regime in this paper we use a novel two phase momentum equation approach based on general mixture theory to generate effective relative permeabilities where this dependence and others is automatically captured in particular this formulation includes two viscous coupling effects i viscous drag between the flowing phases and the stagnant porous rock ii viscous drag caused by momentum transfer between the flowing phases the resulting generalized model will predict that during co current flow the faster moving fluid accelerates the slow fluid but is itself decelerated while for counter current flow they are both decelerated the implications of these mechanisms are demonstrated by investigating recovery of oil from a matrix block surrounded by water due to a combination of gravity drainage and spontaneous imbibition a situation highly relevant for naturally fractured reservoirs we implement relative permeability data obtained experimentally through co current flooding experiments and then explore the model behavior for different flow cases ranging from counter current dominated to co current dominated in particular it is demonstrated how the proposed model seems to offer some possible interesting improvements over conventional modeling by providing generalized

conventional modeling of two phase flow in porous media is based on darcy s extended law which was originally developed empirically for single phase flow darcy 1856 rose 2000 and extended to multiphase flow by incorporation of relative permeabilities muskat et al 2013 the relative permeability is commonly assumed to be a function of saturation only implying that the presence of another phase has a unique impact on the phase s flux i e no coupling is accounted for through the velocity or pressure gradient of the other phase several experimental observations however indicate that the flow mode co or counter current can have a more or less strong impact on the phase mobilities previous studies of counter current flow settings see below for more details support that relative permeability in a counter current flow setting can be significantly lower than in co current flow settings in conventional simulation tools the dependence of the saturation functions i e relative permeability and capillary pressure on the flow direction co current or counter current and phase velocities is commonly ignored this indicates that the use of the extended darcy s law may be questionable 1 1 previous works on coupled multiphase flow fluid fluid interactions referred to herein as viscous coupling can play a significant role related to two phase flow in porous media yuster 1951 was the first to mention such phenomena by theoretical analysis of two phase flow in capillary tubes where he derived that relative permeability should not only be a function of saturation but also of viscosity ratio researchers have proposed that relative permeabilities depend on saturations capillary number and viscosity ratio between two fluids avraam and payatakes 1995a ehrlich 1993 and on how the fluids flow relative to each other bentsen and manai 1992 bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 momentum transfer due to differences in interstitial velocities induces acceleration of the slower and deceleration of the faster moving fluid if the fluids are moving co currently deceleration of both fluid velocities will occur if they are moving counter currently ayodele 2006 babchin et al 2006 bentsen and manai 1993 dullien and dong 1996 li et al 2004 hence the extent of fluid fluid interaction and the flow mode is significantly impacting fluid mobilities and relative permeabilities there are several theoretical approaches aiming at developing generalized models that account for viscous coupling effects an effort to extend the single phase darcy s law to multiphase flow was made by de la cruz and spanos 1983 who derived theoretically darcy s empirical extended law by applying the method of volume averaging to stokes equation kalaydjian 1987 1990 developed flow equations using the concepts of irreversible thermodynamics from a macroscopic understanding of two phase flow in porous media moreover a number of researchers tried to gain insight into how two immiscible phases flow through a porous medium by using simple analogous models such as tubular flow bacri et al 1990 yuster 1951 common for such generalized models the flux of each phase is a function of both phases pressure gradients and it therefore contains four generalized coefficients diagonal and cross term mobilities which are referred to as generalized mobilities avraam and payatakes 1995b measured such cross terms experimentally in 2 d micro models vs wetting phase saturation in steady state co current flow of water and oil they concluded that coupling is important over broad ranges of wetting phase saturation capillary number and viscosity ratio dullien and dong 1996 likewise measured cross terms in two phase flow in sand packs using a fluid system with viscosity ratio of unity the value of the cross terms ranged from 10 to 35 of the value of the effective permeability to water and from 5 to 15 of the effective permeability to oil respectively langaas and papatzacos 2001 used the lattice boltzmann lb approach to investigate viscous coupling and concluded that co current relative permeabilities always are larger than the corresponding counter current curves caused partly by viscous coupling and different levels of capillary forces li et al 2005 also used lb to investigate viscous coupling and they concluded that their model was able to capture main experimental effects normally interpreted as caused by this effect they also concluded that the interfacial area between the fluids is a key variable for understanding of multiphase flow and hence relative permeability functions when two immiscible fluids are flowing through porous media 1 2 objectives of this work the main objective of this work is to explore how to develop a model that naturally can account for viscous coupling effects i e fluid fluid interaction by applying the theory of mixtures lemon et al 2006 rajagopal 2007 rajagopal and tao 1995 schuff et al 2013 in this formulation each phase momentum balance equation is a function of both fluid velocities more precisely based on a two fluid stokes type of formulation for creeping flow we derive generalized mobility functions that are sensitive to both solid fluid interaction as well as fluid fluid interaction in other words the obtained mobility functions automatically include terms that sense contributions from the counter current flow and other terms that sense contributions from the co current flow in particular the mobility functions ensure that for co current flow the fluid with highest speed decelerates whereas the slower fluid is accelerated for counter current flow both fluids will experience a reduced velocity depending on the strength of the fluid fluid interaction a first presentation of this idea was given in standnes et al 2017 the model studied in that work was simplified in the sense that no impact of gravity forces and capillary pressure was accounted for in the final expressions it was also used for steady state investigations only the potential usefulness of the proposed generalized model is illustrated by studying a specific example with an oil saturated matrix block submerged in water where the resulting flow involves a rather delicate balance between counter current and co current flow depending on the relative strength of capillary pressure driven flow spontaneous imbibition and gravity driven spontaneous imbibition is regarded as a key driving mechanism for oil production in naturally fractured water wet reservoirs andersen et al 2014 mason and morrow 2013 this process is featured by water imbibing spontaneously into the matrix blocks by capillary forces simultaneously expelling oil to the surrounding fracture system either counter currently if the matrix blocks are totally submerged in water or in a co current flow mode if parts of the blocks are covered by oil andersen et al 2017a hence the rate of imbibition is determined by the capillary forces and the corresponding fluid mobilities which are strong functions of the flow mode co versus counter current flow an important aspect of the imbibition process is the fact that capillary forces decrease rapidly when the water saturation increases implying that gravity forces under such conditions no longer can be ignored and will have significant impact on fluid saturation distribution and flow of oil and water viscous coupling effects can thus potentially have important implications and modeling advantages for the understanding of two phase flow in this context both since i relative permeabilities are always measured co currently in the laboratory and counter current flow can thus behave differently than predicted from those measurements and ii since a dynamic variation can occur regarding the magnitude of co versus counter current flow in a conventional model this case would be challenging to deal with because regions with different flow behavior co current and counter current must be identified and then corresponding relative permeability functions assigned manually as an example of such implementation an interesting recent study of viscous coupling effects in a three phase setting is found in sherafati and jessen 2017 the authors investigated the impact of mobility changes due to flow reversals from co current to counter current flow on the displacement performance of water alternating gas wag injection processes their method consists of switching between using co current relative permeability functions and counter current depending on a criterion that classifies flow either as co or counter current with the proposed generalized model of this paper one set of parameters could potentially describe all such flow combinations dynamically the presented generalized model further has the advantage of accounting for the effect of fluid viscosities on relative permeabilites and imbibition rates standnes and andersen 2017 standnes et al 2017 it seems appropriate to mention here another related direction where researchers have proposed alternatives to darcy type formulations in order to remedy some of the shortcomings of classical multiphase extension of darcy s law the hassanizadeh gray model hassanizadeh and gray 1993 and the barenblatt model barenblatt and vinnichenko 1980 both suggest to include non equilibrium effects in capillary pressure and or relative permeability functions we refer to juanes 2008 silin and patzek 2004 for a comprehensive overview of different works where these ideas have been implemented and tested there is a similarity between the barenblatt approach and the use of the more general momentum balance equations we suggest in the sense that experimentally obtained flow functions like relative permeability are process dependent in order to account for this non equilibrium effect the barenblatt approach consists of introducing an additional variable s w e effective water saturation and an additional equation which describes the difference between the actual water saturation sw and the effective s w e in terms of a time dependent but non specific process capillary pressure and relative permeability curves are then expressed in terms of the effective saturation s w e the current manuscript focuses more on one specific effect that will make relative permeability functions process dependent namely the fluid fluid interaction effect drag force effect between the flowing phases for a proper demonstration of properties of the generalized model proposed in this manuscript the behavior of the model is compared against results obtained from a conventional two phase modeling which relies on standard darcy s extended law the model is parameterized using experimental results from the literature where viscous coupling could be quantified in particular co currently measured relative permeability curves from the literature are implemented and experimental data of counter current spontaneous imbibition from the same rock fluid system is history matched we demonstrate the model for three different cases 1 a co current dominated flow mode where oil is mainly displaced upwards by water in the water surrounded system due to dominant gravity forces i e buoyancy 2 a counter current dominated flow mode where dominant capillary forces induce counter current spontaneous imbibition symmetrically from all sides which are open to water phase and 3 a case where gravity and capillary forces have similar magnitude the paper is organized in the following way in section 2 we derive the relevant mathematical models used to represent the gravity drainage spontaneous imbibition controlled flow system we are interested in i first using the conventional darcy law approach ii then with momentum balance equations that account for viscous coupling in section 3 we give a compact summary of these two models for the readers convenience together with a brief description of the solution algorithm in section 4 using representative input data we carefully consider the model behavior at different degrees of capillary and gravity dominated flow regimes the two modeling approaches are compared and discussed conclusions are given in section 5 2 theory 2 1 geometry the system we consider is a matrix block surrounded by water fig 1 representative of the state below the water level in a naturally fractured reservoir during water injection or an amott test in the laboratory for simplicity only 1 d flow is considered along the vertical axis the mechanisms at work are spontaneous imbibition and gravity drainage no forced displacement is considered 2 2 conventional 1 d model based on darcy s law transport equations for incompressible and immiscible phases oil o and water w in a 1 d porous media are given by 1 t ϕ s i x u i i w o where ϕ is porosity si is phase saturation and ui is the flux darcy velocity of each phase i o w a 1 d system is considered along the vertical axis denoted x positive direction downwards darcy s law in such a 1 d vertical system is given by 2 u i k k r i μ i x p i ρ i g i w o where k is the absolute permeability pi is phase pressure g 9 8 m s2 is the acceleration of gravity and kri ρi and μi are phase relative permeability density and viscosity respectively the phase pressures are dependent due to the capillary pressure function p o p w p c also we introduce the total darcy velocity ut as follows 3 u t u w u o λ o x p c λ t x p w λ o ρ o λ w ρ w g where the mobilities λi λt are defined as 4 λ i k k r i μ i i w o λ t λ w λ o it follows from adding the conservation laws 1 that 5 x u t 0 solving 3 with respect to x pw and inserting this into 2 the water velocity can be expressed in the following form 6 u w f w u t f w λ o δ ρ g f w λ o x p c therefore the water transport equation becomes 7 t ϕ s w x f w u t f w λ o δ ρ g x f w λ o x p c x 0 h where f w λ w λ t is the water fractional flow function and δ ρ ρ w ρ o note that the rhs of 7 is expressed in terms of an advective gravitational term and a capillary diffusion term respectively remark 2 1 note that ut represents co current flow through the system its numerical value depends on an interplay of pressure gradients gravity and boundary conditions see 3 in this work ut results from buoyancy i e gravity effects as no applied pressure driving force is considered if different phases are simultaneously present at the matrix boundaries ut can also result from spontaneous imbibition andersen et al 2017a ut is one of the unknowns in the system but is found from 3 after applying x and combining with 5 this gives an elliptic equation for pw which can be solved when combined with the boundary conditions the resulting water pressure pw and available water saturation sw can be inserted in 3 to compute ut we refer to section 3 for details 2 3 a generalized multiphase flow model based on mixture theory the starting point for developing our model that can account for more detailed physical mechanisms for water oil flow in porous media than conventional modeling is the theory of mixtures this is a theory based on balance laws and conservation principles which is well known in continuum mechanics ambrosi and preziosi 2002 bowen 1976 1980 byrne and preziosi 2003 preziosi and farina 2002 rajagopal and tao 1995 and has been widely applied to systems which can be characterized as a mixture of interacting continua a theoretical outline of the general components of mixture theory is presented in appendix a together with a description of various applications in the following section 2 3 1 we apply this theory to derive a model that is appropriate to a water oil flow scenario in porous media the presentation of the general theory in appendix a and of the adapted model in this section closely follows the description in lemon et al 2006 rajagopal 2007 schuff et al 2013 which in turn builds on bowen 1980 drew and passman 1999 compared to the general theory we make some minor modifications to ensure that the formulation is consistent with conventional two phase modeling based on darcy s law as described in section 2 2 we will here deal with three phases solid matrix water and oil since matrix does not move or change mass and momentum balance equations are only formulated for water and oil however the momentum balance equations for the fluids will motivated by the general mixture theory approach account for frictional resistance both at the porous boundaries of the solid as well as at the moving water oil boundaries moreover we will follow the conventional assumption that these resistance forces are far greater than internal frictional resistance due to viscosity and therefore ignore viscous stress tensor terms see details in section a 3 finally the model must account for the fact that a limited range of volume fractions are available for flow as denoted by residual saturations and that the flow takes place inside the porous space of the rock as defined by introducing the rock porosity in section 2 3 2 we formulate a 1 d version of the generalized multiphase model that is comparable to the conventional model described in section 2 2 2 3 1 formulation in 3 d hence mass balance equations without any source terms are in the case of incompressible water oil transport given by 8 t ϕ s i u i 0 9 u i ϕ s i s i r v i i w o where the second equation expresses the relation between the darcy velocity u i and the interstitial velocity v i of phase i in the mobile domain we also introduce normalized saturations si for the further derivations such that 10 s w s w s w r 1 s w r s o r s o 1 s w sir i w o denote residual saturations moreover introducing an effective porosity ϕe 11 ϕ e ϕ 1 s o r s w r allows us to write 12 u i ϕ e s i v i i w o neglecting inertial effects acceleration effects as is usual when dealing with creeping flow in porous materials the mechanical stress balance is given by ambrosi and preziosi 2002 13 0 s i ψ i m i g i i w o where ψ i refers to the cauchy stress tensor m i represents the interaction forces exerted on the constituents by other constituents of the mixture and g i s i ρ i g is the external body force due to gravity following the conventional approximation that the viscous stress tensor can be ignored and the dominating effects is due to the fluid matrix and fluid fluid interaction forces we have 14 ψ i p i i i w o the difference in water pressure pw and oil pressure po is expressed by the capillary pressure p c p o p w according to general principles of the theory of mixtures the interaction forces m i between the constituents appearing in 13 may be described as ambrosi and preziosi 2002 preziosi and farina 2002 15 m o p o s o f o w m o m m w p w s w f o w m w m where f ow denotes the force drag that the water phase exerts on the oil the oil exerts an equal and opposite force f o w similarly m om and m wm represent interaction forces drag forces between fluid and pore walls solid matrix respectively for oil and water the terms po so and pw sw are interfacial forces that arise from an averaging process to close the system we must specify the drag force term f ow and interaction force terms m im between fluid i w o and matrix drag force represents the interaction between the oil and water phase and is modeled as ambrosi and preziosi 2002 preziosi and farina 2002 rajagopal 2007 16 f o w r v w v o where r dimension pa s m2 remains to be determined typically r sosw to reflect that this force term will vanish when one of the phases vanishes similarly the interaction force between fluid and pore wall matrix which is stagnant is naturally expressed then as ambrosi and preziosi 2002 preziosi and farina 2002 rajagopal 2007 rajagopal and tao 1995 17 m i m r i v i i w o the coefficients r and ri dimension pa s m2 that characterize the magnitude of interaction terms can be chosen such that the model recovers the classical porous media model based on darcy s law at the same time the approach used here will open for development of reservoir models where more detailed physics can be taken into account 2 3 2 formulation in 1 d

hand side represent respectively rock fluid interaction fluid fluid interaction and gravity ri 0 and r 0 are solid fluid interaction and fluid fluid interaction terms respectively solving 18 with respect to interstitial velocities vi and inserting into 12 results in 19 u w ϕ e s w v w λ w w x p w ρ w g λ w o x p o ρ o g u o ϕ e s o v o λ o w x p w ρ w g λ o o x p o ρ o g or equivalently using

generalized phase mobilities λ i and total mobility λ t 22 λ w λ w w λ w o s w 2 r o s w r r o r w r r o r w ϕ e λ o λ o w λ o o s o 2 r w s o r r o r w r r o r w ϕ e λ t λ o λ w s w 2 r o s o 2 r w r r o r w r r o r w ϕ e by summing uw and uo in 20 and using the notation introduced in 22 it follows that the total darcy velocity can be expressed as 23 u t u w u o λ t x p w λ o x p c g λ w ρ w λ o ρ

20 and using the notation introduced in 22 we get 25 u w u t f w w δ ρ g w x p c u o u t f o w δ ρ g w x p c with δ ρ ρ w ρ o where we have defined 26 f w s w λ w λ t λ w λ w λ o s w 2 r o s w r s w 2 r o 1 s w 2 r w r w s w f w λ o s o s w r ϕ e r o r w r r o r w s w 2 1 s w 2 ϕ e s w 2 r o 1 s w 2 r w r inserting the water flux 25 into the 1 d version of the water conservation eq 8 we obtain 27 t ϕ s w x u t f w w δ ρ g x w x p c 0 x h the generalized model 27 can be solved once we have computed ut as mentioned before we can apply x to 23 and make use of 28 x u t 0 to obtain a second order elliptic equation for pw this is combined with appropriate boundary conditions and the available saturation sw having computed pw we can obtain ut which is defined by 23 we refer to section 3 for details note that 27 takes the same form as the conventional model 7 except that the term w has an additional term compared to the product λ o f w as in the conventional model see 26 remark 2 2 a closer inspection of the momentum force balance eqs 18 shows that we can extract information about the role played by the fluid fluid interaction term r v o w w for the two different flow regimes of co current and counter current flow a for co current flow it follows that vw and vo have the same sign let us assume that vw vo 0 if vw vo then r v o v w 0 consequently it follows from 18 1 holding sw x pw and swρwg fixed that there is a reduction in the magnitude of vw compared to the case with r 0 on the other hand since r v o v w 0 it is clear from 18 2 that vo must increase in order to maintain the force balance consequently the influence from the fluid fluid interaction term is that is generates a deceleration of the fluid with highest velocity vw and an acceleration of the slowest fluid vo b for counter current flow it follows that vw and vo have the opposite sign let us assume that vw 0 and vo 0 then r v o v w 0 and in view of the balance law 18 1 it is clear that this must generate a reduced vw compared to the case with r 0 similarly 18 2 combined with the fact that r v o v w 0 allows us to conclude that vo must also decrease consequently the influence from the fluid fluid interaction term is that is generates a deceleration of both fluids remark 2 3 co current flow is accounted for by the u t f i term in 25 whereas counter current flow is represented by the capillary pressure and gravity related terms with coefficient w the precise role of the fluid rock interaction force term and the fluid fluid interaction term is expressed by ri and r respectively in the expression for f w and w in 26 the occurrence of the fluid fluid interaction coefficient r in the co current term f i as well as the counter current term w expresses exactly the behavior more loosely observed in remark 2 2 for example for counter current flow it follows from the expression for w that r 0 will give rise to a deceleration effect for both fluids for co current flow a decrease in uw due to a decrease in f w caused by the presence of r corresponds to an increase in uo since f o 1 f w this is in accordance with several experimental observations as mentioned in the introduction see for example bentsen and manai 1992 1993 bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 sherafati and jessen 2017 and references therein remark 2 4 the essential difference between the conventional model and the generalized comes to the surface in the expression for the counter current related coefficient w in 26 2 conventional modeling amounts to using f w λ o whereas the generalized model includes a correction term that depends on the strength r of the fluid fluid interaction hence it is clear that the generalized mobility functions 22 have a built in capacity to compensate for a change in flow regime counter current versus co current or a mixture of these two in section 4 we will test how the generalized model can account for both flow regimes co and counter current flow in a relevant manner with one and the same set of parameters in contrast to a conventional model that must use different mobility functions depending on the flow regime under consideration before we are ready for that we will need to specify expressions for the interactions coefficients ri i w o and r 2 3 3 interaction terms the frictional interaction terms must be specified for computing f w and w in 27 it is clear that the solid fluid interaction terms r i i w o should obey the relationship ri μi k in order to be consistent with standard porous media flow formulation based on darcy s law 2 the following interaction terms were suggested to be included in the generalized model 21 in order to capture the interaction effects between two movable fluids when they are flowing simultaneously through a porous medium standnes et al 2017 29 r w i w s w α μ w k ϕ e r o i o s o β μ o k ϕ e r i s w s o μ w μ o k ϕ e all the interaction terms have dimension pa s m2 α and β are dimensionless exponents iw and io are dimensionless friction coefficients characterizing the strength of fluid solid interaction and i is a coefficient characterizing the strength of the fluid fluid drag force with dimension pa s 1 using 29 in combination with 26 we obtain full expressions for the generalized fraction flow functions f w and w given by 30 f w s w s w 1 s w β 1 μ o i o s w μ w μ o i s w 1 s w β 1 μ o i o 1 s w s w α 1 μ w i w μ w μ o i w s w s w 1 s w k s w 1 s w β 1 μ o i o 1 s w s w α 1 μ w i w μ w μ o i 2 3 4 generalized relative permeabilities we see from 25 that the terms responsible for co current flow are represented by f w and f o the corresponding generalized mobility functions are given by λ w and λ o as expressed in 22 this gives rise to generalized relative permeabilities k r i for i w o defined as 31 k r w μ w k λ w i o s w s o β 1 i μ w s w i w i o s w α 1 s o β 1 i i w s w α μ w i o s o β μ o k r o μ o k λ o i w s o s w α 1 i μ o s o i w i o s w α 1 s o β 1 i i w s w α μ w i o s o

co current generalized relative permeability curves k r w c o c and k r o c o c as we see that by applying the co current related assumption x p w x p o it follows from 19 that the generalized mobilities λ w λ w w λ w o λ o λ o w λ o o given in 22 represent mobility in the conventional sense that is in the sense of darcy s law 2 with λ i k k r i μ i later in section 4 when we explore properties of the generalized model 27 we apply 31 to identify the parameters iw io i α and β such that a good fit is obtained when compared with relative permeability curves obtained from co current

calculate sw x t a local time step forward assuming ut is held fixed using the transport eq 41 1 3 iterate until full simulation time has been obtained based on the variables pw ut sw output variables such as pc uo uw and oil recovery can be calculated the model was discretized into 300 cells in the x direction with sufficiently small time steps to achieve acceptable resolution and convergence 3 1 buoyancy for a simple interpretation of ut a special case can be considered at initial state we have a uniform saturation profile with thus a fixed capillary pressure in the block which yields from 41 2 44 u t 0 λ t 0 x p w 0 g λ w 0 ρ w λ o 0 ρ o where u t 0 is the initial total darcy velocity and all mobilities are evaluated at swr as denoted by the index 0 since the water pressure is continuous with the hydrostatic pressure at both boundaries we can set x p w 0 ρ w g to obtain 45 u t 0 λ o 0 δ ρ g demonstrating that gravity controlled by the density difference of water and oil and by the mobility of oil in particular initiate a co current flow of the phases in upwards direction negative ut as seen from the general eq 41 2 further changes in ut depend on the distribution of pressure and saturations along the block 4 results and discussion a possible challenge for reservoir simulation is that conventional mobility functions based on relative permeability functions obtained through co current flow experiments do not represent well other flow regimes where strong counter current effects are involved bentsen and manai 1992 1993 bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 sherafati and jessen 2017 the root of this problem is the ignorance of fluid fluid interaction in conventional modeling based on darcy s law consequently the drag force effect between two moving fluids for which co current flow leads to a deceleration effect for the fluid with highest speed and an acceleration effect for the slower moving fluid and for counter current flow leads to a deceleration of both fluids is ignored we refer to remarks 2 2 and 2 3 for details normally this problem is fixed by manually reducing the mobility functions relative permeability functions when used for flow scenarios that involve counter current flow however realistic flow systems will often involve a more or less complicated mixture of these two flow regimes the main purpose of this section is to explore how the generalized model seems to offer some improvements compared to conventional modeling by providing generalized mobility functions that automatically are able to capture several flow regimes for one and the same parameter set careful investigations are carried out for the flow system in fig 1 where we compare the behavior predicted by the conventional model and the generalized see remark 2 4 for a precise description of the difference between the generalized and conventional model first motivated by experimental data from bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 where co currently measured relative permeability curves were obtained and counter current spontaneous imbibition for the same rock fluid system was measured we provide a set of parameters in section 4 1 needed in the generalized model that lead to a good match see also remark 2 5 these data are then used in all further simulations to define f w and w in 26 for reference it is demonstrated that the conventional and generalized models produce equivalent results in strictly co current flow in section 4 2 1 the ability of the model to capture reduced mobility effects seen in experimental data during counter current flow is demonstrated in section 4 2 2 next in section 4 3 we carefully test the two models generalized and conventional for our flow system we discuss three cases i a gravity dominated case with well defined co current vertical flow ii a capillary pressure flow dominated case i e counter current dominated when all open phases are exposed to water iii a combination where gravity and capillary pressure forces have similar strength mixed flow regimes this allows us to obtain precise insight into differences and similarities between the conventional and the generalized model the numerical scheme was validated by comparison of the conventional model simulations of these cases with results obtained from the commercial simulator eclipse 100 we refer to appendix c for this demonstration 4 1 input data the input parameters table 1 used in the simulations are mainly collected from bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 to put more emphasis on gravity we use a block of 0 5 m height which is 70 higher than in their experiments their measured relative permeability data from co current flow were matched as described in the following the end points are related by 46 i w 1 k r w m a x i o 1 k r o m a x as found by setting s o 1 or s w 1 in 31 the expression 31 was further matched to the shape of the data by varying the parameters i α and β we recall that the interaction term i reflects the strength of the fluid fluid interaction term r see 29 by assigning a certain value i 0 to this term it follows that we account for viscous coupling information that will be important when we consider other flow regimes that involve counter current type of flow due to gravity and or capillary pressure in particular the magnitude of i is also quality checked by assessing the simulated rate of counter current spontaneous imbibition against experimental measurements performed by bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 on the same rock fluid system as where co current relative permeabilities were measured this role played by i is explicitly reflected by the expression for w see 26 2 or 30 2 and contains effects not accounted for in the conventional modeling which amounts to using the coefficient f w λ o in fig 3 we show a plot of w and the conventional part f w λ o which illustrates the effect from fluid fluid interaction term r the co current relative permeability curves shown in fig 2 and represented by 31 are given as direct input in the conventional model the viscous coupling effects which occur during co current flow is thus integrated in these curves but are implicitly assumed not to change in the conventional model when we consider other flow scenarios involving counter current effects due to gravity and or capillary pressure by using the generalized model this assumption of fixed curves is put to a test since generalized mobilities are related to both phase pressure gradients see 19 and 21 hence this representation of the relative permeabilities is more general and it is expected that it is capable of capturing effects due to flow direction and or interaction between the fluids and solids we refer to section 4 2 2 for an example that illustrates this clearly note that the same parameterization given in table 1 is applied to both models in the following remark 4 1 note that we have two equivalent formulations of fluid velocity for instance uw in the generalized model i the use of two mobility functions λ w w and λ w o one associated with x pw the other with x po as in 19 ii the use of phase mobility functions λ w λ w w λ w o and λ o λ o w λ o o associated with pure co current flow see 25 1 and 26 1 combined with inclusion of capillary pressure driven counter current flow with a non conventional coefficient w given by 26 2 4 2 basic validation 4 2 1 model comparison during co current flow in this example the generalized and conventional models are for validation purposes compared under conditions that should yield identical results a pure co current flow test was considered this was realized by assuming p c s w 0 and that the phase outside the block at the top was oil instead of water as assumed in fig 1 then a stable gravity displacement of the low density oil in the block by high density water is achieved in co current fashion due to buoyancy all counter current terms are negligible in this situation the comparison of the conventional and generalized model revealed a perfect match as shown in fig 4 this may be explained as follows as mentioned the difference between the two models lies in the coefficient in front of the gravity term appearing in 41 1 one uses λ o f w conventional the other uses w generalized in fig 5 we include plots of the corresponding total advective gravitational fluxes f c o n s w u t f w λ o f w δ ρ g and f g e n s w u t f w w δ ρ g see 41 for a fixed time t where u t u t 0 10 where u t 0 is the initial total darcy velocity of the system for this flow case an upward moving front increasing jump in scaled saturation from 0 to 1 is formed at the bottom according to the theory of solutions of riemann problems for scalar nonlinear conservation laws see chapter 16 in le veque 2002 the entropy satisfying solution is given in terms of a shock solution that moves with the speed s determined by the rankine hugoniot condition s f i 1 f i 0 1 for i c o n g e n consequently it is only the endpoints of the two functions fi that matter more precisely the construction of the solution depends on the lower convex hull of fi sw in the interval 0 1 and this is the same for both i c o n and i g e n see fig 5 right where the lower convex hull is indicated for this example and more explanation hence there is not room for any effects from the fluid fluid interaction term which makes good sense due to the fact that r swso see 29 such that the difference between w and f w λ o does not affect end points see also fig 3 some rapid variations in the phase velocity curves is observed around x 0 075 m after 467 1 hours when ut is low this is related to the slope change of the advection gravitational flux 4 2 2 comparison against experimental counter current data secondly the generalized and conventional models were used to simulate a strictly counter current spontaneous imbibition test where the bottom boundary is closed in fig 1 and both capillary and gravity effects are considered this case was conducted experimentally in bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 using the indicated data shown in table 1 except for a core of length 0 29 m thus also implemented in the simulations here the results in terms of oil recovery are shown in fig 6 we observe that the generalized model produces an oil recovery curve that largely matches the experimental results this nice prediction also justifies the value of the interaction coefficient i resulting from matching the relative permeability curves the conventional model which directly implements the co currently measured relative permeabilities yields higher recovery rates than the experimental data and generalized model in particular the mobility associated with the counter current flow effect is too strong which is expected since the relative permeability curves used are based on co current flow regime motivated by these results we now turn our attention to the flow system depicted in fig 1 and represented by the model 41 42 and 43 4 3 investigation of flow regimes 4 3 1 case i capillary dominated system for the capillary dominated case we reduce all terms related to gravity to negligible magnitude both in the transport eqs 7 and 27 and the velocity eqs 3 and 23 also the capillary pressure at x h goes to 0 see 38 the system can thus be regarded as a purely counter current spontaneous imbibition process fig 7 shows the profiles of water and oil darcy velocities uw x uo x and normalized water saturation sw x at three given times 1 5 15 5 and 46 6 h corresponding to rf 15 50 and 85 in the conventional model respectively the duration of the test is 150 hours due to the counter current dominated process and equal boundary conditions the profiles are symmetric during counter current flow both phases decelerate as is seen from the form of the coefficient w in 26 2 which reflects the additional viscous coupling effects through the r dependent term as a consequence the inflowing water fronts move slower compared to the conventional model where the co current relative permeabilities are applied which amounts to using f w λ o as the capillary pressure coefficient the saturation profiles predicted by the generalized model are delayed and the imbibition process is generally slower the saturation fronts almost converge after 15 5 h and the center saturation is at 75 after 46 6 h in the conventional model while in the generalized model all saturations have travelled significantly shorter distance from the boundaries it is also observed that the discrepancy between the two model saturation profiles increases as time elapses fig 8 shows the total darcy velocity ut from 3 and 23 and oil recovery from 40 plotted vs time the total velocity is zero throughout the process indicative of counter current flow recovery by spontaneous imbibition from a linear system follows a square root of time profile until significant boundary effects are encountered andersen et al 2014 the generalized model displays a slower imbibition process than the conventional model with lower recovery than the conventional model at all times at 90 recovery there is around 23 h delay in time between the models 55 vs 78 h which means the time scale has increased by roughly 42 the conventional model represents the ideal but unrealistic behavior of the reservoir in the sense that the co current relative permeabilities do not account for the change in viscous coupling that reduce the phase velocities both models do however produce the same end recovery which is given by the saturation where the capillary forces vanish p c 0 corresponding to sw 1 as seen in fig 2 and rf 1 4 3 2 case ii gravity dominated system in this case we assume that capillary effects are ignored in the system and pc sw is equal to 0 everywhere including the boundary conditions thus all terms related to capillary pressure are neglected both in the transport eqs 7 and 27 and the velocity eqs 3 and 23 this case is similar to the one studied in section 4 2 2 except that water is now available to enter the block also at the top this will give rise to interesting new behavior as water entering at the top will form a downward going water front striking differences will be seen between the upward going water front and the downward moving front that elucidate the role of viscous coupling effects fig 9 shows the profiles of water and oil darcy velocities uw x uo x and normalized water saturation sw x at three given times 11 8 89 1 and 258 1 h corresponding to 15 50 and 85 oil recovery in the conventional model the system is no longer symmetric rather one can see that the system is predominantly co current at 11 8 h we see that near the bottom water has a large negative velocity moves upwards while oil has been displaced and has negligible flux there in the upper part of the system mainly oil flows upwards while water has a negligible flux dense water slowly migrating from the top converges with the co current water front travelling from the bottom of the block at 258 1 h resulting in a more complex flow pattern at this time the uppermost region 0 x 0 15 m in the conventional model and 0 x 0 07 m in the generalized model displays significant velocities for both phases in opposite directions i e this region displays counter current flow this advanced flow pattern is a combination of co and counter current flow initially dominated by co current it is thus seen that the conventional and generalized models produce almost equivalent profiles in the lower part of the block even after 258 1 h 85 recovery while the counter current wave travelling from the top results in significantly different behavior between the two models due to viscous coupling effects what is the precise explanation of the difference seen in the behavior at the top this can be explained as follows as noted for the case in section 4 2 1 the behavior in the conventional model and the generalized is completely determined by the flux functions fi for i c o n g e n and their lower convex hull as described and shown in fig 5 this explains the alikeness in the behavior at the bottom see section 4 2 2 however at the top there is a decreasing jump formed the riemann problem for a decreasing jump is dictated by the upper convex hull of fi which will be different for fcon sw and fgen sw we refer to fig 5 for illustrations in particular we see from the upper convex hull of fgen sw that for the generalized model a slowly moving front will be formed that jumps from s w 0 to approximately s w 0 45 followed by a rarefaction wave the conventional model however will produce according to the upper convex hull of fcon sw a fast moving front that jumps from s w 0 to approximately s w 0 5 followed by a rarefaction wave fig 10 illustrates the total darcy velocity 3 and 23 and oil recovery 40 vs time all the mobile oil is recovered during the gravity drainage process such that r f 1 in the end the delay in oil recovery between the two models is significantly reduced compared to the previous example fig 8 there is around 24 3 time delay when comparing the end states of the oil recovery processes 370 h for the conventional model and 460 h for the generalized model since the flow is mainly co current using the co current relative permeabilities in the conventional model gives a better description of the system in this case with less deviation from the generalized model compared to the counter current case it is further worth noticing that the rate ut displayed in fig 10 left does not show distinct model behavior until after 260 h corresponding to the time when the co current and counter current waves in the conventional model meet see fig 9 the recovery factor seen in fig 10 right on the other hand differs visible already after 60 h which is due to the importance of counter currently produced oil at this time 4 3 3 case iii combined flow regimes in this case we consider the situation with inclusion of both gravity and capillary terms which will give rise to mixed co current and counter current driven flow both in the conventional and generalized model in order to clearly see this mixed effect we reduce the interfacial tension σ by five times since the magnitude of capillary pressure shown in fig 2 is much higher than the gravity force variations of water and oil darcy velocities uw uo and normalized water saturation sw in space and time logarithmic are shown in fig 11 the highest darcy velocities are seen at the top and bottom faces of the block and the magnitudes are similar at the top and bottom although there are some differences this can be explained by capillary forces being strong compared to gravity fig 12 shows the profiles of water and oil darcy velocities uw x uo x and normalized water saturation sw x at the given times 4 8 43 9 and 126 h corresponding to rf 15 50 and 85 in the conventional model fig 12 shows that there are strong phase velocities near the bottom and top of the block decreasing towards the center however there is also a net co current flow upwards due to gravity that also mobilizes the central oil even before the imbibition front reaches the center as seen in the central region the velocity profiles in fig 12 are not symmetric at 4 8 h and 43 9 h but shifted towards more negative values due to co current flow upwards it is thus seen that more water has entered the block from the bottom although a significant imbibition front has also entered from the top the generalized model velocities are lower in the outer regions where counter current flow dominates at 126 h the two models produce more asymmetric behavior at the upper part of the core and the two phases travel in opposite directions over a larger part of the core 0 x 0 2 m and 0 3 x 0 5 m only the central region displays co current flow both uw and uo are negative both phases travel upwards at earlier times larger fractions of the block display co current flow in other words it appears that counter current flow becomes more dominant with time comparing the saturation profiles in fig 12 especially after 43 9 h it is seen that the water fronts travelling from the top behave more different between the conventional and generalized model compared to the front travelling from the bottom of the block this can be attributed to the observation that gravity enhances counter current flow at the top while it counter acts capillary diffusion and works to keep the phases separate at the bottom for this reason the generalized model exhibits more delay compared to the conventional model at the top than it does at the bottom in similarity with the gravity dominated case it appears thus that also here the main delay in recovery occurs at late times see fig 13 right the overall delay is situated in magnitude between the two previously shown cases i and ii 5 conclusions this paper presents a model where momentum equations based on a general mixture theory replace darcy s law in order to account for viscous coupling between the fluid phases and between fluid and rock we carry out a systematic comparison of the generalized model and the conventional model darcy based approach for a specific flow case relevant for naturally fractured reservoirs to parameterize the model realistically we match experimental data from bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 where co current and counter current data were able to distinguish such effects quantitatively in the conventional model we directly apply co current relative permeability curves while in the generalized model relative permeability curves are a result of using more general momentum balance equations the exact difference between the two models is manifested in the counter current coefficient w expressed in 26 2 the inclusion of the fluid fluid interaction term r implies that the term w contains a modification that automatically accounts for counter current effects not captured by the conventional model as a demonstration of the model we consider gravity aided spontaneous imbibition into a matrix block fully surrounded by water on all sides representative of the conditions in a naturally fractured reservoir the geometry was 1 d with flow along the vertical axis only it should be noted that both initial state boundary conditions and bond number contribute to the flow regimes for different situations the choice of having all open sides exposed to water allowed flow conditions where co and counter current flow regimes were naturally involved based on a systematic study of the model behavior we reach the following conclusions directly implementing co currently measured relative permeability curves as is standard into reservoir simulation may yield too optimistic results since viscous coupling can be enhanced at more general flow regimes in the capillary dominated case all open faces exposed to water the flow is mainly counter current this results in significant viscous coupling and increases the time scale of recovery in the gravity dominated case the flow is mainly co current upwards buoyancy although some counter current flow at the top dense water sinking opposite way of light oil produces viscous interaction also in this case directly applying co currently measured relative permeabilities from the lab is a better assumption under such conditions than for strongly counter current flow and the conventional and generalized models produced very similar behavior increasing the magnitude of capillary forces results in more counter current flow and thus more viscous coupling larger differences were observed between the conventional and generalized models interestingly the simulations indicate that the viscous coupling effects could become more significant with time in combined cases where both gravity and capillary pressure forces are present as counter current flow dominates a larger portion of the core at late times the generalized model apparently can automatically capture fluid fluid interaction effects and better represent mobility functions for mixed flow regimes the usefulness and validity of the proposed model has been demonstrated in this work by matching experimental data with evident features of viscous coupling and by demonstrating the listed trends in fluid transport with flow regime previous works have demonstrated the model s ability to capture experimental non standard trends in relative permeability functions with variations in viscosity ratio and flow direction standnes et al 2017 and also the ability to improve scaling of counter current spontaneous imbibition at conditions where viscous coupling should be more pronounced standnes and andersen 2017 the proposed model equipped with generalized mobility functions should however be further tested regarding its ability to capture different flow behavior using one and the same parameter set for more general cases and flow regimes an interesting direction to explore could be to combine or compare the proposed generalized model with approaches like the barenblatt model where the saturation functions only gradually approach unique relations with saturation two natural questions in that context are which experimental features could be captured both by the barenblatt model and our generalized model and what would be distinct obviously both models would predict reduced mobility during spontaneous imbibition a transient process as compared to steady state measured relative permeability curves the mechanisms are different though as the barenblatt model would display visible distinctions only during transient flow while the generalized model is sensitive also to variations in steady state flow regimes standnes et al 2017 what would be the effect of introducing the non equilibrium effect of the barenblatt approach in our generalized model and how could this be distinguished from current mechanisms one such feature could lie in the transient nature more apparent in the barenblatt model while flow regime and perhaps not so much time changes affects the generalized model further tortuosity cai et al 2014 could be a relevant parameter to incorporate as the actual travel length of the fluids should be more closely related to the overall momentum transfer and pressure drop for a given core sample than the straight line path these questions and others considered to be beyond the scope of the current manuscript will be addressed in future work acknowledgements the 1st author thanks the research council

mixture theory a 1 continuity and momentum equations for simplicity reason we consider a mixture of two phases i 1 2 and let θi v i and ρi denote volume fraction velocity intrinsic and density of phase i we assume incompressible fluids and that there is no source terms 47 t θ i θ i v i 0 i 1 2 the intrinsic velocity v i is related to the superficial velocity darcy velocity u i by u i θ i v i the no voids constraint implies that the volume fractions must sum to unity 48 θ 1 θ 2 1 the dynamics of the phases at any point will be described using a flow model whereby the motion of each phase is in response to the stress within that phase and the pressures exerted by the other component phases neglecting inertial effects including the momentum change caused by interchange of mass between the phases the momentum balance equation for phase i is 49 θ 1 ψ 1 f 12 g 1 0 θ 2 ψ 2 f 21 g 2 0 where ψ i refers to the macroscopic averaged stress tensor associated with phase i whereas the quantity f ij denotes the interphase force which is exerted by the jth phase on the ith phase clearly f i j f j i by newton s third law finally g i θ i ρ i g refers to the external body force on phase i due to gravity and g refers to the gravity vector with the direction of gravitational pull and magnitude g 9 8 a 2 interphase forces f ij the interphase forces f ij represent the forces acting at the interfaces between pairs of phases many works assume that a simplified approach can be used whereby these forces are expressed in terms of interphase pressure and drag force components the following expression is postulated 50 f 12 p 12 θ 2 θ 1 p 21 θ 1 θ 2 β 12 θ 1 θ 2 v 2 v 1 f 21 p 21 θ 1 θ 2 p 12 θ 2 θ 1 β 21 θ 1 θ 2 v 1 v 2 we refer to lemon et al 2006 for more details regarding the interpretation of the different terms here we simply note that different relations have been proposed by various authors motivated by the special flow system under consideration we see that if β 12 β 21 and p 12 p 21 then 50 simplifies to 51 f 12 p 12 θ 1 β 12 θ 1 θ 2 v 2 v 1 f 21 p 21 θ 2 β 21 θ 1 θ 2 v 1 v 2 in view of 48 and it follows that f 12 f 21 note that solid components like structural proteins that comprise the matrix in connective tissue in the context of tissue engineering or rock in the context of multiphase flow in a reservoir can also naturally be included within this modeling framework in this case the momentum balance 49 is not relevant since the velocity associated with this phase is zero if deformation of the matrix is ignored however the volume fraction of this solid phase must of course be taken into account as well as interaction force terms the last term on the right hand side of 51 a 3 constitutive relations as described in lemon et al 2006 the partial stress tensor ψ i is decomposed into the following form 52 ψ i p i i ψ i d i 1 2 where pi refers to the locally averaged intraphase pressure for phase i and ψ i d is the deviatoric part of the partial stress tensor and i is the identity tensor at the microscopic scale ψ i d is related to the intrinsic velocity on a local scale v i for viscous fluids 53 ψ i d μ i v i v i t κ i v i i i 1 2 which includes both the effect of shear viscosity μi and bulk viscosity κi on a macroscopic scale where velocities are averaged over a representative elementary volume rev i e giving the intrinsic average velocities v i the form of the stress term must be more carefully evaluated several works account for the viscous stress term ψ i d by directly implementing the average interstitial velocities v i into 53 see lemon et al 2006 schuff et al 2013 wu et al 2017 on the other hand when defining the partial stress of a fluid constituent the viscous forces are also often neglected such that ψ i d 0 in 52 see e g ambrosi and preziosi 2002 lemon et al 2006 for a porous media in which the fluid drag on the porous matrix dominates this may be a valid assumption as mentioned in rajagopal 2007 the underlying assumptions imply that the viscosity of the fluid and the roughness of the solid surface lead to far greater frictional resistance and hence dissipation at the porous boundaries of the solid in comparison to the frictional resistance and hence the dissipation in the fluid note that the above modeling framework is general enough to also account for elastic deformation of for example the solid matrix components in a reservoir modeling of deformation of solid components like matrix constituents in a reservoir or tissue growth involving elastic constituents is significantly more complicated and implies that we cannot assume that ψ i d 0 schuff et al 2013 an interesting example of this can be found in ambrosi and preziosi 2009 which focuses on flow systems composed of cells viscous fluid extracellular matrix solid constituent and water inviscid fluid where also elastic deformation is taken into consideration in the mathematical formulation this gives rise to a stress tensor ψ i d where the extracellular matrix is treated as a compressible elastic body remark a 1 an instructive overview is given in rajagopal 2007 of how generalizations of the standard darcy s law for single phase flow can be derived within the context of mixture theory starting with more general momentum balance equations and using different sets of assumptions leads to a hierarchy of mathematical models in particular it can be shown that popular models due to brinkman biot and many others can be obtained via various approximations for example brinkman s equation see 54 accounts for frictional effects in the fluid by using a partial stress tensor 53 where the first term is included this may be relevant for porous media having large permeability and or being dominated by a network of fractures the resulting momentum balance equation then takes the following form for a fluid matrix system 54 p α 0 v ρ b μ v where the quantities refer to the fluid phase i e p is fluid pressure and v is pore velocity ρ phase density and μ phase viscosity b denotes external body forces e g for gravity b g and α 0 the magnitude of the fluid matrix drag force the final term involving second order derivatives of velocity marks a clear distinction from darcy s law for single phase flow further extension of the viscous stress tensor is necessary in order to account for non newtonian fluid properties corresponding to shear thickening or shear thinning behavior rajagopal 2007 we refer to the same work for more discussions related to weakly compressible fluids and small deformations and appropriate extensions of darcy s equation remark a 2 water weakening effects and deformation of solid matrix constituents are currently subject to extensive experimental investigations andersen et al 2017b various creep tests are carried out to detect detailed mechanisms related to deformation of matrix in chalk reservoirs however this behavior cannot be separated from the flow of liquid phases which carry various chemicals that may react with the solid components and thereby have an impact of the deformation behavior at the same time these fluids and their chemical components may also have an impact on the solid fluid interaction terms as well as fluid fluid interaction terms the mixture theory formulation seems to offer a framework that is broad enough to allow for mathematical models that can bring together systematic studies of all these different aspects of multiphase flow in a reservoir remark a 3 development of models within the framework of mixture theory has found many applications within the study of multiphase flow in porous media relevant for life science biomechanics see for instance ambrosi and preziosi 2002 byrne and preziosi 2003 preziosi and farina 2002 see also evje 2017 for a recent work where a general compressible cell fluid model with interaction terms similar to 16 and 17 is proposed to explore cancer cell migration dynamics for mathematical results related to compressible versions of two fluid models that involve gravity driven segregation see evje and wen 2015 and for models that discuss the role of capillary pressure and its stabilizing effect we refer the interesting reader to evje et al 2016 evje and wen 2016 and references therein appendix b discretization of the generalized model two dimensionless variables td and xd

t n 1 appendix c numerical validation eclipse 100 was used to examine the validity of the numerical method direct comparison between eclipse simulations and modeling results from the conventional model and the generalized model is shown in fig 14 in terms of recovery factor vs time the eclipse results are in excellent agreement with the conventional model i e where co current relative permeabilities are implemented to model flow regimes with varying extent of counter current flows while naturally there is significant difference with the results from the generalized model 
880,it is well known that relative permeabilities can depend on the flow configuration and they are commonly lower during counter current flow as compared to co current flow conventional models must deal with this by manually changing the relative permeability curves depending on the observed flow regime in this paper we use a novel two phase momentum equation approach based on general mixture theory to generate effective relative permeabilities where this dependence and others is automatically captured in particular this formulation includes two viscous coupling effects i viscous drag between the flowing phases and the stagnant porous rock ii viscous drag caused by momentum transfer between the flowing phases the resulting generalized model will predict that during co current flow the faster moving fluid accelerates the slow fluid but is itself decelerated while for counter current flow they are both decelerated the implications of these mechanisms are demonstrated by investigating recovery of oil from a matrix block surrounded by water due to a combination of gravity drainage and spontaneous imbibition a situation highly relevant for naturally fractured reservoirs we implement relative permeability data obtained experimentally through co current flooding experiments and then explore the model behavior for different flow cases ranging from counter current dominated to co current dominated in particular it is demonstrated how the proposed model seems to offer some possible interesting improvements over conventional modeling by providing generalized

conventional modeling of two phase flow in porous media is based on darcy s extended law which was originally developed empirically for single phase flow darcy 1856 rose 2000 and extended to multiphase flow by incorporation of relative permeabilities muskat et al 2013 the relative permeability is commonly assumed to be a function of saturation only implying that the presence of another phase has a unique impact on the phase s flux i e no coupling is accounted for through the velocity or pressure gradient of the other phase several experimental observations however indicate that the flow mode co or counter current can have a more or less strong impact on the phase mobilities previous studies of counter current flow settings see below for more details support that relative permeability in a counter current flow setting can be significantly lower than in co current flow settings in conventional simulation tools the dependence of the saturation functions i e relative permeability and capillary pressure on the flow direction co current or counter current and phase velocities is commonly ignored this indicates that the use of the extended darcy s law may be questionable 1 1 previous works on coupled multiphase flow fluid fluid interactions referred to herein as viscous coupling can play a significant role related to two phase flow in porous media yuster 1951 was the first to mention such phenomena by theoretical analysis of two phase flow in capillary tubes where he derived that relative permeability should not only be a function of saturation but also of viscosity ratio researchers have proposed that relative permeabilities depend on saturations capillary number and viscosity ratio between two fluids avraam and payatakes 1995a ehrlich 1993 and on how the fluids flow relative to each other bentsen and manai 1992 bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 momentum transfer due to differences in interstitial velocities induces acceleration of the slower and deceleration of the faster moving fluid if the fluids are moving co currently deceleration of both fluid velocities will occur if they are moving counter currently ayodele 2006 babchin et al 2006 bentsen and manai 1993 dullien and dong 1996 li et al 2004 hence the extent of fluid fluid interaction and the flow mode is significantly impacting fluid mobilities and relative permeabilities there are several theoretical approaches aiming at developing generalized models that account for viscous coupling effects an effort to extend the single phase darcy s law to multiphase flow was made by de la cruz and spanos 1983 who derived theoretically darcy s empirical extended law by applying the method of volume averaging to stokes equation kalaydjian 1987 1990 developed flow equations using the concepts of irreversible thermodynamics from a macroscopic understanding of two phase flow in porous media moreover a number of researchers tried to gain insight into how two immiscible phases flow through a porous medium by using simple analogous models such as tubular flow bacri et al 1990 yuster 1951 common for such generalized models the flux of each phase is a function of both phases pressure gradients and it therefore contains four generalized coefficients diagonal and cross term mobilities which are referred to as generalized mobilities avraam and payatakes 1995b measured such cross terms experimentally in 2 d micro models vs wetting phase saturation in steady state co current flow of water and oil they concluded that coupling is important over broad ranges of wetting phase saturation capillary number and viscosity ratio dullien and dong 1996 likewise measured cross terms in two phase flow in sand packs using a fluid system with viscosity ratio of unity the value of the cross terms ranged from 10 to 35 of the value of the effective permeability to water and from 5 to 15 of the effective permeability to oil respectively langaas and papatzacos 2001 used the lattice boltzmann lb approach to investigate viscous coupling and concluded that co current relative permeabilities always are larger than the corresponding counter current curves caused partly by viscous coupling and different levels of capillary forces li et al 2005 also used lb to investigate viscous coupling and they concluded that their model was able to capture main experimental effects normally interpreted as caused by this effect they also concluded that the interfacial area between the fluids is a key variable for understanding of multiphase flow and hence relative permeability functions when two immiscible fluids are flowing through porous media 1 2 objectives of this work the main objective of this work is to explore how to develop a model that naturally can account for viscous coupling effects i e fluid fluid interaction by applying the theory of mixtures lemon et al 2006 rajagopal 2007 rajagopal and tao 1995 schuff et al 2013 in this formulation each phase momentum balance equation is a function of both fluid velocities more precisely based on a two fluid stokes type of formulation for creeping flow we derive generalized mobility functions that are sensitive to both solid fluid interaction as well as fluid fluid interaction in other words the obtained mobility functions automatically include terms that sense contributions from the counter current flow and other terms that sense contributions from the co current flow in particular the mobility functions ensure that for co current flow the fluid with highest speed decelerates whereas the slower fluid is accelerated for counter current flow both fluids will experience a reduced velocity depending on the strength of the fluid fluid interaction a first presentation of this idea was given in standnes et al 2017 the model studied in that work was simplified in the sense that no impact of gravity forces and capillary pressure was accounted for in the final expressions it was also used for steady state investigations only the potential usefulness of the proposed generalized model is illustrated by studying a specific example with an oil saturated matrix block submerged in water where the resulting flow involves a rather delicate balance between counter current and co current flow depending on the relative strength of capillary pressure driven flow spontaneous imbibition and gravity driven spontaneous imbibition is regarded as a key driving mechanism for oil production in naturally fractured water wet reservoirs andersen et al 2014 mason and morrow 2013 this process is featured by water imbibing spontaneously into the matrix blocks by capillary forces simultaneously expelling oil to the surrounding fracture system either counter currently if the matrix blocks are totally submerged in water or in a co current flow mode if parts of the blocks are covered by oil andersen et al 2017a hence the rate of imbibition is determined by the capillary forces and the corresponding fluid mobilities which are strong functions of the flow mode co versus counter current flow an important aspect of the imbibition process is the fact that capillary forces decrease rapidly when the water saturation increases implying that gravity forces under such conditions no longer can be ignored and will have significant impact on fluid saturation distribution and flow of oil and water viscous coupling effects can thus potentially have important implications and modeling advantages for the understanding of two phase flow in this context both since i relative permeabilities are always measured co currently in the laboratory and counter current flow can thus behave differently than predicted from those measurements and ii since a dynamic variation can occur regarding the magnitude of co versus counter current flow in a conventional model this case would be challenging to deal with because regions with different flow behavior co current and counter current must be identified and then corresponding relative permeability functions assigned manually as an example of such implementation an interesting recent study of viscous coupling effects in a three phase setting is found in sherafati and jessen 2017 the authors investigated the impact of mobility changes due to flow reversals from co current to counter current flow on the displacement performance of water alternating gas wag injection processes their method consists of switching between using co current relative permeability functions and counter current depending on a criterion that classifies flow either as co or counter current with the proposed generalized model of this paper one set of parameters could potentially describe all such flow combinations dynamically the presented generalized model further has the advantage of accounting for the effect of fluid viscosities on relative permeabilites and imbibition rates standnes and andersen 2017 standnes et al 2017 it seems appropriate to mention here another related direction where researchers have proposed alternatives to darcy type formulations in order to remedy some of the shortcomings of classical multiphase extension of darcy s law the hassanizadeh gray model hassanizadeh and gray 1993 and the barenblatt model barenblatt and vinnichenko 1980 both suggest to include non equilibrium effects in capillary pressure and or relative permeability functions we refer to juanes 2008 silin and patzek 2004 for a comprehensive overview of different works where these ideas have been implemented and tested there is a similarity between the barenblatt approach and the use of the more general momentum balance equations we suggest in the sense that experimentally obtained flow functions like relative permeability are process dependent in order to account for this non equilibrium effect the barenblatt approach consists of introducing an additional variable s w e effective water saturation and an additional equation which describes the difference between the actual water saturation sw and the effective s w e in terms of a time dependent but non specific process capillary pressure and relative permeability curves are then expressed in terms of the effective saturation s w e the current manuscript focuses more on one specific effect that will make relative permeability functions process dependent namely the fluid fluid interaction effect drag force effect between the flowing phases for a proper demonstration of properties of the generalized model proposed in this manuscript the behavior of the model is compared against results obtained from a conventional two phase modeling which relies on standard darcy s extended law the model is parameterized using experimental results from the literature where viscous coupling could be quantified in particular co currently measured relative permeability curves from the literature are implemented and experimental data of counter current spontaneous imbibition from the same rock fluid system is history matched we demonstrate the model for three different cases 1 a co current dominated flow mode where oil is mainly displaced upwards by water in the water surrounded system due to dominant gravity forces i e buoyancy 2 a counter current dominated flow mode where dominant capillary forces induce counter current spontaneous imbibition symmetrically from all sides which are open to water phase and 3 a case where gravity and capillary forces have similar magnitude the paper is organized in the following way in section 2 we derive the relevant mathematical models used to represent the gravity drainage spontaneous imbibition controlled flow system we are interested in i first using the conventional darcy law approach ii then with momentum balance equations that account for viscous coupling in section 3 we give a compact summary of these two models for the readers convenience together with a brief description of the solution algorithm in section 4 using representative input data we carefully consider the model behavior at different degrees of capillary and gravity dominated flow regimes the two modeling approaches are compared and discussed conclusions are given in section 5 2 theory 2 1 geometry the system we consider is a matrix block surrounded by water fig 1 representative of the state below the water level in a naturally fractured reservoir during water injection or an amott test in the laboratory for simplicity only 1 d flow is considered along the vertical axis the mechanisms at work are spontaneous imbibition and gravity drainage no forced displacement is considered 2 2 conventional 1 d model based on darcy s law transport equations for incompressible and immiscible phases oil o and water w in a 1 d porous media are given by 1 t ϕ s i x u i i w o where ϕ is porosity si is phase saturation and ui is the flux darcy velocity of each phase i o w a 1 d system is considered along the vertical axis denoted x positive direction downwards darcy s law in such a 1 d vertical system is given by 2 u i k k r i μ i x p i ρ i g i w o where k is the absolute permeability pi is phase pressure g 9 8 m s2 is the acceleration of gravity and kri ρi and μi are phase relative permeability density and viscosity respectively the phase pressures are dependent due to the capillary pressure function p o p w p c also we introduce the total darcy velocity ut as follows 3 u t u w u o λ o x p c λ t x p w λ o ρ o λ w ρ w g where the mobilities λi λt are defined as 4 λ i k k r i μ i i w o λ t λ w λ o it follows from adding the conservation laws 1 that 5 x u t 0 solving 3 with respect to x pw and inserting this into 2 the water velocity can be expressed in the following form 6 u w f w u t f w λ o δ ρ g f w λ o x p c therefore the water transport equation becomes 7 t ϕ s w x f w u t f w λ o δ ρ g x f w λ o x p c x 0 h where f w λ w λ t is the water fractional flow function and δ ρ ρ w ρ o note that the rhs of 7 is expressed in terms of an advective gravitational term and a capillary diffusion term respectively remark 2 1 note that ut represents co current flow through the system its numerical value depends on an interplay of pressure gradients gravity and boundary conditions see 3 in this work ut results from buoyancy i e gravity effects as no applied pressure driving force is considered if different phases are simultaneously present at the matrix boundaries ut can also result from spontaneous imbibition andersen et al 2017a ut is one of the unknowns in the system but is found from 3 after applying x and combining with 5 this gives an elliptic equation for pw which can be solved when combined with the boundary conditions the resulting water pressure pw and available water saturation sw can be inserted in 3 to compute ut we refer to section 3 for details 2 3 a generalized multiphase flow model based on mixture theory the starting point for developing our model that can account for more detailed physical mechanisms for water oil flow in porous media than conventional modeling is the theory of mixtures this is a theory based on balance laws and conservation principles which is well known in continuum mechanics ambrosi and preziosi 2002 bowen 1976 1980 byrne and preziosi 2003 preziosi and farina 2002 rajagopal and tao 1995 and has been widely applied to systems which can be characterized as a mixture of interacting continua a theoretical outline of the general components of mixture theory is presented in appendix a together with a description of various applications in the following section 2 3 1 we apply this theory to derive a model that is appropriate to a water oil flow scenario in porous media the presentation of the general theory in appendix a and of the adapted model in this section closely follows the description in lemon et al 2006 rajagopal 2007 schuff et al 2013 which in turn builds on bowen 1980 drew and passman 1999 compared to the general theory we make some minor modifications to ensure that the formulation is consistent with conventional two phase modeling based on darcy s law as described in section 2 2 we will here deal with three phases solid matrix water and oil since matrix does not move or change mass and momentum balance equations are only formulated for water and oil however the momentum balance equations for the fluids will motivated by the general mixture theory approach account for frictional resistance both at the porous boundaries of the solid as well as at the moving water oil boundaries moreover we will follow the conventional assumption that these resistance forces are far greater than internal frictional resistance due to viscosity and therefore ignore viscous stress tensor terms see details in section a 3 finally the model must account for the fact that a limited range of volume fractions are available for flow as denoted by residual saturations and that the flow takes place inside the porous space of the rock as defined by introducing the rock porosity in section 2 3 2 we formulate a 1 d version of the generalized multiphase model that is comparable to the conventional model described in section 2 2 2 3 1 formulation in 3 d hence mass balance equations without any source terms are in the case of incompressible water oil transport given by 8 t ϕ s i u i 0 9 u i ϕ s i s i r v i i w o where the second equation expresses the relation between the darcy velocity u i and the interstitial velocity v i of phase i in the mobile domain we also introduce normalized saturations si for the further derivations such that 10 s w s w s w r 1 s w r s o r s o 1 s w sir i w o denote residual saturations moreover introducing an effective porosity ϕe 11 ϕ e ϕ 1 s o r s w r allows us to write 12 u i ϕ e s i v i i w o neglecting inertial effects acceleration effects as is usual when dealing with creeping flow in porous materials the mechanical stress balance is given by ambrosi and preziosi 2002 13 0 s i ψ i m i g i i w o where ψ i refers to the cauchy stress tensor m i represents the interaction forces exerted on the constituents by other constituents of the mixture and g i s i ρ i g is the external body force due to gravity following the conventional approximation that the viscous stress tensor can be ignored and the dominating effects is due to the fluid matrix and fluid fluid interaction forces we have 14 ψ i p i i i w o the difference in water pressure pw and oil pressure po is expressed by the capillary pressure p c p o p w according to general principles of the theory of mixtures the interaction forces m i between the constituents appearing in 13 may be described as ambrosi and preziosi 2002 preziosi and farina 2002 15 m o p o s o f o w m o m m w p w s w f o w m w m where f ow denotes the force drag that the water phase exerts on the oil the oil exerts an equal and opposite force f o w similarly m om and m wm represent interaction forces drag forces between fluid and pore walls solid matrix respectively for oil and water the terms po so and pw sw are interfacial forces that arise from an averaging process to close the system we must specify the drag force term f ow and interaction force terms m im between fluid i w o and matrix drag force represents the interaction between the oil and water phase and is modeled as ambrosi and preziosi 2002 preziosi and farina 2002 rajagopal 2007 16 f o w r v w v o where r dimension pa s m2 remains to be determined typically r sosw to reflect that this force term will vanish when one of the phases vanishes similarly the interaction force between fluid and pore wall matrix which is stagnant is naturally expressed then as ambrosi and preziosi 2002 preziosi and farina 2002 rajagopal 2007 rajagopal and tao 1995 17 m i m r i v i i w o the coefficients r and ri dimension pa s m2 that characterize the magnitude of interaction terms can be chosen such that the model recovers the classical porous media model based on darcy s law at the same time the approach used here will open for development of reservoir models where more detailed physics can be taken into account 2 3 2 formulation in 1 d

20 and using the notation introduced in 22 we get 25 u w u t f w w δ ρ g w x p c u o u t f o w δ ρ g w x p c with δ ρ ρ w ρ o where we have defined 26 f w s w λ w λ t λ w λ w λ o s w 2 r o s w r s w 2

ϕ s w x u t f w w δ ρ g x w x p c 0 x h the generalized model 27 can be solved once we have computed ut as mentioned before we can apply x to 23 and make use of 28 x u t 0 to obtain a second order elliptic equation for pw this is combined with appropriate boundary conditions and the available saturation sw having computed pw we can obtain ut which is defined by 23 we refer to section 3 for details note that 27 takes the same form as the conventional model 7 except that the term w has an additional term compared to the product λ o f w as in the conventional model see 26 remark 2 2 a closer inspection of the momentum force balance eqs 18 shows that we can extract information about the role played by the fluid fluid interaction term r v o w w for the two different flow regimes of co current and counter current flow a for co current flow it follows that vw and vo have the same sign let us assume that vw vo 0 if vw vo then r v o v w 0 consequently it follows from 18 1 holding sw x pw and swρwg fixed that there is a reduction in the magnitude of vw compared to the case with r 0 on the other hand since r v o v w 0 it is clear from 18 2 that vo must increase in order to maintain the force balance consequently the influence from the fluid fluid interaction term is that is generates a deceleration of the fluid with highest velocity vw and an acceleration of the slowest fluid vo b for counter current flow it follows that vw and vo have the opposite sign let us assume that vw 0 and vo 0 then r v o v w 0 and in view of the balance law 18 1 it is clear that this must generate a reduced vw compared to the case with r 0 similarly 18 2 combined with the fact that r v o v w 0 allows us to conclude that vo must also decrease consequently the influence from the fluid fluid interaction term is that is generates a deceleration of both fluids remark 2 3 co current flow is accounted for by the u t f i term in 25 whereas counter current flow is represented by the capillary pressure and gravity related terms with coefficient w the precise role of the fluid rock interaction force term and the fluid fluid interaction term is expressed by ri and r respectively in the expression for f w and w in 26 the occurrence of the fluid fluid interaction coefficient r in the co current term f i as well as the counter current term w expresses exactly the behavior more loosely observed in remark 2 2 for example for counter current flow it follows from the expression for w that r 0 will give rise to a deceleration effect for both fluids for co current flow a decrease in uw due to a decrease in f w caused by the presence of r corresponds to an increase in uo since f o 1 f w this is in accordance with several experimental observations as mentioned in the introduction see for example bentsen and manai 1992 1993 bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 sherafati and jessen 2017 and references therein remark 2 4 the essential difference between the conventional model and the generalized comes to the surface in the expression for the counter current related coefficient w in 26 2 conventional modeling amounts to using f w λ o whereas the generalized model includes a correction term that depends on the strength r of the fluid fluid interaction hence it is clear that the generalized mobility functions 22 have a built in capacity to compensate for a change in flow regime counter current versus co current or a mixture of these two in section 4 we will test how the generalized model can account for both flow regimes co and counter current flow in a relevant manner with one and the same set of parameters in contrast to a conventional model that must use different mobility functions depending on the flow regime under consideration before we are ready for that we will need to specify expressions for the interactions coefficients ri i w o and r 2 3 3 interaction terms the frictional interaction terms must be specified for computing f w and w in 27 it is clear that the solid fluid interaction terms r i i w o should obey the relationship ri μi k in order to be consistent with standard porous media flow formulation based on darcy s law 2 the following interaction terms were suggested to be included in the generalized model 21 in order to capture the interaction effects between two movable fluids when they are flowing simultaneously through a porous

are represented by f w and f o the corresponding generalized mobility functions are given by λ w and λ o as expressed in 22 this gives rise to generalized relative permeabilities k r i for i w o

calculate sw x t a local time step forward assuming ut is held fixed using the transport eq 41 1 3 iterate until full simulation time has been obtained based on the variables pw ut sw output variables such as pc uo uw and oil recovery can be calculated the model was discretized into 300 cells in the x direction with sufficiently small time steps to achieve acceptable resolution and convergence 3 1 buoyancy for a simple interpretation of ut a special case can be considered at initial state we have a uniform saturation profile with thus a fixed capillary pressure in the block which yields from 41 2 44 u t 0 λ t 0 x p w 0 g λ w 0 ρ w λ o 0 ρ o where u t 0 is the initial total darcy velocity and all mobilities are evaluated at swr as denoted by the index 0 since the water pressure is continuous with the hydrostatic pressure at both boundaries we can set x p w 0 ρ w g to obtain 45 u t 0 λ o 0 δ ρ g demonstrating that gravity controlled by the density difference of water and oil and by the mobility of oil in particular initiate a co current flow of the phases in upwards direction negative ut as seen from the general eq 41 2 further changes in ut depend on the distribution of pressure and saturations along the block 4 results and discussion a possible challenge for reservoir simulation is that conventional mobility functions based on relative permeability functions obtained through co current flow experiments do not represent well other flow regimes where strong counter current effects are involved bentsen and manai 1992 1993 bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 sherafati and jessen 2017 the root of this problem is the ignorance of fluid fluid interaction in conventional modeling based on darcy s law consequently the drag force effect between two moving fluids for which co current flow leads to a deceleration effect for the fluid with highest speed and an acceleration effect for the slower moving fluid and for counter current flow leads to a deceleration of both fluids is ignored we refer to remarks 2 2 and 2 3 for details normally this problem is fixed by manually reducing the mobility functions relative permeability functions when used for flow scenarios that involve counter current flow however realistic flow systems will often involve a more or less complicated mixture of these two flow regimes the main purpose of this section is to explore how the generalized model seems to offer some improvements compared to conventional modeling by providing generalized mobility functions that automatically are able to capture several flow regimes for one and the same parameter set careful investigations are carried out for the flow system in fig 1 where we compare the behavior predicted by the conventional model and the generalized see remark 2 4 for a precise description of the difference between the generalized and conventional model first motivated by experimental data from bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 where co currently measured relative permeability curves were obtained and counter current spontaneous imbibition for the same rock fluid system was measured we provide a set of parameters in section 4 1 needed in the generalized model that lead to a good match see also remark 2 5 these data are then used in all further simulations to define f w and w in 26 for reference it is demonstrated that the conventional and generalized models produce equivalent results in strictly co current flow in section 4 2 1 the ability of the model to capture reduced mobility effects seen in experimental data during counter current flow is demonstrated in section 4 2 2 next in section 4 3 we carefully test the two models generalized and conventional for our flow system we discuss three cases i a gravity dominated case with well defined co current vertical flow ii a capillary pressure flow dominated case i e counter current dominated when all open phases are exposed to water iii a combination where gravity and capillary pressure forces have similar strength mixed flow regimes this allows us to obtain precise insight into differences and similarities between the conventional and the generalized model the numerical scheme was validated by comparison of the conventional model simulations of these cases with results obtained from the commercial simulator eclipse 100 we refer to appendix c for this demonstration 4 1 input data the input parameters table 1 used in the simulations are mainly collected from bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 to put more emphasis on gravity we use a block of 0 5 m height which is 70 higher than in their experiments their measured relative permeability data from co current flow were matched as described in the following the end points are related by 46 i w 1 k r w m a x i o 1 k r o m a x as found by setting s o 1 or s w 1 in 31 the expression 31 was further matched to the shape of the data by varying the parameters i α and β we recall that the interaction term i reflects the strength of the fluid fluid interaction term r see 29 by assigning a certain value i 0 to this term it follows that we account for viscous coupling information that will be important when we consider other flow regimes that involve counter current type of flow due to gravity and or capillary pressure in particular the magnitude of i is also quality checked by assessing the simulated rate of counter current spontaneous imbibition against experimental measurements performed by bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 on the same rock fluid system as where co current relative permeabilities were measured this role played by i is explicitly reflected by the expression for w see 26 2 or 30 2 and contains effects not accounted for in the conventional modeling which amounts to using the coefficient f w λ o in fig 3 we show a plot of w and the conventional part f w λ o which illustrates the effect from fluid fluid interaction term r the co current relative permeability curves shown in fig 2 and represented by 31 are given as direct input in the conventional model the viscous coupling effects which occur during co current flow is thus integrated in these curves but are implicitly assumed not to change in the conventional model when we consider other flow scenarios involving counter current effects due to gravity and or capillary pressure by using the generalized model this assumption of fixed curves is put to a test since generalized mobilities are related to both phase pressure gradients see 19 and 21 hence this representation of the relative permeabilities is more general and it is expected that it is capable of capturing effects due to flow direction and or interaction between the fluids and solids we refer to section 4 2 2 for an example that illustrates this clearly note that the same parameterization given in table 1 is applied to both models in the following remark 4 1 note that we have two equivalent formulations of fluid velocity for instance uw in the generalized model i the use of two mobility functions λ w w and λ w o one associated with x pw the other with x po as in 19 ii the use of phase mobility functions λ w λ w w λ w o and λ o λ o w λ o o associated with pure co current flow see 25 1 and 26 1 combined with inclusion of capillary pressure driven counter current flow with a non conventional coefficient w given by 26 2 4 2 basic validation 4 2 1 model comparison during co current flow in this example the generalized and conventional models are for validation purposes compared under conditions that should yield identical results a pure co current flow test was considered this was realized by assuming p c s w 0 and that the phase outside the block at the top was oil instead of water as assumed in fig 1 then a stable gravity displacement of the low density oil in the block by high density water is achieved in co current fashion due to buoyancy all counter current terms are negligible in this situation the comparison of the conventional and generalized model revealed a perfect match as shown in fig 4 this may be explained as follows as mentioned the difference between the two models lies in the coefficient in front of the gravity term appearing in 41 1 one uses λ o f w conventional the other uses w generalized in fig 5 we include plots of the corresponding total advective gravitational fluxes f c o n s w u t f w λ o f w δ ρ g and f g e n s w u t f w w δ ρ g see 41 for a fixed time t where u t u t 0 10 where u t 0 is the initial total darcy velocity of the system for this flow case an upward moving front increasing jump in scaled saturation from 0 to 1 is formed at the bottom according to the theory of solutions of riemann problems for scalar nonlinear conservation laws see chapter 16 in le veque 2002 the entropy satisfying solution is given in terms of a shock solution that moves with the speed s determined by the rankine hugoniot condition s f i 1 f i 0 1 for i c o n g e n consequently it is only the endpoints of the two functions fi that matter more precisely the construction of the solution depends on the lower convex hull of fi sw in the interval 0 1 and this is the same for both i c o n and i g e n see fig 5 right where the lower convex hull is indicated for this example and more explanation hence there is not room for any effects from the fluid fluid interaction term which makes good sense due to the fact that r swso see 29 such that the difference between w and f w λ o does not affect end points see also fig 3 some rapid variations in the phase velocity curves is observed around x 0 075 m after 467 1 hours when ut is low this is related to the slope change of the advection gravitational flux 4 2 2 comparison against experimental counter current data secondly the generalized and conventional models were used to simulate a strictly counter current spontaneous imbibition test where the bottom boundary is closed in fig 1 and both capillary and gravity effects are considered this case was conducted experimentally in bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 using the indicated data shown in table 1 except for a core of length 0 29 m thus also implemented in the simulations here the results in terms of oil recovery are shown in fig 6 we observe that the generalized model produces an oil recovery curve that largely matches the experimental results this nice prediction also justifies the value of the interaction coefficient i resulting from matching the relative permeability curves the conventional model which directly implements the co currently measured relative permeabilities yields higher recovery rates than the experimental data and generalized model in particular the mobility associated with the counter current flow effect is too strong which is expected since the relative permeability curves used are based on co current flow regime motivated by these results we now turn our attention to the flow system depicted in fig 1 and represented by the model 41 42 and 43 4 3 investigation of flow regimes 4 3 1 case i capillary dominated system for the capillary dominated case we reduce all terms related to gravity to negligible magnitude both in the transport eqs 7 and 27 and the velocity eqs 3 and 23 also the capillary pressure at x h goes to 0 see 38 the system can thus be regarded as a purely counter current spontaneous imbibition process fig 7 shows the profiles of water and oil darcy velocities uw x uo x and normalized water saturation sw x at three given times 1 5 15 5 and 46 6 h corresponding to rf 15 50 and 85 in the conventional model respectively the duration of the test is 150 hours due to the counter current dominated process and equal boundary conditions the profiles are symmetric during counter current flow both phases decelerate as is seen from the form of the coefficient w in 26 2 which reflects the additional viscous coupling effects through the r dependent term as a consequence the inflowing water fronts move slower compared to the conventional model where the co current relative permeabilities are applied which amounts to using f w λ o as the capillary pressure coefficient the saturation profiles predicted by the generalized model are delayed and the imbibition process is generally slower the saturation fronts almost converge after 15 5 h and the center saturation is at 75 after 46 6 h in the conventional model while in the generalized model all saturations have travelled significantly shorter distance from the boundaries it is also observed that the discrepancy between the two model saturation profiles increases as time elapses fig 8 shows the total darcy velocity ut from 3 and 23 and oil recovery from 40 plotted vs time the total velocity is zero throughout the process indicative of counter current flow recovery by spontaneous imbibition from a linear system follows a square root of time profile until significant boundary effects are encountered andersen et al 2014 the generalized model displays a slower imbibition process than the conventional model with lower recovery than the conventional model at all times at 90 recovery there is around 23 h delay in time between the models 55 vs 78 h which means the time scale has increased by roughly 42 the conventional model represents the ideal but unrealistic behavior of the reservoir in the sense that the co current relative permeabilities do not account for the change in viscous coupling that reduce the phase velocities both models do however produce the same end recovery which is given by the saturation where the capillary forces vanish p c 0 corresponding to sw 1 as seen in fig 2 and rf 1 4 3 2 case ii gravity dominated system in this case we assume that capillary effects are ignored in the system and pc sw is equal to 0 everywhere including the boundary conditions thus all terms related to capillary pressure are neglected both in the transport eqs 7 and 27 and the velocity eqs 3 and 23 this case is similar to the one studied in section 4 2 2 except that water is now available to enter the block also at the top this will give rise to interesting new behavior as water entering at the top will form a downward going water front striking differences will be seen between the upward going water front and the downward moving front that elucidate the role of viscous coupling effects fig 9 shows the profiles of water and oil darcy velocities uw x uo x and normalized water saturation sw x at three given times 11 8 89 1 and 258 1 h corresponding to 15 50 and 85 oil recovery in the conventional model the system is no longer symmetric rather one can see that the system is predominantly co current at 11 8 h we see that near the bottom water has a large negative velocity moves upwards while oil has been displaced and has negligible flux there in the upper part of the system mainly oil flows upwards while water has a negligible flux dense water slowly migrating from the top converges with the co current water front travelling from the bottom of the block at 258 1 h resulting in a more complex flow pattern at this time the uppermost region 0 x 0 15 m in the conventional model and 0 x 0 07 m in the generalized model displays significant velocities for both phases in opposite directions i e this region displays counter current flow this advanced flow pattern is a combination of co and counter current flow initially dominated by co current it is thus seen that the conventional and generalized models produce almost equivalent profiles in the lower part of the block even after 258 1 h 85 recovery while the counter current wave travelling from the top results in significantly different behavior between the two models due to viscous coupling effects what is the precise explanation of the difference seen in the behavior at the top this can be explained as follows as noted for the case in section 4 2 1 the behavior in the conventional model and the generalized is completely determined by the flux functions fi for i c o n g e n and their lower convex hull as described and shown in fig 5 this explains the alikeness in the behavior at the bottom see section 4 2 2 however at the top there is a decreasing jump formed the riemann problem for a decreasing jump is dictated by the upper convex hull of fi which will be different for fcon sw and fgen sw we refer to fig 5 for illustrations in particular we see from the upper convex hull of fgen sw that for the generalized model a slowly moving front will be formed that jumps from s w 0 to approximately s w 0 45 followed by a rarefaction wave the conventional model however will produce according to the upper convex hull of fcon sw a fast moving front that jumps from s w 0 to approximately s w 0 5 followed by a rarefaction wave fig 10 illustrates the total darcy velocity 3 and 23 and oil recovery 40 vs time all the mobile oil is recovered during the gravity drainage process such that r f 1 in the end the delay in oil recovery between the two models is significantly reduced compared to the previous example fig 8 there is around 24 3 time delay when comparing the end states of the oil recovery processes 370 h for the conventional model and 460 h for the generalized model since the flow is mainly co current using the co current relative permeabilities in the conventional model gives a better description of the system in this case with less deviation from the generalized model compared to the counter current case it is further worth noticing that the rate ut displayed in fig 10 left does not show distinct model behavior until after 260 h corresponding to the time when the co current and counter current waves in the conventional model meet see fig 9 the recovery factor seen in fig 10 right on the other hand differs visible already after 60 h which is due to the importance of counter currently produced oil at this time 4 3 3 case iii combined flow regimes in this case we consider the situation with inclusion of both gravity and capillary terms which will give rise to mixed co current and counter current driven flow both in the conventional and generalized model in order to clearly see this mixed effect we reduce the interfacial tension σ by five times since the magnitude of capillary pressure shown in fig 2 is much higher than the gravity force variations of water and oil darcy velocities uw uo and normalized water saturation sw in space and time logarithmic are shown in fig 11 the highest darcy velocities are seen at the top and bottom faces of the block and the magnitudes are similar at the top and bottom although there are some differences this can be explained by capillary forces being strong compared to gravity fig 12 shows the profiles of water and oil darcy velocities uw x uo x and normalized water saturation sw x at the given times 4 8 43 9 and 126 h corresponding to rf 15 50 and 85 in the conventional model fig 12 shows that there are strong phase velocities near the bottom and top of the block decreasing towards the center however there is also a net co current flow upwards due to gravity that also mobilizes the central oil even before the imbibition front reaches the center as seen in the central region the velocity profiles in fig 12 are not symmetric at 4 8 h and 43 9 h but shifted towards more negative values due to co current flow upwards it is thus seen that more water has entered the block from the bottom although a significant imbibition front has also entered from the top the generalized model velocities are lower in the outer regions where counter current flow dominates at 126 h the two models produce more asymmetric behavior at the upper part of the core and the two phases travel in opposite directions over a larger part of the core 0 x 0 2 m and 0 3 x 0 5 m only the central region displays co current flow both uw and uo are negative both phases travel upwards at earlier times larger fractions of the block display co current flow in other words it appears that counter current flow becomes more dominant with time comparing the saturation profiles in fig 12 especially after 43 9 h it is seen that the water fronts travelling from the top behave more different between the conventional and generalized model compared to the front travelling from the bottom of the block this can be attributed to the observation that gravity enhances counter current flow at the top while it counter acts capillary diffusion and works to keep the phases separate at the bottom for this reason the generalized model exhibits more delay compared to the conventional model at the top than it does at the bottom in similarity with the gravity dominated case it appears thus that also here the main delay in recovery occurs at late times see fig 13 right the overall delay is situated in magnitude between the two previously shown cases i and ii 5 conclusions this paper presents a model where momentum equations based on a general mixture theory replace darcy s law in order to account for viscous coupling between the fluid phases and between fluid and rock we carry out a systematic comparison of the generalized model and the conventional model darcy based approach for a specific flow case relevant for naturally fractured reservoirs to parameterize the model realistically we match experimental data from bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 where co current and counter current data were able to distinguish such effects quantitatively in the conventional model we directly apply co current relative permeability curves while in the generalized model relative permeability curves are a result of using more general momentum balance equations the exact difference between the two models is manifested in the counter current coefficient w expressed in 26 2 the inclusion of the fluid fluid interaction term r implies that the term w contains a modification that automatically accounts for counter current effects not captured by the conventional model as a demonstration of the model we consider gravity aided spontaneous imbibition into a matrix block fully surrounded by water on all sides representative of the conditions in a naturally fractured reservoir the geometry was 1 d with flow along the vertical axis only it should be noted that both initial state boundary conditions and bond number contribute to the flow regimes for different situations the choice of having all open sides exposed to water allowed flow conditions where co and counter current flow regimes were naturally involved based on a systematic study of the model behavior we reach the following conclusions directly implementing co currently measured relative permeability curves as is standard into reservoir simulation may yield too optimistic results since viscous coupling can be enhanced at more general flow regimes in the capillary dominated case all open faces exposed to water the flow is mainly counter current this results in significant viscous coupling and increases the time scale of recovery in the gravity dominated case the flow is mainly co current upwards buoyancy although some counter current flow at the top dense water sinking opposite way of light oil produces viscous interaction also in this case directly applying co currently measured relative permeabilities from the lab is a better assumption under such conditions than for strongly counter current flow and the conventional and generalized models produced very similar behavior increasing the magnitude of capillary forces results in more counter current flow and thus more viscous coupling larger differences were observed between the conventional and generalized models interestingly the simulations indicate that the viscous coupling effects could become more significant with time in combined cases where both gravity and capillary pressure forces are present as counter current flow dominates a larger portion of the core at late times the generalized model apparently can automatically capture fluid fluid interaction effects and better represent mobility functions for mixed flow regimes the usefulness and validity of the proposed model has been demonstrated in this work by matching experimental data with evident features of viscous coupling and by demonstrating the listed trends in fluid transport with flow regime previous works have demonstrated the model s ability to capture experimental non standard trends in relative permeability functions with variations in viscosity ratio and flow direction standnes et al 2017 and also the ability to improve scaling of counter current spontaneous imbibition at conditions where viscous coupling should be more pronounced standnes and andersen 2017 the proposed model equipped with generalized mobility functions should however be further tested regarding its ability to capture different flow behavior using one and the same parameter set for more general cases and flow regimes an interesting direction to explore could be to combine or compare the proposed generalized model with approaches like the barenblatt model where the saturation functions only gradually approach unique relations with saturation two natural questions in that context are which experimental features could be captured both by the barenblatt model and our generalized model and what would be distinct obviously both models would predict reduced mobility during spontaneous imbibition a transient process as compared to steady state measured relative permeability curves the mechanisms are different though as the barenblatt model would display visible distinctions only during transient flow while the generalized model is sensitive also to variations in steady state flow regimes standnes et al 2017 what would be the effect of introducing the non equilibrium effect of the barenblatt approach in our generalized model and how could this be distinguished from current mechanisms one such feature could lie in the transient nature more apparent in the barenblatt model while flow regime and perhaps not so much time changes affects the generalized model further tortuosity cai et al 2014 could be a relevant parameter to incorporate as the actual travel length of the fluids should be more closely related to the overall momentum transfer and pressure drop for a given core sample than the straight line path these questions and others considered to be beyond the scope of the current manuscript will be addressed in future work acknowledgements the 1st author thanks the research council

mixture theory a 1 continuity and momentum equations for simplicity reason we consider a mixture of two phases i 1 2 and let θi v i and ρi denote volume fraction velocity intrinsic and density of phase i we assume incompressible fluids and that there is no source terms 47 t θ i θ i v i 0 i 1 2 the intrinsic velocity v i is related to the superficial velocity darcy velocity u i by u i θ i v i the no voids constraint implies that the volume fractions must sum to unity 48 θ 1 θ 2 1 the dynamics of the phases at any point will be described using a flow model whereby the motion of each phase is in response to the stress within that phase and the pressures exerted by the other component phases neglecting inertial effects including the momentum change caused by interchange of mass between the phases the momentum balance equation for phase i is 49 θ 1 ψ 1 f 12 g 1 0 θ 2 ψ 2 f 21 g 2 0 where ψ i refers to the macroscopic averaged stress tensor associated with phase i whereas the quantity f ij denotes the interphase force which is exerted by the jth phase on the ith phase clearly f i j f j i by newton s third law finally g i θ i ρ i g refers to the external body force on phase i due to gravity and g refers to the gravity vector with the direction of gravitational pull and magnitude g 9 8 a 2 interphase forces f ij the interphase forces f ij represent the forces acting at the interfaces between pairs of phases many works assume that a simplified approach can be used whereby these forces are expressed in terms of interphase pressure and drag force components the following expression is postulated 50 f 12 p 12 θ 2 θ 1 p 21 θ 1 θ 2 β 12 θ 1 θ 2 v 2 v 1 f 21 p 21 θ 1 θ 2 p 12 θ 2 θ 1 β 21 θ 1 θ 2 v 1 v 2 we refer to lemon et al 2006 for more details regarding the interpretation of the different terms here we simply note that different relations have been proposed by various authors motivated by the special flow system under consideration we see that if β 12 β 21 and p 12 p 21 then 50 simplifies to 51 f 12 p 12 θ 1 β 12 θ 1 θ 2 v 2 v 1 f 21 p 21 θ 2 β 21 θ 1 θ 2 v 1 v 2 in view of 48 and it follows that f 12 f 21 note that solid components like structural proteins that comprise the matrix in connective tissue in the context of tissue engineering or rock in the context of multiphase flow in a reservoir can also naturally be included within this modeling framework in this case the momentum balance 49 is not relevant since the velocity associated with this phase is zero if deformation of the matrix is ignored however the volume fraction of this solid phase must of course be taken into account as well as interaction force terms the last term on the right hand side of 51 a 3 constitutive relations as described in lemon et al 2006 the partial stress tensor ψ i is decomposed into the following form 52 ψ i p i i ψ i d i 1 2 where pi refers to the locally averaged intraphase pressure for phase i and ψ i d is the deviatoric part of the partial stress tensor and i is the identity tensor at the microscopic scale ψ i d is related to the intrinsic velocity on a local scale v i for viscous fluids 53 ψ i d μ i v i v i t κ i v i i i 1 2 which includes both the effect of shear viscosity μi and bulk viscosity κi on a macroscopic scale where velocities are averaged over a representative elementary volume rev i e giving the intrinsic average velocities v i the form of the stress term must be more carefully evaluated several works account for the viscous stress term ψ i d by directly implementing the average interstitial velocities v i into 53 see lemon et al 2006 schuff et al 2013 wu et al 2017 on the other hand when defining the partial stress of a fluid constituent the viscous forces are also often neglected such that ψ i d 0 in 52 see e g ambrosi and preziosi 2002 lemon et al 2006 for a porous media in which the fluid drag on the porous matrix dominates this may be a valid assumption as mentioned in rajagopal 2007 the underlying assumptions imply that the viscosity of the fluid and the roughness of the solid surface lead to far greater frictional resistance and hence dissipation at the porous boundaries of the solid in comparison to the frictional resistance and hence the dissipation in the fluid note that the above modeling framework is general enough to also account for elastic deformation of for example the solid matrix components in a reservoir modeling of deformation of solid components like matrix constituents in a reservoir or tissue growth involving elastic constituents is significantly more complicated and implies that we cannot assume that ψ i d 0 schuff et al 2013 an interesting example of this can be found in ambrosi and preziosi 2009 which focuses on flow systems composed of cells viscous fluid extracellular matrix solid constituent and water inviscid fluid where also elastic deformation is taken into consideration in the mathematical formulation this gives rise to a stress tensor ψ i d where the extracellular matrix is treated as a compressible elastic body remark a 1 an instructive overview is given in rajagopal 2007 of how generalizations of the standard darcy s law for single phase flow can be derived within the context of mixture theory starting with more general momentum balance equations and using different sets of assumptions leads to a hierarchy of mathematical models in particular it can be shown that popular models due to brinkman biot and many others can be obtained via various approximations for example brinkman s equation see 54 accounts for frictional effects in the fluid by using a partial stress tensor 53 where the first term is included this may be relevant for porous media having large permeability and or being dominated by a network of fractures the resulting momentum balance equation then takes the following form for a fluid matrix system 54 p α 0 v ρ b μ v where the quantities refer to the fluid phase i e p is fluid pressure and v is pore velocity ρ phase density and μ phase viscosity b denotes external body forces e g for gravity b g and α 0 the magnitude of the fluid matrix drag force the final term involving second order derivatives of velocity marks a clear distinction from darcy s law for single phase flow further extension of the viscous stress tensor is necessary in order to account for non newtonian fluid properties corresponding to shear thickening or shear thinning behavior rajagopal 2007 we refer to the same work for more discussions related to weakly compressible fluids and small deformations and appropriate extensions of darcy s equation remark a 2 water weakening effects and deformation of solid matrix constituents are currently subject to extensive experimental investigations andersen et al 2017b various creep tests are carried out to detect detailed mechanisms related to deformation of matrix in chalk reservoirs however this behavior cannot be separated from the flow of liquid phases which carry various chemicals that may react with the solid components and thereby have an impact of the deformation behavior at the same time these fluids and their chemical components may also have an impact on the solid fluid interaction terms as well as fluid fluid interaction terms the mixture theory formulation seems to offer a framework that is broad enough to allow for mathematical models that can bring together systematic studies of all these different aspects of multiphase flow in a reservoir remark a 3 development of models within the framework of mixture theory has found many applications within the study of multiphase flow in porous media relevant for life science biomechanics see for instance ambrosi and preziosi 2002 byrne and preziosi 2003 preziosi and farina 2002 see also evje 2017 for a recent work where a general compressible cell fluid model with interaction terms similar to 16 and 17 is proposed to explore cancer cell migration dynamics for mathematical results related to compressible versions of two fluid models that involve gravity driven segregation see evje and wen 2015 and for models that discuss the role of capillary pressure and its

881,population growth and changes in climate and diets will likely further increase the pressure on agriculture and water resources globally currently staple crops are obtained from annuals plants a shift towards perennial crops may enhance many ecosystem services but at the cost of higher water requirements and lower yields it is still unclear when the advantages of perennial crops overcome their disadvantages and perennial crops are thus a sustainable solution here we combine a probabilistic description of the soil water balance and crop development with an extensive dataset of traits of congeneric annuals and perennials to identify the conditions for which perennial crops are more viable than annual ones with reference to yield yield stability and effective use of water we show that the larger and more developed roots of perennial crops allow a better exploitation of soil water resources and a reduction of yield variability with respect to annual species but their yields remain lower when considering grain crops furthermore perennial crops have higher and more variable irrigation requirements and lower water productivity these results are important to understand the potential consequences for yield its stability and water resource use of a shift from annual to perennial crops and more generally if perennial crops may be more resilient than annual crops in the face of climatic fluctuations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agricultural sustainability water productivity annual crops perennial crops stochastic model irrigation 1 introduction the 2030 agenda for sustainable developmental goals calls for zero hunger and sustainable consumption and production while at the same time preserving life on land and in water clean water and acting to limit climate change united nations 2015 among other steps meeting these goals will require sufficient and stable yields produced in a sustainable way currently intensive agriculture relies primarily on annual crops meyer et al 2012 monfreda et al 2008 raun and johnson 1999 a shift from annual to perennial crops has been advocated as a way to enhance the sustainability of crop production because perennial plants have the ability to provide a number of diverse ecosystem services batello et al 2014 cox et al 2006 crews 2005 dehaan et al 2005 glover et al 2010b kantar et al 2016 pimentel et al 2012 perennial crops cover the soil throughout the year have low tillage requirements beyond the establishment year and have larger belowground biomass than annual crops as a result with respect to annual crops perennials reduce soil erosion and water and nutrient losses may achieve higher nutrient and water uptake efficiencies and may enhance soil carbon sequestration culman et al 2013 randall and mulla 2001 zan et al 2001 furthermore perennial crops improve soil biological physical and chemical properties e g by sustaining a larger microbial biomass and a more diverse nematode population culman et al 2013 dupont et al 2014 glover et al 2010a beyond the provisioning of ecosystem services sustainable agriculture must ensure yield production with an effective use of available resources in terms of arable lands i e providing adequate yields per unit cultivated areas water and nutrients regarding yields perennial plants tend to allocate less resources to reproduction structures prioritizing instead storage structures for extended survival bazzaz et al 1987 bloom et al 1985 this pattern emerges also among most of the newly developed perennial cereal crops perennial wheat and perennial rice hayes et al 2012 larkin et al 2014 murphy et al 2009 pogna et al 2014 sacks et al 2003 2006 2007 scheinost et al 2001 particularly among those varieties exhibiting a higher survival after the first year vico et al 2016 this resource allocation pattern is problematic when seeds represent the sought product as in grain crops nevertheless perennial plants tend to be larger than their annual counterparts this is a clear advantage when aiming at biomass production e g for biofuels or feed but may also partially counterbalance the lower allocation to seed when considering seed yields as in grain crops recent estimates suggest that perennial cereals could provide average seed yields comparable to the annual ones should they achieve a biomass increase over the years similar to those of some other existing perennial grasses vico et al 2016 water is already in scarce supply in many regions climate change with warmer temperatures and more frequent dry spells may further exacerbate water scarcity crop water requirements and use patterns are thus key aspects for future sustainable agriculture perennial crops are generally considered more drought tolerant than annual ones glover et al 2010b van tassel et al 2014 indeed perennial plants by allocating more resources below ground may develop more extensive rooting systems accessing deeper soil layers and thus resources not available to annual plants furthermore developing deeper and denser rooting systems enhances plant tolerance to dry periods canadell et al 1996 chaves et al 2002 by buffering against fluctuations in water availability perennial crops may thus have an advantage during dry periods and result in more stable yields because of their access to deeper water stores this is a key aspect to ensure stable yields under future conditions when more intermittent precipitation and higher temperatures may lead to more frequent or more severe periods of water scarcity at the same time the larger transpiring biomass typical of perennial plants may result in higher gross plant water needs thus accelerating soil moisture depletion and potentially exposing the plants to more frequent water stress than annuals this raises the question if the extended rooting system typical of perennial plants is sufficient to meet the higher water demands potentially generated by a larger transpiring biomass and buffer against dry spells or will additional irrigation be required additionally can perennial grain crops lead to more crop per drop despite their lower allocation of resources to seeds answers to these questions are a necessary step to ensure that the advocated shift from annual to perennial crops truly enhances the sustainability of crop production system not only in terms of yields and provision of a diverse set of ecosystem services but also for an effective use of available water resources in the face of future more variable and potentially drier climates so far this issue has not been investigated in detail either experimentally or via modeling most of the existing assessments of yields and water use do not compare annual and perennial crops those that do so focus on bioenergy crops and compare crops with very different genetic background e g corn or soybean vs miscanthus or switchgrass the only exception to date is culman et al 2013 where a two year field comparison of annual and perennial wheat showed that perennial wheat had lower yields than annual wheat and resulted in lower or comparable soil moisture levels this result is suggestive of a higher water use and lower water use efficiency of perennial wheat to address this knowledge gap here we combine the results of an extensive meta analysis of annual and perennial plant traits and a stochastic model of crop yield accounting for the randomness in precipitation we quantify yields and their variability water productivity and irrigation water requirements in annual and perennial plants the goals are i to identify the climatic conditions under which perennial crops with specific traits allow for higher or more stable yields lower water requirements and a more efficient use of water than annual crops and when conversely annual crops are preferable and ii to define the key traits that perennial crops must possess in order to be sustainable also with respect to yield yield stability and efficient water use 2 methods informed decisions on the viability of annual vs perennial crops under certain environmental and management conditions require quantitative knowledge on their performances in terms of productivity and sustainability to this aim we compare annual and perennial crops grown under the same soil and environmental conditions a minimalist stochastic model coupling the dynamics of plant available soil moisture crop development and yield formation section 2 1 is parameterized for prototype annual and perennial crops section 2 2 their performances are contrasted with reference to several metrics of productivity and sustainability and their year to year variability section 2 3 to focus on the potential differences in performance deriving from expected life span and the associated plant traits annuals and perennials are assumed to be subjected to the same management practices in addition different climatic scenarios are explored 2 1 crop development and yield and the soil water balance to limit parameter requirements we employ a minimalist description of crop development and yield formation we focus on the crop development during the main growing season of duration tmain i e the period starting a few days after emergence or when sustained growth is resumed after the winter and ending when biomass growth rate tapers off and resources start to be allocated to reproductive and storage structures during this period the crop biomass growth is largely independent of the existing biomass i e the growth is approximately linear monteith 2000 with an extreme simplification of the complex processes driving plant growth during the main growing season and focusing on water as the most limiting factor it is assumed that plant growth occurs at rate g when water availability is adequate conversely when water is limited the growth rate decreases to g vico and porporato 2013 the alternation of periods of well watered and water stressed conditions drives the accumulation of biomass during the main growing season and in turn the final yield in turn the plant biomass at the end of the main growing season provides the starting point for a simple yet robust estimate of the final yield exploiting the concept of harvest index hi representing the fraction of the final plant biomass corresponding to the marketable yield more details on the description of the crop development model are reported in the appendix a1 the alternation of periods of well watered and water stressed conditions is determined by the soil moisture balance laio et al 2001 extending over the ecohydrologically active rooting zone of depth zr where most of the roots are located the plant available soil moisture averaged over zr s t is driven by the inputs via precipitation and irrigation if any and the losses via actual evapotranspiration surficial runoff and deep percolation rainfall pattern is summarized via the average frequency of rainfall events λ and the average depth of rainfall events α the actual evapotranspiration rate in turn depends on the plant available soil moisture linearly declining from etmax under well watered conditions corresponding to soil moisture levels above the threshold of incipient plant water stress s to 0 when no more water is available to plants for irrigated agriculture an efficient demand based deficit irrigation english and raja 1996 strategy is considered where irrigation is supplied whenever plant available soil moisture is depleted to a pre set level s below the threshold s vico and porporato 2011 because a demand based irrigation strategy is implemented the rainfall pattern also affects the frequency of irrigation applications and hence the total irrigation water requirements for example water requirements are lower in wetter climates more details on the soil moisture balance and the irrigation strategy are reported in the appendix a1 this simple description of the coupled plant available soil moisture crop development and yield formation allows an analytical solution to the probability density functions of crop biomass and hence final yield and for irrigated agriculture seasonal irrigation requirement vico and porporato 2013 this analytical approach allows for the full accounting of the unpredictability of rainfall events without requiring computationally heavy monte carlo simulations the results are summarized in the form of averages and standard deviations of the key random variables yields and irrigation requirements for irrigated agriculture they can be readily obtained via integration of the probability density functions see section a2 in the appendix knowledge of the standard deviations of these key indicators permits the assessment of the year to year stability of yield and water requirement stability for an in depth understanding annuals and perennials are compared for two management strategies i e rainfed and irrigated agriculture and different climatic scenarios we explore total annual rainfall ranging from 300 to 1300 mm as a result of an increase in rainfall frequency λ but assuming constant average depth of rainfall events α 2 2 parameterization of annual and perennial crops in the above description the parameters defining crop development and yield formation are i the evapotranspiration rate per unit ground area under well watered conditions etmax ii the ecohydrologically active rooting depth zr iii the biomass growth rate under well watered conditions g iv the crop response to water stress i e the water limited growth rate g and the soil moisture level at incipient plant water stress s v the harvest index hi and vi the duration of the main growing season tmain to facilitate the comparison between annual and perennial species we employ a prototype annual grain crop and a prototype annual biomass crop the corresponding perennial crops are defined with reference to the prototype annual crop assuming a proportionality between the traits of the perennial crop and those of the corresponding annual for each trait the coefficient of proportionality is inferred from data collated in a recent meta analysis that contrasted congeneric annual subscript a and perennial subscript p species belonging to 28 genera and including a total of around 3000 congeneric annual perennial pairs vico et al 2016 the genetic closeness of congeneric species allows focusing on plant life span and associated traits all else being equal kelly and hanley 2005 to circumvent data limitations we combine data obtained from different studies unless the parameters for annuals and perennials were directly measured the coefficient of proportionality for the generic parameter x x p x a is determined as the product of perennial to annual ratios of different traits as detailed below we combine the available trait ratios including all possible combinations to obtain a measure of the uncertainty in ratios of the parameters this approach is first applied focusing only on those congeneric pairs for which all the trait ratios are available albeit from different studies second we consider the entire dataset and a random subset of all the possible combinations even of trait ratios measured in different genera the first approach has the advantage of combining trait ratios observed in the same genera but only few ratios are available the second approach has the advantage of fully exploiting all the available data at the cost of combining information collected in different genera although each trait ratio still refers to congeneric annual perennial pairs 2 2 1 evapotranspiration rate under well watered conditions etmax available data on leaf level water vapor exchange rate eleaf suggest there is no significant difference in transpiration rate between congeneric annuals and perennials vico et al 2016 nevertheless the plant available soil moisture balance is defined per unit ground area so that the available leaf level data must be scaled up to the stand level to this aim assuming a perfect aerodynamic coupling between the leaves and the atmosphere we consider the amount of transpiring leaf area per unit ground area the latter can be expressed as the product of the specific leaf area sla the vegetative biomass per plant bveg and the planting density in turn the vegetative biomass can also be expressed as the product of the total plant biomass btot and the vegetative biomass fractions fveg i e bveg fvegbtot we note that the planting density can be neglected when considering data driven ratios between perennials and annuals because density was the same for annuals and perennials in the experiments reported in the literature the ratio of evapotranspiration rates per unit ground area for perennials and annuals can thus be expressed as a function of often measured leaf and plant traits as 1 e t m a x p e t m a x a e l e a f p e l e a f a s l a p s l a a b v e g p b v e g a e l e a f p e l e a f a s l a p s l a a f v e g p f v e g a b t o t p b t o t a the formulation on the far r h s is in principle equivalent to the one based on biomass but in practice it allows us to exploit those studies where the vegetative biomass is not explicitly reported assuming that the perennial annual ratios of biomass and biomass fraction remain substantially unchanged during the whole growing season eq 1 simply requires that biomass and biomass fraction are measured at the same stage in both annuals and perennials as is customary in the literature 2 2 2 active rooting depth zr perennials have significantly larger rooting biomass than annuals nevertheless information on root mass distribution within the soil is extremely limited and often contrasting in particular when focusing on congeneric species for example no difference in rooting depths was apparent in studies considering the early development of annual and perennial medic and wheat ward et al 2011 there the perennial wheat was a triticum x agropyron line nevertheless visual examination of roots in annual and perennial wheat kernza wheatgrass cox et al 2006 suggests the perennial wheat has deeper roots than the annual one the latter observation is in agreement with more extensive studies suggesting that perennials have deeper roots than annuals when grown in the same conditions dupont et al 2014 monti and zatta 2009 a pattern emerging also from global analyses of root distributions see e g canadell et al 1996 to proceed quantitatively we note that visual inspection of root architecture of annual and perennial wheat points to large similarities both in kernza wheatgrass and a triticum x agropyron line cox et al 2006 ward et al 2011 if annuals and perennials have the same rooting density at the soil surface and further assuming an exponential root profile as suggested by jackson et al 1996 the ratio of active rooting depths between perennials and annuals must equal the ratio of root biomass broot for the two expected life spans i e 2 z r p z r a b r o o t p b r o o t a f r o o t p f r o o t a b t o t p b t o t a as in eq 1 the formulation on the far r h s is obtained by expressing the root biomass with reference to the total plant biomass btot and the root fraction froot 2 2 3 biomass growth rate under well watered conditions g relative growth rates rgr determined early after sowing point to perennials having a lower rgr than their congeneric annual counterparts e g garnier 1992 in contrast to these early season data total plant biomass later in the season are significantly larger in perennial plants than in the congeneric annuals even if observations are conducted at the same time after sowing and even when referring to first year perennials only vico et al 2016 we consider this cumulated biomass as more representative of plant growth than early season data on rgr as it integrates plant activity over a longer period on these bases we expect that the growth rate under well watered conditions g is larger in perennials than annuals i e g p g a 1 to estimate g p g a we proceed similarly to the case of transpiration rates starting from leaf level measurements of net co2 assimilation aleaf and scaling them up to the stand scale based on biomass data our underlying assumption is that the perennial to annual ratio of co2 assimilation rates per unit ground area a m a x p a m a x a well represents the perennial to annual plant growth rate ratio during the main growing season under well watered conditions the rationale is that the fixed carbon is in part used for plant growth and the fixed carbon to growth ratio or carbon use efficiency is likely similar for plants at similar developmental stages regardless of their expected life span it follows that g p g a can be estimated as 3 g p g a a m a x p a m a x a a l e a f p a l e a f a s l a p s l a a b v e g p b v e g a a l e a f p a l e a f a s l a p s l a a f v e g p f v e g a b t o t p b t o t a 2 2 4 response to water stress s and g the need for drought tolerance is well recognized in the breeding efforts towards perennial grain crops van tassel et al 2014 nevertheless to our knowledge no study has explored in detail whether annual and perennial crops respond differently to water stress particularly in terms of growth and yield reductions when subjecting five perennial wheat lines and an annual variety to a severe drying and rewetting cycle larkin et al 2014 found that the survival and total water consumption of the perennial varieties bracketed the ones observed in the annual yet no conclusion can be drawn on productivity particularly with reference to less extreme water stress conditions common in the field moreover a comparison of non congeneric annuals and perennials showed that differences in water uptake capacity and speed cannot be explained with life span monti and zatta 2009 for these reasons in what follows annuals and perennials are assumed to have the same response to water stress i e g p g a g p g a and s p s a 1 in other words we assume that the oft mentioned higher drought tolerance of perennial crops is conferred by the access to larger water stores in the soil not by their ability to sustain plant activities at lower soil and leaf water potentials or a less marked reduction in plant activity with water stress when compared to annuals 2 2 5 duration of the main growing season tmain the duration of the growing season depends primarily on the climatic conditions and their effects on plant development management can impact the length of the growing season via the sowing date and for biomass crops via the harvest date if that is set before the plant completes its cycle as explained in section 2 1 and the appendix we focus on the main part of the growing season its duration tmain is defined by climatic conditions and plant response to them little information is available on the rate of development in annuals and perennials grown under the same conditions although gonzalez paleo and ravetta 2012 and culman et al 2013 observed an earlier flowering in annuals than perennials due to limited information on this point here we assume tmain to be the same in annuals and perennials t m a i n p t m a i n a 1 this assumption may need revising for later year perennials because existing plant resources in storage organs and a fully developed root system may lead to an earlier beginning of the main growing season or a faster development 2 2 6 harvest index hi the definition of the harvest index hi depends on whether the marketable yield is represented by the seeds only e g in grain crops or by the above ground biomass e g for feed and biofuels in both cases the perennial to annual ratio of harvest indices can be determined directly on the basis of the biomass or from the allocation fractions it accounts for the difference in resource allocation patterns between annuals and perennials for seed crops the harvest index is defined as the fraction of total biomass represented by seeds so that the ratio of harvest indices can be determined as 4 h i s e e d p h i s e e d a b s e e d p b s e e d a b t o t a b t o t p f s e e d p f s e e d a conversely for biomass crops the harvest index is represented by the fraction of plant biomass located above ground which includes also the seeds if the crop is harvested at maturity as such the harvest index is the complement to one of the root fraction i e h i b i o m a s s 1 f r o o t 1 b r o o t b t o t and the perennial to annual ratio of harvest indices is 5 h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a 1 f r o o t p 1 f r o o t a b t o t p b r o o t p b t o t a b r o o t a b t o t a b t o t p for biomass crops harvested before maturity i e during the vegetative phase the harvest index can also be defined as hibiomass fveg from which the perennial to annual ratio of harvest indices for biomass crops can thus be estimated as 6 h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a b v e g p b v e g a b t o t a b t o t p f v e g p f v e g a the two formulations are equivalent when harvest occurs during the vegetative period 2 2 7 second and later year perennials the response ratios discussed above refer to first year perennials observations on second and later year perennials are generally limited to very few genera and traits mostly above ground biomass and yields culman et al 2013 griffith 2000 hayes et al 2012 jaikumar et al 2012 jungers et al 2017 larkin et al 2014 it is expected that in later years perennials can exploit their previously stored resources to achieve a higher growing rate than during the first year possibly leading to larger biomass increases and hence yields at the same time not all the perennial plants may survive to the following growing season so that the larger biomass production per plant may not exactly translate in a larger biomass production per unit ground area although mortality may reduce density thus partially easing plant plant competition finally as the plant ages additional changes in its physiology and traits may occur we note however that the often observed decline in leaf photosynthetic capacity with aging leaves does not apply to the case of perennial crops because the above ground biomass is harvested in full at the end of each growing season so that all the photosynthesizing tissues are the result of re sprouting after harvest on these bases here we focus on the biomass dependent parameters maximum evapotranspiration rate etmax growth rate g and active rooting depth zr while maintaining the other parameters constant we explore how the advantages and disadvantages of perennial crops may evolve in time to estimate the performance of perennial plants during the second and later years all other parameter ratios are assumed to be independent of the age of the perennial to proceed quantitatively we exploit the minimalist model of the temporal evolution of plant biomass and yields proposed by vico et al 2016 in short the biomass of a perennial plant at the end of the kth growing season can be expressed as 7 b p k b p 1 ς c k 1 where b p 1 is the perennial plant biomass at the end of the first growing season ς is the fraction of survived individuals per year and c is the relative change in biomass of live plants from one year to the next with c 0 indicating a net increase in biomass for simplicity here it is assumed that ς and c remain constant year after year although the above formulation can be easily generalized to the case of ς and c depending on plant age see vico et al 2016 for details little information is available to choose the parameters ς and c data collated on perennial wheats and rice show that currently the survival after the first year exceeds 0 75 only in few lines vico et al 2016 and references therein thus to achieve a conservative estimate in the analyses below we set ς 0 75 no information is available on the relative change in biomass from one year to the next for perennial crops c observations in independently measured perennial grasses suggest a large variability in this parameter with the most commonly observed values around 2 vico et al 2016 and references therein hence we selected this value for the analyses below exploiting eq 7 it is possible to revise the above perennial to annual ratios of biomass driven parameters so that they are suitable for a generic kth growing season as 8 g p k g a a m a x p 1 a m a x a a l e a f p a l e a f a s l a p s l a a b v e g p 1 ς c k 1 b v e g a 9 e t m a x p k e t m a x a e l e a f p e l e a f a s l a p s l a a b v e g p 1 ς c k 1 b v e g a 10 z r p k z r a k b r o o t p 1 ς c k 1 b r o o t a f r o o t p f r o o t a b t o t p 1 ς c k 1 b t o t a these parameter ratios are to be interpreted as estimates of the upper limits where all of the potential for enhanced biomass growth is realized this approach may lead to unrealistic results for large k values for which the above assumption of constant ς and c may not hold these ratios may also not hold for active rooting depths in fact once fully developed the root system of the perennial crop may simply be maintained and not grown any further also allocation patterns as represented by biomass fractions may change as the perennial age thus potentially leading to further changes in the perennial to annual ratio of rooting depths and harvest indices yet to our knowledge no information is available on how the biomass fractions may change as perennial plants age so that biomass fractions and hence harvest indices are considered constant nevertheless given these uncertainties we limit our applications to k 3 although perennial crops may be employed for longer durations 2 3 metrics for evaluation of the productivity and sustainability of perennial and annual crops in the following we compare annual and perennial crops with reference to several metrics aimed at assessing their productivity feasibility and sustainability under different but complementary points of view regarding seed or biomass yields we consider the average yield a measure of productivity and the yield standard deviation quantifying the year to year variability in yield important for food security and in general for planning purposes for irrigated agriculture average water requirements and their standard deviations are also quantified for a set irrigation strategy average water requirement is important in the face of current and projected water scarcity while its year to year variability is relevant for resource allocation purposes finally to fully grasp the implications for water use of annual vs perennial crops we summarize the above results in terms of average water productivity wp defined as the yield per unit water supplied regardless of its source precipitation and irrigation this index is proportional to the amount of water made available to the plants that is effectively used for plant growth which in turn is later transformed into yield as discussed in vico and porporato 2015 this definition of water productivity allows exploring the gamut from rainfed to irrigated agriculture even under sustained well watered conditions wp is determined not only by the crop features defining water use efficiency specifically etmax g and hi but also by rainfall patterns larger or smaller amounts of water can be lost to runoff and deep percolation depending on the alternation of rainfall events and dry periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 traits of annual and perennial crops fig 1 summarizes the log ratios of the traits included in the model for which a difference between annual and perennial is considered determined as per eqs 1 6 the focus is on first year perennials for each trait and trait combination fig 1 reports measured values when considering only congeneric pairs for which all the trait ratios are available orange boxes and a random subset of all the combinations obtained from the whole dataset green boxes as a term of comparison when possible the ratio based on traits directly measured is reported as well gray boxes it appears that these different approaches lead to similar median coefficients of proportionality in most traits the only exceptions are transpiration and growth rates under well watered conditions when determined based on the vegetative biomass for which however just two congeneric pairs are available fig 1 a table 1 summarizes the values used in the simulations below they represent the median ratios obtained via direct measurements or from a random subset of all the trait combinations when direct measurements were not available the value selected for h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a is the one obtained defining hibiomass as hibiomass 1 froot for which the largest number of direct measurements is available the results for etmax and its components are reported in fig 1 a and b regardless of the biomass traits employed i e bveg in fig 1 a or btot and fveg in fig 1 b the estimated median evapotranspiration ratio is higher in perennials than annuals because of the larger transpiring biomass typical of this life span indeed observations point to a significantly larger soil moisture depletion under kernza wheatgrass than annual winter wheat culman et al 2013 glover et al 2010a for non congeneric species a larger total seasonal evapotranspiration was observed under miscanthus and switchgrass than in corn soybean or sorghum e g hickman et al 2010 mcisaac et al 2010 yimam et al 2014 similarly perennial kernza wheatgrass exhibited a 27 larger cumulative evapotranspiration than soybean and corn de oliveira et al 2018 measurements refer to different locations in the us midwest in line with this pattern perennial plants have been suggested as a useful addition to rotations to reduce the expansion of dryland salinization e g ward and micin 2006 conversely abraha et al 2015 found no significant difference in cumulated evapotranspiration over fields with annual corn or soybean vs perennial switchgrass mixed prairie or grassland species these contrasting results may be at least partially explained by different levels of aerodynamic coupling between the canopy and the atmosphere crops have generally dense canopies so that stand level actual evapotranspiration rate may be partially independent of transpiring biomass in particular under low wind speeds and for crops with large leaves due to the potential dependence on wind conditions and stand density in the following analyses we consider also the extreme case of complete aerodynamic decoupling between the canopy and the atmosphere i e e t m a x p e t m a x a 1 fig 1 c summarizes the log ratios of the traits employed to estimate the ratio of active rooting depths eq 2 as obtained directly from the root biomass gray box and by combining total biomass and the root fractions dark orange and green boxes for first year perennials as expected z r p z r a 1 we note however that assuming a similar root structure in annuals and perennials is not fully supported by observations pertaining non congeneric annuals and perennials where perennials showed not only larger root biomass than annuals but also higher root length and root density dupont et al 2014 monti and zatta 2009 more generally root distribution in different soil layers may differ even across species with similar total root biomass and the same life span see e g switchgrass and miscanthus in monti and zatta 2009 furthermore rooting depth is known to be affected by soil features and environmental conditions e g frequency of rainfall or irrigation see e g proffitt et al 1985 for these reasons in the following analyses we consider not only the case of rooting depths changing with life span as per eq 2 but also the other extreme case i e annuals and perennials having the same active rooting depth in agreement with observations by ward et al 2011 this case may also be interpreted as representative of delayed root development in perennials although we note that all the data in fig 1 c refer to first year perennials thus lending support to our choice of z r p z r a regarding growth under well watered conditions available data on leaf level gas exchange suggest that net co2 assimilation rate is slightly lower in perennials than annuals vico et al 2016 fig 1 b as in the case of transpiration few studies provide information on both leaf level traits and whole plant biomass which limits the ability to analyze scaling issues from the leaf to the plant and stand scales yet the few that do so suggest that because of the larger photosynthesizing biomass in perennials the growth rate in perennials is larger than the one for annuals regardless of the biomass traits employed fig 1 a and b finally because annual and perennial plants prioritize resource allocation to different organs it is to be expected that the productivity and sustainability of perennial crops with respect to that of annuals strongly depends on the plant organs constituting the marketable yield specifically perennials do not generally prioritize reproductive structures see e g bloom et al 1985 van tassel et al 2010 indeed available data overwhelmingly show that the perennial to annual seed production ratio is lower than 1 fig 1 d conversely for the perennial to annual biomass harvest index ratio three out of the four estimation methods employed here suggest that the median value of h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a is around 1 fig 1 e these results are suggestive that with respect to annual plants the larger amount of biomass allocated to the below ground by perennial plants mostly stems from the larger size of the perennial plants nevertheless the fourth method based on the difference between the root and the total biomass far r h s of eq 5 suggests that it may also be the case that perennial plants allocate a larger fraction of resources to the below ground yet for the analyses below we deemed more appropriate to set h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a 1 because the majority of data and approaches point in this direction and this value provides a more conservative estimate of the biomass production of perennial crops 3 2 comparison of productivity and sustainability of perennial to annual crops the above results indicate that for first year perennials the most uncertain parameter ratios pertain to the maximum evapotranspiration rate factoring in the potential for an aerodynamically limited canopy transpiration rate and the active rooting depth factoring in the fact that larger root biomass may not directly translate to deeper roots here we consider three different prototype perennials a median perennial where the parameter ratios are taken as the median values in fig 1 a root constrained perennial where it is assumed that z r p z r a 1 and a transpiration limited perennial for which e t m a x p e t m a x a 1 3 2 1 first year perennials figs 2 and 3 provide the perennial to annual ratios of average yields and their variability the water productivity and the irrigation water requirements and their variability for seed and biomass producing crops respectively considering only first year perennials to facilitate the comparison between annual and perennial crops these quantities are reported as perennial to annual ratios the absolute values of seed yields and their variability average water productivity and irrigation volumes are reported as supplementary information for the median perennial grain crop and the annual crop fig s1 along each curve average annual rainfall increases from 300 to 1300 mm these climatic scenarios were chosen so that the explored precipitation totals bracket the cumulative seasonal evapotranspiration of the annual crop under well watered conditions for the same scenarios and assuming a larger evapotranspiration rate in perennial than annual crops only the wettest climatic scenarios can fully replace the amount of water lost via evapotranspiration by the perennial crop during the main growing season nevertheless as discussed in the appendix it is assumed that plants can rely on an additional water source represented by the pre growing season soil water accumulation which is depleted early in the main growing season due to this winter water storage rainfed perennial crops are not water limited under the wettest climatic scenarios as apparent in fig 2 median perennial seed crops green symbols and solid lines have lower average yields than annuals i e lines in fig 2 a and b are in the left quadrants because the reduction in water stress stemming from access to deeper water stores does not balance the lower harvest index of perennials the difference in average yield between annuals and perennials is only marginally impacted by average rainfall totals although the effect of precipitation is slightly larger in rainfed than irrigated agriculture yields of the median perennial are also less variable than those of annuals i e lines are in the bottom quadrants because of the stabilizing effects of deeper roots the difference in yield variability between annuals and median perennials decreases with increasing total rainfall up to approximately 1100 mm yr 1 while it increases with further increases in rainfall under such wet conditions the perennials experience very infrequent water stress due to their deeper roots and the variability in yield becomes very low the yield variability remains marked in annuals which have shallower roots if perennials have active rooting depths equal to that of annuals brown symbols and dashed lines the difference in average yields between perennials and annuals becomes larger i e the lines shift to the left further away from the vertical black line while the difference in yield variability is reduced i e the lines shift upwards closer to the horizontal black line in other words assuming the same active rooting depth in annuals and perennials leads to lower and more variable yields in perennials with respect to the case of the median perennial crops grown under the same climatic conditions the only exception to this general pattern is the yield variability under extremely wet climates where median perennials and root constrained perennials respond in opposite ways to an increase in rainfall amount moreover the effect of reduced active rooting depth for the perennial is most marked for rainfed agriculture under those conditions the impact of losing the buffering effects of deeper roots while still having to cope with their higher evapotranspiration rates and lower allocations of resources to seeds is most significant conversely assuming the same transpiration rate for annuals and perennials blue dotted lines results in more similar average yields across the two life spans i e the lines shifts towards the vertical black line in the extreme case of dryland rainfed agriculture the seed yield of the perennial may become larger than that of the annual thanks to the benefits of deeper roots for transpiration limited perennials an increase in total rainfall has the opposite effect on average yields and their variability than that emerging in the case of median and root constrained perennials an increase in rainfall mostly enhances the differences in terms of yield and yield variability between annuals and perennials in fact the reduction of transpiration rate in the perennials becomes less and less important as rainfall input increases in wet conditions the yield of perennials becomes completely stable i e independent from the vagaries of rainfall while a residual variability may still be present in annuals as they cannot rely on similarly deep roots perennials also have lower mean water productivity than annuals fig 2 c and d bottom left quadrant because of their larger transpiring biomass and lower allocation of resources to seeds the difference in water productivity is particularly marked for root constrained perennials brown lines and symbols the only trait climate combination for which water productivity is higher in perennials than annuals is that of rainfed agriculture in dry areas assuming atmospherically limited evapotranspiration rates i e the same conditions under which average seed yield is larger in perennials than annuals fig 2 d small blue symbols finally micro irrigated perennials generally require larger and more variable amounts of water for irrigation than annuals fig 2 e lines and symbols are in the top right quadrant unless maximum transpiration rate is the same in annuals and perennials blue lines and symbols constraining the active rooting depth of perennials make these larger water requirements in perennials even more marked these results should be considered as best case scenarios because of the very efficient nature of the irrigation strategy simulated here nevertheless similar patterns of perennial to annual ratios emerge also under other irrigation strategies not shown fig 3 illustrates the results for the scenario when the desired yield is the above ground biomass i e considering crops for biofuel or feed production still focusing on first year perennials the general patterns are similar to those obtained for grain crops nevertheless when considering biomass crops the perennial crop becomes more similar to the annual in terms of average and standard deviation of yields as well as the average water productivity lines and symbols shift towards the black lines in fig 3 the median and transpiration limited perennial can achieve higher yields while still having a lower yield variability than the prototype annual under most climates most symbols are located in the bottom right quadrant in fig 3 a and b conversely yield variability of the root constrained perennial exceeds that of the annual except under dry climates larger brown symbols are in the top quadrants in fig 3 a and b due to the lack of extensive water stores to buffer against rainfall intermittency the water productivity of perennials is similar or higher than in annuals except for root limited perennials i e in fig 3 c and d symbols are in the top right quadrant except the brown points the irrigation amount is unaffected by the nature of the yield not shown 3 2 2 second and third year perennials fig 4 summarizes how the yields water productivity and irrigation requirements of perennial seed crops change when considering second and third year plants the relative advantages and disadvantages of perennial seed crops with respect to annual seed crops are reported in fig s2 in the supplementary information for simplicity only the case of the median perennial seed crop is shown but similar patterns emerge when considering perennials with other traits and when aiming at biomass production as time progresses i e moving from the solid to the dashed and dotted lines the average yields of perennials increase there is shift to the right from solid to dashed and dotted lines in fig 4 a and b because the larger biomass produced partially counterbalances the low allocation of resources to seeds rainfed perennials in wet climates are the only exception to this pattern in this case the net effect of larger biomass enhanced transpiration requirements and deepening roots is not positive particularly during the second year the increase in yield with plant age is more marked in irrigated perennials than in rainfed ones yield variability decreases thanks to the deepening roots except under the wettest climate scenarios symbols except the largest ones shift downwards with plant age in fig 4 a and b the enhanced productivity comes at the costs of larger and more variable irrigation requirements there is shift upwards and to the right from solid to dashed and dotted lines in fig 4 e finally the water productivity increases with plant age except under the wettest climates fig 4 c and d thanks to the increase in yield and deepening roots the absolute changes in yield water productivity and irrigation requirements apparent from fig 4 are however not sufficient to make the seed perennials more productive or sustainable than the seed annuals grown under the same conditions with the exception of third year perennials in wet climates fig s2 in the supplementary information it should be noted that figs 4 and s2 refer to a specific fraction of survived individuals ς and relative change in biomass of live plants c selected based on the limited information relative to second and later year perennial crops and observations on other perennial grasses see section 2 2 7 these parameters are thus highly uncertain and additional information would be needed for a more robust assessment of the prospects of later year perennial crops larger survival or relative change in biomass even within already observed ranges vico et al 2016 and references therein would be beneficial for the performance of later year perennial seed crops we also note that survival and growth enhancement act similarly on the final results in eq 6 they are multiplied together i e larger survival rates may compensate a less pronounced growth in biomass from year to year a larger and more difficult to characterize source of uncertainty is to what extent the increase in biomass over subsequent years translates in larger parameter ratios as per eq 10 in this sense the dashed and dotted lines in fig 4 corresponds to the best case scenario where perennials can take full advantage of their biomass over the years the other extreme is represented by the values for the first year perennial solid lines which can also be interpreted as corresponding to a later year perennial with survival rate and biomass growth such that ς c 1 3 3 methodological considerations data availability on perennial crops emerges as a major obstacle in characterizing the advantages and disadvantages of perennial crops in terms of productivity and sustainability lack of information is particularly marked for later year perennials despite the simplifying assumptions and the low parameter requirements of the model coupling crop development and yield formation to soil water availability no single study available allows determining all the necessary parameters and how they compare with their annual counterparts particularly when considering crops of similar genetic background the approach to parameter quantification employed here circumvents this data limitation at the cost of combining data from different studies and genera to obtain the necessary trait ratios the different estimates lead to similar median values thus lending support to this approach to describe a median perennial yet the emerging range of trait ratios suggest a potentially large difference in how perennial crops may differ from annual ones hence a large uncertainty remains in several of the parameter values as reviewed in section 2 2 root features and water use patterns are largely under characterized in perennial crops the sensitivity analyses above show that these parameters are however key in defining the sustainability of a shift from annual to perennial crops conversely the general patterns presented above are largely independent of the specific parameterization of the annual crop although the exact values depend on the choice of the prototype annual crop another often overlooked aspect is the length of the main growing season and how it changes in later year perennials when plants are already established due to the absolute lack of information on this point here we chose not to explore the role of any difference in main growing season length between annuals and perennials nevertheless sensitivity analyses suggest that assuming a different length of the main growing season for both annuals and perennials have small effects on the final results although the perennial to annual yield variability ratio slightly declines when considering a shorter main growing season not shown because the stabilizing effects of the larger initial water storage available to perennials becomes more marked thus beyond the results presented here this study points to the need for extensive experimental investigations contrasting annuals and perennials when grown under similar conditions and extending over later year perennials this step is clearly necessary for a quantitative and complete assessment of the consequences of a shift from annuals to perennial crops we note that our results should be interpreted as a direct comparison of annual and perennial crops but a full assessment of the feasibility of perennial crops should also include considerations regarding their advantages and disadvantages within the full crop rotation for example to benefit from them perennial crops must be maintained in the field for several years their yield stability may thus be put in jeopardy by other issues like disease or weed accumulation furthermore perennial crops introduce a further element of rigidity in the crop rotation such that farmers cannot adjust their management every year based on pre season knowledge on the expected conditions as they would do to reduce yield variability in annual crops aside from the low parameter requirement a further advantage of the modeling approach employed here is the quantification of both average and year to year variability of yield and water requirements without numerically intensive simulations knowledge of the year to year variability of these key variables is critical for planning purposes the tradeoffs emerging among yield and its stability and water requirements underline that the consequences of choosing annual or perennial crops are multi faceted even when focusing the attention on few metrics at the field level 4 conclusions and implications to our knowledge this is the first time that the prospects of perennial crops are quantitatively and simultaneously evaluated with reference not only to yields but also their variability and the associated water requirements and productivity this analysis adds additional dimensions on existing evaluations of perennial crops with respect to their sustainability their viability in crop rotations and their acceptance by farmers and end users see among others bell et al 2008 cox et al 2005 culman et al 2013 marquardt et al 2016 pimentel et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 perennials lead to smaller but more stable yields particularly when considering grain crops despite their faster growing rate larger biomass and the advantage provided by deeper roots at the same time perennials require larger and more variable amounts of irrigation than annuals and have a lower water productivity due to their lower yields despite the benefits provided by deeper roots and even when implementing a water savvy irrigation strategy such as deficit micro irrigation the difference between annual and perennial average yields is smallest in drier climates where the advantage of deeper roots is less marked and is further reduced when considering later year perennials hence the deeper roots of perennials are key to limit yield variability irrigation requirement and its variability suggesting that breeding for perennial crops should aim at maintaining this trait in the face of future more variable climatic conditions in summary the results presented here suggest that perennials are generally suitable to reduce yield variability particularly in dryland rainfed agriculture this reduction in yield variability comes at the cost of lower average yield and water productivity of perennials when compared to annuals furthermore rooting depth water losses via transpiration sought yield and the age of the perennial crop are key in defining the sustainability and productivity of perennial crops yet our review of the literature points to the extreme paucity of quantitative information to characterize some aspects of perennial crops that emerge as key for the assessment of their sustainability in terms of yields and efficient water use this is a major obstacle in defining the sustainability of a shift from annual to perennial crops

foundation perennial agriculture project appendix stochastic model of plant available soil moisture balance crop development and yield and irrigation water requirements a 1 coupled plant available soil moisture balance crop development and yield and irrigation water requirements we describe the crop development during the growing season as a stochastically forced dynamical system katul et al 2007 we focus on water availability because of its pivotal role in co2 assimilation and hence plant carbon uptake plant biomass growth and seed production hsiao 1973 lawlor and tezara 2009 vico and porporato 2008 following vico and porporato 2013 the growth rate of the plant biomass is determined by water availability i e the dynamics of plant biomass b t and the plant available soil moisture s t are coupled formally this can be written as a1 n z r ds t dt p t i s t et s t lq s t a2 db t dt g s t see below for symbol clarification soil water balance inputs and losses and plant biomass are all expressed per unit ground area a 1 1 plant available soil moisture balance the soil water balance in a1 describes the dynamics of the plant available soil moisture averaged over the soil layer hosting the majority of roots termed ecohydrologically active rooting zone of depth zr and porosity n the temporal evolution of the average soil moisture s t over this layer is the net result of the input via precipitation and the effective irrigation if any p t and i s t respectively and the losses via evapotranspiration deep drainage and surficial runoff et s t and lq s t respectively laio et al 2001 this soil moisture balance is to be interpreted at the daily time scale precipitation occurs randomly thus injecting stochasticity in the soil moisture balance and crop development rainfall is idealized at the daily time scale as a poisson process with average frequency λ precipitation event depths are assumed to be exponentially distributed with average depth α rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 losses via surficial runoff and deep percolation are simply modeled as instantaneous at the daily time scale losses occurring when the plant available soil moisture reaches a threshold s 1 at or slightly above soil field capacity milly 2001 finally losses via evapotranspiration are assumed to range from zero when s 0 i e no water is available to plants to a maximum value when stomata are fully open we model this dependence as a piecewise function of plant available soil moisture i e a3 e t s t e t m a x s s e t m a x s s s s where etmax is the evapotranspiration rate under well watered conditions i e lower or equal to the potential evapotranspiration rate set by the radiative balance and s is the plant available soil moisture corresponding to the leaf water potential at incipient stomatal closure for simplicity etmax is considered independent of crop developmental stage while this is a simplification we note that early in the main growing season the low leaf area and hence the low transpiration demands per unit ground area are partially balanced by soil water evaporation the latter loss term is drastically reduced after canopy closure however when the transpiring biomass increases in the case of irrigated agriculture an additional input to the soil water balance may be provided via water applications here a demand based irrigation is considered where an irrigation application is triggered by plant available soil moisture reaching a pre defined level s the irrigation application is such that losses via evapotranspiration are fully balanced at the daily time scale i e water is applied at a rate e t s the irrigation application continues till the next effective rainfall event vico and porporato 2011 such an irrigation scheme often termed micro irrigation is among the most water conserving systems currently available in other words the results provided here represent the best case scenario in terms of an effective use of water for irrigation because irrigation applications are triggered by soil moisture reaching the pre set threshold the accumulated irrigation is coupled with the soil moisture temporal evolution for micro irrigation the total irrigation application per unit ground area v t evolves in time as d v t d t g v s t with a4 g v s t g v 0 s s g v e t s s s a 1 2 plant biomass growth the temporal evolution of the crop biomass is estimated via eq a2 applied over the main growing season of length tmain tmain extends over the period when the growth is nearly linear see e g monteith 2000 this period begins some time after emergence or the beginning of sustained growth for winter crops and later years perennials when the initial exponential growth slows down it ends when the growth rate tapers off and resources are reallocated to reproductive and storage structures the end of the main growing season may occur at or after flowering depending on the crop and its growth habit i e determinate and indeterminate the growth rate g s t accounts for the water availability or lack of it it is assumed that under well watered conditions plant growth proceeds unhampered at rate g conversely when water is scarce the growth rate lowers to g with g g vico and porporato 2013 we can thus formalize the rate of change in biomass g s t as a5 g s t g s s g s s in turn g is assumed to a be a nonlinear function of the minimum achievable plant available soil moisture smin equal to zero for rainfed agriculture and to s for irrigated agriculture g g s m i n s 6 vico and porporato 2013 eqs a2 and a5 together result in a piecewise linear biomass growth in time with the rate depending on the alternation of periods of sufficient and limiting water availability indeed low soil water potentials result in reduced leaf water potentials which in turn cause a partial or total stomatal closure and an overall reduction in leaf activity this impairs co2 uptake via photosynthesis and carbon available to the plant for all its functions including growth see e g hsiao 1973 finally we estimate crop yield from the plant biomass at the end of the main growing season via the harvest index hi this concept is flexible enough to accommodate marketable yield as both seeds in this case hi is the seed fraction and biomass in this case hi is the fraction of above ground biomass although simplified this approach captures the key aspects of plant development and yield formation and the overall response of vegetation to reduced soil water availability while at the same time requiring a limited number of parameters a more detailed description of plant development and yield formation would require knowledge of the temporal evolution of biomass growth rate at the different developmental stages and their durations this information is currently missing when considering perennial crops so that a more complex model would result in further uncertainties furthermore a temporal dependence of plant growth rate would make the above model no longer amenable to the analytical approach discussed below conversely additional limiting factors e g nutrient availability could be incorporated in this minimalist description via their effects on growth rates and harvest index but are not considered here a 2 probability density functions of yields and water requirements for irrigation with the assumptions described in section a 1 it is possible to analytically obtain the probability density functions of the key random variables i e plant available soil moisture plant biomass and applied irrigation volume and how they evolve during the main growing season and crop yield the detailed analytical developments are reported in vico and porporato 2013 briefly the first step is considering the durations of well watered and water stressed conditions their average durations λ 1 and λ 1 respectively have been obtained analytically by porporato et al 2001 and vico and porporato 2013 as a function of the parameters of the soil moisture balance eq a1 their distribution is not known exactly but numerical simulations support the assumption of exponentially distributed intervals vico and porporato 2013 in this case the crop development during the main growing season can be idealized as a stationary dichotomous markovian process horsthemke and lefever 1984 van den broeck 1983 the process jumps between two values g and g eq a5 with mean frequency equal to the inverse of the average durations of well watered and water limited periods with this idealization we can analytically obtain the probability density function of the crop biomass and how it evolves in time see aquino et al 2010 and vico and porporato 2013 finally exploiting the harvest index the probability density function of yield is obtained from that of the biomass at the end of the main growing season by means of the derived distribution technique to achieve a more realistic description of water availability during the main growing season we assume that plant available soil moisture always starts at an intermediate status between the point of incipient stomatal closure and field capacity as the result of winter and spring accumulation of water in the soil vico and porporato 2015 in the absence of additional precipitations the crop is then under well watered conditions at least for a period of duration tcross corresponding to the shortest time over which such initially high moisture is depleted the length of tcross depends on the rate of evapotranspiration as well as on the ecohydrologically active rooting depth and hence may differ between annual and perennial crops and first and later year perennials we thus apply the above description only to the period t tmain tcross note that in some extreme cases of deep roots and low etmax tcross may extend over a large fraction of the main growing season moreover for dry winters and deep roots the duration of the well watered period may be overestimated as winter recharge may not be sufficient to ensure soil moistures above the point of incipient stomatal closure at the beginning of the growing season in this case a lower initial soil moisture should be selected the results reported in the main text summarize the obtained probability distribution by means of its average and standard deviation in summary the crop development during the main growing season depends on the biomass growth rates under well watered and water limited conditions g and g the duration of the duration of the initial dry down and the whole main growing season tcross and tmain as well as the average durations of periods of well watered and water limited conditions λ 1 and λ 1 the latter are functions of the size of the plant accessible water store zr precipitation pattern as summarized by λ and α irrigation scheme here micro irrigation triggered when s s and losses via evapotranspiration etmax and s given the similarities between the processes of biomass accumulation eq a2 combined with a5 and the cumulated applied irrigation eq a4 a similar analytical approach can be used also to determine the probability density function of seasonally cumulated irrigation applications per unit area indeed micro irrigation consists of a continuous on a daily scale water application which is started when plant available soil moisture reaches s and discountinued only at the following rainfall event because of the memory less nature of the poisson process driving the precipitation input cox and miller 2001 the duration of the irrigation applications is exactly exponentially distributed with average λ 1 vico and porporato 2010 further the interval between subsequent irrigation applications have average duration λ 1 p 0 1 1 p 0 where p 0 is the atom of probability in s s vico and porporato 2011 thus the temporal evolution of the accumulated water applied for irrigation can be seen as stationary dichotomous markovian process with rate g v e t s during irrigation applications and g v 0 when irrigation is turned off after rainfall events with an approach similar to that followed for the biomass it is possible to obtain analytically the probability density function of the cumulated applied irrigation volume note that for simplicity water resources are assumed to be sufficient to meet the irrigation water demands connected to the implemented irrigation scheme throughout the growing season but the model can also accommodate the case of limited seasonal water resources see vico and porporato 2013 for details the analytical probability density function of the applied irrigation volume over the main growing season permits obtaining the average and standard deviations of these two variables via integration

881,population growth and changes in climate and diets will likely further increase the pressure on agriculture and water resources globally currently staple crops are obtained from annuals plants a shift towards perennial crops may enhance many ecosystem services but at the cost of higher water requirements and lower yields it is still unclear when the advantages of perennial crops overcome their disadvantages and perennial crops are thus a sustainable solution here we combine a probabilistic description of the soil water balance and crop development with an extensive dataset of traits of congeneric annuals and perennials to identify the conditions for which perennial crops are more viable than annual ones with reference to yield yield stability and effective use of water we show that the larger and more developed roots of perennial crops allow a better exploitation of soil water resources and a reduction of yield variability with respect to annual species but their yields remain lower when considering grain crops furthermore perennial crops have higher and more variable irrigation requirements and lower water productivity these results are important to understand the potential consequences for yield its stability and water resource use of a shift from annual to perennial crops and more generally if perennial crops may be more resilient than annual crops in the face of climatic fluctuations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agricultural sustainability water productivity annual crops perennial crops stochastic model irrigation 1 introduction the 2030 agenda for sustainable developmental goals calls for zero hunger and sustainable consumption and production while at the same time preserving life on land and in water clean water and acting to limit climate change united nations 2015 among other steps meeting these goals will require sufficient and stable yields produced in a sustainable way currently intensive agriculture relies primarily on annual crops meyer et al 2012 monfreda et al 2008 raun and johnson 1999 a shift from annual to perennial crops has been advocated as a way to enhance the sustainability of crop production because perennial plants have the ability to provide a number of diverse ecosystem services batello et al 2014 cox et al 2006 crews 2005 dehaan et al 2005 glover et al 2010b kantar et al 2016 pimentel et al 2012 perennial crops cover the soil throughout the year have low tillage requirements beyond the establishment year and have larger belowground biomass than annual crops as a result with respect to annual crops perennials reduce soil erosion and water and nutrient losses may achieve higher nutrient and water uptake efficiencies and may enhance soil carbon sequestration culman et al 2013 randall and mulla 2001 zan et al 2001 furthermore perennial crops improve soil biological physical and chemical properties e g by sustaining a larger microbial biomass and a more diverse nematode population culman et al 2013 dupont et al 2014 glover et al 2010a beyond the provisioning of ecosystem services sustainable agriculture must ensure yield production with an effective use of available resources in terms of arable lands i e providing adequate yields per unit cultivated areas water and nutrients regarding yields perennial plants tend to allocate less resources to reproduction structures prioritizing instead storage structures for extended survival bazzaz et al 1987 bloom et al 1985 this pattern emerges also among most of the newly developed perennial cereal crops perennial wheat and perennial rice hayes et al 2012 larkin et al 2014 murphy et al 2009 pogna et al 2014 sacks et al 2003 2006 2007 scheinost et al 2001 particularly among those varieties exhibiting a higher survival after the first year vico et al 2016 this resource allocation pattern is problematic when seeds represent the sought product as in grain crops nevertheless perennial plants tend to be larger than their annual counterparts this is a clear advantage when aiming at biomass production e g for biofuels or feed but may also partially counterbalance the lower allocation to seed when considering seed yields as in grain crops recent estimates suggest that perennial cereals could provide average seed yields comparable to the annual ones should they achieve a biomass increase over the years similar to those of some other existing perennial grasses vico et al 2016 water is already in scarce supply in many regions climate change with warmer temperatures and more frequent dry spells may further exacerbate water scarcity crop water requirements and use patterns are thus key aspects for future sustainable agriculture perennial crops are generally considered more drought tolerant than annual ones glover et al 2010b van tassel et al 2014 indeed perennial plants by allocating more resources below ground may develop more extensive rooting systems accessing deeper soil layers and thus resources not available to annual plants furthermore developing deeper and denser rooting systems enhances plant tolerance to dry periods canadell et al 1996 chaves et al 2002 by buffering against fluctuations in water availability perennial crops may thus have an advantage during dry periods and result in more stable yields because of their access to deeper water stores this is a key aspect to ensure stable yields under future conditions when more intermittent precipitation and higher temperatures may lead to more frequent or more severe periods of water scarcity at the same time the larger transpiring biomass typical of perennial plants may result in higher gross plant water needs thus accelerating soil moisture depletion and potentially exposing the plants to more frequent water stress than annuals this raises the question if the extended rooting system typical of perennial plants is sufficient to meet the higher water demands potentially generated by a larger transpiring biomass and buffer against dry spells or will additional irrigation be required additionally can perennial grain crops lead to more crop per drop despite their lower allocation of resources to seeds answers to these questions are a necessary step to ensure that the advocated shift from annual to perennial crops truly enhances the sustainability of crop production system not only in terms of yields and provision of a diverse set of ecosystem services but also for an effective use of available water resources in the face of future more variable and potentially drier climates so far this issue has not been investigated in detail either experimentally or via modeling most of the existing assessments of yields and water use do not compare annual and perennial crops those that do so focus on bioenergy crops and compare crops with very different genetic background e g corn or soybean vs miscanthus or switchgrass the only exception to date is culman et al 2013 where a two year field comparison of annual and perennial wheat showed that perennial wheat had lower yields than annual wheat and resulted in lower or comparable soil moisture levels this result is suggestive of a higher water use and lower water use efficiency of perennial wheat to address this knowledge gap here we combine the results of an extensive meta analysis of annual and perennial plant traits and a stochastic model of crop yield accounting for the randomness in precipitation we quantify yields and their variability water productivity and irrigation water requirements in annual and perennial plants the goals are i to identify the climatic conditions under which perennial crops with specific traits allow for higher or more stable yields lower water requirements and a more efficient use of water than annual crops and when conversely annual crops are preferable and ii to define the key traits that perennial crops must possess in order to be sustainable also with respect to yield yield stability and efficient water use 2 methods informed decisions on the viability of annual vs perennial crops under certain environmental and management conditions require quantitative knowledge on their performances in terms of productivity and sustainability to this aim we compare annual and perennial crops grown under the same soil and environmental conditions a minimalist stochastic model coupling the dynamics of plant available soil moisture crop development and yield formation section 2 1 is parameterized for prototype annual and perennial crops section 2 2 their performances are contrasted with reference to several metrics of productivity and sustainability and their year to year variability section 2 3 to focus on the potential differences in performance deriving from expected life span and the associated plant traits annuals and perennials are assumed to be subjected to the same management practices in addition different climatic scenarios are explored 2 1 crop development and yield and the soil water balance to limit parameter requirements we employ a minimalist description of crop development and yield formation we focus on the crop development during the main growing season of duration tmain i e the period starting a few days after emergence or when sustained growth is resumed after the winter and ending when biomass growth rate tapers off and resources start to be allocated to reproductive and storage structures during this period the crop biomass growth is largely independent of the existing biomass i e the growth is approximately linear monteith 2000 with an extreme simplification of the complex processes driving plant growth during the main growing season and focusing on water as the most limiting factor it is assumed that plant growth occurs at rate g when water availability is adequate conversely when water is limited the growth rate decreases to g vico and porporato 2013 the alternation of periods of well watered and water stressed conditions drives the accumulation of biomass during the main growing season and in turn the final yield in turn the plant biomass at the end of the main growing season provides the starting point for a simple yet robust estimate of the final yield exploiting the concept of harvest index hi representing the fraction of the final plant biomass corresponding to the marketable yield more details on the description of the crop development model are reported in the appendix a1 the alternation of periods of well watered and water stressed conditions is determined by the soil moisture balance laio et al 2001 extending over the ecohydrologically active rooting zone of depth zr where most of the roots are located the plant available soil moisture averaged over zr s t is driven by the inputs via precipitation and irrigation if any and the losses via actual evapotranspiration surficial runoff and deep percolation rainfall pattern is summarized via the average frequency of rainfall events λ and the average depth of rainfall events α the actual evapotranspiration rate in turn depends on the plant available soil moisture linearly declining from etmax under well watered conditions corresponding to soil moisture levels above the threshold of incipient plant water stress s to 0 when no more water is available to plants for irrigated agriculture an efficient demand based deficit irrigation english and raja 1996 strategy is considered where irrigation is supplied whenever plant available soil moisture is depleted to a pre set level s below the threshold s vico and porporato 2011 because a demand based irrigation strategy is implemented the rainfall pattern also affects the frequency of irrigation applications and hence the total irrigation water requirements for example water requirements are lower in wetter climates more details on the soil moisture balance and the irrigation strategy are reported in the appendix a1 this simple description of the coupled plant available soil moisture crop development and yield formation allows an analytical solution to the probability density functions of crop biomass and hence final yield and for irrigated agriculture seasonal irrigation requirement vico and porporato 2013 this analytical approach allows for the full accounting of the unpredictability of rainfall events without requiring computationally heavy monte carlo simulations the results are summarized in the form of averages and standard deviations of the key random variables yields and irrigation requirements for irrigated agriculture they can be readily obtained via integration of the probability density functions see section a2 in the appendix knowledge of the standard deviations of these key indicators permits the assessment of the year to year stability of yield and water requirement stability for an in depth understanding annuals and perennials are compared for two management strategies i e rainfed and irrigated agriculture and different climatic scenarios we explore total annual rainfall ranging from 300 to 1300 mm as a result of an increase in rainfall frequency λ but assuming constant average depth of rainfall events α 2 2 parameterization of annual and perennial crops in the above description the parameters defining crop development and yield formation are i the evapotranspiration rate per unit ground area under well watered conditions etmax ii the ecohydrologically active rooting depth zr iii the biomass growth rate under well watered conditions g iv the crop response to water stress i e the water limited growth rate g and the soil moisture level at incipient plant water stress s v the harvest index hi and vi the duration of the main growing season tmain to facilitate the comparison between annual and perennial species we employ a prototype annual grain crop and a prototype annual biomass crop the corresponding perennial crops are defined with reference to the prototype annual crop assuming a proportionality between the traits of the perennial crop and those of the corresponding annual for each trait the coefficient of proportionality is inferred from data collated in a recent meta analysis that contrasted congeneric annual subscript a and perennial subscript p species belonging to 28 genera and including a total of around 3000 congeneric annual perennial pairs vico et al 2016 the genetic closeness of congeneric species allows focusing on plant life span and associated traits all else being equal kelly and hanley 2005 to circumvent data limitations we combine data obtained from different studies unless the parameters for annuals and perennials were directly measured the coefficient of proportionality for the generic parameter x x p x a is determined as the product of perennial to annual ratios of different traits as detailed below we combine the available trait ratios including all possible combinations to obtain a measure of the uncertainty in ratios of the parameters this approach is first applied focusing only on those congeneric pairs for which all the trait ratios are available albeit from different studies second we consider the entire dataset and a random subset of all the possible combinations even of trait ratios measured in different genera the first approach has the advantage of combining trait ratios observed in the same genera but only few ratios are available the second approach has the advantage of fully exploiting all the available data at the cost of combining information collected in different genera although each trait ratio still refers to congeneric annual perennial pairs 2 2 1 evapotranspiration rate under well watered conditions etmax available data on leaf level water vapor exchange rate eleaf suggest there is no significant difference in transpiration rate between congeneric annuals and perennials vico et al 2016 nevertheless the plant available soil moisture balance is defined per unit ground area so that the available leaf level data must be scaled up to the stand level to this aim assuming a perfect aerodynamic coupling between the leaves and the atmosphere we consider the amount of transpiring leaf area per unit ground area the latter can be expressed as the product of the specific leaf area sla the vegetative biomass per plant bveg and the planting density in turn the vegetative biomass can also be expressed as the product of the total plant biomass btot and the vegetative biomass fractions fveg i e bveg fvegbtot we note that the planting density can be neglected when considering data driven ratios between perennials and annuals because density was the same for annuals and perennials in the experiments reported in the literature the ratio of evapotranspiration rates per unit ground area for perennials and annuals can thus be expressed as a function of often measured leaf and plant traits as 1 e t m a x p e t m a x a e l e a f p e l e a f a s l a p s l a a b v e g p b v e g a e l e a f p e l e a f a s l a p s l a a f v e g p f v e g a b t o t p b t o t a the formulation on the far r h s is in principle equivalent to the one based on biomass but in practice it allows us to exploit those studies where the vegetative biomass is not explicitly reported assuming that the perennial annual ratios of biomass and biomass fraction remain substantially unchanged during the whole growing season eq 1 simply requires that biomass and biomass fraction are measured at the same stage in both annuals and perennials as is customary in the literature 2 2 2 active rooting depth zr perennials have significantly larger rooting biomass than annuals nevertheless information on root mass distribution within the soil is extremely limited and often contrasting in particular when focusing on congeneric species for example no difference in rooting depths was apparent in studies considering the early development of annual and perennial medic and wheat ward et al 2011 there the perennial wheat was a triticum x agropyron line nevertheless visual examination of roots in annual and perennial wheat kernza wheatgrass cox et al 2006 suggests the perennial wheat has deeper roots than the annual one the latter observation is in agreement with more extensive studies suggesting that perennials have deeper roots than annuals when grown in the same conditions dupont et al 2014 monti and zatta 2009 a pattern emerging also from global analyses of root distributions see e g canadell et al 1996 to proceed quantitatively we note that visual inspection of root architecture of annual and perennial wheat points to large similarities both in kernza wheatgrass and a triticum x agropyron line cox et al 2006 ward et al 2011 if annuals and perennials have the same rooting density at the soil surface and further assuming an exponential root profile as suggested by jackson et al 1996 the ratio of active rooting depths between perennials and annuals must equal the ratio of root biomass broot for the two expected life spans i e 2 z r p z r a b r o o t p b r o o t a f r o o t p f r o o t a b t o t p b t o t a as in eq 1 the formulation on the far r h s is obtained by expressing the root biomass with reference to the total plant biomass btot and the root fraction froot 2 2 3 biomass growth rate under well watered conditions g relative growth rates rgr determined early after sowing point to perennials having a lower rgr than their congeneric annual counterparts e g garnier 1992 in contrast to these early season data total plant biomass later in the season are significantly larger in perennial plants than in the congeneric annuals even if observations are conducted at the same time after sowing and even when referring to first year perennials only vico et al 2016 we consider this cumulated biomass as more representative of plant growth than early season data on rgr as it integrates plant activity over a longer period on these bases we expect that the growth rate under well watered conditions g is larger in perennials than annuals i e g p g a 1 to estimate g p g a we proceed similarly to the case of transpiration rates starting from leaf level measurements of net co2 assimilation aleaf and scaling them up to the stand scale based on biomass data our underlying assumption is that the perennial to annual ratio of co2 assimilation rates per unit ground area a m a x p a m a x a well represents the perennial to annual plant growth rate ratio during the main growing season under well watered conditions the rationale is that the fixed carbon is in part used for plant growth and the fixed carbon to growth ratio or carbon use efficiency is likely similar for plants at similar developmental stages regardless of their expected life span it follows that g p g a can be estimated as 3 g p g a a m a x p a m a x a a l e a f p a l e a f a s l a p s l a a b v e g p b v e g a a l e a f p a l e a f a s l a p s l a a f v e g p f v e g a b t o t p b t o t a 2 2 4 response to water stress s and g the need for drought tolerance is well recognized in the breeding efforts towards perennial grain crops van tassel et al 2014 nevertheless to our knowledge no study has explored in detail whether annual and perennial crops respond differently to water stress particularly in terms of growth and yield reductions when subjecting five perennial wheat lines and an annual variety to a severe drying and rewetting cycle larkin et al 2014 found that the survival and total water consumption of the perennial varieties bracketed the ones observed in the annual yet no conclusion can be drawn on productivity particularly with reference to less extreme water stress conditions common in the field moreover a comparison of non congeneric annuals and perennials showed that differences in water uptake capacity and speed cannot be explained with life span monti and zatta 2009 for these reasons in what follows annuals and perennials are assumed to have the same response to water stress i e g p g a g p g a and s p s a 1 in other words we assume that the oft mentioned higher drought tolerance of perennial crops is conferred by the access to larger water stores in the soil not by their ability to sustain plant activities at lower soil and leaf water potentials or a less marked reduction in plant activity with water stress when compared to annuals 2 2 5 duration of the main growing season tmain the duration of the growing season depends primarily on the climatic conditions and their effects on plant development management can impact the length of the growing season via the sowing date and for biomass crops via the harvest date if that is set before the plant completes its cycle as explained in section 2 1 and the appendix we focus on the main part of the growing season its duration tmain is defined by climatic conditions and plant response to them little information is available on the rate of development in annuals and perennials grown under the same conditions although gonzalez paleo and ravetta 2012 and culman et al 2013 observed an earlier flowering in annuals than perennials due to limited information on this point here we assume tmain to be the same in annuals and perennials t m a i n p t m a i n a 1 this assumption may need revising for later year perennials because existing plant resources in storage organs and a fully developed root system may lead to an earlier beginning of the main growing season or a faster development 2 2 6 harvest index hi the definition of the harvest index hi depends on whether the marketable yield is represented by the seeds only e g in grain crops or by the above ground biomass e g for feed and biofuels in both cases the perennial to annual ratio of harvest indices can be determined directly on the basis of the biomass or from the allocation fractions it accounts for the difference in resource allocation patterns between annuals and perennials for seed crops the harvest index is defined as the fraction of total biomass represented by seeds so that the ratio of harvest indices can be determined as 4 h i s e e d p h i s e e d a b s e e d p b s e e d a b t o t a b t o t p f s e e d p f s e e d a conversely for biomass crops the harvest index is represented by the fraction of plant biomass located above ground which includes also the seeds if the crop is harvested at maturity as such the harvest index is the complement to one of the root fraction i e h i b i o m a s s 1 f r o o t 1 b r o o t b t o t and the perennial to annual ratio of harvest indices is 5 h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a 1 f r o o t p 1 f r o o t a b t o t p b r o o t p b t o t a b r o o t a b t o t a b t o t p for biomass crops harvested before maturity i e during the vegetative phase the harvest index can also be defined as hibiomass fveg from which the perennial to annual ratio of harvest indices for biomass crops can thus be estimated as 6 h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a b v e g p b v e g a b t o t a b t o t p f v e g p f v e g a the two formulations are equivalent when harvest occurs during the vegetative period 2 2 7 second and later year perennials the response ratios discussed above refer to first year perennials observations on second and later year perennials are generally limited to very few genera and traits mostly above ground biomass and yields culman et al 2013 griffith 2000 hayes et al 2012 jaikumar et al 2012 jungers et al 2017 larkin et al 2014 it is expected that in later years perennials can exploit their previously stored resources to achieve a higher growing rate than during the first year possibly leading to larger biomass increases and hence yields at the same time not all the perennial plants may survive to the following growing season so that the larger biomass production per plant may not exactly translate in a larger biomass production per unit ground area although mortality may reduce density thus partially easing plant plant competition finally as the plant ages additional changes in its physiology and traits may occur we note however that the often observed decline in leaf photosynthetic capacity with aging leaves does not apply to the case of perennial crops because the above ground biomass is harvested in full at the end of each growing season so that all the photosynthesizing tissues are the result of re sprouting after harvest on these bases here we focus on the biomass dependent parameters maximum evapotranspiration rate etmax growth rate g and active rooting depth zr while maintaining the other parameters constant we explore how the advantages and disadvantages of perennial crops may evolve in time to estimate the performance of perennial plants during the second and later years all other parameter ratios are assumed to be independent of the age of the perennial to proceed quantitatively we exploit the minimalist model of the temporal evolution of plant biomass and yields proposed by vico et al 2016 in short the biomass of a perennial plant at the end of the kth growing season can be expressed as 7 b p k b p 1 ς c k 1 where b p 1 is the perennial plant biomass at the end of the first growing season ς is the fraction of survived individuals per year and c is the relative change in biomass of live plants from one year to the next with c 0 indicating a net increase in biomass for simplicity here it is assumed that ς and c remain constant year after year although the above formulation can be easily generalized to the case of ς and c depending on plant age see vico et al 2016 for details little information is available to choose the parameters ς and c data collated on perennial wheats and rice show that currently the survival after the first year exceeds 0 75 only in few lines vico et al 2016 and references therein thus to achieve a conservative estimate in the analyses below we set ς 0 75 no information is available on the relative change in biomass from one year to the next for perennial crops c observations in independently measured perennial grasses suggest a large variability in this parameter with the most commonly observed values around 2 vico et al 2016 and references therein hence we selected this value for the analyses below exploiting eq 7 it is possible to revise the above perennial to annual ratios of biomass driven parameters so that they are suitable for a generic kth growing season as 8 g p k g a a m a x p 1 a m a x a a l e a f p a l e a f a s l a p s l a a b v e g p 1 ς c k 1 b v e g a 9 e t m a x p k e t m a x a e l e a f p e l e a f a s l a p s l a a b v e g p 1 ς c k 1 b v e g a 10 z r p k z r a k b r o o t p 1 ς c k 1 b r o o t a f r o o t p f r o o t a b t o t p 1 ς c k 1 b t o t a these parameter ratios are to be interpreted as estimates of the upper limits where all of the potential for enhanced biomass growth is realized this approach may lead to unrealistic results for large k values for which the above assumption of constant ς and c may not hold these ratios may also not hold for active rooting depths in fact once fully developed the root system of the perennial crop may simply be maintained and not grown any further also allocation patterns as represented by biomass fractions may change as the perennial age thus potentially leading to further changes in the perennial to annual ratio of rooting depths and harvest indices yet to our knowledge no information is available on how the biomass fractions may change as perennial plants age so that biomass fractions and hence harvest indices are considered constant nevertheless given these uncertainties we limit our applications to k 3 although perennial crops may be employed for longer durations 2 3 metrics for evaluation of the productivity and sustainability of perennial and annual crops in the following we compare annual and perennial crops with reference to several metrics aimed at assessing their productivity feasibility and sustainability under different but complementary points of view regarding seed or biomass yields we consider the average yield a measure of productivity and the yield standard deviation quantifying the year to year variability in yield important for food security and in general for planning purposes for irrigated agriculture average water requirements and their standard deviations are also quantified for a set irrigation strategy average water requirement is important in the face of current and projected water scarcity while its year to year variability is relevant for resource allocation purposes finally to fully grasp the implications for water use of annual vs perennial crops we summarize the above results in terms of average water productivity wp defined as the yield per unit water supplied regardless of its source precipitation and irrigation this index is proportional to the amount of water made available to the plants that is effectively used for plant growth which in turn is later transformed into yield as discussed in vico and porporato 2015 this definition of water productivity allows exploring the gamut from rainfed to irrigated agriculture even under sustained well watered conditions wp is determined not only by the crop features defining water use efficiency specifically etmax g and hi but also by rainfall patterns larger or smaller amounts of water can be lost to runoff and deep percolation depending on the alternation of rainfall events and dry periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 traits of annual and perennial crops fig 1 summarizes the log ratios of the traits included in the model for which a difference between annual and perennial is considered determined as per eqs 1 6 the focus is on first year perennials for each trait and trait combination fig 1 reports measured values when considering only congeneric pairs for which all the trait ratios are available orange boxes and a random subset of all the combinations obtained from the whole dataset green boxes as a term of comparison when possible the ratio based on traits directly measured is reported as well gray boxes it appears that these different approaches lead to similar median coefficients of proportionality in most traits the only exceptions are transpiration and growth rates under well watered conditions when determined based on the vegetative biomass for which however just two congeneric pairs are available fig 1 a table 1 summarizes the values used in the simulations below they represent the median ratios obtained via direct measurements or from a random subset of all the trait combinations when direct measurements were not available the value selected for h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a is the one obtained defining hibiomass as hibiomass 1 froot for which the largest number of direct measurements is available the results for etmax and its components are reported in fig 1 a and b regardless of the biomass traits employed i e bveg in fig 1 a or btot and fveg in fig 1 b the estimated median evapotranspiration ratio is higher in perennials than annuals because of the larger transpiring biomass typical of this life span indeed observations point to a significantly larger soil moisture depletion under kernza wheatgrass than annual winter wheat culman et al 2013 glover et al 2010a for non congeneric species a larger total seasonal evapotranspiration was observed under miscanthus and switchgrass than in corn soybean or sorghum e g hickman et al 2010 mcisaac et al 2010 yimam et al 2014 similarly perennial kernza wheatgrass exhibited a 27 larger cumulative evapotranspiration than soybean and corn de oliveira et al 2018 measurements refer to different locations in the us midwest in line with this pattern perennial plants have been suggested as a useful addition to rotations to reduce the expansion of dryland salinization e g ward and micin 2006 conversely abraha et al 2015 found no significant difference in cumulated evapotranspiration over fields with annual corn or soybean vs perennial switchgrass mixed prairie or grassland species these contrasting results may be at least partially explained by different levels of aerodynamic coupling between the canopy and the atmosphere crops have generally dense canopies so that stand level actual evapotranspiration rate may be partially independent of transpiring biomass in particular under low wind speeds and for crops with large leaves due to the potential dependence on wind conditions and stand density in the following analyses we consider also the extreme case of complete aerodynamic decoupling between the canopy and the atmosphere i e e t m a x p e t m a x a 1 fig 1 c summarizes the log ratios of the traits employed to estimate the ratio of active rooting depths eq 2 as obtained directly from the root biomass gray box and by combining total biomass and the root fractions dark orange and green boxes for first year perennials as expected z r p z r a 1 we note however that assuming a similar root structure in annuals and perennials is not fully supported by observations pertaining non congeneric annuals and perennials where perennials showed not only larger root biomass than annuals but also higher root length and root density dupont et al 2014 monti and zatta 2009 more generally root distribution in different soil layers may differ even across species with similar total root biomass and the same life span see e g switchgrass and miscanthus in monti and zatta 2009 furthermore rooting depth is known to be affected by soil features and environmental conditions e g frequency of rainfall or irrigation see e g proffitt et al 1985 for these reasons in the following analyses we consider not only the case of rooting depths changing with life span as per eq 2 but also the other extreme case i e annuals and perennials having the same active rooting depth in agreement with observations by ward et al 2011 this case may also be interpreted as representative of delayed root development in perennials although we note that all the data in fig 1 c refer to first year perennials thus lending support to our choice of z r p z r a regarding growth under well watered conditions available data on leaf level gas exchange suggest that net co2 assimilation rate is slightly lower in perennials than annuals vico et al 2016 fig 1 b as in the case of transpiration few studies provide information on both leaf level traits and whole plant biomass which limits the ability to analyze scaling issues from the leaf to the plant and stand scales yet the few that do so suggest that because of the larger photosynthesizing biomass in perennials the growth rate in perennials is larger than the one for annuals regardless of the biomass traits employed fig 1 a and b finally because annual and perennial plants prioritize resource allocation to different organs it is to be expected that the productivity and sustainability of perennial crops with respect to that of annuals strongly depends on the plant organs constituting the marketable yield specifically perennials do not generally prioritize reproductive structures see e g bloom et al 1985 van tassel et al 2010 indeed available data overwhelmingly show that the perennial to annual seed production ratio is lower than 1 fig 1 d conversely for the perennial to annual biomass harvest index ratio three out of the four estimation methods employed here suggest that the median value of h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a is around 1 fig 1 e these results are suggestive that with respect to annual plants the larger amount of biomass allocated to the below ground by perennial plants mostly stems from the larger size of the perennial plants nevertheless the fourth method based on the difference between the root and the total biomass far r h s of eq 5 suggests that it may also be the case that perennial plants allocate a larger fraction of resources to the below ground yet for the analyses below we deemed more appropriate to set h i b i o m a s s p h i b i o m a s s a 1 because the majority of data and approaches point in this direction and this value provides a more conservative estimate of the biomass production of perennial crops 3 2 comparison of productivity and sustainability of perennial to annual crops the above results indicate that for first year perennials the most uncertain parameter ratios pertain to the maximum evapotranspiration rate factoring in the potential for an aerodynamically limited canopy transpiration rate and the active rooting depth factoring in the fact that larger root biomass may not directly translate to deeper roots here we consider three different prototype perennials a median perennial where the parameter ratios are taken as the median values in fig 1 a root constrained perennial where it is assumed that z r p z r a 1 and a transpiration limited perennial for which e t m a x p e t m a x a 1 3 2 1 first year perennials figs 2 and 3 provide the perennial to annual ratios of average yields and their variability the water productivity and the irrigation water requirements and their variability for seed and biomass producing crops respectively considering only first year perennials to facilitate the comparison between annual and perennial crops these quantities are reported as perennial to annual ratios the absolute values of seed yields and their variability average water productivity and irrigation volumes are reported as supplementary information for the median perennial grain crop and the annual crop fig s1 along each curve average annual rainfall increases from 300 to 1300 mm these climatic scenarios were chosen so that the explored precipitation totals bracket the cumulative seasonal evapotranspiration of the annual crop under well watered conditions for the same scenarios and assuming a larger evapotranspiration rate in perennial than annual crops only the wettest climatic scenarios can fully replace the amount of water lost via evapotranspiration by the perennial crop during the main growing season nevertheless as discussed in the appendix it is assumed that plants can rely on an additional water source represented by the pre growing season soil water accumulation which is depleted early in the main growing season due to this winter water storage rainfed perennial crops are not water limited under the wettest climatic scenarios as apparent in fig 2 median perennial seed crops green symbols and solid lines have lower average yields than annuals i e lines in fig 2 a and b are in the left quadrants because the reduction in water stress stemming from access to deeper water stores does not balance the lower harvest index of perennials the difference in average yield between annuals and perennials is only marginally impacted by average rainfall totals although the effect of precipitation is slightly larger in rainfed than irrigated agriculture yields of the median perennial are also less variable than those of annuals i e lines are in the bottom quadrants because of the stabilizing effects of deeper roots the difference in yield variability between annuals and median perennials decreases with increasing total rainfall up to approximately 1100 mm yr 1 while it increases with further increases in rainfall under such wet conditions the perennials experience very infrequent water stress due to their deeper roots and the variability in yield becomes very low the yield variability remains marked in annuals which have shallower roots if perennials have active rooting depths equal to that of annuals brown symbols and dashed lines the difference in average yields between perennials and annuals becomes larger i e the lines shift to the left further away from the vertical black line while the difference in yield variability is reduced i e the lines shift upwards closer to the horizontal black line in other words assuming the same active rooting depth in annuals and perennials leads to lower and more variable yields in perennials with respect to the case of the median perennial crops grown under the same climatic conditions the only exception to this general pattern is the yield variability under extremely wet climates where median perennials and root constrained perennials respond in opposite ways to an increase in rainfall amount moreover the effect of reduced active rooting depth for the perennial is most marked for rainfed agriculture under those conditions the impact of losing the buffering effects of deeper roots while still having to cope with their higher evapotranspiration rates and lower allocations of resources to seeds is most significant conversely assuming the same transpiration rate for annuals and perennials blue dotted lines results in more similar average yields across the two life spans i e the lines shifts towards the vertical black line in the extreme case of dryland rainfed agriculture the seed yield of the perennial may become larger than that of the annual thanks to the benefits of deeper roots for transpiration limited perennials an increase in total rainfall has the opposite effect on average yields and their variability than that emerging in the case of median and root constrained perennials an increase in rainfall mostly enhances the differences in terms of yield and yield variability between annuals and perennials in fact the reduction of transpiration rate in the perennials becomes less and less important as rainfall input increases in wet conditions the yield of perennials becomes completely stable i e independent from the vagaries of rainfall while a residual variability may still be present in annuals as they cannot rely on similarly deep roots perennials also have lower mean water productivity than annuals fig 2 c and d bottom left quadrant because of their larger transpiring biomass and lower allocation of resources to seeds the difference in water productivity is particularly marked for root constrained perennials brown lines and symbols the only trait climate combination for which water productivity is higher in perennials than annuals is that of rainfed agriculture in dry areas assuming atmospherically limited evapotranspiration rates i e the same conditions under which average seed yield is larger in perennials than annuals fig 2 d small blue symbols finally micro irrigated perennials generally require larger and more variable amounts of water for irrigation than annuals fig 2 e lines and symbols are in the top right quadrant unless maximum transpiration rate is the same in annuals and perennials blue lines and symbols constraining the active rooting depth of perennials make these larger water requirements in perennials even more marked these results should be considered as best case scenarios because of the very efficient nature of the irrigation strategy simulated here nevertheless similar patterns of perennial to annual ratios emerge also under other irrigation strategies not shown fig 3 illustrates the results for the scenario when the desired yield is the above ground biomass i e considering crops for biofuel or feed production still focusing on first year perennials the general patterns are similar to those obtained for grain crops nevertheless when considering biomass crops the perennial crop becomes more similar to the annual in terms of average and standard deviation of yields as well as the average water productivity lines and symbols shift towards the black lines in fig 3 the median and transpiration limited perennial can achieve higher yields while still having a lower yield variability than the prototype annual under most climates most symbols are located in the bottom right quadrant in fig 3 a and b conversely yield variability of the root constrained perennial exceeds that of the annual except under dry climates larger brown symbols are in the top quadrants in fig 3 a and b due to the lack of extensive water stores to buffer against rainfall intermittency the water productivity of perennials is similar or higher than in annuals except for root limited perennials i e in fig 3 c and d symbols are in the top right quadrant except the brown points the irrigation amount is unaffected by the nature of the yield not shown 3 2 2 second and third year perennials fig 4 summarizes how the yields water productivity and irrigation requirements of perennial seed crops change when considering second and third year plants the relative advantages and disadvantages of perennial seed crops with respect to annual seed crops are reported in fig s2 in the supplementary information for simplicity only the case of the median perennial seed crop is shown but similar patterns emerge when considering perennials with other traits and when aiming at biomass production as time progresses i e moving from the solid to the dashed and dotted lines the average yields of perennials increase there is shift to the right from solid to dashed and dotted lines in fig 4 a and b because the larger biomass produced partially counterbalances the low allocation of resources to seeds rainfed perennials in wet climates are the only exception to this pattern in this case the net effect of larger biomass enhanced transpiration requirements and deepening roots is not positive particularly during the second year the increase in yield with plant age is more marked in irrigated perennials than in rainfed ones yield variability decreases thanks to the deepening roots except under the wettest climate scenarios symbols except the largest ones shift downwards with plant age in fig 4 a and b the enhanced productivity comes at the costs of larger and more variable irrigation requirements there is shift upwards and to the right from solid to dashed and dotted lines in fig 4 e finally the water productivity increases with plant age except under the wettest climates fig 4 c and d thanks to the increase in yield and deepening roots the absolute changes in yield water productivity and irrigation requirements apparent from fig 4 are however not sufficient to make the seed perennials more productive or sustainable than the seed annuals grown under the same conditions with the exception of third year perennials in wet climates fig s2 in the supplementary information it should be noted that figs 4 and s2 refer to a specific fraction of survived individuals ς and relative change in biomass of live plants c selected based on the limited information relative to second and later year perennial crops and observations on other perennial grasses see section 2 2 7 these parameters are thus highly uncertain and additional information would be needed for a more robust assessment of the prospects of later year perennial crops larger survival or relative change in biomass even within already observed ranges vico et al 2016 and references therein would be beneficial for the performance of later year perennial seed crops we also note that survival and growth enhancement act similarly on the final results in eq 6 they are multiplied together i e larger survival rates may compensate a less pronounced growth in biomass from year to year a larger and more difficult to characterize source of uncertainty is to what extent the increase in biomass over subsequent years translates in larger parameter ratios as per eq 10 in this sense the dashed and dotted lines in fig 4 corresponds to the best case scenario where perennials can take full advantage of their biomass over the years the other extreme is represented by the values for the first year perennial solid lines which can also be interpreted as corresponding to a later year perennial with survival rate and biomass growth such that ς c 1 3 3 methodological considerations data availability on perennial crops emerges as a major obstacle in characterizing the advantages and disadvantages of perennial crops in terms of productivity and sustainability lack of information is particularly marked for later year perennials despite the simplifying assumptions and the low parameter requirements of the model coupling crop development and yield formation to soil water availability no single study available allows determining all the necessary parameters and how they compare with their annual counterparts particularly when considering crops of similar genetic background the approach to parameter quantification employed here circumvents this data limitation at the cost of combining data from different studies and genera to obtain the necessary trait ratios the different estimates lead to similar median values thus lending support to this approach to describe a median perennial yet the emerging range of trait ratios suggest a potentially large difference in how perennial crops may differ from annual ones hence a large uncertainty remains in several of the parameter values as reviewed in section 2 2 root features and water use patterns are largely under characterized in perennial crops the sensitivity analyses above show that these parameters are however key in defining the sustainability of a shift from annual to perennial crops conversely the general patterns presented above are largely independent of the specific parameterization of the annual crop although the exact values depend on the choice of the prototype annual crop another often overlooked aspect is the length of the main growing season and how it changes in later year perennials when plants are already established due to the absolute lack of information on this point here we chose not to explore the role of any difference in main growing season length between annuals and perennials nevertheless sensitivity analyses suggest that assuming a different length of the main growing season for both annuals and perennials have small effects on the final results although the perennial to annual yield variability ratio slightly declines when considering a shorter main growing season not shown because the stabilizing effects of the larger initial water storage available to perennials becomes more marked thus beyond the results presented here this study points to the need for extensive experimental investigations contrasting annuals and perennials when grown under similar conditions and extending over later year perennials this step is clearly necessary for a quantitative and complete assessment of the consequences of a shift from annuals to perennial crops we note that our results should be interpreted as a direct comparison of annual and perennial crops but a full assessment of the feasibility of perennial crops should also include considerations regarding their advantages and disadvantages within the full crop rotation for example to benefit from them perennial crops must be maintained in the field for several years their yield stability may thus be put in jeopardy by other issues like disease or weed accumulation furthermore perennial crops introduce a further element of rigidity in the crop rotation such that farmers cannot adjust their management every year based on pre season knowledge on the expected conditions as they would do to reduce yield variability in annual crops aside from the low parameter requirement a further advantage of the modeling approach employed here is the quantification of both average and year to year variability of yield and water requirements without numerically intensive simulations knowledge of the year to year variability of these key variables is critical for planning purposes the tradeoffs emerging among yield and its stability and water requirements underline that the consequences of choosing annual or perennial crops are multi faceted even when focusing the attention on few metrics at the field level 4 conclusions and implications to our knowledge this is the first time that the prospects of perennial crops are quantitatively and simultaneously evaluated with reference not only to yields but also their variability and the associated water requirements and productivity this analysis adds additional dimensions on existing evaluations of perennial crops with respect to their sustainability their viability in crop rotations and their acceptance by farmers and end users see among others bell et al 2008 cox et al 2005 culman et al 2013 marquardt et al 2016 pimentel et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 perennials lead to smaller but more stable yields particularly when considering grain crops despite their faster growing rate larger biomass and the advantage provided by deeper roots at the same time perennials require larger and more variable amounts of irrigation than annuals and have a lower water productivity due to their lower yields despite the benefits provided by deeper roots and even when implementing a water savvy irrigation strategy such as deficit micro irrigation the difference between annual and perennial average yields is smallest in drier climates where the advantage of deeper roots is less marked and is further reduced when considering later year perennials hence the deeper roots of perennials are key to limit yield variability irrigation requirement and its variability suggesting that breeding for perennial crops should aim at maintaining this trait in the face of future more variable climatic conditions in summary the results presented here suggest that perennials are generally suitable to reduce yield variability particularly in dryland rainfed agriculture this reduction in yield variability comes at the cost of lower average yield and water productivity of perennials when compared to annuals furthermore rooting depth water losses via transpiration sought yield and the age of the perennial crop are key in defining the sustainability and productivity of perennial crops yet our review of the literature points to the extreme paucity of quantitative information to characterize some aspects of perennial crops that emerge as key for the assessment of their sustainability in terms of yields and efficient water use this is a major obstacle in defining the sustainability of a shift from annual to perennial crops

soil moisture balance crop development and yield and irrigation water requirements we describe the crop development during the growing season as a stochastically forced dynamical system katul et al 2007 we focus on water availability because of its pivotal role in co2 assimilation and hence plant carbon uptake plant biomass growth and seed production hsiao 1973 lawlor and tezara 2009 vico and porporato 2008 following vico and porporato 2013 the growth rate of the plant biomass is determined by water availability i e the dynamics of plant biomass b t and the plant available soil moisture s t are coupled formally this can be written as a1 n z r ds t dt p t i s t et s t lq s t a2 db t dt g s t see below for symbol clarification soil water balance inputs and losses and plant biomass are all expressed per unit ground area a 1 1 plant available soil moisture balance the soil water balance in a1 describes the dynamics of the plant available soil moisture averaged over the soil layer hosting the majority of roots termed ecohydrologically active rooting zone of depth zr and porosity n the temporal evolution of the average soil moisture s t over this layer is the net result of the input via precipitation and the effective irrigation if any p t and i s t respectively and the losses via evapotranspiration deep drainage and surficial runoff et s t and lq s t respectively laio et al 2001 this soil moisture balance is to be interpreted at the daily time scale precipitation occurs randomly thus injecting stochasticity in the soil moisture balance and crop development rainfall is idealized at the daily time scale as a poisson process with average frequency λ precipitation event depths are assumed to be exponentially distributed with average depth α rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 losses via surficial runoff and deep percolation are simply modeled as instantaneous at the daily time scale losses occurring when the plant available soil moisture reaches a threshold s 1 at or slightly above soil field capacity milly 2001 finally losses via evapotranspiration are assumed to range from zero when s 0 i e no water is available to plants to a maximum value when stomata are fully open we model this dependence as a piecewise function of plant available soil moisture i e a3 e t s t e t m a x s s e t m a x s s s s where etmax is the evapotranspiration rate under well watered conditions i e lower or equal to the potential evapotranspiration rate set by the radiative balance and s is the plant available soil moisture corresponding to the leaf water potential at incipient stomatal closure for simplicity etmax is considered independent of crop developmental stage while this is a simplification we note that early in the main growing season the low leaf area and hence the low transpiration demands per unit ground area are partially balanced by soil water evaporation the latter loss term is drastically reduced after canopy closure however when the transpiring biomass increases in the case of irrigated agriculture an additional input to the soil water balance may be provided via water applications here a demand based irrigation is considered where an irrigation application is triggered by plant available soil moisture reaching a pre defined level s the irrigation application is such that losses via evapotranspiration are fully balanced at the daily time scale i e water is applied at a rate e t s the irrigation application continues till the next effective rainfall event vico and porporato 2011 such an irrigation scheme often termed micro irrigation is among the most water conserving systems currently available in other words the results provided here represent the best case scenario in terms of an effective use of water for irrigation because irrigation applications are triggered by soil moisture reaching the pre set threshold the accumulated irrigation is coupled with the soil moisture temporal evolution for micro irrigation the total irrigation application per unit ground area v t evolves in time as d v t d t g v s t with a4 g v s t g v 0 s s g v e t s s s a 1 2 plant biomass growth the temporal evolution of the crop biomass is estimated via eq a2 applied over the main growing season of length tmain tmain extends over the period when the growth is nearly linear see e g monteith 2000 this period begins some time after emergence or the beginning of sustained growth for winter crops and later years perennials when the initial exponential growth slows down it ends when the growth rate tapers off and resources are reallocated to reproductive and storage structures the end of the main growing season may occur at or after flowering depending on the crop and its growth habit i e determinate and indeterminate the growth rate g s t accounts for the water availability or lack of it it is assumed that under well watered conditions plant growth proceeds unhampered at rate g conversely when water is scarce the growth rate lowers to g with g g vico and porporato 2013 we can thus formalize the rate of change in biomass g s t as a5 g s t g s s g s s in turn g is assumed to a be a nonlinear function of the minimum achievable plant available soil moisture smin equal to zero for rainfed agriculture and to s for irrigated agriculture g g s m i n s 6 vico and porporato 2013 eqs a2 and a5 together result in a piecewise linear biomass growth in time with the rate depending on the alternation of periods of sufficient and limiting water availability indeed low soil water potentials result in reduced leaf water potentials which in turn cause a partial or total stomatal closure and an overall reduction in leaf activity this impairs co2 uptake via photosynthesis and carbon available to the plant for all its functions including growth see e g hsiao 1973 finally we estimate crop yield from the plant biomass at the end of the main growing season via the harvest index hi this concept is flexible enough to accommodate marketable yield as both seeds in this case hi is the seed fraction and biomass in this case hi is the fraction of above ground biomass although simplified this approach captures the key aspects of plant development and yield formation and the overall response of vegetation to reduced soil water availability while at the same time requiring a limited number of parameters a more detailed description of plant development and yield formation would require knowledge of the temporal evolution of biomass growth rate at the different developmental stages and their durations this information is currently missing when considering perennial crops so that a more complex model would result in further uncertainties furthermore a temporal dependence of plant growth rate would make the above model no longer amenable to the analytical approach discussed below conversely additional limiting factors e g nutrient availability could be incorporated in this minimalist description via their effects on growth rates and harvest index but are not considered here a 2 probability density functions of yields and water requirements for irrigation with the assumptions described in section a 1 it is possible to analytically obtain the probability density functions of the key random variables i e plant available soil moisture plant biomass and applied irrigation volume and how they evolve during the main growing season and crop yield the detailed analytical developments are reported in vico and porporato 2013 briefly the first step is considering the durations of well watered and water stressed conditions their average durations λ 1 and λ 1 respectively have been obtained analytically by porporato et al 2001 and vico and porporato 2013 as a function of the parameters of the soil moisture balance eq a1 their distribution is not known exactly but numerical simulations support the assumption of exponentially distributed intervals vico and porporato 2013 in this case the crop development during the main growing season can be idealized as a stationary dichotomous markovian process horsthemke and lefever 1984 van den broeck 1983 the process jumps between two values g and g eq a5 with mean frequency equal to the inverse of the average durations of well watered and water limited periods with this idealization we can analytically obtain the probability density function of the crop biomass and how it evolves in time see aquino et al 2010 and vico and porporato 2013 finally exploiting the harvest index the probability density function of yield is obtained from that of the biomass at the end of the main growing season by means of the derived distribution technique to achieve a more realistic description of water availability during the main growing season we assume that plant available soil moisture always starts at an intermediate status between the point of incipient stomatal closure and field capacity as the result of winter and spring accumulation of water in the soil vico and porporato 2015 in the absence of additional precipitations the crop is then under well watered conditions at least for a period of duration tcross corresponding to the shortest time over which such initially high moisture is depleted the length of tcross depends on the rate of evapotranspiration as well as on the ecohydrologically active rooting depth and hence may differ between annual and perennial crops and first and later year perennials we thus apply the above description only to the period t tmain tcross note that in some extreme cases of deep roots and low etmax tcross may extend over a large fraction of the main growing season moreover for dry winters and deep roots the duration of the well watered period may be overestimated as winter recharge may not be sufficient to ensure soil moistures above the point of incipient stomatal closure at the beginning of the growing season in this case a lower initial soil moisture should be selected the results reported in the main text summarize the obtained probability distribution by means of its average and standard deviation in summary the crop development during the main growing season depends on the biomass growth rates under well watered and water limited conditions g and g the duration of the duration of the initial dry down and the whole main growing season tcross and tmain as well as the average durations of periods of well watered and water limited conditions λ 1 and λ 1 the latter are functions of the size of the plant accessible water store zr precipitation pattern as summarized by λ and α irrigation scheme here micro irrigation triggered when s s and losses via evapotranspiration etmax and s given the similarities between the processes of biomass accumulation eq a2 combined with a5 and the cumulated applied irrigation eq a4 a similar analytical approach can be used also to determine the probability density function of seasonally cumulated irrigation applications per unit area indeed micro irrigation consists of a continuous on a daily scale water application which is started when plant available soil moisture reaches s and discountinued only at the following rainfall event because of the memory less nature of the poisson process driving the precipitation input cox and miller 2001 the duration of the irrigation applications is exactly exponentially distributed with average λ 1 vico and porporato 2010 further the interval between subsequent irrigation applications have average duration λ 1 p 0 1 1 p 0 where p 0 is the atom of probability in s s vico and porporato 2011 thus the temporal evolution of the accumulated water applied for irrigation can be seen as stationary dichotomous markovian process with rate g v e t s during irrigation applications and g v 0 when irrigation is turned off after rainfall events with an approach similar to that followed for the biomass it is possible to obtain analytically the probability density function of the cumulated applied irrigation volume note that for simplicity water resources are assumed to be sufficient to meet the irrigation water demands connected to the implemented irrigation scheme throughout the growing season but the model can also accommodate the case of limited seasonal water resources see vico and porporato 2013 for details the analytical probability density function of the applied irrigation volume over the main growing season permits obtaining the average and standard deviations of these two variables via integration

instance analyzed the flood peaks of more than 500 streamgage stations in the eastern us fitted a generalized extreme value distribution to annual flood peaks of each station and quantified upper tail properties of flood distributions they observed striking spatial heterogeneity in flood distributions over the region which was attributed to the dependence of hydrologic and hydraulic responses on basin physiographic properties as well as to the spatially varying mixtures of flood generating mechanisms berghuijs et al 2016 compared the regional differences in the process control of flooding responses by using daily streamflow and meteorological records from 420 model parameter estimation experiment mopex catchments for the period 1948 2001 using mean and variance of the date of

found that precipitation excess snowmelt and rain on snow events are better predictors of the flooding responses than rainfall characteristics alone merz and blöschl 2008 argued that in lieu of extracting flood peak samples obtained for a single site of interest much better use should be made of the wealth of hydrological knowledge gained in the past century by expanding temporal spatial and causal information indeed various forms of information expansion and fusion have been adopted either explicitly or implicitly in recent hydrologic studies to quantify complex couplings among hydrometeorological variables and explain their roles in climate extreme events such as concurrences of heatwaves and meteorological droughts hao et al 2013 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 the

radiative energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes thus affecting air temperature boundary layer stability and possibly p the nature of sm p coupling however is still under debate seneviratne et al 2010 previous ensemble land surface modeling experiments koster et al 2004 suggested that strong sm climate coupling may exist in transitional zones between dry and wet climates d odorico and porporato 2004 provided theoretical and experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that in continental regions summer sm anomalies affect the probability of occurrence of the subsequent p for each summer day may 1 september 30 between 1980 and 2002 they calculated rainfall frequency in the subsequent 21 days and then related it to the regional average sm tuttle and salvucci 2016 used granger causality test a multivariate linear regression analysis in essence to estimate the causal relationship between sm and occurrence of the next day p over conus their analysis was done using 9 years of remotely sensed sm and gauge based p products at daily steps and a spatial resolution of 0 25 they found that sm anomalies significantly influenced rainfall probabilities over 38 of conus liu et al 2017a evaluated the sensitivity of runoff to climate variables using global land data assimilation system gldas and a regional climate model again they derived multiple hydroclimatic indices using only co located series in each grid cell because of the convection or other atmospheric dynamics hydroclimatic covariability is often not limited to co located events necessitating the search for spatial patterns beyond single sites by looking at many to many correlation among all potentially connected sites such is a form of spatial information expansion referred to by merz and blöschl 2008 geostatistical methods e g kriging have been widely used to analyze spatiotemporal distribution of variables but they are parametric and require specification of covariance models empirical orthogonal decomposition eof is another often used method for studying spatial and temporal patterns in gridded data sets using which spatiotemporally varying climate variables are expanded as a linear combination of eigenmodes for explaining climate teleconnection phenomena as well as for comparing climate observations to model simulations hannachi et al 2007 an alternative approach for analyzing spatial and temporal processes is the complex network theory which may be regarded as an extension of the classic graph theory to complex systems with high structural heterogeneity and inherently dynamic properties newman 2003 complex network theory provides a powerful framework to dissect interdependence and connection strength of physical processes while retaining only the most significant network topology in the analyses thus helping to reveal new visual evidence on embedded driving mechanisms that are otherwise not extractable through conventional analytical tools although the contemporary complex network theory bears many similarities to the classic graph theory that has long been used in hydrology it provides a flexible computational framework for experimenting with many similarity dissimilarity measures originated from fields like information theory and statistical physics importantly more efficient algorithms have been developed to cope with large scale networks arising from big data analytics in recent years the complex network analysis has been applied to quantifying multivariate and multiscale connectivity in hydroclimate tsonis et al 2006 and donges et al 2009b constructed the so called climate networks using climate reanalysis data in their studies the network nodes or vertices were identified with grid cells of climate data sets and links between nodes edges were established using a similarity measure between times series associated with different grid cells only the strongest links filtered using either a predefined link density or correlation cutoff threshold were retained in the final networks to help uncover the most important network characteristics using linear correlation analysis steinhaeuser et al 2011 2012 constructed climate networks from reanalysis data and demonstrated their potential to capture regional and global dependence structures within and among climate variables sun et al 2015 quantified spatial connectivity of observed terrestrial water storage anomalies from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data and suggested that network measures may be used as additional spatial constraints when calibrating global hydrological models such that network statistics obtained using simulated data should match the same statistics obtained from observed data fan et al 2017 constructed climate networks to identify regions that are most significantly affected by el niño la niña events in addition to linear correlation measures nonlinear similarity measures have been used to explore uni or multivariate pairwise relationships such as mutual information donges et al 2009b and transfer entropy runge et al 2015 kriging eof and complex network analysis all operate on certain similarity matrices either covariance or adjacency matrix constructed from gridded data sets thus complex network analysis is applicable wherever the other two methods are applicable however a subtle but important difference is that even when linear similarity measures e g pearson correlation are used network based analyses may still recover characteristics of nonlinear dynamic systems e g scale free property that are otherwise not identifiable using linear approaches such as eof tsonis et al 2006 many hydrologic analyses involve identification and extraction of discrete events e g flood events from continuous time series and then quantifying concurrence rates nonparametric event based synchronicity measures originally introduced in neuroscience to quantify event synchronicity in electroencephalogram eeg signals kreuz et al 2013 quiroga et al 2002 have been combined with the complex network analysis to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall extremes given any two event series in binary form i e 1 if an event occurs at a measurement time and 0 otherwise event synchronization es counts the number of concurrent events in a sliding window which after being normalized by the total number of events gives a simple nonparametric measure of synchronicity es circumvents some difficulty and or ambiguity associated with the conventional correlation analysis such as handling non normality and nonlinearity in data malik et al 2012 used es to analyze extreme precipitation events in indian monsoon system and boers et al 2013 applied es and complex network analysis to characterize extreme precipitation synchronicity in south america monsoon system konapala and mishra 2017 used es to study spatiotemporal evolution of droughts in 344 climatic divisions of conus because es depends on properties beyond the second statistical moment it can be used to examine causal relationships quiroga et al 2002 recently donges et al 2016 and siegmund et al 2017 introduced a similar event coincidence analysis eca measure using which precursor trigger coincidence rate may be calculated to reflect the probability of one type of events preceding succeeding another thus complementing the es measure which does not differentiate the order of events sun et al 2017 applied eca to quantifying concurrences of hydroclimate extremes in global river basins using grace data the main purposes of this study were to a quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of p and sm extremes with a focus on wet events and b identify potential coupling between sm p using eca few network studies have analyzed the covariation pattern of hydrometeorological variables which may span over multiple spatial and temporal scales knowledge of the sm p covariation pattern is useful for flood mitigation and drought management although we mainly focused on the former in this analysis the selected area of study is the state of texas in us which is a geographic region possessing several unique and important attributes a its climate divisions span a wide spectrum from the semiarid west to the humid east b it has produced some of the heaviest rainfall accumulations and flood magnitudes in the history of the us and the world smith et al 2000 c the state is at the forefront of water energy nexus studies where increased energy production activities in semiarid west texas are perceived to compete for limited water supplies that are already under stress due to drought urbanization and irrigated agriculture scanlon et al 2014 and yet 4 seasonal predictability of rainfall and streamflow is generally low for most of texas houborg et al 2012 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 this study utilized more than 30 years of daily precipitation data from the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 which is a gauge only precipitation product over the nldas grid 0 125 and includes an orographic adjustment rui and mocko 2017 for sm gridded model outputs from nldas 2 were used this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area section 3 describes data and methodology section 4 shows the results of analyses followed by discussion and conclusions 2 study area texas covering an area of 690 000 km2 is the largest state in conus by area and the second largest state by economic outputs bea 2015 fig 1 a texas is divided into 10 climate subdivisions mean annual precipitation ranges from 355 mm in its semiarid west to 1187 mm in the humid east prism 2015 and the annual precipitation distribution fig 1 b shows a clear north south stripe pattern across the state average annual temperature gradually increases from 11 c in the northern panhandle to 20 c in lower rio grande that is located in the southmost part of the state gulf of mexico is the predominant geographical feature affecting the state s climate moderating seasonal temperatures along the gulf coast and providing the major source of precipitation for most of the state except for the trans pecos and panhandle regions of texas where precipitation originates mostly from the eastern pacific ocean and from land recycled moisture twdb 1967 annual precipitation in texas exhibits a distinctive bimodal temporal pattern spring is the wettest season in most of the texas with april and may the wettest months a secondary peak of rainfall occurs in september and october slade and patton 2003 tropical cyclones hurricanes and tropic storms typically occur in late summer or early fall and those that made landfall have produced large depths of rainfall over wide areas of the state balcones escarpment an area of steep elevation gradient in central texas at the boundary between the edwards plateau and the gulf coast plain labeled in fig 1 a assists in uplifting of air masses and formation of storms and have produced many of the largest storms in the state slade and patton 2003 smith et al 2000 texas has suffered greatly from severe storms throughout its history flooding is common during spring and early fall the maximum known discharges typically range from about 1 5 3 times greater than 100 year discharges for sites in the western and eastern parts of the state but documented discharges for some sites along the balcones escarpment have been as much as 4 or 5 times greater than the 100 year peak discharges causing severe losses to those establishments existing outside the 100 year floodplain but within floodplains of maximum floods slade and patton 2003 as a result texas has consistently suffered the most deaths and damage from flooding than any other state brody et al 2008 sharif et al 2014 according to federal emergency management agency fema statistics on flood insurance payments from january 1978 to june 2017 texas alone accounted for usd 6 9 billion in property losses only second to louisiana https bsa nfipstat fema gov reports 1040 htm the recent hurricane harvey is expected to significantly increase that amount thus the complex climatic and geographic settings of texas represent a unique complex system with high structural heterogeneity making it well suited for demonstrating the event based complex network analysis insights gained from this study shall be beneficial not only to local emergency managers but also to other coastal regions prone to flooding 3 data and methods 3 1 data gridded p and sm data were acquired from nldas 2 https ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas nldas2model php which includes four land surface models i e noah mosaic sac and vic and covers conus with high spatial 0 125 and temporal hourly resolution period of coverage includes a 30 year retrospective run from january 1 1979 to december 31 2008 augmented with a real time extension from january 1 2009 to the present xia et al 2012 nldas precipitation field is synthesized using a number of rainfall products including daily gauge hourly radar and global satellite observations non precipitation forcing fields are derived from the analysis fields of north american regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 nldas forcing and output have been validated and assessed by using measurements collected from selected observation networks for example nldas 2 daily sm outputs were validated against the long term in situ datasets i e the north american soil moisture database including illinois sm database oklahoma mesonet sm dataset and data from a total of 121 sites of the soil climate analysis network scan covering conus xia et al 2014 the study of xia et al 2014 used in situ sm data from 1997 2002 xia et al 2015 further expanded the evaluation period to 13 years 1999 2012 overall all four nldas 2 land surface models were shown to capture the broad features of observed sm variations i e the seasonal cycle and interannual variability reproducing the daily monthly and annual sm anomalies well and capturing most of the wet and dry events at different soil depths xia et al 2014 in their p and sm causality analysis tuttle and salvucci 2016 compared the remotely sensed data top 1 cm sm from advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e a sensor deployed on nasa s aqua satellite to nldas 2 simulation results 0 10 cm sm simulated by noah and mosaic they reported that the two products generally gave similar feedback patterns the period of study in this work ranges from january 1 1979 to december 31 2014 previously the model validation study by xia et al 2014 showed that for the top 10 cm noah sac has the smallest largest mean absolute error and root mean square error while mosaic and vic are in between noah is currently being used as the land component for national centers for environmental prediction s ncep operational model systems including global forecast system climate forecast system north american modeling system and other regional numerical model systems it is important to understand the limitations and strengths of noah for improving weather and climate prediction skills thus simulated 0 10 cm sm data from noah were mainly used for quantifying sm p coupling results from vic and mosaic are provided as part of the supporting materials the total number of valid nldas grid cells for texas is 4112 downloaded hourly p and sm data were first aggregated into daily steps the daily step is short enough for identification of low frequency high magnitude wet events to explore seasonal patterns the daily time series corresponding to each grid cell were split into four seasons december february djf march may mam july august jja and september november son data processing was done using python scripts on a computer cluster operated by the texas advanced computing center at the university of texas 3 2 event based complex network analysis 3 2 1 event synchronization es general workflow of the event based complex network analysis used in this study consists of event extraction event synchronization quantification and network construction fig 2 during event extraction events of interest are identified according to certain criteria e g the top 10 daily rainfalls in a season manual event identification has also been used as done in ford et al 2015 after forming event series pairwise event synchronization is then performed let s a t i t i t i 1 i 1 n a denote an ordered event series a containing na events where ti denotes the time index an integer of the ith event similarly s b t j j 1 n b denotes another ordered event series b the two event series may represent either events of the same type e g p but occurred at different locations or co located events of different types e g p and sm a coincidence indicator c i a b between s a and s b is defined as kreuz et al 2013 1 c i j a b 1 if t i a t j b τ i j a b 0 otherwise in which t i a t j b is the time delay between any event pair from each of the two event series and τ i j a b defines the width of a sliding window for determining whether the two events are associated with each other 2 τ i j a b 1 2 min t i 1 a t i a t i a t i 1 a t j 1 b t j b t j b t j 1 b in which the factor 1 2 is used to avoid double counting if two events in s a are close to the same event in s b quiroga et al 2002 because intervals between events indirectly reflect the event occurrence rate τ i j a b allows the coincidence indicator to adapt to the local rate of event occurrence by allowing such dynamic delays between events the es measure avoids specification of a fixed lag between time series which can often be ambiguous for climate series boers et al 2013 an upper bound τ max can be imposed such that the window width is τ i j a b min τ i j a b τ max the es measure is then simply calculated by summing over c i j a b and normalizing the result by the total number of events from both series 3 es 1 m i j c i j a b where m n a n b is the total number of events the nonlinear es measure as given in eq 1 is symmetric in this work es was used to quantify similarity between all pairs of grid cells yielding an nc nc square similarity matrix where nc is the total number of grid cells because of symmetry only half of the calculations are necessary for each p time series an event series was extracted by considering the top 10 5 of all daily values resulting in about 328 165 events per grid cell per season the similarity matrix was obtained by using the python package pyspike mulansky 2015 with a τ max value of 3 days 3 2 2 network measures climate networks can be constructed from the similarity matrix in which grid cells are treated as network nodes and a pair of nodes are said to be connected if there is a significant link between them for the latter purpose a preset link density e g 0 02 is usually set to help uncover the most significant features in the network donges et al 2009a in this approach the es values of all pairs of event series are first sorted in an increasing order to generate an empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of es and a cutoff es value denoted as est is then found for the corresponding percentile e g 98th percentile for a link density of 0 02 only links having es values greater than the est are retained for network construction the higher the est is or equivalently the smaller the link density the less likely that two nodes are linked due to spurious correlation to test the statistical significance of the chosen link density a procedure similar to that in boers et al 2013 and konapala and mishra 2017 was used specifically 5000 independent event series were generated with 328 165 independent and uniformly distributed random events in each the es values of all pairs of event series were then calculated and used to derive a test ecdf for comparison with the original input data the null hypothesis is that the randomly generated test set has a similar es value to est at the same link density if est is significantly larger then the null hypothesis is rejected the link trimming process described here leads to a very sparse binary adjacency matrix with elements equal to 1 if the corresponding grid cells are linked and 0 otherwise calculation and storage of similarity matrices is often the most time consuming step in network construction the following climate network measures were used in this study to characterize the topology of networks degree centrality dc of a node is the number of directly connected neighbors also known as the first neighbors in literature the node has 4 dc i j n i a i j where ni is the set of directly connected neighbors of node i and aij are elements of the adjacency matrix nodes with a high dc are called super nodes and clusters of such super nodes are referred to as hubs betweenness centrality bn of a node is the fraction of shortest paths connecting any two nodes that also pass through the node 5 bn i k l i σ k l i k l i σ k l where σkl denotes the number of shortest paths between any pair of nodes k and l and σkl i includes only the shortest paths that pass through i a node with a high bn value indicates the importance of the node in mediating transport of network attributes e g traffic information or mass in climate networks regions exhibiting high bn values may represent pathways for the long ranged directed propagation of extreme climate events boers et al 2013 mean link distance ld is the average length of links that each node has which is normalized by node degree centrality 6 ld i 1 dc i j 1 n c a i j d i s t i j where dc i is the dc of node i nc is the number of nodes and dist i j is the geographical distance between nodes i and j and is defined as 7 d i s t i j r cos 1 sin λ i sin λ j cos λ i cos λ j cos δ i j in which λi and λj are latitudes of the nodes δij is the absolute difference in longitudes and r is earth radius high ld values indicate regions of high synchronicity with distant nodes unlike dc which is a local measure of the directly connected neighborhood both bn and ld are global measures of network topology that rely on shortest link lengths the artificially imposed boundary i e the texas state border in the current case may affect the accuracy of calculated network measures because connections to nodes outside the boundary are cut off for dc measure we simply expanded the study area to include significantly larger areas outside texas whereas for bn and ld measures we adopted a more sophisticated procedure suggested in rheinwalt et al 2012 and recently in wiedermann et al 2016 for each season an ensemble of random surrogate networks are generated that preserve the global and local link distributions between nodes hence explicitly taking into account the spatial embedding of the network in some metric space the underlying assumption is that links that are clipped due to the boundary effect can be randomly re wired inside the boundary using network statistics derived from the existing network the ensemble mean of all surrogate networks is then used to correct for the boundary effect for example the corrected bn is expressed as the ratio between bn of the input network and the ensemble mean bn in this work an ensemble of 300 surrogate networks were used for each season network measures were computed using the pyunicorn package developed by donges et al 2015 which in turn calls the open source graph package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 for network calculations 3 2 3 community detection the problem of community detection refers to the partition of a network into communities of densely connected nodes with the nodes belonging to different communities being only sparsely connected blondel et al 2008 in this study we were interested in combining community detection with the aforementioned network measures to understand the spatial structures of covariation regions community detection has gained significant interests since the seminal paper by girvan and newman 2002 although a wide array of algorithms are available for community detection fortunato 2010 very few of those are suitable for large networks having more than several hundreds of nodes the particular algorithm adopted in this work is a multilevel partition algorithm proposed by blondel et al 2008 it optimizes a network measure called modularity q an indicator of partition correctness in the sense that a good partition should have many edges within communities but only a few between them clauset et al 2004 8 q 1 2 n l i j a i j d c i d c j 2 n l δ c i c j where nl is the total number of edges in a network aij are elements of adjacency matrix dci and dcj are the degree centrality of nodes i and j respectively c u is the community membership of a node u and is equal to 1 if u is part of it and the delta function δ c u c v is 1 if nodes u and v are in the same community and 0 otherwise eq 8 suggests that q is closely related to degree centrality with higher q values indicating better community partitions to maximize the value of q the multi level partition algorithm operates iteratively in two stages in the first stage every node in the network is assigned a separate community and the nodes are moved among communities iteratively in a way that maximizes each node s local contribution to the overall modularity in the second stage a new network is built whose vertices are communities identified from the first stage the two stage process is iterated until there are no more changes and a maximum modularity is attained the algorithm is very efficient making it suitable for analyzing large networks within reasonable time we used an implementation of the multi level partition algorithm from the igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 for this work 3 2 4 soil moisture precipitation coupling in addition to constructing extreme precipitation networks the sm p coupling was quantified using an event based analysis measure eca in particular we were interested in a precursor coincidence rate that is defined between two event series s a and s b as siegmund et al 2017 9 r p 1 n a i 1 n a h j 1 n b i 0 δ t t i a τ t j b in which s a and s b are as defined before h is heaviside function i 0 δt is an indicator function which is equal to 1 when its argument falls within 0 δt and 0 otherwise the parameter δt defines the width of a sliding window and parameter τ allows to explicitly take into account lagged relationships between event series by definition rp is in the 0 1 range thus if s a represents p events and s b represents sm anomalies then rp is the fraction of p events that are preceded by at least one sm anomaly event here sm anomalies are obtained by detrending time series for each season by subtracting the seasonal means the maximum slide window length δt was set to 7 days and the lag τ to 0 for the sm p analysis 4 results and discussion extreme precipitation networks were generated from gridded p data from nldas 2 using the 90th percentile of individual grid time series as event cutoff threshold and with a link density of 0 02 see description under section 3 2 1 for djf for example the resulting network has 171 000 links out of 41122 2 at the specified link density which corresponds to an es value of 0 79 the procedure described in section 3 2 2 was used to test the significance of the specified link density by using 5000 uniformly distributed random event series the es value of the test set is only 0 27 at the 0 02 link density and the maximum es value of the test set is 0 33 thus the retained links are considered statistically significant unless otherwise specified all results reported below pertain to this set of networks fig 3 shows the resulting seasonal dc maps which are normalized by the maximum nodal degree of each season significant variations in spatial dc patterns can be observed across seasons node clusters exhibiting high dc values hot spots tend to synchronize with a relatively large number of adjacent nodes during extreme rainfalls note adjacency is in a similarity sense not necessarily in a geographical sense consequently those hot spot regions may be used as a proxy of high flooding risks in winter djf high value clusters dc 0 4 cover the northeastern half of texas which extends further to the north to oklahoma in spring mam the high value clusters become significantly smaller in size and are mainly located in southeastern texas in summer jja the extreme p clusters cover the entire central texas finally in fall son a high value 0 8 dc cluster is observed near the four state corner of texas oklahoma arkansas louisiana i e near the right border in fig 3 d these dc patterns may be further interpreted using texas climatology in winter and spring precipitation is formed when cool air from the north and from high plains of northern mexico meet the humid air from gulf of mexico in early fall tropical cyclones from both the eastern pacific and atlantic basins contribute to some of the heaviest rainfalls near the texas gulf coast in the summer orographic ascent along the balcones escarpment acts an important forcing mechanism for the extreme thunderstorms observed in central texas nielsen et al 2016 the lack of strongly synchronized p clusters in mam the wettest season in texas is intriguing this may be attributed to the lack of a dominant precipitation generation mechanism in mam as a sensitivity study dc maps generated using the 95th percentile event cutoff is shown in supporting information si fig s1 in general the dc clusters become weaker when the p event cutoff threshold is increased because of the smaller number of p events and subsequently less spatial synchronicity this is especially true for djf and mam in son however we see that more smaller sized extreme rainfall hot spots appear in the brazos river basin in fig 4 bn maps derived for the same p networks are shown recall that bn is a measure of the importance of a network node in mediating propagation of a certain network attribute which in the current case may be interpreted as air mass associated with extreme p as described under section 3 2 2 the bn maps were corrected by using the ensemble mean of 300 surrogate networks that were generated separately for each season to compensate for the boundary effect in djf strong bn values can be observed in northeastern texas near the junction of brazos trinity river basins the pattern is rotated clockwise during jja with one cluster seen in north central texas and another trace of clusters aligned with balcones escarpment bns in mam and son are more scattered suggesting the randomness in heavy rainfalls in those seasons therefore flooding risks in spring and fall tend to be quite widespread an observation that is consistent with what slade and patton 2003 had observed on the basis of 256 major storms in the history of texas 1850 2002 in general many of the high valued bn clusters appear on or near the major river basin boundaries specifically the brazos river basin acts as a major p transport pathway in most of the seasons bn maps derived from networks that were constructed using the 95th percentile cutoff fig s2 agree well with those in fig 4 showing brazos river basin as a major pathway the ld maps shown in fig 5 measure the average shortest spatial distance between each node and its first neighbors all high value ld clusters are concentrated in central texas in the middle of brazos and colorado river basins small sized clusters are observed in balcones escarpment in jja and near east texas in son the nodal average link distance is smaller in jja than in other seasons probably because of the local nature of many storms comparing to fig 4 we see co existence of high valued ld and bn clusters in central texas indicating that the region acts as a central hub for facilitating the long range directed moisture transport processes from different parts of the state at last we identified the p community structure using the 90th percentile extreme p networks all seasons have similar numbers of community structures as shown in fig 6 the community structure shapes are relatively fixed in the north panhandle area and in west texas across all seasons but vary significantly in central texas and the gulf coast region a community border is formed around the balcones escarpment in all seasons except in son in the latter case a golden color community covering the houston area is seen with its longer axis parallel to the gulf coast on the other hand an elongated north south green color community is observed that spans from the southern most corner all the way to central texas these are the communities that are often influenced by tropical cyclones during son for example the golden color community includes the area that was severely flooded during the landfall of hurricane harvey in late august 2017 sm patterns were examined using the same complex network analysis although sm does not transport as dynamically as air masses per se its spatial distribution is influenced by multiple atmospheric surface and subsurface processes including p evapotranspiration and infiltration thus the spatial distribution of sm and its network topology inherently reflect not only the soil properties e g texture and hydraulic conductivity but also signatures of multiple physical processes soil property data used in nldas were derived from 1 km state soil geographic statsgo database and have 11 layers and 16 texture classes fig s3 shows the soil texture data for texas we constructed the sm networks using the 0 10 cm sm data from noah model of nldas 2 the event cutoff was again set to 90th percentile of cell wise sm anomaly values and the link density to 0 02 the resulting sm dc maps are shown in fig 7 overall the spatial patterns of sm dc bear many similarities with the rainfall dc maps shown in fig 3 especially in the summer and fall seasons in addition high value soil moisture dc clusters are found near the southern high plains area the lower texas panhandle which is a region of relatively deep soils comprising of sandy loams and clay loams human alterations of the surface water and energy balance have been massive in the high plains area as already reported in numerous previous studies e g moore and rojstaczer 2002 scanlon et al 2012 irrigation water withdrawal at the region is over 6 109 m3 annually an amount that is so massive that it can cool the surface and raise the latent heat flux as well as the convective available potential energy moore and rojstaczer 2002 although nldas 2 land surface models do not simulate human activities directly a number of in situ scan sites are located near the lower texas panhandle area noah outputs were shown to have relatively high correlation 0 78 with in situ observations in great plains xia et al 2014 for comparison the sm degree maps constructed using the 0 10 cm sm data from mosaic and vic are given in figs s5 and s6 respectively overall the spatial patterns of mosaic are similar to those from noah except for djf although the dc cluster sizes obtained from mosaic are smaller the sm patterns from vic however are significantly different from those given by noah and mosaic the latter observation is consistent with xia et al 2014 who showed that the vic top 10 cm soil moisture has less seasonal variation when compared with the observations and the other three models and a likely cause was attributed to the limited bare soil fractions assigned in vic grid cells the combination of short duration extreme rainfalls high soil moisture conditions and low permeability soil classes may significantly aggravate the flooding risk thus regions with stronger covariability in p and sm should be evaluated during hazard mitigation planning a question is then whether there is also coupling between p and sm in these regions especially in the sense of sm p feedback mechanism the es measure we have used so far does not differentiate the order of events as mentioned before it is trivial that higher p leads to higher sm however sm p coupling in the other direction i e due to sm feedback is more intriguing and is still subject to active investigations as mentioned in the introduction here we applied the eca measure described under section 3 2 4 specifically the precursor coincidence rate to quantify cell wise sm p coupling with sm anomalies being the precursor the absolute values of sm anomalies were used so that contributions of both dry and wet sm events to subsequent p events could be included a statistical significance test was used to ensure that the coincidence is not purely random the null hypothesis of the significance test is that the observed number of coincidences can be explained by two independent series of randomly distributed events following a poisson process if the p value is smaller than a user defined confidence level α the null hypothesis can be rejected donges et al 2016 results are presented in fig 8 all colored areas are significant at α 0 05 level in winter sm p coupling is sparse strong precursor coincidence rate 0 7 is mainly observed along the texas gulf coast in spring and fall the coupling becomes more widespread with mild coupling regions 0 5 0 6 covering almost the entire state however strong coupling is still limited to the coastal area sm p coupling seems to be the strongest in summer the hottest and driest season in texas where significant coupling is seen in lower rio grande river basin near the us mexico border and in the adjacent nueces river basin a previous study showed that summer precipitation in the us may be significantly contributed by local recycling through moisture returning to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration from the same region d odorico and porporato 2004 a more recent study tried to link in situ observations of soil moisture from more than 100 stations in oklahoma to subsequent unorganized afternoon convective precipitation ford et al 2015 the authors found a statistically significant preference for convective precipitation initiation over drier than normal soils with over 70 of events initiating over soil moisture below the long term median in our case the hot summer evapotranspiration may directly drive moisture recycling leading to initiation of local convective precipitation the coupling in the texas panhandle part of the high plains is weak or none in all seasons interestingly many areas exhibiting high extreme rainfall synchronicity e g central texas and balcones escarpment do not exhibit strong sm p coupling suggesting the alternative forcing mechanisms behind the extreme p events occurred in those areas e g sharp elevation changes the main exception is near the texas louisiana border in son where we see high precipitation dc soil moisture dc and strong sm p coupling indeed that is the region known to be highly prone to flooding as a sensitivity study the same analysis was repeated using the 95th percentile event threshold fig s4 in which case the higher threshold tends to weaken the coupling pattern as we already saw in other network measures our sm p coupling results are generally in agreement with the findings of tuttle and salvucci 2016 who used observed p and sm data for example those authors identified the texas gulf coast area as a region of strong sm p coupling they did not observe significant sm p feedback in great plains one of the hot spots identified in the original study of koster et al 2004 our study which uses a nonparametric event causality measure also confirmed that little coupling exists in the texas high plains which is a subregion of great plains nevertheless model uncertainties in land surface models may affect the simulated sm which in turn may affect the sm patterns and sm p coupling future works may use in situ data and or remotely sensed soil moisture data to further confirm the spatiotemporal patterns reported here 5 summary and conclusions extreme event covariability has received significant attention in recent years from the perspective of flood risk and vulnerability assessment a strong need exists to identify flooding risks in flood prone areas to support local decision making balica et al 2013 kauffeldt et al 2016 leskens et al 2014 and mitigate the negative impact of climatic variability mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 this study examined covariation patterns embedded in extreme p and its land surface covariate sm using an event based complex network theoretic approach the nonlinear nonparametric es and eca measures are useful for quantifying the coincidence of extreme events circumventing limiting assumptions behind conventional linear correlation analyses these network measures were demonstrated using high resolution nldas data for texas which is a us state exemplifying strong water energy nexus results reveal that extreme event hot spot patterns and community structures show strong seasonal patterns in texas within each season strong spatial variability also exists because of the wide range of climate divisions in the study area the high resolution extreme event patterns uncovered in this study may be used as a reference to direct future hazard mitigation efforts the capability to quickly visualize embedded connections in massive spatiotemporal data is critical as environmental scientists start to embrace big data technologies granell et al 2016 built on a number of network measures we show that the complex network analysis represents a promising tool for extracting interesting features out of large gridded data sets providing new visual analytics and supplementary information to emergency managers finally it is emphasized that although the methodologies are demonstrated for texas they are general and can be applied to studying any other regions or other types of extreme event synchronicity acknowledgment nldas 2 data were downloaded

the understanding of spatiotemporal covariation patterns embedded in precipitation p and soil moisture sm by using an event based complex network theoretic approach events concurrences are quantified using a nonparametric event synchronization measure and spatial patterns of hydroclimate variables are analyzed by using several network measures and a community detection algorithm sm p coupling is examined using a directional event coincidence analysis measure that takes the order of event occurrences into account the complex network approach is demonstrated for texas us a region possessing a rich set of hydroclimate features and is frequented by catastrophic flooding gridded daily observed p data and simulated sm data are used to create complex networks of p and sm extremes the uncovered high degree centrality regions and community structures are qualitatively in agreement with the overall existing knowledge of hydroclimate extremes in the study region our analyses provide new visual insights on the propagation connectivity and synchronicity of p extremes as well as the sm p coupling in this flood prone region and can be readily used as a basis for event driven predictive analytics for other regions keywords precipitation extremes flooding soil moisture event synchronization complex network theory community detection land surface models 1 introduction in late august 2017 hurricane harvey a category 4 tropical storm made landfall in the gulf coast of texas us with peak accumulations of 51 88 in 1318 mm harvey became the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the contiguous united states conus ncep 2017 and caused catastrophic flood damage and economic losses in southeastern texas globally flood is the most prevalent and damaging natural hazard affecting more regions than any other types of natural hazard coumou and rahmstorf 2012 easterling et al 2000 huntington 2006 kunkel et al 2003 seneviratne 2012 winsemius et al 2015 the warming climate steady growth of population and rapid development of watersheds are likely to induce further changes in the distribution severity and frequency of floods luke et al 2017 milly et al 2002 peduzzi 2017 aggravating flood risks in flood prone regions especially along coastlines syvitski et al 2009 extensive work has been done in the understanding of flood generation mechanisms berghuijs et al 2016 villarini and smith 2010 flood forecasting demargne et al 2014 komma et al 2008 restrepo et al 2012 wu et al 2014 yuan et al 2014 development of early warning systems alfieri et al 2013 and flood risk management brouwer et al 2007 few 2003 in particular significant interests exist in using both process based modeling and statistical analyses to identify mechanisms in the atmosphere land surface surface waters build environment and vadose zone that can potentially affect flood characteristics and distributions traditional flood frequency analyses typically extract events e g maximum annual flood from the site of interest and then fit a univariate probability distribution to the data reiss et al 2001 disparity among sites is mainly analyzed through qualitative examination villarini and smith 2010 for instance analyzed the flood peaks of more than 500 streamgage stations in the eastern us fitted a generalized extreme value distribution to annual flood peaks of each station and quantified upper tail properties of flood distributions they observed striking spatial heterogeneity in flood distributions over the region which was attributed to the dependence of hydrologic and hydraulic responses on basin physiographic properties as well as to the spatially varying mixtures of flood generating mechanisms berghuijs et al 2016 compared the regional differences in the process control of flooding responses by using daily streamflow and meteorological records from 420 model parameter estimation experiment mopex catchments for the period 1948 2001 using mean and variance of the date of occurrence as statistics they considered concurrence of maximum annual flow and its four predictors i e maximum daily precipitation maximum weekly precipitation precipitation excess and snowmelt and found that precipitation excess snowmelt and rain on snow events are better predictors of the flooding responses than rainfall characteristics alone merz and blöschl 2008 argued that in lieu of extracting flood peak samples obtained for a single site of interest much better use should be made of the wealth of hydrological knowledge gained in the past century by expanding temporal spatial and causal information indeed various forms of information expansion and fusion have been adopted either explicitly or implicitly in recent hydrologic studies to quantify complex couplings among hydrometeorological variables and explain their roles in climate extreme events such as concurrences of heatwaves and meteorological droughts hao et al 2013 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 the compound climate events and their societal impact leonard et al 2014 and development of multivariate drought indices using precipitation p soil moisture sm or potential evapotranspiration time series hao and aghakouchak 2013 liu et al 2017b vicente serrano et al 2010 the sm p coupling belongs to one of such widely studied topics antecedent sm and the storage of soil reservoirs at the beginning of a flood event are important for reliable flood forecasts komma et al 2008 soil moisture content through its role in the evapotranspiration process also serves as a key control in the partitioning of radiative energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes thus affecting air temperature boundary layer stability and possibly p the nature of sm p coupling however is still under debate seneviratne et al 2010 previous ensemble land surface modeling experiments koster et al 2004 suggested that strong sm climate coupling may exist in transitional zones between dry and wet climates d odorico and porporato 2004 provided theoretical and experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that in continental regions summer sm anomalies affect the probability of occurrence of the subsequent p for each summer day may 1 september 30 between 1980 and 2002 they calculated rainfall frequency in the subsequent 21 days and then related it to the regional average sm tuttle and salvucci 2016 used granger causality test a multivariate linear regression analysis in essence to estimate the causal relationship between sm and occurrence of the next day p over conus their analysis was done using 9 years of remotely sensed sm and gauge based p products at daily steps and a spatial resolution of 0 25 they found that sm anomalies significantly influenced rainfall probabilities over 38 of conus liu et al 2017a evaluated the sensitivity of runoff to climate variables using global land data assimilation system gldas and a regional climate model again they derived multiple hydroclimatic indices using only co located series in each grid cell because of the convection or other atmospheric dynamics hydroclimatic covariability is often not limited to co located events necessitating the search for spatial patterns beyond single sites by looking at many to many correlation among all potentially connected sites such is a form of spatial information expansion referred to by merz and blöschl 2008 geostatistical methods e g kriging have been widely used to analyze spatiotemporal distribution of variables but they are parametric and require specification of covariance models empirical orthogonal decomposition eof is another often used method for studying spatial and temporal patterns in gridded data sets using which spatiotemporally varying climate variables are expanded as a linear combination of eigenmodes for explaining climate teleconnection phenomena as well as for comparing climate observations to model simulations hannachi et al 2007 an alternative approach for analyzing spatial and temporal processes is the complex network theory which may be regarded as an extension of the classic graph theory to complex systems with high structural heterogeneity and inherently dynamic properties newman 2003 complex network theory provides a powerful framework to dissect interdependence and connection strength of physical processes while retaining only the most significant network topology in the analyses thus helping to reveal new visual evidence on embedded driving mechanisms that are otherwise not extractable through conventional analytical tools although the contemporary complex network theory bears many similarities to the classic graph theory that has long been used in hydrology it provides a flexible computational framework for experimenting with many similarity dissimilarity measures originated from fields like information theory and statistical physics importantly more efficient algorithms have been developed to cope with large scale networks arising from big data analytics in recent years the complex network analysis has been applied to quantifying multivariate and multiscale connectivity in hydroclimate tsonis et al 2006 and donges et al 2009b constructed the so called climate networks using climate reanalysis data in their studies the network nodes or vertices were identified with grid cells of climate data sets and links between nodes edges were established using a similarity measure between times series associated with different grid cells only the strongest links filtered using either a predefined link density or correlation cutoff threshold were retained in the final networks to help uncover the most important network characteristics using linear correlation analysis steinhaeuser et al 2011 2012 constructed climate networks from reanalysis data and demonstrated their potential to capture regional and global dependence structures within and among climate variables sun et al 2015 quantified spatial connectivity of observed terrestrial water storage anomalies from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data and suggested that network measures may be used as additional spatial constraints when calibrating global hydrological models such that network statistics obtained using simulated data should match the same statistics obtained from observed data fan et al 2017 constructed climate networks to identify regions that are most significantly affected by el niño la niña events in addition to linear correlation measures nonlinear similarity measures have been used to explore uni or multivariate pairwise relationships such as mutual information donges et al 2009b and transfer entropy runge et al 2015 kriging eof and complex network analysis all operate on certain similarity matrices either covariance or adjacency matrix constructed from gridded data sets thus complex network analysis is applicable wherever the other two methods are applicable however a subtle but important difference is that even when linear similarity measures e g pearson correlation are used network based analyses may still recover characteristics of nonlinear dynamic systems e g scale free property that are otherwise not identifiable using linear approaches such as eof tsonis et al 2006 many hydrologic analyses involve identification and extraction of discrete events e g flood events from continuous time series and then quantifying concurrence rates nonparametric event based synchronicity measures originally introduced in neuroscience to quantify event synchronicity in electroencephalogram eeg signals kreuz et al 2013 quiroga et al 2002 have been combined with the complex network analysis to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall extremes given any two event series in binary form i e 1 if an event occurs at a measurement time and 0 otherwise event synchronization es counts the number of concurrent events in a sliding window which after being normalized by the total number of events gives a simple nonparametric measure of synchronicity es circumvents some difficulty and or ambiguity associated with the conventional correlation analysis such as handling non normality and nonlinearity in data malik et al 2012 used es to analyze extreme precipitation events in indian monsoon system and boers et al 2013 applied es and complex network analysis to characterize extreme precipitation synchronicity in south america monsoon system konapala and mishra 2017 used es to study spatiotemporal evolution of droughts in 344 climatic divisions of conus because es depends on properties beyond the second statistical moment it can be used to examine causal relationships quiroga et al 2002 recently donges et al 2016 and siegmund et al 2017 introduced a similar event coincidence analysis eca measure using which precursor trigger coincidence rate may be calculated to reflect the probability of one type of events preceding succeeding another thus complementing the es measure which does not differentiate the order of events sun et al 2017 applied eca to quantifying concurrences of hydroclimate extremes in global river basins using grace data the main purposes of this study were to a quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of p and sm extremes with a focus on wet events and b identify potential coupling between sm p using eca few network studies have analyzed the covariation pattern of hydrometeorological variables which may span over multiple spatial and temporal scales knowledge of the sm p covariation pattern is useful for flood mitigation and drought management although we mainly focused on the former in this analysis the selected area of study is the state of texas in us which is a geographic region possessing several unique and important attributes a its climate divisions span a wide spectrum from the semiarid west to the humid east b it has produced some of the heaviest rainfall accumulations and flood magnitudes in the history of the us and the world smith et al 2000 c the state is at the forefront of water energy nexus studies where increased energy production activities in semiarid west texas are perceived to compete for limited water supplies that are already under stress due to drought urbanization and irrigated agriculture scanlon et al 2014 and yet 4 seasonal predictability of rainfall and streamflow is generally low for most of texas houborg et al 2012 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 this study utilized more than 30 years of daily precipitation data from the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 which is a gauge only precipitation product over the nldas grid 0 125 and includes an orographic adjustment rui and mocko 2017 for sm gridded model outputs from nldas 2 were used this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area section 3 describes data and methodology section 4 shows the results of analyses followed by discussion and conclusions 2 study area texas covering an area of 690 000 km2 is the largest state in conus by area and the second largest state by economic outputs bea 2015 fig 1 a texas is divided into 10 climate subdivisions mean annual precipitation ranges from 355 mm in its semiarid west to 1187 mm in the humid east prism 2015 and the annual precipitation distribution fig 1 b shows a clear north south stripe pattern across the state average annual temperature gradually increases from 11 c in the northern panhandle to 20 c in lower rio grande that is located in the southmost part of the state gulf of mexico is the predominant geographical feature affecting the state s climate moderating seasonal temperatures along the gulf coast and providing the major source of precipitation for most of the state except for the trans pecos and panhandle regions of texas where precipitation originates mostly from the eastern pacific ocean and from land recycled moisture twdb 1967 annual precipitation in texas exhibits a distinctive bimodal temporal pattern spring is the wettest season in most of the texas with april and may the wettest months a secondary peak of rainfall occurs in september and october slade and patton 2003 tropical cyclones hurricanes and tropic storms typically occur in late summer or early fall and those that made landfall have produced large depths of rainfall over wide areas of the state balcones escarpment an area of steep elevation gradient in central texas at the boundary between the edwards plateau and the gulf coast plain labeled in fig 1 a assists in uplifting of air masses and formation of storms and have produced many of the largest storms in the state slade and patton 2003 smith et al 2000 texas has suffered greatly from severe storms throughout its history flooding is common during spring and early fall the maximum known discharges typically range from about 1 5 3 times greater than 100 year discharges for sites in the western and eastern parts of the state but documented discharges for some sites along the balcones escarpment have been as much as 4 or 5 times greater than the 100 year peak discharges causing severe losses to those establishments existing outside the 100 year floodplain but within floodplains of maximum floods slade and patton 2003 as a result texas has consistently suffered the most deaths and damage from flooding than any other state brody et al 2008 sharif et al 2014 according to federal emergency management agency fema statistics on flood insurance payments from january 1978 to june 2017 texas alone accounted for usd 6 9 billion in property losses only second to louisiana https bsa nfipstat fema gov reports 1040 htm the recent hurricane harvey is expected to significantly increase that amount thus the complex climatic and geographic settings of texas represent a unique complex system with high structural heterogeneity making it well suited for demonstrating the event based complex network analysis insights gained from this study shall be beneficial not only to local emergency managers but also to other coastal regions prone to flooding 3 data and methods 3 1 data gridded p and sm data were acquired from nldas 2 https ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas nldas2model php which includes four land surface models i e noah mosaic sac and vic and covers conus with high spatial 0 125 and temporal hourly resolution period of coverage includes a 30 year retrospective run from january 1 1979 to december 31 2008 augmented with a real time extension from january 1 2009 to the present xia et al 2012 nldas precipitation field is synthesized using a number of rainfall products including daily gauge hourly radar and global satellite observations non precipitation forcing fields are derived from the analysis fields of north american regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 nldas forcing and output have been validated and assessed by using measurements collected from selected observation networks for example nldas 2 daily sm outputs were validated against the long term in situ datasets i e the north american soil moisture database including illinois sm database oklahoma mesonet sm dataset and data from a total of 121 sites of the soil climate analysis network scan covering conus xia et al 2014 the study of xia et al 2014 used in situ sm data from 1997 2002 xia et al 2015 further expanded the evaluation period to 13 years 1999 2012 overall all four nldas 2 land surface models were shown to capture the broad features of observed sm variations i e the seasonal cycle and interannual variability reproducing the daily monthly and annual sm anomalies well and capturing most of the wet and dry events at different soil depths xia et al 2014 in their p and sm causality analysis tuttle and salvucci 2016 compared the remotely sensed data top 1 cm sm from advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e a sensor deployed on nasa s aqua satellite to nldas 2 simulation results 0 10 cm sm simulated by noah and mosaic they reported that the two products generally gave similar feedback patterns the period of study in this work ranges from january 1 1979 to december 31 2014 previously the model validation study by xia et al 2014 showed that for the top 10 cm noah sac has the smallest largest mean absolute error and root mean square error while mosaic and vic are in between noah is currently being used as the land component for national centers for environmental prediction s ncep operational model systems including global forecast system climate forecast system north american modeling system and other regional numerical model systems it is important to understand the limitations and strengths of noah for improving weather and climate prediction skills thus simulated 0 10 cm sm data from noah were mainly used for quantifying sm p coupling results from vic and mosaic are provided as part of the supporting materials the total number of valid nldas grid cells for texas is 4112 downloaded hourly p and sm data were first aggregated into daily steps the daily step is short enough for identification of low frequency high magnitude wet events to explore seasonal patterns the daily time series corresponding to each grid cell were split into four seasons december february djf march may mam july august jja and september november son data processing was done using python scripts on a computer cluster operated by the texas advanced computing center at the university of texas 3 2 event based complex network analysis 3 2 1 event synchronization es general workflow of the event based complex network analysis used in this study consists of event extraction event synchronization quantification and network construction fig 2 during event extraction events of interest are identified according to certain criteria e g the top 10 daily rainfalls in a season manual event identification has also been used as done in ford et al 2015 after forming event series pairwise event synchronization is then performed let s a t i t i t i 1 i 1 n a denote an ordered event series a containing na events where ti denotes the time index an integer of the ith event similarly s b t j j 1 n b denotes another ordered event series b the two event series may represent either events of the same type e g p but occurred at different locations or co located events of different types e g p and sm a coincidence indicator c i a b between s a and s b is defined as kreuz et al 2013 1 c i j a b 1 if t i a t j b τ i j a b 0 otherwise in which t i a t j b is the time delay between any event pair from each of the two event series and τ i j a b defines the width of a sliding window for determining whether the two events are associated with each other 2 τ i j a b 1 2 min t i 1 a t i a t i a t i 1 a t j 1 b t j b t j b t j 1 b in which the factor 1 2 is used to avoid double counting if two events in s a are close to the same event in s b quiroga et al 2002 because intervals between events indirectly reflect the event occurrence rate τ i j a b allows the coincidence indicator to adapt to the local rate of event occurrence by allowing such dynamic delays between events the es measure avoids specification of a fixed lag between time series which can often be ambiguous for climate series boers et al 2013 an upper bound τ max can be imposed such that the window width is τ i j a b min τ i j a b τ max the es measure is then simply calculated by summing over c i j a b and normalizing the result by the total number of events from both series 3 es 1 m i j c i j a b where m n a n b is the total number of events the nonlinear es measure as given in eq 1 is symmetric in this work es was used to quantify similarity between all pairs of grid cells yielding an nc nc square similarity matrix where nc is the total number of grid cells because of symmetry only half of the calculations are necessary for each p time series an event series was extracted by considering the top 10 5 of all daily values resulting in about 328 165 events per grid cell per season the similarity matrix was obtained by using the python package pyspike mulansky 2015 with a τ max value of 3 days 3 2 2 network measures climate networks can be constructed from the similarity matrix in which grid cells are treated as network nodes and a pair of nodes are said to be connected if there is a significant link between them for the latter purpose a preset link density e g 0 02 is usually set to help uncover the most significant features in the network donges et al 2009a in this approach the es values of all pairs of event series are first sorted in an increasing order to generate an empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of es and a cutoff es value denoted as est is then found for the corresponding percentile e g 98th percentile for a link density of 0 02 only links having es values greater than the est are retained for network construction the higher the est is or equivalently the smaller the link density the less likely that two nodes are linked due to spurious correlation to test the statistical significance of the chosen link density a procedure similar to that in boers et al 2013 and konapala and mishra 2017 was used specifically 5000 independent event series were generated with 328 165 independent and uniformly distributed random events in each the es values of all pairs of event series were then calculated and used to derive a test ecdf for comparison with the original input data the null hypothesis is that the randomly generated test set has a similar es value to est at the same link density if est is significantly larger then the null hypothesis is rejected the link trimming process described here leads to a very sparse binary adjacency matrix with elements equal to 1 if the corresponding grid cells are linked and 0 otherwise calculation and storage of similarity matrices is often the most time consuming step in network construction the following climate network measures were used in this study to characterize the topology of networks degree centrality dc of a node is the number of directly connected neighbors also known as the first neighbors in literature the node has 4 dc i j n i a i j where ni is the set of directly connected neighbors of node i and aij are elements of the adjacency matrix nodes with a high dc are called super nodes and clusters of such super nodes are referred to as hubs betweenness centrality bn of a node is the fraction of shortest paths connecting any two nodes that also pass through the node 5 bn i k l i σ k l i k l i σ k l where σkl denotes the number of shortest paths between any pair of nodes k and l and σkl i includes only the shortest paths that pass through i a node with a high bn value indicates the importance of the node in mediating transport of network attributes e g traffic information or mass in climate networks regions exhibiting high bn values may represent pathways for the long ranged directed propagation of extreme climate events boers et al 2013 mean link distance ld is the average length of links that each node has which is normalized by node degree centrality 6 ld i 1 dc i j 1 n c a i j d i s t i j where dc i is the dc of node i nc is the number of nodes and dist i j is the geographical distance between nodes i and j and is defined as 7 d i s t i j r cos 1 sin λ i sin λ j cos λ i cos λ j cos δ i j in which λi and λj are latitudes of the nodes δij is the absolute difference in longitudes and r is earth radius high ld values indicate regions of high synchronicity with distant nodes unlike dc which is a local measure of the directly connected neighborhood both bn and ld are global measures of network topology that rely on shortest link lengths the artificially imposed boundary i e the texas state border in the current case may affect the accuracy of calculated network measures because connections to nodes outside the boundary are cut off for dc measure we simply expanded the study area to include significantly larger areas outside texas whereas for bn and ld measures we adopted a more sophisticated procedure suggested in rheinwalt et al 2012 and recently in wiedermann et al 2016 for each season an ensemble of random surrogate networks are generated that preserve the global and local link distributions between nodes hence explicitly taking into account the spatial embedding of the network in some metric space the underlying assumption is that links that are clipped due to the boundary effect can be randomly re wired inside the boundary using network statistics derived from the existing network the ensemble mean of all surrogate networks is then used to correct for the boundary effect for example the corrected bn is expressed as the ratio between bn of the input network and the ensemble mean bn in this work an ensemble of 300 surrogate networks were used for each season network measures were computed using the pyunicorn package developed by donges et al 2015 which in turn calls the open source graph package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 for network calculations 3 2 3 community detection the problem of community detection refers to the partition of a network into communities of densely connected nodes with the nodes belonging to different communities being only sparsely connected blondel et al 2008 in this study we were interested in combining community detection with the aforementioned network measures to understand the spatial structures of covariation regions community detection has gained significant interests since the seminal paper by girvan and newman 2002 although a wide array of algorithms are available for community detection fortunato 2010 very few of those are suitable for large networks having more than several hundreds of nodes the particular algorithm adopted in this work is a multilevel partition algorithm proposed by blondel et al 2008 it optimizes a network measure called modularity q an indicator of partition correctness in the sense that a good partition should have many edges within communities but only a few between them clauset et al 2004 8 q 1 2 n l i j a i j d c i d c j 2 n l δ c i c j where nl is the total number of edges in a network aij are elements of adjacency matrix dci and dcj are the degree centrality of nodes i and j respectively c u is the community membership of a node u and is equal to 1 if u is part of it and the delta function δ c u c v is 1 if nodes u and v are in the same community and 0 otherwise eq 8 suggests that q is closely related to degree centrality with higher q values indicating better community partitions to maximize the value of q the multi level partition algorithm operates iteratively in two stages in the first stage every node in the network is assigned a separate community and the nodes are moved among communities iteratively in a way that maximizes each node s local contribution to the overall modularity in the second stage a new network is built whose vertices are communities identified from the first stage the two stage process is iterated until there are no more changes and a maximum modularity is attained the algorithm is very efficient making it suitable for analyzing large networks within reasonable time we used an implementation of the multi level partition algorithm from the igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 for this work 3 2 4 soil moisture precipitation coupling in addition to constructing extreme precipitation networks the sm p coupling was quantified using an event based analysis measure eca in particular we were interested in a precursor coincidence rate that is defined between two event series s a and s b as siegmund et al 2017 9 r p 1 n a i 1 n a h j 1 n b i 0 δ t t i a τ t j b in which s a and s b are as defined before h is heaviside function i 0 δt is an indicator function which is equal to 1 when its argument falls within 0 δt and 0 otherwise the parameter δt defines the width of a sliding window and parameter τ allows to explicitly take into account lagged relationships between event series by definition rp is in the 0 1 range thus if s a represents p events and s b represents sm anomalies then rp is the fraction of p events that are preceded by at least one sm anomaly event here sm anomalies are obtained by detrending time series for each season by subtracting the seasonal means the maximum slide window length δt was set to 7 days and the lag τ to 0 for the sm p analysis 4 results and discussion extreme precipitation networks were generated from gridded p data from nldas 2 using the 90th percentile of individual grid time series as event cutoff threshold and with a link density of 0 02 see description under section 3 2 1 for djf for example the resulting network has 171 000 links out of 41122 2 at the specified link density which corresponds to an es value of 0 79 the procedure described in section 3 2 2 was used to test the significance of the specified link density by using 5000 uniformly distributed random event series the es value of the test set is only 0 27 at the 0 02 link density and the maximum es value of the test set is 0 33 thus the retained links are considered statistically significant unless otherwise specified all results reported below pertain to this set of networks fig 3 shows the resulting seasonal dc maps which are normalized by the maximum nodal degree of each season significant variations in spatial dc patterns can be observed across seasons node clusters exhibiting high dc values hot spots tend to synchronize with a relatively large number of adjacent nodes during extreme rainfalls note adjacency is in a similarity sense not necessarily in a geographical sense consequently those hot spot regions may be used as a proxy of high flooding risks in winter djf high value clusters dc 0 4 cover the northeastern half of texas which extends further to the north to oklahoma in spring mam the high value clusters become significantly smaller in size and are mainly located in southeastern texas in summer jja the extreme p clusters cover the entire central texas finally in fall son a high value 0 8 dc cluster is observed near the four state corner of texas oklahoma arkansas louisiana i e near the right border in fig 3 d these dc patterns may be further interpreted using texas climatology in winter and spring precipitation is formed when cool air from the north and from high plains of northern mexico meet the humid air from gulf of mexico in early fall tropical cyclones from both the eastern pacific and atlantic basins contribute to some of the heaviest rainfalls near the texas gulf coast in the summer orographic ascent along the balcones escarpment acts an important forcing mechanism for the extreme thunderstorms observed in central texas nielsen et al 2016 the lack of strongly synchronized p clusters in mam the wettest season in texas is intriguing this may be attributed to the lack of a dominant precipitation generation mechanism in mam as a sensitivity study dc maps generated using the 95th percentile event cutoff is shown in supporting information si fig s1 in general the dc clusters become weaker when the p event cutoff threshold is increased because of the smaller number of p events and subsequently less spatial synchronicity this is especially true for djf and mam in son however we see that more smaller sized extreme rainfall hot spots appear in the brazos river basin in fig 4 bn maps derived for the same p networks are shown recall that bn is a measure of the importance of a network node in mediating propagation of a certain network attribute which in the current case may be interpreted as air mass associated with extreme p as described under section 3 2 2 the bn maps were corrected by using the ensemble mean of 300 surrogate networks that were generated separately for each season to compensate for the boundary effect in djf strong bn values can be observed in northeastern texas near the junction of brazos trinity river basins the pattern is rotated clockwise during jja with one cluster seen in north central texas and another trace of clusters aligned with balcones escarpment bns in mam and son are more scattered suggesting the randomness in heavy rainfalls in those seasons therefore flooding risks in spring and fall tend to be quite widespread an observation that is consistent with what slade and patton 2003 had observed on the basis of 256 major storms in the history of texas 1850 2002 in general many of the high valued bn clusters appear on or near the major river basin boundaries specifically the brazos river basin acts as a major p transport pathway in most of the seasons bn maps derived from networks that were constructed using the 95th percentile cutoff fig s2 agree well with those in fig 4 showing brazos river basin as a major pathway the ld maps shown in fig 5 measure the average shortest spatial distance between each node and its first neighbors all high value ld clusters are concentrated in central texas in the middle of brazos and colorado river basins small sized clusters are observed in balcones escarpment in jja and near east texas in son the nodal average link distance is smaller in jja than in other seasons probably because of the local nature of many storms comparing to fig 4 we see co existence of high valued ld and bn clusters in central texas indicating that the region acts as a central hub for facilitating the long range directed moisture transport processes from different parts of the state at last we identified the p community structure using the 90th percentile extreme p networks all seasons have similar numbers of community structures as shown in fig 6 the community structure shapes are relatively fixed in the north panhandle area and in west texas across all seasons but vary significantly in central texas and the gulf coast region a community border is formed around the balcones escarpment in all seasons except in son in the latter case a golden color community covering the houston area is seen with its longer axis parallel to the gulf coast on the other hand an elongated north south green color community is observed that spans from the southern most corner all the way to central texas these are the communities that are often influenced by tropical cyclones during son for example the golden color community includes the area that was severely flooded during the landfall of hurricane harvey in late august 2017 sm patterns were examined using the same complex network analysis although sm does not transport as dynamically as air masses per se its spatial distribution is influenced by multiple atmospheric surface and subsurface processes including p evapotranspiration and infiltration thus the spatial distribution of sm and its network topology inherently reflect not only the soil properties e g texture and hydraulic conductivity but also signatures of multiple physical processes soil property data used in nldas were derived from 1 km state soil geographic statsgo database and have 11 layers and 16 texture classes fig s3 shows the soil texture data for texas we constructed the sm networks using the 0 10 cm sm data from noah model of nldas 2 the event cutoff was again set to 90th percentile of cell wise sm anomaly values and the link density to 0 02 the resulting sm dc maps are shown in fig 7 overall the spatial patterns of sm dc bear many similarities with the rainfall dc maps shown in fig 3 especially in the summer and fall seasons in addition high value soil moisture dc clusters are found near the southern high plains area the lower texas panhandle which is a region of relatively deep soils comprising of sandy loams and clay loams human alterations of the surface water and energy balance have been massive in the high plains area as already reported in numerous previous studies e g moore and rojstaczer 2002 scanlon et al 2012 irrigation water withdrawal at the region is over 6 109 m3 annually an amount that is so massive that it can cool the surface and raise the latent heat flux as well as the convective available potential energy moore and rojstaczer 2002 although nldas 2 land surface models do not simulate human activities directly a number of in situ scan sites are located near the lower texas panhandle area noah outputs were shown to have relatively high correlation 0 78 with in situ observations in great plains xia et al 2014 for comparison the sm degree maps constructed using the 0 10 cm sm data from mosaic and vic are given in figs s5 and s6 respectively overall the spatial patterns of mosaic are similar to those from noah except for djf although the dc cluster sizes obtained from mosaic are smaller the sm patterns from vic however are significantly different from those given by noah and mosaic the latter observation is consistent with xia et al 2014 who showed that the vic top 10 cm soil moisture has less seasonal variation when compared with the observations and the other three models and a likely cause was attributed to the limited bare soil fractions assigned in vic grid cells the combination of short duration extreme rainfalls high soil moisture conditions and low permeability soil classes may significantly aggravate the flooding risk thus regions with stronger covariability in p and sm should be evaluated during hazard mitigation planning a question is then whether there is also coupling between p and sm in these regions especially in the sense of sm p feedback mechanism the es measure we have used so far does not differentiate the order of events as mentioned before it is trivial that higher p leads to higher sm however sm p coupling in the other direction i e due to sm feedback is more intriguing and is still subject to active investigations as mentioned in the introduction here we applied the eca measure described under section 3 2 4 specifically the precursor coincidence rate to quantify cell wise sm p coupling with sm anomalies being the precursor the absolute values of sm anomalies were used so that contributions of both dry and wet sm events to subsequent p events could be included a statistical significance test was used to ensure that the coincidence is not purely random the null hypothesis of the significance test is that the observed number of coincidences can be explained by two independent series of randomly distributed events following a poisson process if the p value is smaller than a user defined confidence level α the null hypothesis can be rejected donges et al 2016 results are presented in fig 8 all colored areas are significant at α 0 05 level in winter sm p coupling is sparse strong precursor coincidence rate 0 7 is mainly observed along the texas gulf coast in spring and fall the coupling becomes more widespread with mild coupling regions 0 5 0 6 covering almost the entire state however strong coupling is still limited to the coastal area sm p coupling seems to be the strongest in summer the hottest and driest season in texas where significant coupling is seen in lower rio grande river basin near the us mexico border and in the adjacent nueces river basin a previous study showed that summer precipitation in the us may be significantly contributed by local recycling through moisture returning to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration from the same region d odorico and porporato 2004 a more recent study tried to link in situ observations of soil moisture from more than 100 stations in oklahoma to subsequent unorganized afternoon convective precipitation ford et al 2015 the authors found a statistically significant preference for convective precipitation initiation over drier than normal soils with over 70 of events initiating over soil moisture below the long term median in our case the hot summer evapotranspiration may directly drive moisture recycling leading to initiation of local convective precipitation the coupling in the texas panhandle part of the high plains is weak or none in all seasons interestingly many areas exhibiting high extreme rainfall synchronicity e g central texas and balcones escarpment do not exhibit strong sm p coupling suggesting the alternative forcing mechanisms behind the extreme p events occurred in those areas e g sharp elevation changes the main exception is near the texas louisiana border in son where we see high precipitation dc soil moisture dc and strong sm p coupling indeed that is the region known to be highly prone to flooding as a sensitivity study the same analysis was repeated using the 95th percentile event threshold fig s4 in which case the higher threshold tends to weaken the coupling pattern as we already saw in other network measures our sm p coupling results are generally in agreement with the findings of tuttle and salvucci 2016 who used observed p and sm data for example those authors identified the texas gulf coast area as a region of strong sm p coupling they did not observe significant sm p feedback in great plains one of the hot spots identified in the original study of koster et al 2004 our study which uses a nonparametric event causality measure also confirmed that little coupling exists in the texas high plains which is a subregion of great plains nevertheless model uncertainties in land surface models may affect the simulated sm which in turn may affect the sm patterns and sm p coupling future works may use in situ data and or remotely sensed soil moisture data to further confirm the spatiotemporal patterns reported here 5 summary and conclusions extreme event covariability has received significant attention in recent years from the perspective of flood risk and vulnerability assessment a strong need exists to identify flooding risks in flood prone areas to support local decision making balica et al 2013 kauffeldt et al 2016 leskens et al 2014 and mitigate the negative impact of climatic variability mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 this study examined covariation patterns embedded in extreme p and its land surface covariate sm using an event based complex network theoretic approach the nonlinear nonparametric es and eca measures are useful for quantifying the coincidence of extreme events circumventing limiting assumptions behind conventional linear correlation analyses these network measures were demonstrated using high resolution nldas data for texas which is a us state exemplifying strong water energy nexus results reveal that extreme event hot spot patterns and community structures show strong seasonal patterns in texas within each season strong spatial variability also exists because of the wide range of climate divisions in the study area the high resolution extreme event patterns uncovered in this study may be used as a reference to direct future hazard mitigation efforts the capability to quickly visualize embedded connections in massive spatiotemporal data is critical as environmental scientists start to embrace big data technologies granell et al 2016 built on a number of network measures we show that the complex network analysis represents a promising tool for extracting interesting features out of large gridded data sets providing new visual analytics and supplementary information to emergency managers finally it is emphasized that although the methodologies are demonstrated for texas they are general and can be applied to studying any other regions or other types of extreme event synchronicity acknowledgment nldas 2 data were downloaded

883,modeling and data analyses were used in this study to examine the temporal hydrological variability in geographically isolated wetlands giws as influenced by hydrologic connectivity to shallow groundwater wetland bathymetry and subject to stochastic hydro climatic forcing we examined the general case of giws coupled to shallow groundwater through exfiltration or infiltration across wetland bottom we also examined limiting case with the wetland stage as the local expression of the shallow groundwater we derive analytical expressions for the steady state probability density functions pdfs for wetland water storage and stage using few scaled physically based parameters in addition we analyze the hydrologic crossing time properties of wetland stage and the dependence of the mean hydroperiod on climatic and wetland morphologic attributes our analyses show that it is crucial to account for shallow groundwater connectivity to fully understand the hydrologic dynamics in wetlands the application of the model to two different case studies in florida jointly with a detailed sensitivity analysis allowed us to identify the main drivers of hydrologic dynamics in giws under different climate and morphologic conditions keywords crossing time probability density function eco hydrology hydrologic regimes hydro period 1 introduction wetlands are key hydrological elements of landscapes and their spatiotemporal dynamics strongly influence surface water storage runoff groundwater recharge discharge processes and evapotranspiration rains et al 2016 they also play a key role in determining the temporal variability of catchment biogeochemical processes e g nutrient and sediment accretion transformations etc cheng and basu 2017 marton et al 2015 and ecological processes e g aquatic habitat suitability and integrity for unique flora and fauna euliss et al 2008 of the diverse types of inland freshwater wetlands our interest here is to examine geographically isolated wetlands giws defined as wetlands that are completely surrounded by upland while there may be no accepted scientific definition of an isolated wetland it is clear from the hydrologic and ecological literature leibowitz 2015 tiner 2003 that interactions between such wetlands and other water bodies can indeed occur here we use the term giws to simply represent single depressions with topographically delineated boundaries which form natural contributing area for surface water flow to each wetland such giws are embedded into the landscape in various spatial patterns and not permanently connected to stream networks isolated wetlands can interact through permanent or episodic connections to regional shallow groundwater depending on the hydro geologic setting of the specific landscape we do not consider inter connectivity among wetlands during flooding events when ephemeral stream networks are formed our motivation for exploring stochastic modeling approaches to dynamics of isolated wetlands is based on related research on groundwater dependent ecosystems laio et al 2009 tamea et al 2009 and our recent work by park et al 2014 our overall goal is to develop generalized analytical solutions defined by few key parameters for quantifying long term dynamics of wetlands representing a range of likely scenarios for linkage between the giws and surrounding uplands vadose zone or shallow groundwater located near the wetland bottom when a sufficiently thick low permeability layer occurs along the pool bottom as a result of accretion of fine sediment or organic material or presence of confining units e g clay the wetland bottom regulates water exchange between wetland and groundwater rains et al 2016 section 2 3 as the hydrologic resistivity of the wetland bottom decreases the pool water can readily exfiltrate to surrounding uplands and exchange with shallow groundwater in response to the hydrologic potential gradients section 2 4 conversely as the hydrologic resistivity of the wetland bottom increases the wetland pool dynamics become increasingly independent of the shallow groundwater and upland as well supplementary material section s 1 the approach represents an extension of park et al 2014 where a stochastic model was presented for giws connected to uplands but connectivity to groundwater was not explicitly considered in that work groundwater was not considered as a source of input into the wetland and water losses from the wetland were only driven by evapotranspiration and exfiltration as a function of the water storage volume in the wetland here we extend this approach to explicitly account for the effect of a dynamic water table section 2 3 we provide analytical solutions for the probability density functions pdfs of the volume and stage of a wetland where shallow groundwater dynamics influence wetland stage fluctuations the analytical pdfs we present here are completely described by five non dimensional parameters defining the hydro climatic forcing wetland bathymetry and hydrologic interactions with the surrounding landscape upland shallow groundwater these analytical pdfs enable direct comparison between coupled wetland groundwater systems with widely varying characteristics we also analyze the crossing time properties of wetland stage volume to understand how hydroperiod varies according to multiple factors tamea et al 2011 hydrologic thresholds are important for the ecological and habitat suitability for a variety of adapted aquatic fauna and flora cronk and fennessy 2001 snodgrass et al 2000 therefore a better understanding of the main processes affecting the patterns of exposure and inundation along wetland transects may bring important implications for ecological processes altermatt et al 2009 laio et al 2009 tamea et al 2009 the coupling of such considerations can represent an important step toward a new method for wetland classification depending on the climatic conditions the type of landscape the geometry of the wetlands and their interaction with the hydrological elements of the watershed such attributes are embedded in the dimensionless parameters that determine the shapes of the analytical expressions of the derived pdf and the mean crossing times 2 coupled stochastic modeling of wetland groundwater systems 2 1 modeling framework we conceptualize a giw as a depression in the landscape within which water can accumulate from a well delineated contributing area and with its bathymetry defined by the landscape topography the changes in giw water storage are completely described by the balance or imbalance between water inputs and water losses the configuration of the model is depicted in fig 1 water inputs are precipitation over the contributing area of the wetland and groundwater infiltration water losses from the wetland are dominated by evapotranspiration et and exfiltration this continuous exchange of water between shallow groundwater and giw requires evaluation of the coupled dynamics of the wetland groundwater system in our analysis shallow groundwater was modeled as a second storage subject to inputs from et censored rainfall and losses modulated through first order hydrologic recession on the basis of the foregoing assumptions the water balance equations for giw coupled with shallow groundwater can be written as 1 d w d t ξ λ p α p a c e t a w k 1 h w z s w 2 d w g w d t ξ λ α p a g w k 2 w g w in eqs 1 and 2 w is the water volume stored in the wetland and wgw the water volume stored in shallow groundwater the first term on the right hand side of eqs 1 and 2 represents the stochastic water inputs due to a sequence of rainfall effective rainfall events in particular following rodriguez iturbe et al and botter et al 2007 the term ξ λp αpac is modeled as a stationary poisson process where the events occur at random times with mean frequency λp t 1 and random exponentially distributed depths with mean αp l over the wetland contributing area ac the term ξ λ αpagw represents the stochastic water input from the root zone to the groundwater due to a sequence of censored rainfall events over the groundwater contributing area agw porporato et al 2004 effective rainfall events take place with frequency λ λp and are also represented by a marked poisson process botter et al 2007 the frequency λ of these censored episodic events produced by the infiltrating precipitation can be expressed in terms of the underlying rainfall soil and vegetation properties botter et al 2007 porporato et al 2004 in this study we follow the model proposed by porporato et al 2004 3 λ λ p d i γ γ d i exp γ γ γ γ d i γ where di is budyko dryness index budyko 1974 and represents the ratio between the mean potential evapotranspiration et and the long term mean of rainfall p given by the product αpλp moreover γ defines the ratio between the soil water storage capacity n z r θ f c θ w and the mean rainfall depth αp where n is the porosity of the soil zr the root zone depth and θfc and θw representing respectively the field capacity and the wilting point in eq 3 γ γ di γ represents the lower incomplete gamma function of parameters γ di and γ the second term on the right hand side of eq 1 stands for the volumetric water loss through evapotranspiration in particular et l t represents the temporally averaged et rate a w l 2 the water surface area which changes over time as a function of water volume in eq 2 et losses are accounted for in the censoring of the rain frequency from λp to λ eq 3 the second term on the right hand side of eq 2 expresses shallow groundwater losses due to hydrologic recession dynamics accordingly k 2 1 t represents the linearized rate for shallow groundwater recession the last term on the right hand side of eq 1 k 1 h w z s w describes the rate of water exchange between wetland and shallow groundwater through a wetted surface area s w this process is modeled following a generalized darcy s law where the hydraulic gradient is defined by the difference between the wetland pool level h and groundwater stage z and k 1 1 t is the recession of the wetland bottom layer which depends on hydraulic conductivity and the mean thickness of the bottom layer this gradient term can be positive or negative depending on the wetland and groundwater levels when the groundwater depth z is below the pool stage in the wetland h the term represents exfiltration from the wetland to upland and groundwater when groundwater depth is higher than the pool level the exchange term represents the infiltration from the groundwater into the wetland when the sediment layer is completely impermeable k 1 0 there is no exchange with groundwater in this case pool stage dynamics are defined only by the rainfall and the et since the goal of the paper is to investigate the impact of the groundwater on wetland hydrology the solution for this scenario is presented in supplementary material section s 1 the exchange term k 1 h w z s w should appear also in eq 2 however since the groundwater volume is much larger compared to that of a single wetland wgw w the volume of water exchanged between the two hydrologic storages can be neglected in eq 2 the solution of eq 1 requires an explicit link between the volume of groundwater and the water table z which is identified as 4 z w g w a g w n z in particular the drainable porosity n z is strongly affected by the soil properties and soil water content profile and strongly varies when the water table is close to the ground surface laio et al 2009 for this reason we modeled n as a function of the water level z following the approach developed by acharya et al 2012 5 n z θ s θ r 1 1 η z h b b 1 b where θs and θr are respectively the saturated water content and the residual water content while η and b are soil specific parameters of the modified van genuchten retention model van genuchten 1980 introduced by troch et al 2003 note that in eq 5 the suction at the soil surface is modeled for a hydrostatic pressure distribution however eq 4 is now circular since it defines z in terms of drainable porosity which is function of z thus the groundwater level can be evaluated only by solving numerically eq 4 or by assuming a constant effective value for the drainable porosity the impact of the time variant drainable porosity on the dynamics of groundwater and wetland stage is further discussed in the supplementary material section s 2 2 2 wetland bathymetry it is necessary to define the relationships between the depression area a volume w and depth of water h for a wetland we use a simple power function model for wetland volume area depth w a h relationships from hayashi and van der 2000 and brooks and hayashi 2002 and modified by park et al 2014 for normalized variables w a and h to simplify the derivation of the pdf 6 a h β 1 β 7 w h 1 1 β where a a a max w w w max and h h h max a max w max and h max are respectively the maximum value for area volume and stage β is an empirical parameter that determines the shape of wetland slope while the theoretical range of β is 0 1 according to field survey data presented in hayashi and van der 2000 and brooks and hayashi 2002 it generally ranges from 0 20 to 0 65 as shown in eq 1 the wetland groundwater exchange is modulated by the wetted area in the pool sw which is calculated from the integration of the circular perimeter of the wetland with radius rw along its depth h the wetted area in the pool can be expressed as 8 s w 0 h 2 π r w d h 4 π w m a x 2 β a m a x w 1 β 2 eq 8 shows that the wetted area in the pool sw is a non linear function of normalized water volume w 2 3 steady state pdf for wetland groundwater systems the goal here is to determine a form for the analytical pdfs for the water volume inside the wetland methodologically the dynamics of the coupled bivariate non linear system eqs 1 2 and 4 can be solved only numerically in order to derive analytical expression for the pdf we considered the groundwater level as fixed around its long term mean level z which can be either above or below wetland bottom thus exerting hydrologic influence on pool dynamics thus influence in the mean of shallow groundwater on wetland stage dynamics is considered but temporal variability of such effects are not considered in the analytical model in order to derive an analytical expression for z the expectation of the mass balance eq 2 is taken ending up with 9 w g w λ α p a g w k 2 the robustness of this assumption is analyzed in section 4 2 with the aid of numerical simulations to calculate z from wgw the dependence of the drainable porosity on the groundwater level eq 4 needs to be accounted for however the steady state pdf for the water volume is derived by considering that the groundwater is fixed around its mean level z therefore the drainable porosity is not subjected to any variation supplementary material section s 2 under this assumption from eq 9 we have 10 z λ α p k 2 n z which has to be solved numerically or by assuming an effective value for n the pdf for wetland volume consists of writing the mass balance eq 1 scaled with maximum volume w max 11 d w d t ρ w ξ λ p r 2 α p where r 2 is the ratio between the contributing area of the wetland ac and w max and w w w max is the normalized pool water storage in eq 11 the function ρ w includes both the volumetric water loss by et and the wetland groundwater exchange term therefore the function ρ w can be expressed as 12 ρ w e t r 1 w β p 1 w 2 3 β 2 p 2 w 1 β 2 where the three terms on the right hand side represent respectively loss driven by et with r 1 a max w max exfiltration from the wetland to groundwater and infiltration from groundwater into the wetland the coefficients p 1 and p 2 which describe these processes can be expressed as 13 p 1 h m a x k 1 4 π 2 β a m a x 14 p 2 h g w z k 1 4 π 2 β a m a x where hgw is the thickness of the aquifer using this loss gain function and following the approach developed by botter et al 2009 the steady state pdf for w can be expressed as 15 p w w c ρ w exp w α p r 2 λ p 1 ρ w d w c λ p δ w where the first term on the right hand side expresses the continuous part of the pdf when 0 w 1 while the second term is the atom of probability in w 0 i e fraction of time when w 0 and there is no open water in the wetland the term c is a normalization constant that ensures 0 1 p w u d u 1 because of the nature of the inverse of the loss gain function in eq 15 a closed form expression for p w w can not be obtained hence p w w needs to be calculated numerically the shape of the pdf is controlled by the wetland shape parameter β and the following scaled parameters 16 ϕ e t r 1 α p λ p r 2 e t a m a x α p λ p a c 17 r α p r 2 18 ɛ 1 p 1 e t r 1 19 ɛ 2 p 2 e t r 1 these parameters can be physically interpreted as follows ϕ is a normalized aridity index which quantifies the ratio of et rate occurring from the maximum water surface relative to the mean water input rate from rainfall events occurring over the contributing area r is the average volumetric input per event scaled to the maximum volume of the wetland ε1 is interpreted as the ratio of exfiltration to evapotranspiration losses when w 1 ε2 is interpreted as the ratio of infiltration to evapotranspiration losses when w 1 the additional parameter ε2 compared to park et al 2014 model accounts for the possible infiltration contribution from shallow groundwater into the wetland the steady state pdf for wetland storage can be expanded using these dimensionless parameters as 20 p w w c e t r 1 1 w β ɛ 1 w 2 3 β 2 ɛ 2 w 1 β 2 exp 1 r w e t r 1 ϕ 1 ρ w d w c λ p δ w by letting 21 i w 1 w β ɛ 1 w 2 3 β 2 ɛ 2 w 1 β 2 exp 1 r w e t r 1 ϕ 1 ρ w d w we can compute the normalizing constant c by knowing that 0 1 p w w d w 1 thus 22 c 1 e t r 1 0 1 i w d w 1 λ p 1 then the solution in eq 20 is expressed as 23 p w w 1 0 1 i w d w ϕ r i w ϕ r 0 1 i w d w ϕ r δ w eq 23 is in fact a generalized solution for water storage dynamics in a non linear reservoir subject to shot noise park et al 2014 and coupled with the groundwater 2 4 groundwater dominated wetlands as the hydrologic resistivity of the wetland bottom approaches zero i e k 1 0 the time lag between wetland stage and the shallow groundwater table diminishes such that the wetland is simply surface expression of the groundwater level in such cases wetland stage and groundwater depth are deterministically linked at all times and temporal variability of the wetland is described entirely by the dynamics of the shallow groundwater the groundwater wetland coupled model section 2 3 tends to converge to model governed only by the groundwater as k 1 approaches infinity however this convergence cannot be easily shown analytically using eq 23 since the loss term inside the steady state pdf approaches infinity for k 1 therefore the dynamics of a wetland with low bottom resistance have to be investigated by reformulating the water balance for a groundwater system recharged by effective rainfall here we investigate how well this approximation represents observed stage variations in a case study section 4 3 in this model we no longer need a separate wetland mass balance eq 1 and we only conceptualize the groundwater as a linear reservoir whose dynamics follow the mass balance in eq 2 with a constant drainable porosity if this mass balance is expressed in terms of the groundwater stage z we obtain 24 d z d t k 2 z ξ λ α p n according to eq 24 the groundwater dynamics are completely described in terms of stage assuming that wetland stage is at hydrologic equilibrium with the shallow groundwater level the only parameter needed is wetland bottom elevation note that given the groundwater level at any time it is possible to know when the wetland starts to fill this happens when the groundwater is close to and above the wetland bottom in terms of pdf this can be quantified considering the exceedance probability p z zb where zb is the threshold that corresponds to the wetland bottom evaluated from the reference point of the groundwater furthermore when there is a known maximum wetland stage above the ground surface z max such as from surface drainage outlets it is possible to confine the groundwater stage also to this upper boundary if we shift the datum at the bottom of the wetland zb and we scale the mass balance eq 24 to the maximum depth of the wetland h max z max z b we can describe the dynamics of the wetland normalized stages h z z b h max when h approaches zero the wetland is almost completely dry while a value of h close to 1 indicates a full wetland thus the mass balance given in eq 24 is expressed in terms of h as 25 d h d t k 2 h ξ λ α p h m a x n the steady state solution for the pdf of the wetland normalized stages h is obtained following porporato et al 2004 and botter et al 2007 the general solution for the mass balance eq 25 can be expressed by a gamma distribution 26 p h h γ h λ k 2 γ λ k 2 exp γ h h h λ k 2 1 where the parameter γ h h max n α p represents the mean normalized stage increment due to incoming rainfall from eq 26 it is evident that the pdf of the normalized wetland stage is completely described by three parameters γh λ and k 2 in particular the ratio λ k 2 is the key parameter which defines the shape of the pdf when λ k 2 1 the pdf is a bell shape typical of a wet regime while when λ k 2 1 the shape switches to monotonically decreasing indicating a dry regime botter et al 2013 thus λ k 2 1 serves as an important threshold for separating dry erratic and humid persistent hydrologic regimes for wetlands in equilibrium with the groundwater however since we are considering a domain bounded at the bottom h 0 and at the top of the wetland h 1 it is necessary to truncate this pdf and account for the atoms of probability that quantify the probability to observe a completely dry wetland h 0 and the full pool stage h 1 in order to fully characterizes these scenarios it is necessary to define two atoms of probability 27 p 0 h 0 p z z b δ z p h 0 δ h 28 p 1 h 1 p z z m a x δ h 1 p h 1 δ h 1 therefore the full analytical expression for the pdf of the wetland normalized stages h can be defined as 29 p h h γ h λ k 2 γ λ k 2 exp γ h h h λ k 2 1 h 1 h h h p 0 h 0 p 1 h 1 where h represents the heaviside step function in this case the shape of the pdf expressed in eq 29 is not only influenced by the ratio λ k 2 but is also affected by the truncation due to the atoms of probability which may transform a hump shaped pdf into a monotonically decreasing the expression for the steady state pdf of the normalized stage h given by eq 29 is useful since it represents a general approach for modeling long term dynamics of giw with permeable bottom and in equilibrium with shallow groundwater 2 5 threshold crossing times the duration of water stage excursion above and below some threshold level is of crucial importance for the management of the giw as viable aquatic habitats or to perform some critical biogeochemical functions one possible way to represent these characteristics is to analyse the crossing properties at some specific levels of water volume or stage that are important for the system in general for a stochastic variable x that obeys the langevin equation 30 d x d t ρ x ξ where ξ is a marked poisson noise and ρ x the loss function the time interval τi elapsed between an upcrossing and a subsequent downcrossing of a threshold ξ is a new stochastic variable the mean of this variable ti ξ represents the average interarrival between an upcrossing of the threshold from below and the subsequent downcrossing from above tamea et al 2011 31 t i 1 p e x ρ x p x where the terms pe x p x and ρ x represent respectively the cumulative non exceedance probability the pdf and the loss function of the relevant variable similarly the time interval τe elapsed between a downcrossing and a subsequent upcrossing is a stochastic variable whose average value is 32 t e p e x ρ x p x in our analysis the variable x could be either the normalized volume of the wetland w as in eq 11 or the normalized stage of the wetland h as in eq 25 to compute the observed exposure times te a threshold is selected for either the normalized volume of the wetland w or the normalized stage of the wetland h then the upcrossing and downcrossing events are identified and the interarrivals between a downcrossing and the following upcrossing are calculated finally the mean value of all these interarrivals was computed this procedure is then repeated for different thresholds 3 case studies hydrological data and calibration 3 1 case studies two karst plain depressional giws in different parts of florida usa are considered as representative cases studies in this paper one in the lake okeechobee watershed and one in the tampa bay watershed fig 2 min et al 2010 monitored water levels in four giws in the lake okeechobee basin and we used their data for the wetland labeled bw1 27 24 34 00 n 80 56 48 76 w because the stage dynamics of this wetland were least affected by artificial drainage this wetland is characterized by a maximum surface area of about 1 8 ha and the only ditch present in the wetland is located at a height of 0 5 m from the bottom which imposes the maximum stage of the wetland note that for the major part of the depressional wetlands present in the region the depth is never larger than one meter and they typically exhibit a bowl or elongated bowl shape bhadha and jawitz 2010 studied a similar wetland in the area and found that the soil immediately below wetlands 0 2 m is characterized by a higher organic matter content with an order of magnitude lower hydraulic conductivity compared to upland soils thus the wetland bottom restricts rate of upland wetland water exchange below this 2 m a clay rich soil layer is present the second wetland selected for this study is located south of the starkey well field boundary nilsson et al 2013 and classified as a cypress wetland wetland planar area a 3 2 ha was calculated from the geographic information system gis land use 1999 swfwmd 2007 and it corresponds to the wetland surface extent additionally wetland dry bed elevation dbe and normal pool elevation npe have been previously identified by south west florida water management district swfwmd staff the wetland dbe was evaluated as the dry reading mark in the staff gauge and assumed to be the lowest point in the wetland nilsson et al 2013 the wetland npe corresponds to physical and vegetative markers i e inflection points on the buttresses of cypress trees carr et al 2006 in this wetland the dbe based on the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 ngvd is 13 5 m and the npe is 14 3 m therefore the difference between these values 0 8 m is the estimated maximum depth 3 2 hydrological data florida wetland bw1 was already analyzed by park et al 2014 therefore for this wetland data are available in terms of both stages and volume storages of the wetland in order to normalize these data the elevation of the ditch bottom has been used to set h max while the maximum water volume recorded during the entire period of observation was used as w max in addition the time series of the upland groundwater is also available min et al 2010 in this study we examined wetland and groundwater dynamics during the wet season from august to october 2003 wetland dynamics during the dry season when the groundwater stage us far below the wetland bottom have been examined by park et al 2014 rainfall data for the wet period under consideration were downloaded from the south florida water management district sfwmd hydrologic database these daily precipitation data were measured at the basset station 27 24 41 10 n 80 55 16 2 w 2 3 km from to the studied wetland in the second case study wetland stage level was monitored daily by south west florida water management district swfwmd over a period of twelve years from 2003 to 2015 rainfall data were downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website for the station located in the tampa international airport for the same period groundwater monitoring data from a well near the tampa bay site were also obtained from the swfwmd hydrologic database however these are at lower temporal resolution monthly compared to daily data for stage measured in a well located in the middle of the wetland 3 3 estimation of model parameters the wetland groundwater model developed in section 2 2 was calibrated based on the observation data from the study wetland during august 2003 october 2003 from the lake okeechobee wetland the mean rainfall depth αp was calculated as the observed mean daily depth during wet days mean rainfall frequency λp was calculated as the relative proportion of wet days while monthly average et rate is provided by carr et al 2006 and is reported in table 1 based on the h max value we evaluated the contributing area of the site using the relation a c a max 0 6 following the stage area relationship presented in min et al 2010 the wetland profile coefficient β table 1 was estimated from survey data reported in the same paper the groundwater table parameters were estimated using the observed data the mean frequency for the effective rainfall events recharging groundwater λ was obtained from precipitation and et data by means of eq 3 using the n zr s 1 and sw values in table 1 then the recession constant of the groundwater k 2 was calibrated on the basis of its lowest mean square error mse between the numerical simulations and the observed time series the calibration was performed using both a time varying drainable porosity n z following acharya et al 2012 and also using a constant value for this variable table 1 reports only the parameters obtained from the latter method the alternative calibration procedures are reported in the supplementary material and they provide similar results calibration to estimate wetland recession constant k 1 was based on the match between the observed wetland stage time series and the model simulations see table 1 in particular the time series simulated by the model through eq 1 is an expression of the coupled groundwater wetland dynamics for the tampa bay wetland αp and λp were calculated from the data available during the period 2003 2015 the two key parameters of the groundwater dominated model are λ and k 2 in this case the variation of the drainable porosity can be neglected since we are considering only the time periods during which the groundwater level is above the wetland bottom therefore the porosity is constant and its value is reported in table 1 the estimation of the recession constant k 2 is performed following the method developed in basso et al 2015 from the water stage record we considered only those recessions that happen above the dry bed then every recession was estimated through a linear regression between the temporal derivatives of z dz dt and the corresponding observed z we selected the median value as the recession constant from all estimated values 4 results 4 1 sensitivity analysis the dependence of the pdf shapes for normalized water volume p w eq 23 and mean exposure times te eq 32 on morphologic and hydro climatic attributes was explored by varying the five scaled parameters ϕ ε1 ε2 r and β the detailed results of the sensitivity analysis are reported and commented in supplementary material section s 3 this analysis showed that four scaled parameters ϕ r ε1 ε2 have largest impact on the shape of p w and te two are related to the hydroclimatic forcing ϕ and wetland bathymetry r and the other two define hydrologic recession of wetland bottom ε1 and shallow groundwater ε2 scaled aridity index ϕ which represents the ratio of potential et rate to the water input due to rainfall has a large impact on the shape of p w and te as ϕ increases from low to high values the pdf shifts from a monotonically increasing distribution with its mode concentrated near the maximum volume towards a monotonically decreasing pdf with high probability of low levels of the volume of water inside the wetland figure s2 a b the shapes for p w and te are also influenced by the parameter ε1 figure s2 c d which is a function of the wetland bottom recession constant k 1 and ε2 figure s2 e f which is controlled by the groundwater recession constant k 2 and the drainable porosity n larger values of ε1 and positive values of ε2 shift the mean of p w towards lower normalized volume because the exfiltration process dominates the pattern of the mean exposure times reflects this behavior under these conditions the water losses are relevant and so the time spent by the system at lower volumes is large on the other hand when ε2 is negative the infiltration from the groundwater drives the mean of pdf of the normalized volume towards larger volumes the shape of p w and te is also sensitive to the parameter r figure s2 g h that is related to the maximum volume of the wetland when this parameter is large the wetland tends to be smaller and therefore more sensitive to the fluctuations of the volume the variance of p w is large and the mean exposure times are small when r decreases the variance of p w decreases and converges to a gaussian distribution while the exposure times are longer instead the shapes for p w and te are quite insensitive to variations of β figure s2 i j 4 2 lake okeechobee wetland time series of the w from the data collected by min et al 2010 for the lake okeechobee wetland bw1 are compared with the calibrated numerical simulation in fig 3 a these results were calculated by solving eq 11 where water inputs to the systems were the actual rainfall data measured at basset station while the groundwater level z was obtained from eqs 2 and 4 with a constant value of n the results obtained using a drainable porosity dependent on z are discussed in the supplementary material section s 2 the numerical model reproduces the coupled dynamics of the two systems fig 3a these results emphasize that the recession of the bottom layer k 1 which is embedded in the definition of ε1 is the key parameter governing coupled dynamics between wetland and groundwater comparison between the analytical blue solid line and observed pdf red circles of the w shows that the analytical pdf captures the observed frequency distribution of w fig 3b the observed period is characterized by a high probability associated with larger volumes typical of a wet regime q q plots were used to estimate the error between analytical and observed pdfs the procedure consists on building the q q plot by using 9 quantiles ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 and then calculating the mse between the simulated quantiles and those achieved from the real data the result confirms the good agreement between the observed and the analytical pdfs despite the assumption of having considered the groundwater as fixed around its mean level observed pdf is strongly affected by the initial condition since the available data are restricted to only one season of the year this may be why the analytical pdf underestimates the lower normalized volumes in the initial days of the season fig 3a another reason that could lead to this underestimation is related to the assumption of considering a simple bathymetry for the wetland constant value of the shape parameter β while the actual landscape topography is perhaps more complex fig 3c compares the analytical mean exposure time obtained by solving eq 32 and the observed values derived from field data the general trend one season of mean exposure times given by eq 32 is similar to the observed pattern however the data from min et al 2010 are for short term and do not allow a robust analysis of mean crossing times for a wide range of thresholds in particular the wetland time series of fig 3a shows that the wetland tends to remain at higher level for much of the time w 1 means a full wetland without significant excursion in the lower part of the state space that are essential to better represent the observed dynamics crossing times analyses based on multi year data were performed with data from the tampa bay wetland as discussed next 4 3 tampa bay wetland for the tampa bay wetland we present the results of the application of the groundwater dominated wetland model section 2 4 instead of the groundwater wetland coupled model section 2 3 which was applied to lake okeechobee wetland the results achieved using the latter model show that the analytical pdf is not able to correctly reproduce the wetland dynamics primarily because the assumption of fixed at steady state level groundwater is not valid this statement is supported by the stage pdf obtained by solving eqs 1 and 2 where the groundwater is free to fluctuate in this case the numerical pdf of normalized stage for the coupled model is more similar to the observed pattern further details are reported in the supplementary material section s 4 fig 4 presents the results of the application of the groundwater dominated models to the tampa bay wetland the analytical pdf solution expressed by eq 29 reproduces the empirical pdf based on h observed in the wetland zero value on the x axis represents a completely empty wetland while the value of h 1 represents a full wetland the pdf of wetland stage is characterized by a bell shape typical of a wet regime in fact this is confirmed by ratio λ k 2 15 good agreement was observed fig 4a between analytical and the observed p h although the analytical solution tends to slightly overestimate the probability of high stages this discrepancy could be explained by a small error in the proposed normal pool elevation the observed pdf shows that the wetland never exceeded h 0 95 corresponding to a height of 14 25 m however the value of the normal pool elevation provided by the swfwmd was 14 3 m the analytical solution tends also to underestimate the probability of low normalized stages h as for the lake okeechobee wetland one of the possible reasons is related to the assumption of a simple bathymetry instead of a more complex shape in addition the simplified model expressed in eq 25 assuming groundwater fluctuations to be the dominant factor controlling stage dynamics underestimates the role of second order effects by neglecting the coupled dynamics this is evident in p h based on long term time series generated by numerical simulations presented in the supplementary material figure s4 a here the numerical pdf better reproduce the lower normalized stages the analytical mean exposure times trend solid line is compared fig 4b with the observed mean exposure times circles obtained from the analysis of the stage record as the threshold increases the mean exposure time increases as well indicating the tendency that the lower points of the wetland tend to be flooded for a longer period the analytical solution tends to overestimate the exposure time spent at higher stages 5 discussion the stochastic models we presented in this work and in our earlier paper park et al 2014 present multiple analytical pdf solutions for the study of geographically isolated wetland hydrologic dynamics the proposed models are summarized in table 2 along with the key parameters that define the shapes of the probability density function and crossing times comparison of short term observed time series for lake okeechobee wetland with the simulations obtained from eqs 1 and 2 showed good agreement despite the limited time period one season for which data are available and simplification of considering the groundwater depth as being fixed around its long term mean level thus avoiding solving the joint pdf for groundwater stage and wetland volume the analytical pdf of w captures well the observed values because a closed form for the analytical p w which accounts for the coupled dynamics between wetland and groundwater could not be derived in fig 3 we reported also the results in terms of pdf and exposure times te from a 50 years monte carlo numerical simulation using the numerical model with time variable groundwater depths these simulations were obtained by solving the system of eqs 1 and 2 thus accounting for the coupled dynamics between wetland and groundwater the numerical simulations were obtained forcing the systems with 50 years of synthetic rainfall evaluated fixing αp and λp in addition the non dimensional parameters that describe the pdf of w were kept constant from the results of the calibration procedure fig 3 shows that numerical monte carlo simulation tends to better reproduce the observed pattern of p w since in this model the groundwater fluctuates and strongly interacts with the wetland pool in addition especially for larger volume the analytical model eq 23 tends to overestimate p w and therefore underestimate te exposure times estimated using the long term simulations monte carlo with the numerical model eq 1 and 2 more closely follow the trends predicted by the analytical model for the and mean exposure times eq 32 despite this the analytical pdf and analytical te derived by assuming a constant value for the groundwater are not significantly different from the results of the numerical simulation arguably the assumption of steady groundwater depth is particularly effective for lake okeechobee wetland because the shallow groundwater did not frequently cross the wetland stage shallow groundwater rises above wetland pool only 25 days out of 92 in support to these considerations the values of the infiltration parameter is ε2 is 0 76 indicating a weak tendency for groundwater to infiltrate into the wetland this analysis suggests that the assumption made by park et al 2014 in an earlier study where the wetland was represented as affected only by an effective exfiltration process is justified for the tampa bay wetland stage is just an expression of the groundwater dynamics because the wetland is flooded only when the water table rises above wetland bottom differently from the lake okeechobee wetland in the tampa bay wetland scenario the seasonal effects of short term data are not relevant in fact here we have a long record 12 years at daily scale and therefore we can perform a long term analysis thus comparison of empirical and analytical pdf of stages provides a robust assessment the main assumption underlying the groundwater dominated model is that equilibrium is instantaneously reached between shallow groundwater and the wetland level once groundwater crosses the wetland bottom resistivity of the wetland bottom is assumed to be low enough that it does not control lag in the hydrologic response of the wetland this scenario in which the wetland is just a surface water expression of the shallow groundwater is useful for the hydrological modeling of multiple wetlands in a region that is forced by the same rainfall and shallow regional groundwater once the relative position of the wetlands bottom with respect to water table is known its stage dynamics can be evaluated based only on groundwater fluctuations for both types of wetlands in florida we also derived analytical expressions for mean crossing times for exceedance of any specified threshold wetland stage or volume and compared them with values estimated from the time series data from site monitoring in concert with other factors hydrologic threshold crossing times have important implications for determining the suitability of wetlands as aquatic habitats and adaptive strategies specific flora and fauna need to adopt for coping with variable conditions in the wetlands thus the application of the crossing times theory to wetlands can be very useful from an eco hydrological perspective to determine habitat suitability for example particular specialist plant species could only survive under conditions with a small range of hydro periods while other generalist plants could readily adapt to a wide range of hydrologic conditions 6 conclusions the models described in this paper aim to quantify the effect of temporal hydrologic variability of storage and stage in giws as influenced by stochastic hydro climatic forcings rainfall and evapotranspiration with connectivity to surrounding upland or shallow groundwater starting from the system of eqs 1 and 2 and introducing some simplifying assumptions we derived pdf solutions for a range of scenarios the first model supplementary material section s1 can be used for a giw wetland an impervious bottom k 1 approaches zero and the wetland is truly isolated from the surrounding upland and shallow groundwater the second model park et al 2014 the wetland bottom has a finite permeability but the shallow groundwater level is below the groundwater level such that evaporation plus exfiltration from giw to upland are the only loss pathways ε in the third model the groundwater is located fixed at an elevation close to the wetland bottom either below or above the wetland stage with both exfiltration ε1 and infiltration ε2 as the contributing processes section 2 3 this approximation may underestimate the volume and stage in the wetland when the groundwater is highly variable and the wetland sediment layer allows the water exchange between the two systems for the fourth case the wetland bottom is highly permeable k 1 approaches infinity enough to offer little hydrologic resistance and the shallow groundwater dynamics dominate wetland stage dynamics section 2 4 we also present comparisons of the analytical pdfs to empirical pdfs based on monte carlo simulations using a numerical model to examine adequacy of the simplifying assumptions given the limitations on availability of or access to long term monitoring data for giw hydrology we present here comparison to a limited data set from two giws in florida compiling observational data from giws in diverse landscape settings with a range of hydro climatic forcing budyko aridity index is indeed the focus of our ongoing efforts our sensitivity analyses suggest that long term giw stage fluctuations are moderated by few scaled parameters as reflected in the shifts of the pdf shapes the two recession constants k 1 for wetland bottom and k 2 for shallow groundwater control the relative importance of coupling of wetland with upland and groundwater while the hydro climatic forcing ϕ defines the balance between precipitation inputs and evaporation losses we also investigated wetland stage fluctuations based on mean crossing time above below a specified threshold to characterize the persistence of certain hydrologic regimes for both wetlands comparisons of stage volume pdfs with model simulations suggest that long term temporal variability of wetland hydrology can be reproduced using few scaled parameters that are expressions of site specific hydro climatic conditions wetland pool bathymetry and the size the influence of shallow groundwater model analyses presented here suggest that different shapes of the volume and stage pdfs and patterns of mean exposure time can arise under different climatic and geomorphic conditions these analyses may help in the development of a general approach to classify wetland hydrologic regimes and in the prediction of the likely ecological response of wetland ecosystems to unsteady external forcing for instance the proposed framework could allow for a theoretical analysis of the expected shift in vegetation species in response to climate change scenarios or how amphibian population dispersal and survival patterns are influenced by current hydro climatic patterns acknowledgements financial support for this research

883,modeling and data analyses were used in this study to examine the temporal hydrological variability in geographically isolated wetlands giws as influenced by hydrologic connectivity to shallow groundwater wetland bathymetry and subject to stochastic hydro climatic forcing we examined the general case of giws coupled to shallow groundwater through exfiltration or infiltration across wetland bottom we also examined limiting case with the wetland stage as the local expression of the shallow groundwater we derive analytical expressions for the steady state probability density functions pdfs for wetland water storage and stage using few scaled physically based parameters in addition we analyze the hydrologic crossing time properties of wetland stage and the dependence of the mean hydroperiod on climatic and wetland morphologic attributes our analyses show that it is crucial to account for shallow groundwater connectivity to fully understand the hydrologic dynamics in wetlands the application of the model to two different case studies in florida jointly with a detailed sensitivity analysis allowed us to identify the main drivers of hydrologic dynamics in giws under different climate and morphologic conditions keywords crossing time probability density function eco hydrology hydrologic regimes hydro period 1 introduction wetlands are key hydrological elements of landscapes and their spatiotemporal dynamics strongly influence surface water storage runoff groundwater recharge discharge processes and evapotranspiration rains et al 2016 they also play a key role in determining the temporal variability of catchment biogeochemical processes e g nutrient and sediment accretion transformations etc cheng and basu 2017 marton et al 2015 and ecological processes e g aquatic habitat suitability and integrity for unique flora and fauna euliss et al 2008 of the diverse types of inland freshwater wetlands our interest here is to examine geographically isolated wetlands giws defined as wetlands that are completely surrounded by upland while there may be no accepted scientific definition of an isolated wetland it is clear from the hydrologic and ecological literature leibowitz 2015 tiner 2003 that interactions between such wetlands and other water bodies can indeed occur here we use the term giws to simply represent single depressions with topographically delineated boundaries which form natural contributing area for surface water flow to each wetland such giws are embedded into the landscape in various spatial patterns and not permanently connected to stream networks isolated wetlands can interact through permanent or episodic connections to regional shallow groundwater depending on the hydro geologic setting of the specific landscape we do not consider inter connectivity among wetlands during flooding events when ephemeral stream networks are formed our motivation for exploring stochastic modeling approaches to dynamics of isolated wetlands is based on related research on groundwater dependent ecosystems laio et al 2009 tamea et al 2009 and our recent work by park et al 2014 our overall goal is to develop generalized analytical solutions defined by few key parameters for quantifying long term dynamics of wetlands representing a range of likely scenarios for linkage between the giws and surrounding uplands vadose zone or shallow groundwater located near the wetland bottom when a sufficiently thick low permeability layer occurs along the pool bottom as a result of accretion of fine sediment or organic material or presence of confining units e g clay the wetland bottom regulates water exchange between wetland and groundwater rains et al 2016 section 2 3 as the hydrologic resistivity of the wetland bottom decreases the pool water can readily exfiltrate to surrounding uplands and exchange with shallow groundwater in response to the hydrologic potential gradients section 2 4 conversely as the hydrologic resistivity of the wetland bottom increases the wetland pool dynamics become increasingly independent of the shallow groundwater and upland as well supplementary material section s 1 the approach represents an extension of park et al 2014 where a stochastic model was presented for giws connected to uplands but connectivity to groundwater was not explicitly considered in that work groundwater was not considered as a source of input into the wetland and water losses from the wetland were only driven by evapotranspiration and exfiltration as a function of the water storage volume in the wetland here we extend this approach to explicitly account for the effect of a dynamic water table section 2 3 we provide analytical solutions for the probability density functions pdfs of the volume and stage of a wetland where shallow groundwater dynamics influence wetland stage fluctuations the analytical pdfs we present here are completely described by five non dimensional parameters defining the hydro climatic forcing wetland bathymetry and hydrologic interactions with the surrounding landscape upland shallow groundwater these analytical pdfs enable direct comparison between coupled wetland groundwater systems with widely varying characteristics we also analyze the crossing time properties of wetland stage volume to understand how hydroperiod varies according to multiple factors tamea et al 2011 hydrologic thresholds are important for the ecological and habitat suitability for a variety of adapted aquatic fauna and flora cronk and fennessy 2001 snodgrass et al 2000 therefore a better understanding of the main processes affecting the patterns of exposure and inundation along wetland transects may bring important implications for ecological processes altermatt et al 2009 laio et al 2009 tamea et al 2009 the coupling of such considerations can represent an important step toward a new method for wetland classification depending on the climatic conditions the type of landscape the geometry of the wetlands and their interaction with the hydrological elements of the watershed such attributes are embedded in the dimensionless parameters that determine the shapes of the analytical expressions of the derived pdf and the mean crossing times 2 coupled stochastic modeling of wetland groundwater systems 2 1 modeling framework we conceptualize a giw as a depression in the landscape within which water can accumulate from a well delineated contributing area and with its bathymetry defined by the landscape topography the changes in giw water storage are completely described by the balance or imbalance between water inputs and water losses the configuration of the model is depicted in fig 1 water inputs are precipitation over the contributing area of the wetland and groundwater infiltration water losses from the wetland are dominated by evapotranspiration et and exfiltration this continuous exchange of water between shallow groundwater and giw requires evaluation of the coupled dynamics of the wetland groundwater system in our analysis shallow groundwater was modeled as a second storage subject to inputs from et censored rainfall and losses modulated through first order hydrologic recession on the basis of the foregoing assumptions the water balance equations for giw coupled with shallow groundwater can be written as 1 d w d t ξ λ p α p a c e t a w k 1 h w z s w 2 d w g w d t ξ λ α p a g w k 2 w g w in eqs 1 and 2 w is the water volume stored in the wetland and wgw the water volume stored in shallow groundwater the first term on the right hand side of eqs 1 and 2 represents the stochastic water inputs due to a sequence of rainfall effective rainfall events in particular following rodriguez iturbe et al and botter et al 2007 the term ξ λp αpac is modeled as a stationary poisson process where the events occur at random times with mean frequency λp t 1 and random exponentially distributed depths with mean αp l over the wetland contributing area ac the term ξ λ αpagw represents the stochastic water input from the root zone to the groundwater due to a sequence of censored rainfall events over the groundwater contributing area agw porporato et al 2004 effective rainfall events take place with frequency λ λp and are also represented by a marked poisson process botter et al 2007 the frequency λ of these censored episodic events produced by the infiltrating precipitation can be expressed in terms of the underlying rainfall soil and vegetation properties botter et al 2007 porporato et al 2004 in this study we follow the model proposed by porporato et al 2004 3 λ λ p d i γ γ d i exp γ γ γ γ d i γ where di is budyko dryness index budyko 1974 and represents the ratio between the mean potential evapotranspiration et and the long term mean of rainfall p given by the product αpλp moreover γ defines the ratio between the soil water storage capacity n z r θ f c θ w and the mean rainfall depth αp where n is the porosity of the soil zr the root zone depth and θfc and θw representing respectively the field capacity and the wilting point in eq 3 γ γ di γ represents the lower incomplete gamma function of parameters γ di and γ the second term on the right hand side of eq 1 stands for the volumetric water loss through evapotranspiration in particular et l t represents the temporally averaged et rate a w l 2 the water surface area which changes over time as a function of water volume in eq 2 et losses are accounted for in the censoring of the rain frequency from λp to λ eq 3 the second term on the right hand side of eq 2 expresses shallow groundwater losses due to hydrologic recession dynamics accordingly k 2 1 t represents the linearized rate for shallow groundwater recession the last term on the right hand side of eq 1 k 1 h w z s w describes the rate of water exchange between wetland and shallow groundwater through a wetted surface area s w this process is modeled following a generalized darcy s law where the hydraulic gradient is defined by the difference between the wetland pool level h and groundwater stage z and k 1 1 t is the recession of the wetland bottom layer which depends on hydraulic conductivity and the mean thickness of the bottom layer this gradient term can be positive or negative depending on the wetland and groundwater levels when the groundwater depth z is below the pool stage in the wetland h the term represents exfiltration from the wetland to upland and groundwater when groundwater depth is higher than the pool level the exchange term represents the infiltration from the groundwater into the wetland when the sediment layer is completely impermeable k 1 0 there is no exchange with groundwater in this case pool stage dynamics are defined only by the rainfall and the et since the goal of the paper is to investigate the impact of the groundwater on wetland hydrology the solution for this scenario is presented in supplementary material section s 1 the exchange term k 1 h w z s w should appear also in eq 2 however since the groundwater volume is much larger compared to that of a single wetland wgw w the volume of water exchanged between the two hydrologic storages can be neglected in eq 2 the solution of eq 1 requires an explicit link between the volume of groundwater and the water table z which is identified as 4 z w g w a g w n z in particular the drainable porosity n z is strongly affected by the soil properties and soil water content profile and strongly varies when the water table is close to the ground surface laio et al 2009 for this reason we modeled n as a function of the water level z following the approach developed by acharya et al 2012 5 n z θ s θ r 1 1 η z h b b 1 b where θs and θr are respectively the saturated water content and the residual water content while η and b are soil specific parameters of the modified van genuchten retention model van genuchten 1980 introduced by troch et al 2003 note that in eq 5 the suction at the soil surface is modeled for a hydrostatic pressure distribution however eq 4 is now circular since it defines z in terms of drainable porosity which is function of z thus the groundwater level can be evaluated only by solving numerically eq 4 or by assuming a constant effective value for the drainable porosity the impact of the time variant drainable porosity on the dynamics of groundwater and wetland stage is further discussed in the supplementary material section s 2 2 2 wetland bathymetry it is necessary to define the relationships between the depression area a volume w and depth of water h for a wetland we use a simple power function model for wetland volume area depth w a h relationships from hayashi and van der 2000 and brooks and hayashi 2002 and modified by park et al 2014 for normalized variables w a and h to simplify the derivation of the pdf 6 a h β 1 β 7 w h 1 1 β where a a a max w w w max and h h h max a max w max and h max are respectively the maximum value for area volume and stage β is an empirical parameter that determines the shape of wetland slope while the theoretical range of β is 0 1 according to field survey data presented in hayashi and van der 2000 and brooks and hayashi 2002 it generally ranges from 0 20 to 0 65 as shown in eq 1 the wetland groundwater exchange is modulated by the wetted area in the pool sw which is calculated from the integration of the circular perimeter of the wetland with radius rw along its depth h the wetted area in the pool can be expressed as 8 s w 0 h 2 π r w d h 4 π w m a x 2 β a m a x w 1 β 2 eq 8 shows that the wetted area in the pool sw is a non linear function of normalized water volume w 2 3 steady state pdf for wetland groundwater systems the goal here is to determine a form for the analytical pdfs for the water volume inside the wetland methodologically the dynamics of the coupled bivariate non linear system eqs 1 2 and 4 can be solved only numerically in order to derive analytical expression for the pdf we considered the groundwater level as fixed around its long term mean level z which can be either above or below wetland bottom thus exerting hydrologic influence on pool dynamics thus influence in the mean of shallow groundwater on wetland stage dynamics is considered but temporal variability of such effects are not considered in the analytical model in order to derive an analytical expression for z the expectation of the mass balance eq 2 is taken ending up with 9 w g w λ α p a g w k 2 the robustness of this assumption is analyzed in section 4 2 with the aid of numerical simulations to calculate z from wgw the dependence of the drainable porosity on the groundwater level eq 4 needs to be accounted for however the steady state pdf for the water volume is derived by considering that the groundwater is fixed around its mean level z therefore the drainable porosity is not subjected to any variation supplementary material section s 2 under this assumption from eq 9 we have 10 z λ α p k 2 n z which has to be solved numerically or by assuming an effective value for n the pdf for wetland volume consists of writing the mass balance eq 1 scaled with maximum volume w max 11 d w d t ρ w ξ λ p r 2 α p where r 2 is the ratio between the contributing area of the wetland ac and w max and w w w max is the normalized pool water storage in eq 11 the function ρ w includes both the volumetric water loss by et and the wetland groundwater exchange term therefore the function ρ w can be expressed as 12 ρ w e t r 1 w β p 1 w 2 3 β 2 p 2 w 1 β 2 where the three terms on the right hand side represent respectively loss driven by et with r 1 a max w max exfiltration from the wetland to groundwater and infiltration from groundwater into the wetland the coefficients p 1 and p 2 which describe these processes can be expressed as 13 p 1 h m a x k 1 4 π 2 β a m a x 14 p 2 h g w z k 1 4 π 2 β a m a x where hgw is the thickness of the aquifer using this loss gain function and following the approach developed by botter et al 2009 the steady state pdf for w can be expressed as 15 p w w c ρ w exp w α p r 2 λ p 1 ρ w d w c λ p δ w where the first term on the right hand side expresses the continuous part of the pdf when 0 w 1 while the second term is the atom of probability in w 0 i e fraction of time when w 0 and there is no open water in the wetland the term c is a normalization constant that ensures 0 1 p w u d u 1 because of the nature of the inverse of the loss gain function in eq 15 a closed form expression for p w w can not be obtained hence p w w needs to be calculated numerically the shape of the pdf is controlled by the wetland shape parameter β and the following scaled parameters 16 ϕ e t r 1 α p λ p r 2 e t a m a x α p λ p a c 17 r α p r 2 18 ɛ 1 p 1 e t r 1 19 ɛ 2 p 2 e t r 1 these parameters can be physically interpreted as follows ϕ is a normalized aridity index which quantifies the ratio of et rate occurring from the maximum water surface relative to the mean water input rate from rainfall events occurring over the contributing area r is the average volumetric input per event scaled to the maximum volume of the wetland ε1 is interpreted as the ratio of exfiltration to evapotranspiration losses when w 1 ε2 is interpreted as the ratio of infiltration to evapotranspiration losses when w 1 the additional parameter ε2 compared to park et al 2014 model accounts for the possible infiltration contribution from shallow groundwater into the wetland the steady state pdf for wetland storage can be expanded using these dimensionless parameters as 20 p w w c e t r 1 1 w β ɛ 1 w 2 3 β 2 ɛ 2 w 1 β 2 exp 1 r w e t r 1 ϕ 1 ρ w d w c λ p δ w by letting 21 i w 1 w β ɛ 1 w 2 3 β 2 ɛ 2 w 1 β 2 exp 1 r w e t r 1 ϕ 1 ρ w d w we can compute the normalizing constant c by knowing that 0 1 p w w d w 1 thus 22 c 1 e t r 1 0 1 i w d w 1 λ p 1 then the solution in eq 20 is expressed as 23 p w w 1 0 1 i w d w ϕ r i w ϕ r 0 1 i w d w ϕ r δ w eq 23 is in fact a generalized solution for water storage dynamics in a non linear reservoir subject to shot noise park et al 2014 and coupled with the groundwater 2 4 groundwater dominated wetlands as the hydrologic resistivity of the wetland bottom approaches zero i e k 1 0 the time lag between wetland stage and the shallow groundwater table diminishes such that the wetland is simply surface expression of the groundwater level in such cases wetland stage and groundwater depth are deterministically linked at all times and temporal variability of the wetland is described entirely by the dynamics of the shallow groundwater the groundwater wetland coupled model section 2 3 tends to converge to model governed only by the groundwater as k 1 approaches infinity however this convergence cannot be easily shown analytically using eq 23 since the loss term inside the steady state pdf approaches infinity for k 1 therefore the dynamics of a wetland with low bottom resistance have to be investigated by reformulating the water balance for a groundwater system recharged by effective rainfall here we investigate how well this approximation represents observed stage variations in a case study section 4 3 in this model we no longer need a separate wetland mass balance eq 1 and we only conceptualize the groundwater as a linear reservoir whose dynamics follow the mass balance in eq 2 with a constant drainable porosity if this mass balance is expressed in terms of the groundwater stage z we obtain 24 d z d t k 2 z ξ λ α p n according to eq 24 the groundwater dynamics are completely described in terms of stage assuming that wetland stage is at hydrologic equilibrium with the shallow groundwater level the only parameter needed is wetland bottom elevation note that given the groundwater level at any time it is possible to know when the wetland starts to fill this happens when the groundwater is close to and above the wetland bottom in terms of pdf this can be quantified considering the exceedance probability p z zb where zb is the threshold that corresponds to the wetland bottom evaluated from the reference point of the groundwater furthermore when there is a known maximum wetland stage above the ground surface z max such as from surface drainage outlets it is possible to confine the groundwater stage also to this upper boundary if we shift the datum at the bottom of the wetland zb and we scale the mass balance eq 24 to the maximum depth of the wetland h max z max z b we can describe the dynamics of the wetland normalized stages h z z b h max when h approaches zero the wetland is almost completely dry while a value of h close to 1 indicates a full wetland thus the mass balance given in eq 24 is expressed in terms of h as 25 d h d t k 2 h ξ λ α p h m a x n the steady state solution for the pdf of the wetland normalized stages h is obtained following porporato et al 2004 and botter et al 2007 the general solution for the mass balance eq 25 can be expressed by a gamma distribution 26 p h h γ h λ k 2 γ λ k 2 exp γ h h h λ k 2 1 where the parameter γ h h max n α p represents the mean normalized stage increment due to incoming rainfall from eq 26 it is evident that the pdf of the normalized wetland stage is completely described by three parameters γh λ and k 2 in particular the ratio λ k 2 is the key parameter which defines the shape of the pdf when λ k 2 1 the pdf is a bell shape typical of a wet regime while when λ k 2 1 the shape switches to monotonically decreasing indicating a dry regime botter et al 2013 thus λ k 2 1 serves as an important threshold for separating dry erratic and humid persistent hydrologic regimes for wetlands in equilibrium with the groundwater however since we are considering a domain bounded at the bottom h 0 and at the top of the wetland h 1 it is necessary to truncate this pdf and account for the atoms of probability that quantify the probability to observe a completely dry wetland h 0 and the full pool stage h 1 in order to fully characterizes these scenarios it is necessary to define two atoms of probability 27 p 0 h 0 p z z b δ z p h 0 δ h 28 p 1 h 1 p z z m a x δ h 1 p h 1 δ h 1 therefore the full analytical expression for the pdf of the wetland normalized stages h can be defined as 29 p h h γ h λ k 2 γ λ k 2 exp γ h h h λ k 2 1 h 1 h h h p 0 h 0 p 1 h 1 where h represents the heaviside step function in this case the shape of the pdf expressed in eq 29 is not only influenced by the ratio λ k 2 but is also affected by the truncation due to the atoms of probability which may transform a hump shaped pdf into a monotonically decreasing the expression for the steady state pdf of the normalized stage h given by eq 29 is useful since it represents a general approach for modeling long term dynamics of giw with permeable bottom and in equilibrium with shallow groundwater 2 5 threshold crossing times the duration of water stage excursion above and below some threshold level is of crucial importance for the management of the giw as viable aquatic habitats or to perform some critical biogeochemical functions one possible way to represent these characteristics is to analyse the crossing properties at some specific levels of water volume or stage that are important for the system in general for a stochastic variable x that obeys the langevin equation 30 d x d t ρ x ξ where ξ is a marked poisson noise and ρ x the loss function the time interval τi elapsed between an upcrossing and a subsequent downcrossing of a threshold ξ is a new stochastic variable the mean of this variable ti ξ represents the average interarrival between an upcrossing of the threshold from below and the subsequent downcrossing from above tamea et al 2011 31 t i 1 p e x ρ x p x where the terms pe x p x and ρ x represent respectively the cumulative non exceedance probability the pdf and the loss function of the relevant variable similarly the time interval τe elapsed between a downcrossing and a subsequent upcrossing is a stochastic variable whose average value is 32 t e p e x ρ x p x in our analysis the variable x could be either the normalized volume of the wetland w as in eq 11 or the normalized stage of the wetland h as in eq 25 to compute the observed exposure times te a threshold is selected for either the normalized volume of the wetland w or the normalized stage of the wetland h then the upcrossing and downcrossing events are identified and the interarrivals between a downcrossing and the following upcrossing are calculated finally the mean value of all these interarrivals was computed this procedure is then repeated for different thresholds 3 case studies hydrological data and calibration 3 1 case studies two karst plain depressional giws in different parts of florida usa are considered as representative cases studies in this paper one in the lake okeechobee watershed and one in the tampa bay watershed fig 2 min et al 2010 monitored water levels in four giws in the lake okeechobee basin and we used their data for the wetland labeled bw1 27 24 34 00 n 80 56 48 76 w because the stage dynamics of this wetland were least affected by artificial drainage this wetland is characterized by a maximum surface area of about 1 8 ha and the only ditch present in the wetland is located at a height of 0 5 m from the bottom which imposes the maximum stage of the wetland note that for the major part of the depressional wetlands present in the region the depth is never larger than one meter and they typically exhibit a bowl or elongated bowl shape bhadha and jawitz 2010 studied a similar wetland in the area and found that the soil immediately below wetlands 0 2 m is characterized by a higher organic matter content with an order of magnitude lower hydraulic conductivity compared to upland soils thus the wetland bottom restricts rate of upland wetland water exchange below this 2 m a clay rich soil layer is present the second wetland selected for this study is located south of the starkey well field boundary nilsson et al 2013 and classified as a cypress wetland wetland planar area a 3 2 ha was calculated from the geographic information system gis land use 1999 swfwmd 2007 and it corresponds to the wetland surface extent additionally wetland dry bed elevation dbe and normal pool elevation npe have been previously identified by south west florida water management district swfwmd staff the wetland dbe was evaluated as the dry reading mark in the staff gauge and assumed to be the lowest point in the wetland nilsson et al 2013 the wetland npe corresponds to physical and vegetative markers i e inflection points on the buttresses of cypress trees carr et al 2006 in this wetland the dbe based on the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 ngvd is 13 5 m and the npe is 14 3 m therefore the difference between these values 0 8 m is the estimated maximum depth 3 2 hydrological data florida wetland bw1 was already analyzed by park et al 2014 therefore for this wetland data are available in terms of both stages and volume storages of the wetland in order to normalize these data the elevation of the ditch bottom has been used to set h max while the maximum water volume recorded during the entire period of observation was used as w max in addition the time series of the upland groundwater is also available min et al 2010 in this study we examined wetland and groundwater dynamics during the wet season from august to october 2003 wetland dynamics during the dry season when the groundwater stage us far below the wetland bottom have been examined by park et al 2014 rainfall data for the wet period under consideration were downloaded from the south florida water management district sfwmd hydrologic database these daily precipitation data were measured at the basset station 27 24 41 10 n 80 55 16 2 w 2 3 km from to the studied wetland in the second case study wetland stage level was monitored daily by south west florida water management district swfwmd over a period of twelve years from 2003 to 2015 rainfall data were downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website for the station located in the tampa international airport for the same period groundwater monitoring data from a well near the tampa bay site were also obtained from the swfwmd hydrologic database however these are at lower temporal resolution monthly compared to daily data for stage measured in a well located in the middle of the wetland 3 3 estimation of model parameters the wetland groundwater model developed in section 2 2 was calibrated based on the observation data from the study wetland during august 2003 october 2003 from the lake okeechobee wetland the mean rainfall depth αp was calculated as the observed mean daily depth during wet days mean rainfall frequency λp was calculated as the relative proportion of wet days while monthly average et rate is provided by carr et al 2006 and is reported in table 1 based on the h max value we evaluated the contributing area of the site using the relation a c a max 0 6 following the stage area relationship presented in min et al 2010 the wetland profile coefficient β table 1 was estimated from survey data reported in the same paper the groundwater table parameters were estimated using the observed data the mean frequency for the effective rainfall events recharging groundwater λ was obtained from precipitation and et data by means of eq 3 using the n zr s 1 and sw values in table 1 then the recession constant of the groundwater k 2 was calibrated on the basis of its lowest mean square error mse between the numerical simulations and the observed time series the calibration was performed using both a time varying drainable porosity n z following acharya et al 2012 and also using a constant value for this variable table 1 reports only the parameters obtained from the latter method the alternative calibration procedures are reported in the supplementary material and they provide similar results calibration to estimate wetland recession constant k 1 was based on the match between the observed wetland stage time series and the model simulations see table 1 in particular the time series simulated by the model through eq 1 is an expression of the coupled groundwater wetland dynamics for the tampa bay wetland αp and λp were calculated from the data available during the period 2003 2015 the two key parameters of the groundwater dominated model are λ and k 2 in this case the variation of the drainable porosity can be neglected since we are considering only the time periods during which the groundwater level is above the wetland bottom therefore the porosity is constant and its value is reported in table 1 the estimation of the recession constant k 2 is performed following the method developed in basso et al 2015 from the water stage record we considered only those recessions that happen above the dry bed then every recession was estimated through a linear regression between the temporal derivatives of z dz dt and the corresponding observed z we selected the median value as the recession constant from all estimated values 4 results 4 1 sensitivity analysis the dependence of the pdf shapes for normalized water volume p w eq 23 and mean exposure times te eq 32 on morphologic and hydro climatic attributes was explored by varying the five scaled parameters ϕ ε1 ε2 r and β the detailed results of the sensitivity analysis are reported and commented in supplementary material section s 3 this analysis showed that four scaled parameters ϕ r ε1 ε2 have largest impact on the shape of p w and te two are related to the hydroclimatic forcing ϕ and wetland bathymetry r and the other two define hydrologic recession of wetland bottom ε1 and shallow groundwater ε2 scaled aridity index ϕ which represents the ratio of potential et rate to the water input due to rainfall has a large impact on the shape of p w and te as ϕ increases from low to high values the pdf shifts from a monotonically increasing distribution with its mode concentrated near the maximum volume towards a monotonically decreasing pdf with high probability of low levels of the volume of water inside the wetland figure s2 a b the shapes for p w and te are also influenced by the parameter ε1 figure s2 c d which is a function of the wetland bottom recession constant k 1 and ε2 figure s2 e f which is controlled by the groundwater recession constant k 2 and the drainable porosity n larger values of ε1 and positive values of ε2 shift the mean of p w towards lower normalized volume because the exfiltration process dominates the pattern of the mean exposure times reflects this behavior under these conditions the water losses are relevant and so the time spent by the system at lower volumes is large on the other hand when ε2 is negative the infiltration from the groundwater drives the mean of pdf of the normalized volume towards larger volumes the shape of p w and te is also sensitive to the parameter r figure s2 g h that is related to the maximum volume of the wetland when this parameter is large the wetland tends to be smaller and therefore more sensitive to the fluctuations of the volume the variance of p w is large and the mean exposure times are small when r decreases the variance of p w decreases and converges to a gaussian distribution while the exposure times are longer instead the shapes for p w and te are quite insensitive to variations of β figure s2 i j 4 2 lake okeechobee wetland time series of the w from the data collected by min et al 2010 for the lake okeechobee wetland bw1 are compared with the calibrated numerical simulation in fig 3 a these results were calculated by solving eq 11 where water inputs to the systems were the actual rainfall data measured at basset station while the groundwater level z was obtained from eqs 2 and 4 with a constant value of n the results obtained using a drainable porosity dependent on z are discussed in the supplementary material section s 2 the numerical model reproduces the coupled dynamics of the two systems fig 3a these results emphasize that the recession of the bottom layer k 1 which is embedded in the definition of ε1 is the key parameter governing coupled dynamics between wetland and groundwater comparison between the analytical blue solid line and observed pdf red circles of the w shows that the analytical pdf captures the observed frequency distribution of w fig 3b the observed period is characterized by a high probability associated with larger volumes typical of a wet regime q q plots were used to estimate the error between analytical and observed pdfs the procedure consists on building the q q plot by using 9 quantiles ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 and then calculating the mse between the simulated quantiles and those achieved from the real data the result confirms the good agreement between the observed and the analytical pdfs despite the assumption of having considered the groundwater as fixed around its mean level observed pdf is strongly affected by the initial condition since the available data are restricted to only one season of the year this may be why the analytical pdf underestimates the lower normalized volumes in the initial days of the season fig 3a another reason that could lead to this underestimation is related to the assumption of considering a simple bathymetry for the wetland constant value of the shape parameter β while the actual landscape topography is perhaps more complex fig 3c compares the analytical mean exposure time obtained by solving eq 32 and the observed values derived from field data the general trend one season of mean exposure times given by eq 32 is similar to the observed pattern however the data from min et al 2010 are for short term and do not allow a robust analysis of mean crossing times for a wide range of thresholds in particular the wetland time series of fig 3a shows that the wetland tends to remain at higher level for much of the time w 1 means a full wetland without significant excursion in the lower part of the state space that are essential to better represent the observed dynamics crossing times analyses based on multi year data were performed with data from the tampa bay wetland as discussed next 4 3 tampa bay wetland for the tampa bay wetland we present the results of the application of the groundwater dominated wetland model section 2 4 instead of the groundwater wetland coupled model section 2 3 which was applied to lake okeechobee wetland the results achieved using the latter model show that the analytical pdf is not able to correctly reproduce the wetland dynamics primarily because the assumption of fixed at steady state level groundwater is not valid this statement is supported by the stage pdf obtained by solving eqs 1 and 2 where the groundwater is free to fluctuate in this case the numerical pdf of normalized stage for the coupled model is more similar to the observed pattern further details are reported in the supplementary material section s 4 fig 4 presents the results of the application of the groundwater dominated models to the tampa bay wetland the analytical pdf solution expressed by eq 29 reproduces the empirical pdf based on h observed in the wetland zero value on the x axis represents a completely empty wetland while the value of h 1 represents a full wetland the pdf of wetland stage is characterized by a bell shape typical of a wet regime in fact this is confirmed by ratio λ k 2 15 good agreement was observed fig 4a between analytical and the observed p h although the analytical solution tends to slightly overestimate the probability of high stages this discrepancy could be explained by a small error in the proposed normal pool elevation the observed pdf shows that the wetland never exceeded h 0 95 corresponding to a height of 14 25 m however the value of the normal pool elevation provided by the swfwmd was 14 3 m the analytical solution tends also to underestimate the probability of low normalized stages h as for the lake okeechobee wetland one of the possible reasons is related to the assumption of a simple bathymetry instead of a more complex shape in addition the simplified model expressed in eq 25 assuming groundwater fluctuations to be the dominant factor controlling stage dynamics underestimates the role of second order effects by neglecting the coupled dynamics this is evident in p h based on long term time series generated by numerical simulations presented in the supplementary material figure s4 a here the numerical pdf better reproduce the lower normalized stages the analytical mean exposure times trend solid line is compared fig 4b with the observed mean exposure times circles obtained from the analysis of the stage record as the threshold increases the mean exposure time increases as well indicating the tendency that the lower points of the wetland tend to be flooded for a longer period the analytical solution tends to overestimate the exposure time spent at higher stages 5 discussion the stochastic models we presented in this work and in our earlier paper park et al 2014 present multiple analytical pdf solutions for the study of geographically isolated wetland hydrologic dynamics the proposed models are summarized in table 2 along with the key parameters that define the shapes of the probability density function and crossing times comparison of short term observed time series for lake okeechobee wetland with the simulations obtained from eqs 1 and 2 showed good agreement despite the limited time period one season for which data are available and simplification of considering the groundwater depth as being fixed around its long term mean level thus avoiding solving the joint pdf for groundwater stage and wetland volume the analytical pdf of w captures well the observed values because a closed form for the analytical p w which accounts for the coupled dynamics between wetland and groundwater could not be derived in fig 3 we reported also the results in terms of pdf and exposure times te from a 50 years monte carlo numerical simulation using the numerical model with time variable groundwater depths these simulations were obtained by solving the system of eqs 1 and 2 thus accounting for the coupled dynamics between wetland and groundwater the numerical simulations were obtained forcing the systems with 50 years of synthetic rainfall evaluated fixing αp and λp in addition the non dimensional parameters that describe the pdf of w were kept constant from the results of the calibration procedure fig 3 shows that numerical monte carlo simulation tends to better reproduce the observed pattern of p w since in this model the groundwater fluctuates and strongly interacts with the wetland pool in addition especially for larger volume the analytical model eq 23 tends to overestimate p w and therefore underestimate te exposure times estimated using the long term simulations monte carlo with the numerical model eq 1 and 2 more closely follow the trends predicted by the analytical model for the and mean exposure times eq 32 despite this the analytical pdf and analytical te derived by assuming a constant value for the groundwater are not significantly different from the results of the numerical simulation arguably the assumption of steady groundwater depth is particularly effective for lake okeechobee wetland because the shallow groundwater did not frequently cross the wetland stage shallow groundwater rises above wetland pool only 25 days out of 92 in support to these considerations the values of the infiltration parameter is ε2 is 0 76 indicating a weak tendency for groundwater to infiltrate into the wetland this analysis suggests that the assumption made by park et al 2014 in an earlier study where the wetland was represented as affected only by an effective exfiltration process is justified for the tampa bay wetland stage is just an expression of the groundwater dynamics because the wetland is flooded only when the water table rises above wetland bottom differently from the lake okeechobee wetland in the tampa bay wetland scenario the seasonal effects of short term data are not relevant in fact here we have a long record 12 years at daily scale and therefore we can perform a long term analysis thus comparison of empirical and analytical pdf of stages provides a robust assessment the main assumption underlying the groundwater dominated model is that equilibrium is instantaneously reached between shallow groundwater and the wetland level once groundwater crosses the wetland bottom resistivity of the wetland bottom is assumed to be low enough that it does not control lag in the hydrologic response of the wetland this scenario in which the wetland is just a surface water expression of the shallow groundwater is useful for the hydrological modeling of multiple wetlands in a region that is forced by the same rainfall and shallow regional groundwater once the relative position of the wetlands bottom with respect to water table is known its stage dynamics can be evaluated based only on groundwater fluctuations for both types of wetlands in florida we also derived analytical expressions for mean crossing times for exceedance of any specified threshold wetland stage or volume and compared them with values estimated from the time series data from site monitoring in concert with other factors hydrologic threshold crossing times have important implications for determining the suitability of wetlands as aquatic habitats and adaptive strategies specific flora and fauna need to adopt for coping with variable conditions in the wetlands thus the application of the crossing times theory to wetlands can be very useful from an eco hydrological perspective to determine habitat suitability for example particular specialist plant species could only survive under conditions with a small range of hydro periods while other generalist plants could readily adapt to a wide range of hydrologic conditions 6 conclusions the models described in this paper aim to quantify the effect of temporal hydrologic variability of storage and stage in giws as influenced by stochastic hydro climatic forcings rainfall and evapotranspiration with connectivity to surrounding upland or shallow groundwater starting from the system of eqs 1 and 2 and introducing some simplifying assumptions we derived pdf solutions for a range of scenarios the first model supplementary material section s1 can be used for a giw wetland an impervious bottom k 1 approaches zero and the wetland is truly isolated from the surrounding upland and shallow groundwater the second model park et al 2014 the wetland bottom has a finite permeability but the shallow groundwater level is below the groundwater level such that evaporation plus exfiltration from giw to upland are the only loss pathways ε in the third model the groundwater is located fixed at an elevation close to the wetland bottom either below or above the wetland stage with both exfiltration ε1 and infiltration ε2 as the contributing processes section 2 3 this approximation may underestimate the volume and stage in the wetland when the groundwater is highly variable and the wetland sediment layer allows the water exchange between the two systems for the fourth case the wetland bottom is highly permeable k 1 approaches infinity enough to offer little hydrologic resistance and the shallow groundwater dynamics dominate wetland stage dynamics section 2 4 we also present comparisons of the analytical pdfs to empirical pdfs based on monte carlo simulations using a numerical model to examine adequacy of the simplifying assumptions given the limitations on availability of or access to long term monitoring data for giw hydrology we present here comparison to a limited data set from two giws in florida compiling observational data from giws in diverse landscape settings with a range of hydro climatic forcing budyko aridity index is indeed the focus of our ongoing efforts our sensitivity analyses suggest that long term giw stage fluctuations are moderated by few scaled parameters as reflected in the shifts of the pdf shapes the two recession constants k 1 for wetland bottom and k 2 for shallow groundwater control the relative importance of coupling of wetland with upland and groundwater while the hydro climatic forcing ϕ defines the balance between precipitation inputs and evaporation losses we also investigated wetland stage fluctuations based on mean crossing time above below a specified threshold to characterize the persistence of certain hydrologic regimes for both wetlands comparisons of stage volume pdfs with model simulations suggest that long term temporal variability of wetland hydrology can be reproduced using few scaled parameters that are expressions of site specific hydro climatic conditions wetland pool bathymetry and the size the influence of shallow groundwater model analyses presented here suggest that different shapes of the volume and stage pdfs and patterns of mean exposure time can arise under different climatic and geomorphic conditions these analyses may help in the development of a general approach to classify wetland hydrologic regimes and in the prediction of the likely ecological response of wetland ecosystems to unsteady external forcing for instance the proposed framework could allow for a theoretical analysis of the expected shift in vegetation species in response to climate change scenarios or how amphibian population dispersal and survival patterns are influenced by current hydro climatic patterns acknowledgements financial support for this research

884,the understanding of reactive solute transport in a single fracture rock matrix system is the foundation of studying transport behavior in the complex fractured porous media when transport properties are asymmetrically distributed in the adjacent rock matrixes reactive solute transport has to be considered as a coupled three domain problem which is more complex than the symmetric case with identical transport properties in the adjacent rock matrixes this study deals with the transport problem in a single fracture rock matrix system with asymmetrical distribution of transport properties in the rock matrixes mathematical models are developed for such a problem under the first type and the third type boundary conditions to analyze the spatio temporal concentration and mass distribution in the fracture and rock matrix with the help of laplace transform technique and de hoog numerical inverse laplace algorithm the newly acquired solutions are then tested extensively against previous analytical and numerical solutions and are proven to be robust and accurate furthermore a water flushing phase is imposed on the left boundary of system after a certain time the diffusive mass exchange along the fracture rock matrixes interfaces and the relative masses stored in each of three domains fracture upper rock matrix and lower rock matrix after the water flushing provide great insights of transport with asymmetric distribution of transport properties this study has the following findings 1 asymmetric distribution of transport properties imposes greater controls on solute transport in the rock matrixes however transport in the fracture is mildly influenced 2 the mass stored in the fracture responses quickly to water flushing while the mass stored in the rock matrix is much less sensitive to the water flushing 3 the diffusive mass exchange during the water flushing phase has similar patterns under symmetric and asymmetric cases 4 the characteristic distance which refers to the zero diffusion between the fracture and the rock matrix during the water flushing phase is closely associated with dispersive process in the fracture keywords single fracture back diffusion reactive solute transport asymmetric rock matrix 1 introduction reactive solute transport in fractured media has been studied for decades because of its broad range of applications such as understanding the fate and transport of chemicals and nuclear waste in the subsurface oil and gas production etc grisak and pickens 1981 pouya 2012 zhou et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 a typical example is dealing with the groundwater pollution in fractured reservoirs bodin et al 2003 this study focuses on the influence of asymmetric distribution of transport parameters in the rock matrix on reactive solute transport in a single fracture and addresses the fracture to matrix diffusion during the tracer flushing phase and the matrix to fracture back diffusion issues during the water flushing phase specifically since fractures are much more permeable than rock matrix thus they are usually treated as effective conduits in fractured systems for transporting water and solutes maloszewski and zuber 1993 sudicky and frind 1982 for this reason some previous studies conceptualized solute transport in a single fracture as two distinctive processes advection through the fracture and diffusion between the rock matrix and the fracture grisak and pickens 1980 zhu et al 2016 although fractures are the major conduits in a fracture matrix system interactions between the fracture and the rock matrix would still have significant influence on solute transport roubinet et al 2012 zhan et al 2009a among various approaches of understanding transport in single fractures and fractured media analytical models have their advantages of being physically based with fewer input parameters and providing insights into multiple processes despite of its simplifications of boundaries and initial conditions media heterogeneity etc analytical models provide a powerful tool for understanding the physics associated with transport problems which are fundamentally important for implementing full scale numerical models under complex conditions thus will be the primary concern of this study the first widely used analytical model of solute transport in a single fracture rock matrix was proposed by tang et al 1981 who compared the solutions with and without the fracture dispersion this analytical model provided valuable insight into the mechanism of solute transport in a single fracture rock matrix system sudicky and frind 1982 then extended the solutions of tang et al 1981 to a fracture matrix system with identically parallel fractures they also concluded that it was necessary to consider the longitudinal dispersion of the fracture in assessing the long term fate of solute transport maloszewski and zuber 1990 argued that the influence of rock matrix diffusion cannot be negligible and concluded that the matrix diffusion can even be the dominant process in some cases bodin et al 2003 reviewed the laboratory experiments and theoretical studies over last three decades to emphasize the advection hydrodynamic dispersion channel effects matrix diffusion and sorption reactions as fundamental processes which should be integrated together roubinet et al 2012 developed a two dimensional model for the transport of a conservative solute in a single fracture rock matrix system they concluded that the impact of transverse dispersion in the fracture and longitudinal diffusion in the rock matrix can be neglected in standard models of a single fracture rock matrix all the studies mentioned above about the fracture rock matrix system are based on the assumption that the rock matrix has identical transport properties on both sides of the fracture for a single fracture with parallel and flat surfaces the problem becomes symmetric in respect to the middle plane of the fracture thus can be simplified to a half plane problem zhou et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 however if the rock matrixes on both sides of the fracture have different transport properties such as molecular diffusion coefficient and porosities carrera et al 1998 xu et al 2001 they cannot be simplified into a half plane problem and must be considered as three coupled domains including the fracture and two rock matrixes with different transport properties for example the unconformity can be considered as a preferential pathway with high permeability and porosity like a fracture zimmerman and sassen 1993 the rock formations above and below the unconformity could be formed under very different environments at different ages thus have different transport properties and should be treated separately cipollari and cosentino 1995 investigated miocene unconformities in the central apennines area their field based observations suggested that the angular unconformity between middle miocene and upper miocene separated the lower shallow water limestone and upper glauconitic arenaceous marls which was condensed deposition thus the upper and lower layers have significantly different transport parameters and would not be treated as a symmetric case also caine et al 1996 proposed that a brittle fault zone was lithological heterogeneity and would act as a conduit for fluid flow and solute transport the rock blocks on two sides of the fault would have different lithology due to the fault movement similar field observations were also reported by chester and logan 1986 at punchbowl fault zone at the juncture of san gabriel mountains and the mojave desert the punchbowl fault zone is located between the punchbowl formation and basement with sharp and distinct contacts the punchbowl formation is mainly composed of conglomerate sandstone and siltstone meanwhile the basement is primary composed of igneous rocks that are rich of felsic minerals with some thin mafic mineral layers inside in summary the assumption of the symmetric distribution of transport parameters could not stand in above mentioned examples and an asymmetric model of the fracture rock matrix system is required it is also important to note that solute transport in an asymmetric fracture rock matrix system has a broad scope of applications and the results obtained in this study can be applied to dealing with many other mass or heat transport problems in the subsurface for instance the system investigated here can be directly applied to solute and or heat transport in a thin aquifer bounded by two aquitards deposited under different geological times with different sedimentary environments thus very likely to have very different physical and chemical properties zhan et al 2009a b therefore one has to use the asymmetric model of this study to deal with such an aquifer aquitard system similarly solute and or heat transport in vadose zone aquifer underlying materials often time requests an asymmetric model as well for example when studying the thermal effect of climate change on groundwater fed ecosystems in volcanic medicine lake highlands in california usa burns et al 2017 pointed out that an asymmetric heat transport model was inevitable because thermal properties can differ distinctively between the vadose zone aquifer and underlying materials the main goal of this study is to develop a new analytical model for reactive solute transport in a fracture rock matrix system with asymmetric distribution of transport parameters of the rock matrix a finite element numerical simulation is also developed with comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa for the comparison with our solutions the results under the first type constant concentration and the third type constant mass flux boundary conditions at the fracture inlet are also compared both tracer flushing and water flushing processes are investigated with the obtained solutions one could compute the dynamic partition of mass at three coupled domains and the matrix diffusion and back diffusion issues are specifically taken into consideration the analysis of mass partition would be very helpful for risk and environment impact assessments of contaminant transport in a fracture matrix system with asymmetric transport properties of rock matrix the problem can be applied to deal with transport in an unconformity straightforwardly 2 conceptual model and physical setup in this study we consider a thin fracture or an unconformity situated horizontally with a constant aperture 2b the rock matrixes with different properties are distributed above and below the fracture use of a horizontal fracture here is simply for the sake of illustration in fact the fracture can be in any orientation as the gravity is not a concern here the permeability values of the surrounding rock matrixes are several orders of magnitude less than that of the fracture which is assumed to extend sufficiently far from the domain of interest the rock matrixes are wide enough in the horizontal direction perpendicularly to the groundwater flow direction in the fracture thus the problem can be simplified as a two dimensional one the matrixes are also assumed to be sufficiently thick thus the rock matrix boundaries away from the fracture will not affect the transport process and can be regarded as infinitely far a schematic diagram of three coupled domains including an upper rock matrix a fracture and a lower rock matrix is shown in fig 1 a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system is established with the origin at the crossing point of the left boundary and the middle of the fracture fig 1 the x axis is from left to right while the z axis is vertically upward the groundwater flow only occurs in the fracture from left to right and has a constant velocity groundwater in the upper and lower rock matrixes is immobile a contaminant source exists at the origin of the fracture and the system is free from contamination at the start of transport two boundary conditions at x 0 are considered separately first type dirichlet or constant concentration and third type robin or constant mass flux boundary conditions several assumptions about the geometry and transport properties of the system are made as follows firstly the fracture has a very small aperture which allows the transverse mixing throughout the fracture aperture to occur almost instantaneously therefore the influence of transverse dispersion in the fracture is not taken into consideration also rezaei et al 2016 investigated longitudinal dispersion in the rock matrix and concluded that longitudinal dispersion in the rock matrix can be ignored for most practical cases secondly the permeability values of the upper and lower rock matrixes are so small that transport in the rock matrix is dominated by molecular diffusion these two assumptions provide the basis that the mass flux direction in the rock matrix is perpendicular to the fracture matrix interface the following processes are considered advection longitudinal dispersion molecular diffusion adsorption and radioactive decay in the fracture transverse molecular diffusion adsorption and radioactive decay in the upper and lower rock matrixes 3 mathematical models and solutions 3 1 mathematical models reactive solute transport in the fracture rock matrix system can be described as the following governing equations 1 θ r c t θ d 2 c x 2 θ v c x θ λ r c q 1 2 b q 2 2 b 2 r 1 c 1 t d 1 2 c 1 z 2 λ 1 r 1 c 1 3 r 2 c 2 t d 2 2 c 2 z 2 λ 2 r 2 c 2 where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively the symbol without subscript represents the fracture hereinafter c m l3 is concentration b l is the fracture s half aperture t t is the time r is the constant retardation factor v l t is the groundwater velocity in the fracture λ 1 t is the decay constant which can be further expressed as ln2 t 1 2 where t 1 2 is the half life time θ is the porosity d l2 t is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the fracture which equals d α l v d where αl l is the longitudinal dispersivity d l2 t is the molecular diffusion coefficient in the fracture d 1 l2 t and d 2 l2 t are the transverse molecular diffusion coefficients in the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively q 1 and q 2 m l2t are the diffusive mass fluxes across the fracture rock matrix interfaces and can be further expressed as 4 q 1 θ 1 d 1 c 1 z z b 5 q 2 θ 2 d 2 c 2 z z b the concentration gradients c 1 z and c 2 z at both interfaces are obtained from eqs 2 and 3 a minor point to note is that negative and positive signs are used in eqs 4 and 5 respectively as positive c 1 z and c 2 z will result in downward and upward mass fluxes across the upper and lower fracture matrix interfaces respectively the existence of possible mass accumulations at the sharp interface between the fracture and rock matrix has been reported in a number of investigations before berkowitz et al 2009 leij et al 1991 marseguerra and zoia 2006 which could cause concentration discontinuity across the interface if there are mass accumulations when solutes cross from one medium to another the concentration discontinuity will be detected marseguerra and zoia 2006 however no directly experimental evidence of mass accumulations at the sharp interface is available to support this hypothesis therefore such concentration discontinuity is not considered here as this issue is still debatable and has not been widely accepted because of a lack of convincing experimental evidence we assume the concentration continuity at the fracture matrix interface in this study as commonly done in numerous previous investigations of flow and transport in a fracture matrix system zhang et al 2010 bearing this in mind above governing equations are supplemented with the following conditions 6 c 1 x z b t c x t 7 c 2 x z b t c x t it is worthwhile to point out that besides the continuity of concentration at the fracture matrix interface the continuity of vertical mass flux across the fracture matrix interface is also honored here however the continuity of vertical concentration gradient at the fracture rock matrix interface is not maintained here because the essence of the governing equations such as eq 1 is mass balance not concentration gradient balance the continuity of vertical mass flux is done through the use of two flux terms of q 1 and q 2 in eq 1 above since the fracture aperture is usually so small as compared with the scale of transport in the fracture the mass flux entering the fracture from the matrix is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the entire aperture of 2b instantaneously that is why the terms q 1 2b and q 2 2b are incorporated into eq 1 instead of being treated as a boundary condition at the fracture matrix interface such an instantaneously mixed model has been used as a standard approach for numerous studies in flow and transport in fracture matrix systems sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 and or aquifer aquitard systems zhan and bian 2006 because it simplifies the governing equation in the fracture and or aquifer by reducing a two dimensional problem into a one dimensional problem this approach is proven to be robust and sufficiently accurate for fracture matrix systems owing to the very small apertures as compared to the scales of transport however for transport in an aquifer aquitard system where the aquifer thickness is not sufficiently thin as compared to the scale of transport the instantaneously mixed model may be problematic as documented by some previous investigations zhan et al 2009a b because the mass flux into the aquifer from the aquitard cannot be mixed across the entire aquifer thickness quickly for such a case one cannot use the above eq 1 to deal with the transport in the aquifer anymore instead one has to consider both longitudinal and vertical dispersions in the aquifer and specifically honors both the continuities of concentration and vertical mass flux at the aquifer aquitard interface zhan et al 2009a b nevertheless the mathematical treatment is much more complex for doing so being aware that continuity of mass flux at the aquifer aquitard interface even for this non instantaneously mixed case will not lead to the continuity of vertical concentration gradient at the aquifer aquitard interface because the vertical hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients in the aquifer and aquitard are usually very different from each other in summary regardless of using an instantaneously mixed model or a non instantaneously mixed model continuities of concentration and mass flux at the fracture matrix or aquifer aquitard interface are always maintained but the continuity of vertical concentration gradient at such an interface is not a concern the entire system is assumed to be free of solute at t 0 thus the initial conditions are 8 c x t 0 c 1 x z t 0 c 2 x z t 0 0 the fracture is assumed to be infinitely long and the rock matrix is infinitely thick thus one has 9 c x t c 1 x z t c 2 x z t 0 in this study two different boundary conditions at the fracture inlet are considered separately the first type and third type boundary conditions for the first type boundary condition the concentration at fracture at x 0 keeps constant at c 0 10 c x 0 t c 0 the first type boundary condition assumes that the concentration cross the inlet boundary continuously its validity stands if the entrance reservoir is directly connected to the fracture however it is not practical for the tracer experiments where the solute is added at a specified rate vangenuchten and parker 1984 the third type boundary condition has also been used frequently which can be expressed as 11 v c d c x x 0 v c 0 where x 0 indicates that the estimation is built for the inside profile of the inlet boundary the robin boundary condition stands valid for the following case the fracture is connected to an entrance contaminant source and the molecular diffusion and dispersion in the fore section x 0 is ignored vangenuchten and parker 1984 the solute convective dispersive flux component along the x direction is given as follow batu and vangenuchten 1990 freeze and cherry 1979 12 f x θ v c θ d c x in fig 2 the convective dispersive flux components for the first type and third type boundary conditions are plotted at x 0 the results clearly indicate that the flux for the first type boundary condition fx drops over time and approaches steady state at the value of θc 0 v however the convective dispersive flux for the third type boundary condition at the inlet boundary keeps constant at fx θc 0 v all the time after a couple of days both convective dispersive flux components reach the same value 3 2 solutions of both first type and third type boundary conditions converting the equations into their dimensionless forms is usually helpful because of fewer independent variables left and more reflective of the systems involved as some previous studies have demonstrated bear 1972 simmons et al 2001 all the definitions of the dimensionless variables are listed in appendix of the supplemental files besides that laplace transform is adopted to transform the problem from real time domain to laplace domain for eqs 1 11 thus the analytical solutions under both boundary conditions can be derived in laplace domain under the first type boundary condition the analytical solutions of the fracture and the upper and lower rock matrixes in laplace domain are obtained as follows more details of derivations are provided in appendix of the supplementary files 13 c d 1 p exp p e p e 2 4 k 1

1 1 4 k 1 p e 2 a larger peclet number pe will lead to a smaller difference between those two solutions 3 3 steady state solutions the steady state solutions are particularly helpful for addressing the long term estimations also they are usually much simpler than the transient solutions thus the steady state solutions are widely used for estimating the long term effect and for designing the remediation plans to fulfill the requirements of the steady state solutions one must meet the following equation 19 c d t c 1 d t c 2 d t 0 as indicated in eq 19 after reaching steady state the concentration in the system would reach equilibrium and no longer change with time the steady state solutions can be derived by using the following equation f t d lim p 0 p f p where f p refers to the solution in laplace domain thus the steady state solutions can be easily derived by calculating the limitations of p c d p c 1 d p c 2 d as p approaches 0 from eqs 13 18 the analytical steady state

environment impact and risk assessment this could be done with the help of analytical steady state solutions developed above for a concentration reduction φ or c c 0 ϕ where ϕ is much less than 1 such as 10 3 or 10 4 the penetration depth is defined as lφ for the maximum horizontal penetration depth in the fracture and l 1ϕ and l 2ϕ for the maximum vertical penetration depths in the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively l ϕ refers to the farthest horizontal distance between the origin to the point where the concentration is ϕc 0 while l 1ϕ and l 2ϕ demonstrate the farthest vertical distances between the original to the point where the concentration is ϕc 0 in the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively a sufficiently small value of φ refers to the scenario that the concentration has dropped to a negligible level for instance ϕ 10 4 as used in many studies tang et al 1981 substituting the definition of φ into eqs 20 25 one can obtain the penetration depths l ϕ l 1ϕ and l 2ϕ for the first type boundary condition the penetration depths are 26 l φ 2 ln φ p e p e 2 4 k 1 s 27 l 1 φ r 2 d r d 1 ln φ r 2 r 1 λ 1 α 28 l 2 φ d 2 d 1 λ 2 α ln φ r 2 d r d 1 the

technique of inverse laplace transform will be applied specifically the method of de hoog numerical inverse laplace transform de hoog et al 1982 is selected here for addressing the spatio temporal concentration distribution which has been used in other similar studies wang and zhan 2015 zhou et al 2017 this numerical method successfully accelerates the convergence of the fourier series obtained from the inversion integral using the trapezoidal rule the results are then tested against the two dimensional finite element models built by comsol multiphysics and proven to be robust and accurate the detailed comparison is shown in section 4 1 4 1 break through curves btcs and concentration distribution analysis the following values of parameters are used in the example study v 1 m d b 0 005 m θ 1 θ 2 0 01 θ 1 λ λ 1 λ 2 1 54 10 4 1 d r r 1 r 2 1 d 0 5 m2 d d 1 d 2 1 38 10 5 m2 d it is worthwhile to point out that transport parameters in the upper and lower rock matrixes are given the identical values as a symmetric reference case after that we will run the model with asymmetric distribution of diffusion coefficients in the finite element method with comsol a two dimensional model with a domain of 15 m wide and 6 m deep is developed to compare with the semi analytical solutions of this study the depth and width of the system is large enough to ignore the effect of limit boundaries during the time periods of interest fig 3 shows the segments of mesh used in the numerical simulation there are 30 928 triangular elements generated in comsol which automatically refines the elements within the fracture and near the interfaces the maximum and minimum element sizes are 1 01 m and 0 0045 m respectively the time step increases linearly with a total simulation time of 500 days without losing generality three observation points are picked arbitrarily to analyze btcs of the system shown in fig 1 p1 0 5 m 0 m in the fracture p2 0 5 m 0 1 m in the upper rock matrix and p3 0 5 m 0 1 m in the lower rock matrix respectively btcs at p1 0 5 m 0 m under the first type and third type boundary conditions are plotted in fig 4 the solid lines represent the semi analytical solutions derived in this study the dashed lines in the figure represent the numerical solutions of comsol as can be seen excellent agreements are reached for both boundary conditions between the semi analytical solutions and finite element results it is worthwhile to point out that the difference between solute transport under the first type and the third type boundary conditions are obvious at early time after that it becomes smaller when approaching steady states this is primarily because the first type boundary condition refers to a situation that the solute flux at the inlet boundary decreases with time while the solute flux for the third type boundary condition remains constant as shown in fig 2 since the solute flux for the first type boundary condition is larger than that for the third type boundary condition at early time greater solute mass enters the fracture for this kind of boundary condition which is clearly indicated in fig 4 when approaching their steady states the first type and the third type boundary conditions have about the same flux value leading to nearly the same results after a lapse of enough time fig 5 a shows the effects of transverse molecular diffusion coefficients on btcs btcs at p2 0 5 m 0 1 m in the upper rock matrix and p3 0 5 m 0 1 m in the lower rock matrix are plotted as black lines with the same value of transverse molecular diffusion coefficient at 1 38 10 5 m2 d after adjusting the relative values of transverse molecular diffusion coefficients at d 1 d 2 10 1 and 50 1 without changing the sum of d 1 d 2 btcs at p2 0 5 m 0 1 m and p3 0 5 m 0 1 m are plotted with blue and red dash lines respectively those two molecular diffusion coefficient ratios are selected arbitrarily to represent the geological media with different transport properties in the upper and lower rock bodies a lower transverse molecular diffusion coefficient in the upper rock matrix means a lower diffusion term d 1 2 c 1 z 2 on the right hand side of eq 2 and a weaker diffusive effect since diffusion is the dominating transport process in the rock matrix the concentration at p2 0 5 m 0 1 m is less than the concentration at p3 0 5 m 0 1 m the effects of diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix are further discussed in fig 5b btcs of p3 0 5 m 0 1 m in the lower rock matrix with variable diffusion coefficients in the lower rock matrix are plotted with a fixed value of diffusion coefficient in the upper rock matrix d 1 1 38 10 5m2 d the values of diffusion coefficients are representatives of some geological media golubev and garibyants 1971 from relatively unconsolidated sediments to more consolidated sediments similar to the results in fig 5a a lower diffusion coefficient corresponds to a slower diffusive transport process and less concentration in the rock matrix fig 5c shows the effects of retardation factor on solute transport in the rock matrix the retardation factor of the lower rock matrix is fixed at 1 for all cases which indicates no sorption involved btcs at p2 0 5 m 0 1 m in the upper rock matrix under different values of retardation factors in the upper rock matrix are plotted a greater value of retardation factor in the upper rock matrix means more sorption happened which will decrease the concentration in the aqueous phase there changing the retardation factor in the upper rock matrix will not significantly affect solute transport in the lower rock matrix the concentration profiles along the z axis are indicated in fig 6 the solid lines in fig 6 refer to the cases of symmetric distribution of transport parameters for 50 and 500 days which lead to symmetric distributions of concentrations along the z axis with a higher molecular diffusion coefficient in the upper rock matrix the solute migrates further away from the fracture rock matrix interface than that in the lower rock matrix 4 2 back diffusion of mass by water flushing to study the back diffusion of contaminant mass in the rock matrix a water flushing phase with a zero contaminant mass concentration is imposed on the inlet boundary of the system after a certain time t 0 of tracer flushing the back diffusion from the upper and lower rock matrixes where concentrations are higher into the fracture where concentrations are lower would occur during the water flushing process mathematically water flushing is done by placing another contaminant source with a concentration of c 0 at the inlet boundary of the fracture after time t 0 while keeping the original source with a concentration of c 0 undisturbed we have tested this mathematical approximation rigorously through extensive numerical exercises and conclude that the overall consequence is nearly the same as that of water flushing with some negligible differences at a very short period of time immediately after t 0 the results of semi analytical solutions derived in this study at different points are compared with the solutions with the finite element method in comsol for the water flushing phase starts at after t 0 of 2 days fig 7 an excellent agreement is reached between these two solutions confirming the accuracy and robustness of the new solution the plotted curves in fig 7 a c refer to btcs at the points of 0 5 m 0 m 2 m 0 m and 4 m 0 m respectively in fig 7a the point 0 5 m 0 m is the closest to the inlet boundary thus experiencing immediate concentration changes after the water flushing in fig 7b the advective front of solute just reaches the point 2 m 0 m when the water flushing starts as a result the concentration at point 2 m 0 m still increases with time for a short period even though the tracer flushing has stopped and the water flushing has started in fig 7c when the water flushing starts the concentration at point 4 m 0 m is still at a relatively low level because this point is still way ahead of the tracer advective front the peak concentration is observed at about 4 days since there is extra time for the mixture of solute and water or dispersion before reaching this point the concentration drops at a slower rate at this point than at other two points by comparing btcs among various locations several points are notable firstly dilution caused by water flushing will affect the concentration peak value meaning that the point further down gradient from the entrance will has a lower peak concentration secondly dispersion or mixture of solute and water before reaching the point of interest will slow down the decreasing rate after the peak value if the point of interest is further away from the entrance it will take longer time to reach the peak value and decrease slower after that compared to solute transport in the fracture transport in the rock matrix has a time lag after water flushing the characteristic time for diffusive transport into the rock matrix is inversely proportional to the effective molecular diffusion coefficient in fig 8 the blue solid lines refer to btcs at points p2 and p3 with identical molecular diffusion coefficient symmetric case for the asymmetric cases of d 1 d 2 10 1 and 50 1 while keeping the summation of d 1 and d 2 the same as the symmetric case the solute reaches point p2 faster than before 4 3 diffusive mass exchange between the fracture and the matrix the diffusive mass exchange terms q 1 and q 2 in eqs 4 and 5 refer to the mass fluxes crossing the interfaces of the fracture and the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively the influence of asymmetric distribution of transport parameters is investigated in this section during the tracer flushing phase mass is diffused from the fracture into the rock matrix while during the water flushing phase mass is diffused back from the rock matrix into the fracture except for a very short period of time right after the water flushing fig 9 shows that the diffusive mass exchange between the fracture and the rock matrix have similar patterns and characteristic distances at which the diffusive mass exchange term equals to zero are about the same for all the sceneries of concern the positive value represents the diffusive mass transport from the fracture toward the rock matrix and vice versa the diffusive mass exchange term sharply increases and reaches its positive peak value and then starts to decrease after water flushing starts the diffusive exchange term sharply drops to negative and reaches its negative peak value after that the back diffusion rate slowly decreases and approaches zero after a long time to explain this pattern one needs to understand that the diffusive mass exchange is directly determined by the concentration gradient crossing the fracture rock interfaces a greater concentration difference or gradient between the fracture and rock matrix would lead to a greater diffusive mass exchange in this case the contaminant solute migrates to 0 5 m mainly by advection for about 0 5 days which corresponds to the maximum vertical concentration gradient and the greatest positive diffusive mass exchange at the advection front with the increasing of solute concentration in the rock matrix the diffusive mass exchange decreases as the result of declining concentration gradient across the fracture matrix interface if water flushing time is sufficiently long the concentrations of the fracture and the rock matrix would be very close to each other and the solute diffusion between the fracture and rock matrix would be close to zero the profile of diffusive mass exchange versus the x coordinate is also useful to understand the solute exchange between the fracture and the rock matrix during the water flushing process in fig 10 the curves of the diffusive mass exchange along the x axis toward the upper matrix under different time are plotted it is interesting to check the characteristic distance which is the location at which the concentration in the fracture equals to that in the rock matrix thus the diffusive mass exchange stops without consideration of dispersion the advection front of water flushing is t t 0 which is also the characteristic distance for this hypothetical case there are two factors which would affect the characteristic distance shifting from the advection front of water flushing to a new location the longitudinal dispersion in the fracture and the transverse diffusion in the rock matrix as the diffusion coefficient is several orders of magnitude smaller than the dispersion coefficient the dispersion plays a more important role here for the shifting of characteristic distance thus the characteristic distance is not sensitive to the asymmetric distribution of diffusion coefficients after 10 days the zero value of diffusive mass exchange occurs at 7 9 m down gradient from the inlet boundary x 7 9 m which is very close to the advective front of 8 m after 30 days the zero value of diffusive mass exchange term is about x 26 m which is slightly shorter than the advective front of water flushing at x 28 m at t 50 days the zero value of diffusive mass exchange is about x 44 m while the advective front of flushing water is at x 48 m from above analysis one can see that a longer time allows for more dispersion especially at the contact area thus results in a shorter characteristic distance or the location of zero diffusive mass exchange than those without the consideration of dispersion 4 4 stored mass calculation the amount of mass stored in each domain of the system provides vital information for the long term influence of solute transport the following equations are used to calculate the mass stored in each domain 32 m 0 2 b c θ d x 33 m 1 b 0 c 1 θ 1 d x d z 34 m 2 b 0 c 2 θ 2 d x d z where m m 1 and m 2 are the masses stored per unit width in the fracture the upper rock matrix and the lower rock matrix respectively as an example the calculations of mass stored ratios are under the first type boundary condition see appendix of supplementary materials for details of calculation where the mass stored ratios are calculated by dividing the mass stored in each domain over the peak value of mass stored in the entire system which corresponds to the mass stored in the system just before water flushing in fig 11 the curves of the mass stored ratios in the fracture and the rock matrix are plotted for the cases of symmetric versus asymmetric diffusion coefficients both cases indicate a similar pattern the mass stored in the fracture is the major part of the total mass and it is more sensitive to water flushing after 2 days the mass stored in the fracture decreases sharply however the mass stored in the rock matrix continues to increase but at a slower rate even after the stop of tracer flushing or start of water flushing the mass stored in the fracture is only slightly affected by the diffusion coefficient of the rock matrix as can be seen from comparing fig 11a symmetric case and fig 11b asymmetric case with a greater diffusion coefficient the upper rock matrix is able to store more mass and the difference between the masses stored in the upper and lower rock matrixes becomes larger over time 4 5 discussion a striking aspect of this study is that it honors the asymmetric nature of diffusion in the upper and lower portions of the rock matrixes this new advancement over the classical symmetric model makes it possible to deal with transport in fissures separating different rock types or unconformity however this study also has its limitations that require further attention firstly in this study all the parameters are assumed to be independent of scale and time in reality the dispersivity or dispersion coefficient could be scale dependent gao et al 2010 logan 1996 pickens and grisak 1981 the fracture apertures and dispersion can even be time dependent if the stress strain condition of the fracture matrix is a concern secondly this study relies on a presumption that advection dispersion equation ade is the correct governing equation of transport in the fracture and diffusion equation is the correct governing equation of transport in the matrix such governing equations may be subject to debate as some other investigators have adopted different types of approaches such mobile immobile model zhou et al 2017 fractional ade benson et al 2000a 2000b or continuous time random walk ctrw berkowitz and scher 1997 berkowitz and scher 1998 to study transport in the fracture if flow in the matrix is also a concern then the diffusion equation of transport in the matrix also must be revised to accommodate the advective transport in the matrix rezaei et al 2016 zhan et al 2009a thirdly the study is focused on a single idealized fracture it may be extended to multiple paralleled fractures following the procedures used by zhu et al 2016 for symmetric cases however if the single fracture has a torturous and irregular trajectory one may need to either use a totally different approach or to substantially revise the present model of this study in general the problem becomes a three dimensional rather than a two dimensional for a torturous and irregular fracture fourthly the possible complexity at the fracture matrix interface is not considered such complexity may include the discontinuity of concentration at such an interface among other factors one problem of this study is that there is no direct field data to validate the proposed model despite the obvious importance of studying asymmetric fracture rock matrixes and or aquifer aquitard systems as documented by abundant evidences present in the introduction lack of experimental studies on the subject may come from a host of reasons firstly it is usually much more difficult to obtain concentration and mass information directly from rock matrixes and or aquitards rather than from fractures and aquifers which are much more permeable in the future innovative experimental designs have to be devised to measure preferably non invasively concentration and mass in the rock matrixes and or aquitards secondly for a long time hydrologists have focused their attention on studying flow and transport in permeable media such as fractures and aquifers and have tried to avoid less permeable media such as rock matrixes and aquitards such a mindset has resulted in much less attention paid to designing instrumentations specifically targeting the rock matrixes and aquitards over many decades thirdly because of the lack of theoretical models on asymmetric systems models of symmetric systems have been routinely used to interpret data for transport in aquifer aquitard systems without knowing that whether the systems investigated are truly symmetric or not it is our hope that the theoretical study of this work may help reinvigorate the interests of experimental study of rock matrixes and aquitards for mass and heat transport in the fracture matrix and aquifer aquitard systems 5 conclusions general solutions have been developed for reactive solute transport in a fracture rock matrix system with asymmetric transport properties in the upper and lower rock matrixes advection and dispersion along the single fracture diffusion in the rock matrix and radioactive decay and adsorption in the entire system are considered in this model the corresponding steady state solutions and penetration depth are also provided for the long term evaluation of environment impact a comparison between the first type and the third type boundary conditions are made and explained in terms of solute flux from the entrance source the following conclusions can be made 1 the case studies indicate that the asymmetric case would cause a very different solute distribution in the rock matrix as compared to the symmetric case however reactive solute transport in the fracture seems to be less affected by the asymmetry of diffusion in the rock matrix see figs 5 and 6 2 during the water flushing phase which occurs sometime later after the tracer flushing the flushed water significantly dilutes the contaminant in the fracture leading to a sharp drop of concentration in the fracture however the rock matrix responses to water flushing in a much slower fashion the characteristic time of the peak concentration in the rock matrix is inversely proportional to the effective molecular diffusion coefficient 3 the patterns of diffusive mass exchange between the fracture and rock matrix are also studied during the water flushing phase solute in the fracture is quickly diluted and the back diffusion happens from the rock matrix to the fracture with more dispersion involved there would be greater difference between the characteristic distance with dispersion and the characteristic distance for the hypothetical case without dispersion where the characteristic distance is defined as the distance at which the diffusive mass exchange between the fracture and the rock matrix becomes zero 4 the relative amount of mass stored in each domain is studied and the mass stored in the fracture is the major part of the total mass which is more sensitive to water flushing a greater diffusion

884,the understanding of reactive solute transport in a single fracture rock matrix system is the foundation of studying transport behavior in the complex fractured porous media when transport properties are asymmetrically distributed in the adjacent rock matrixes reactive solute transport has to be considered as a coupled three domain problem which is more complex than the symmetric case with identical transport properties in the adjacent rock matrixes this study deals with the transport problem in a single fracture rock matrix system with asymmetrical distribution of transport properties in the rock matrixes mathematical models are developed for such a problem under the first type and the third type boundary conditions to analyze the spatio temporal concentration and mass distribution in the fracture and rock matrix with the help of laplace transform technique and de hoog numerical inverse laplace algorithm the newly acquired solutions are then tested extensively against previous analytical and numerical solutions and are proven to be robust and accurate furthermore a water flushing phase is imposed on the left boundary of system after a certain time the diffusive mass exchange along the fracture rock matrixes interfaces and the relative masses stored in each of three domains fracture upper rock matrix and lower rock matrix after the water flushing provide great insights of transport with asymmetric distribution of transport properties this study has the following findings 1 asymmetric distribution of transport properties imposes greater controls on solute transport in the rock matrixes however transport in the fracture is mildly influenced 2 the mass stored in the fracture responses quickly to water flushing while the mass stored in the rock matrix is much less sensitive to the water flushing 3 the diffusive mass exchange during the water flushing phase has similar patterns under symmetric and asymmetric cases 4 the characteristic distance which refers to the zero diffusion between the fracture and the rock matrix during the water flushing phase is closely associated with dispersive process in the fracture keywords single fracture back diffusion reactive solute transport asymmetric rock matrix 1 introduction reactive solute transport in fractured media has been studied for decades because of its broad range of applications such as understanding the fate and transport of chemicals and nuclear waste in the subsurface oil and gas production etc grisak and pickens 1981 pouya 2012 zhou et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 a typical example is dealing with the groundwater pollution in fractured reservoirs bodin et al 2003 this study focuses on the influence of asymmetric distribution of transport parameters in the rock matrix on reactive solute transport in a single fracture and addresses the fracture to matrix diffusion during the tracer flushing phase and the matrix to fracture back diffusion issues during the water flushing phase specifically since fractures are much more permeable than rock matrix thus they are usually treated as effective conduits in fractured systems for transporting water and solutes maloszewski and zuber 1993 sudicky and frind 1982 for this reason some previous studies conceptualized solute transport in a single fracture as two distinctive processes advection through the fracture and diffusion between the rock matrix and the fracture grisak and pickens 1980 zhu et al 2016 although fractures are the major conduits in a fracture matrix system interactions between the fracture and the rock matrix would still have significant influence on solute transport roubinet et al 2012 zhan et al 2009a among various approaches of understanding transport in single fractures and fractured media analytical models have their advantages of being physically based with fewer input parameters and providing insights into multiple processes despite of its simplifications of boundaries and initial conditions media heterogeneity etc analytical models provide a powerful tool for understanding the physics associated with transport problems which are fundamentally important for implementing full scale numerical models under complex conditions thus will be the primary concern of this study the first widely used analytical model of solute transport in a single fracture rock matrix was proposed by tang et al 1981 who compared the solutions with and without the fracture dispersion this analytical model provided valuable insight into the mechanism of solute transport in a single fracture rock matrix system sudicky and frind 1982 then extended the solutions of tang et al 1981 to a fracture matrix system with identically parallel fractures they also concluded that it was necessary to consider the longitudinal dispersion of the fracture in assessing the long term fate of solute transport maloszewski and zuber 1990 argued that the influence of rock matrix diffusion cannot be negligible and concluded that the matrix diffusion can even be the dominant process in some cases bodin et al 2003 reviewed the laboratory experiments and theoretical studies over last three decades to emphasize the advection hydrodynamic dispersion channel effects matrix diffusion and sorption reactions as fundamental processes which should be integrated together roubinet et al 2012 developed a two dimensional model for the transport of a conservative solute in a single fracture rock matrix system they concluded that the impact of transverse dispersion in the fracture and longitudinal diffusion in the rock matrix can be neglected in standard models of a single fracture rock matrix all the studies mentioned above about the fracture rock matrix system are based on the assumption that the rock matrix has identical transport properties on both sides of the fracture for a single fracture with parallel and flat surfaces the problem becomes symmetric in respect to the middle plane of the fracture thus can be simplified to a half plane problem zhou et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 however if the rock matrixes on both sides of the fracture have different transport properties such as molecular diffusion coefficient and porosities carrera et al 1998 xu et al 2001 they cannot be simplified into a half plane problem and must be considered as three coupled domains including the fracture and two rock matrixes with different transport properties for example the unconformity can be considered as a preferential pathway with high permeability and porosity like a fracture zimmerman and sassen 1993 the rock formations above and below the unconformity could be formed under very different environments at different ages thus have different transport properties and should be treated separately cipollari and cosentino 1995 investigated miocene unconformities in the central apennines area their field based observations suggested that the angular unconformity between middle miocene and upper miocene separated the lower shallow water limestone and upper glauconitic arenaceous marls which was condensed deposition thus the upper and lower layers have significantly different transport parameters and would not be treated as a symmetric case also caine et al 1996 proposed that a brittle fault zone was lithological heterogeneity and would act as a conduit for fluid flow and solute transport the rock blocks on two sides of the fault would have different lithology due to the fault movement similar field observations were also reported by chester and logan 1986 at punchbowl fault zone at the juncture of san gabriel mountains and the mojave desert the punchbowl fault zone is located between the punchbowl formation and basement with sharp and distinct contacts the punchbowl formation is mainly composed of conglomerate sandstone and siltstone meanwhile the basement is primary composed of igneous rocks that are rich of felsic minerals with some thin mafic mineral layers inside in summary the assumption of the symmetric distribution of transport parameters could not stand in above mentioned examples and an asymmetric model of the fracture rock matrix system is required it is also important to note that solute transport in an asymmetric fracture rock matrix system has a broad scope of applications and the results obtained in this study can be applied to dealing with many other mass or heat transport problems in the subsurface for instance the system investigated here can be directly applied to solute and or heat transport in a thin aquifer bounded by two aquitards deposited under different geological times with different sedimentary environments thus very likely to have very different physical and chemical properties zhan et al 2009a b therefore one has to use the asymmetric model of this study to deal with such an aquifer aquitard system similarly solute and or heat transport in vadose zone aquifer underlying materials often time requests an asymmetric model as well for example when studying the thermal effect of climate change on groundwater fed ecosystems in volcanic medicine lake highlands in california usa burns et al 2017 pointed out that an asymmetric heat transport model was inevitable because thermal properties can differ distinctively between the vadose zone aquifer and underlying materials the main goal of this study is to develop a new analytical model for reactive solute transport in a fracture rock matrix system with asymmetric distribution of transport parameters of the rock matrix a finite element numerical simulation is also developed with comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa for the comparison with our solutions the results under the first type constant concentration and the third type constant mass flux boundary conditions at the fracture inlet are also compared both tracer flushing and water flushing processes are investigated with the obtained solutions one could compute the dynamic partition of mass at three coupled domains and the matrix diffusion and back diffusion issues are specifically taken into consideration the analysis of mass partition would be very helpful for risk and environment impact assessments of contaminant transport in a fracture matrix system with asymmetric transport properties of rock matrix the problem can be applied to deal with transport in an unconformity straightforwardly 2 conceptual model and physical setup in this study we consider a thin fracture or an unconformity situated horizontally with a constant aperture 2b the rock matrixes with different properties are distributed above and below the fracture use of a horizontal fracture here is simply for the sake of illustration in fact the fracture can be in any orientation as the gravity is not a concern here the permeability values of the surrounding rock matrixes are several orders of magnitude less than that of the fracture which is assumed to extend sufficiently far from the domain of interest the rock matrixes are wide enough in the horizontal direction perpendicularly to the groundwater flow direction in the fracture thus the problem can be simplified as a two dimensional one the matrixes are also assumed to be sufficiently thick thus the rock matrix boundaries away from the fracture will not affect the transport process and can be regarded as infinitely far a schematic diagram of three coupled domains including an upper rock matrix a fracture and a lower rock matrix is shown in fig 1 a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system is established with the origin at the crossing point of the left boundary and the middle of the fracture fig 1 the x axis is from left to right while the z axis is vertically upward the groundwater flow only occurs in the fracture from left to right and has a constant velocity groundwater in the upper and lower rock matrixes is immobile a contaminant source exists at the origin of the fracture and the system is free from contamination at the start of transport two boundary conditions at x 0 are considered separately first type dirichlet or constant concentration and third type robin or constant mass flux boundary conditions several assumptions about the geometry and transport properties of the system are made as follows firstly the fracture has a very small aperture which allows the transverse mixing throughout the fracture aperture to occur almost instantaneously therefore the influence of transverse dispersion in the fracture is not taken into consideration also rezaei et al 2016 investigated longitudinal dispersion in the rock matrix and concluded that longitudinal dispersion in the rock matrix can be ignored for most practical cases secondly the permeability values of the upper and lower rock matrixes are so small that transport in the rock matrix is dominated by molecular diffusion these two assumptions provide the basis that the mass flux direction in the rock matrix is perpendicular to the fracture matrix interface the following processes are considered advection longitudinal dispersion molecular diffusion adsorption and radioactive decay in the fracture transverse molecular diffusion adsorption and radioactive decay in the upper and lower rock matrixes 3 mathematical models and solutions 3 1 mathematical models reactive solute transport in the fracture rock matrix system can be described as the following governing equations 1 θ r c t θ d 2 c x 2 θ v c x θ λ r c q 1 2 b q 2 2 b 2 r 1 c 1 t d 1 2 c 1 z 2 λ 1 r 1 c 1 3 r 2 c 2 t d 2 2 c 2 z 2 λ 2 r 2 c 2 where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively the symbol without subscript represents the fracture hereinafter c m l3 is concentration b l is the fracture s half aperture t t is the time r is the constant retardation factor v l t is the groundwater velocity in the fracture λ 1 t is the decay constant which can be further expressed as ln2 t 1 2 where t 1 2 is the half life time θ is the porosity d l2 t is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the fracture which equals d α l v d where αl l is the longitudinal dispersivity d l2 t is the molecular diffusion coefficient in the fracture d 1 l2 t and d 2 l2 t are the transverse molecular diffusion coefficients in the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively q 1 and q 2 m l2t are the diffusive mass fluxes across the fracture rock matrix interfaces and can be further expressed as 4 q 1 θ 1 d 1 c 1 z z b 5 q 2 θ 2 d 2 c 2 z z b the concentration gradients c 1 z and c 2 z at both interfaces are obtained from eqs 2 and 3 a minor point to note is that negative and positive signs are used in eqs 4 and 5 respectively as positive c 1 z and c 2 z will result in downward and upward mass fluxes across the upper and lower fracture matrix interfaces respectively the existence of possible mass accumulations at the sharp interface between the fracture and rock matrix has been reported in a number of investigations before berkowitz et al 2009 leij et al 1991 marseguerra and zoia 2006 which could cause concentration discontinuity across the interface if there are mass accumulations when solutes cross from one medium to another the concentration discontinuity will be detected marseguerra and zoia 2006 however no directly experimental evidence of mass accumulations at the sharp interface is available to support this hypothesis therefore such concentration discontinuity is not considered here as this issue is still debatable and has not been widely accepted because of a lack of convincing experimental evidence we assume the concentration continuity at the fracture matrix interface in this study as commonly done in numerous previous investigations of flow and transport in a fracture matrix system zhang et al 2010 bearing this in mind above governing equations are supplemented with the following conditions 6 c 1 x z b t c x t 7 c 2 x z b t c x t it is worthwhile to point out that besides the continuity of concentration at the fracture matrix interface the continuity of vertical mass flux across the fracture matrix interface is also honored here however the continuity of vertical concentration gradient at the fracture rock matrix interface is not maintained here because the essence of the governing equations such as eq 1 is mass balance not concentration gradient balance the continuity of vertical mass flux is done through the use of two flux terms of q 1 and q 2 in eq 1 above since the fracture aperture is usually so small as compared with the scale of transport in the fracture the mass flux entering the fracture from the matrix is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the entire aperture of 2b instantaneously that is why the terms q 1 2b and q 2 2b are incorporated into eq 1 instead of being treated as a boundary condition at the fracture matrix interface such an instantaneously mixed model has been used as a standard approach for numerous studies in flow and transport in fracture matrix systems sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 and or aquifer aquitard systems zhan and bian 2006 because it simplifies the governing equation in the fracture and or aquifer by reducing a two dimensional problem into a one dimensional problem this approach is proven to be robust and sufficiently accurate for fracture matrix systems owing to the very small apertures as compared to the scales of transport however for transport in an aquifer aquitard system where the aquifer thickness is not sufficiently thin as compared to the scale of transport the instantaneously mixed model may be problematic as documented by some previous investigations zhan et al 2009a b because the mass flux into the aquifer from the aquitard cannot be mixed across the entire aquifer thickness quickly for such a case one cannot use the above eq 1 to deal with the transport in the aquifer anymore instead one has to consider both longitudinal and vertical dispersions in the aquifer and specifically honors both the continuities of concentration and vertical mass flux at the aquifer aquitard interface zhan et al 2009a b nevertheless the mathematical treatment is much more complex for doing so being aware that continuity of mass flux at the aquifer aquitard interface even for this non instantaneously mixed case will not lead to the continuity of vertical concentration gradient at the aquifer aquitard interface because the vertical hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients in the aquifer and aquitard are usually very different from each other in summary regardless of using an instantaneously mixed model or a non instantaneously mixed model continuities of concentration and mass flux at the fracture matrix or aquifer aquitard interface are always maintained but the continuity of vertical concentration gradient at such an interface is not a concern the entire system is assumed to be free of solute at t 0 thus the initial conditions are 8 c x t 0 c 1 x z t 0 c 2 x z t 0 0 the fracture is assumed to be infinitely long and the rock matrix is infinitely thick thus one has 9 c x t c 1 x z t c 2 x z t 0 in this study two different boundary conditions at the fracture inlet are considered separately the first type and third type boundary conditions for the first type boundary condition the concentration at fracture at x 0 keeps constant at c 0 10 c x 0 t c 0 the first type boundary condition assumes that the concentration cross the inlet boundary continuously its validity stands if the entrance reservoir is directly connected to the fracture however it is not practical for the tracer experiments where the solute is added at a specified rate vangenuchten and parker 1984 the third type boundary condition has also been used frequently which can be expressed as 11 v c d c x x 0 v c 0 where x 0 indicates that the estimation is built for the inside profile of the inlet boundary the robin boundary condition stands valid for the following case the fracture is connected to an entrance contaminant source and the molecular diffusion and dispersion in the fore section x 0 is ignored vangenuchten and parker 1984 the solute convective dispersive flux component along the x direction is given as follow batu and vangenuchten 1990 freeze and cherry 1979 12 f x θ v c θ d c x in fig 2 the convective dispersive flux components for the first type and third type boundary conditions are plotted at x 0 the results clearly indicate that the flux for the first type boundary condition fx drops over time and approaches steady state at the value of θc 0 v however the convective dispersive flux for the third type boundary condition at the inlet boundary keeps constant at fx θc 0 v all the time after a couple of days both convective dispersive flux components reach the same value 3 2 solutions of both first type and third type boundary conditions converting the equations into their dimensionless forms is usually helpful because of fewer independent variables left and more reflective of the systems involved as some previous studies have demonstrated bear 1972 simmons et al 2001 all the definitions of the dimensionless variables are listed in appendix of the supplemental files besides that laplace transform is adopted to transform the problem from real time domain to laplace domain for eqs 1 11 thus the analytical solutions under both boundary conditions can be derived in laplace domain under the first type boundary condition the analytical solutions of the fracture and the upper and lower rock matrixes in laplace domain are obtained as follows more details of derivations are provided in appendix of the supplementary files 13 c d 1 p exp p e p e 2 4 k 1

1 1 4 k 1 p e 2 a larger peclet number pe will lead to a smaller difference between those two solutions 3 3 steady state solutions the steady state solutions are particularly helpful for addressing the long term estimations also they are usually much simpler than the transient solutions thus the steady state solutions are widely used for estimating the long term effect and for designing the remediation plans to fulfill the requirements of the steady state solutions one must meet the following equation 19 c d t c 1 d t c 2 d t 0 as indicated in eq 19 after reaching steady state the concentration in the system would reach equilibrium and no longer change with time the steady state solutions can be derived by using the following equation f t d lim p 0 p f p where f p refers to the solution in laplace domain thus the steady state solutions can be easily derived by calculating the limitations of p c d p c 1 d p c 2 d as p approaches 0 from eqs 13 18 the analytical steady state

environment impact and risk assessment this could be done with the help of analytical steady state solutions developed above for a concentration reduction φ or c c 0 ϕ where ϕ is much less than 1 such as 10 3 or 10 4 the penetration depth is defined as lφ for the maximum horizontal penetration depth in the fracture and l 1ϕ and l 2ϕ for the maximum vertical penetration depths in the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively l ϕ refers to the farthest horizontal distance between the origin to the point where the concentration is ϕc 0 while l 1ϕ and l 2ϕ demonstrate the farthest vertical distances between the original to the point where the concentration is ϕc 0 in the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively a sufficiently small value of φ refers to the scenario that the concentration has dropped to a negligible level for instance ϕ 10 4 as used in many studies tang et al 1981 substituting the definition of φ into eqs 20 25 one can obtain the penetration depths l ϕ l 1ϕ and l 2ϕ for the first type boundary condition the penetration depths are 26 l φ 2 ln φ p e p e 2 4 k 1 s 27 l 1 φ r 2 d r d 1 ln φ r 2 r 1 λ 1 α 28 l 2 φ d 2 d 1 λ 2 α ln φ r 2 d r d 1 the

technique of inverse laplace transform will be applied specifically the method of de hoog numerical inverse laplace transform de hoog et al 1982 is selected here for addressing the spatio temporal concentration distribution which has been used in other similar studies wang and zhan 2015 zhou et al 2017 this numerical method successfully accelerates the convergence of the fourier series obtained from the inversion integral using the trapezoidal rule the results are then tested against the two dimensional finite element models built by comsol multiphysics and proven to be robust and accurate the detailed comparison is shown in section 4 1 4 1 break through curves btcs and concentration distribution analysis the following values of parameters are used in the example study v 1 m d b 0 005 m θ 1 θ 2 0 01 θ 1 λ λ 1 λ 2 1 54 10 4 1 d r r 1 r 2 1 d 0 5 m2 d d 1 d 2 1 38 10 5 m2 d it is worthwhile to point out that transport parameters in the upper and lower rock matrixes are given the identical values as a symmetric reference case after that we will run the model with asymmetric distribution of diffusion coefficients in the finite element method with comsol a two dimensional model with a domain of 15 m wide and 6 m deep is developed to compare with the semi analytical solutions of this study the depth and width of the system is large enough to ignore the effect of limit boundaries during the time periods of interest fig 3 shows the segments of mesh used in the numerical simulation there are 30 928 triangular elements generated in comsol which automatically refines the elements within the fracture and near the interfaces the maximum and minimum element sizes are 1 01 m and 0 0045 m respectively the time step increases linearly with a total simulation time of 500 days without losing generality three observation points are picked arbitrarily to analyze btcs of the system shown in fig 1 p1 0 5 m 0 m in the fracture p2 0 5 m 0 1 m in the upper rock matrix and p3 0 5 m 0 1 m in the lower rock matrix respectively btcs at p1 0 5 m 0 m under the first type and third type boundary conditions are plotted in fig 4 the solid lines represent the semi analytical solutions derived in this study the dashed lines in the figure represent the numerical solutions of comsol as can be seen excellent agreements are reached for both boundary conditions between the semi analytical solutions and finite element results it is worthwhile to point out that the difference between solute transport under the first type and the third type boundary conditions are obvious at early time after that it becomes smaller when approaching steady states this is primarily because the first type boundary condition refers to a situation that the solute flux at the inlet boundary decreases with time while the solute flux for the third type boundary condition remains constant as shown in fig 2 since the solute flux for the first type boundary condition is larger than that for the third type boundary condition at early time greater solute mass enters the fracture for this kind of boundary condition which is clearly indicated in fig 4 when approaching their steady states the first type and the third type boundary conditions have about the same flux value leading to nearly the same results after a lapse of enough time fig 5 a shows the effects of transverse molecular diffusion coefficients on btcs btcs at p2 0 5 m 0 1 m in the upper rock matrix and p3 0 5 m 0 1 m in the lower rock matrix are plotted as black lines with the same value of transverse molecular diffusion coefficient at 1 38 10 5 m2 d after adjusting the relative values of transverse molecular diffusion coefficients at d 1 d 2 10 1 and 50 1 without changing the sum of d 1 d 2 btcs at p2 0 5 m 0 1 m and p3 0 5 m 0 1 m are plotted with blue and red dash lines respectively those two molecular diffusion coefficient ratios are selected arbitrarily to represent the geological media with different transport properties in the upper and lower rock bodies a lower transverse molecular diffusion coefficient in the upper rock matrix means a lower diffusion term d 1 2 c 1 z 2 on the right hand side of eq 2 and a weaker diffusive effect since diffusion is the dominating transport process in the rock matrix the concentration at p2 0 5 m 0 1 m is less than the concentration at p3 0 5 m 0 1 m the effects of diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix are further discussed in fig 5b btcs of p3 0 5 m 0 1 m in the lower rock matrix with variable diffusion coefficients in the lower rock matrix are plotted with a fixed value of diffusion coefficient in the upper rock matrix d 1 1 38 10 5m2 d the values of diffusion coefficients are representatives of some geological media golubev and garibyants 1971 from relatively unconsolidated sediments to more consolidated sediments similar to the results in fig 5a a lower diffusion coefficient corresponds to a slower diffusive transport process and less concentration in the rock matrix fig 5c shows the effects of retardation factor on solute transport in the rock matrix the retardation factor of the lower rock matrix is fixed at 1 for all cases which indicates no sorption involved btcs at p2 0 5 m 0 1 m in the upper rock matrix under different values of retardation factors in the upper rock matrix are plotted a greater value of retardation factor in the upper rock matrix means more sorption happened which will decrease the concentration in the aqueous phase there changing the retardation factor in the upper rock matrix will not significantly affect solute transport in the lower rock matrix the concentration profiles along the z axis are indicated in fig 6 the solid lines in fig 6 refer to the cases of symmetric distribution of transport parameters for 50 and 500 days which lead to symmetric distributions of concentrations along the z axis with a higher molecular diffusion coefficient in the upper rock matrix the solute migrates further away from the fracture rock matrix interface than that in the lower rock matrix 4 2 back diffusion of mass by water flushing to study the back diffusion of contaminant mass in the rock matrix a water flushing phase with a zero contaminant mass concentration is imposed on the inlet boundary of the system after a certain time t 0 of tracer flushing the back diffusion from the upper and lower rock matrixes where concentrations are higher into the fracture where concentrations are lower would occur during the water flushing process mathematically water flushing is done by placing another contaminant source with a concentration of c 0 at the inlet boundary of the fracture after time t 0 while keeping the original source with a concentration of c 0 undisturbed we have tested this mathematical approximation rigorously through extensive numerical exercises and conclude that the overall consequence is nearly the same as that of water flushing with some negligible differences at a very short period of time immediately after t 0 the results of semi analytical solutions derived in this study at different points are compared with the solutions with the finite element method in comsol for the water flushing phase starts at after t 0 of 2 days fig 7 an excellent agreement is reached between these two solutions confirming the accuracy and robustness of the new solution the plotted curves in fig 7 a c refer to btcs at the points of 0 5 m 0 m 2 m 0 m and 4 m 0 m respectively in fig 7a the point 0 5 m 0 m is the closest to the inlet boundary thus experiencing immediate concentration changes after the water flushing in fig 7b the advective front of solute just reaches the point 2 m 0 m when the water flushing starts as a result the concentration at point 2 m 0 m still increases with time for a short period even though the tracer flushing has stopped and the water flushing has started in fig 7c when the water flushing starts the concentration at point 4 m 0 m is still at a relatively low level because this point is still way ahead of the tracer advective front the peak concentration is observed at about 4 days since there is extra time for the mixture of solute and water or dispersion before reaching this point the concentration drops at a slower rate at this point than at other two points by comparing btcs among various locations several points are notable firstly dilution caused by water flushing will affect the concentration peak value meaning that the point further down gradient from the entrance will has a lower peak concentration secondly dispersion or mixture of solute and water before reaching the point of interest will slow down the decreasing rate after the peak value if the point of interest is further away from the entrance it will take longer time to reach the peak value and decrease slower after that compared to solute transport in the fracture transport in the rock matrix has a time lag after water flushing the characteristic time for diffusive transport into the rock matrix is inversely proportional to the effective molecular diffusion coefficient in fig 8 the blue solid lines refer to btcs at points p2 and p3 with identical molecular diffusion coefficient symmetric case for the asymmetric cases of d 1 d 2 10 1 and 50 1 while keeping the summation of d 1 and d 2 the same as the symmetric case the solute reaches point p2 faster than before 4 3 diffusive mass exchange between the fracture and the matrix the diffusive mass exchange terms q 1 and q 2 in eqs 4 and 5 refer to the mass fluxes crossing the interfaces of the fracture and the upper and lower rock matrixes respectively the influence of asymmetric distribution of transport parameters is investigated in this section during the tracer flushing phase mass is diffused from the fracture into the rock matrix while during the water flushing phase mass is diffused back from the rock matrix into the fracture except for a very short period of time right after the water flushing fig 9 shows that the diffusive mass exchange between the fracture and the rock matrix have similar patterns and characteristic distances at which the diffusive mass exchange term equals to zero are about the same for all the sceneries of concern the positive value represents the diffusive mass transport from the fracture toward the rock matrix and vice versa the diffusive mass exchange term sharply increases and reaches its positive peak value and then starts to decrease after water flushing starts the diffusive exchange term sharply drops to negative and reaches its negative peak value after that the back diffusion rate slowly decreases and approaches zero after a long time to explain this pattern one needs to understand that the diffusive mass exchange is directly determined by the concentration gradient crossing the fracture rock interfaces a greater concentration difference or gradient between the fracture and rock matrix would lead to a greater diffusive mass exchange in this case the contaminant solute migrates to 0 5 m mainly by advection for about 0 5 days which corresponds to the maximum vertical concentration gradient and the greatest positive diffusive mass exchange at the advection front with the increasing of solute concentration in the rock matrix the diffusive mass exchange decreases as the result of declining concentration gradient across the fracture matrix interface if water flushing time is sufficiently long the concentrations of the fracture and the rock matrix would be very close to each other and the solute diffusion between the fracture and rock matrix would be close to zero the profile of diffusive mass exchange versus the x coordinate is also useful to understand the solute exchange between the fracture and the rock matrix during the water flushing process in fig 10 the curves of the diffusive mass exchange along the x axis toward the upper matrix under different time are plotted it is interesting to check the characteristic distance which is the location at which the concentration in the fracture equals to that in the rock matrix thus the diffusive mass exchange stops without consideration of dispersion the advection front of water flushing is t t 0 which is also the characteristic distance for this hypothetical case there are two factors which would affect the characteristic distance shifting from the advection front of water flushing to a new location the longitudinal dispersion in the fracture and the transverse diffusion in the rock matrix as the diffusion coefficient is several orders of magnitude smaller than the dispersion coefficient the dispersion plays a more important role here for the shifting of characteristic distance thus the characteristic distance is not sensitive to the asymmetric distribution of diffusion coefficients after 10 days the zero value of diffusive mass exchange occurs at 7 9 m down gradient from the inlet boundary x 7 9 m which is very close to the advective front of 8 m after 30 days the zero value of diffusive mass exchange term is about x 26 m which is slightly shorter than the advective front of water flushing at x 28 m at t 50 days the zero value of diffusive mass exchange is about x 44 m while the advective front of flushing water is at x 48 m from above analysis one can see that a longer time allows for more dispersion especially at the contact area thus results in a shorter characteristic distance or the location of zero diffusive mass exchange than those without the consideration of dispersion 4 4 stored mass calculation the amount of mass stored in each domain of the system provides vital information for the long term influence of solute transport the following equations are used to calculate the mass stored in each domain 32 m 0 2 b c θ d x 33 m 1 b 0 c 1 θ 1 d x d z 34 m 2 b 0 c 2 θ 2 d x d z where m m 1 and m 2 are the masses stored per unit width in the fracture the upper rock matrix and the lower rock matrix respectively as an example the calculations of mass stored ratios are under the first type boundary condition see appendix of supplementary materials for details of calculation where the mass stored ratios are calculated by dividing the mass stored in each domain over the peak value of mass stored in the entire system which corresponds to the mass stored in the system just before water flushing in fig 11 the curves of the mass stored ratios in the fracture and the rock matrix are plotted for the cases of symmetric versus asymmetric diffusion coefficients both cases indicate a similar pattern the mass stored in the fracture is the major part of the total mass and it is more sensitive to water flushing after 2 days the mass stored in the fracture decreases sharply however the mass stored in the rock matrix continues to increase but at a slower rate even after the stop of tracer flushing or start of water flushing the mass stored in the fracture is only slightly affected by the diffusion coefficient of the rock matrix as can be seen from comparing fig 11a symmetric case and fig 11b asymmetric case with a greater diffusion coefficient the upper rock matrix is able to store more mass and the difference between the masses stored in the upper and lower rock matrixes becomes larger over time 4 5 discussion a striking aspect of this study is that it honors the asymmetric nature of diffusion in the upper and lower portions of the rock matrixes this new advancement over the classical symmetric model makes it possible to deal with transport in fissures separating different rock types or unconformity however this study also has its limitations that require further attention firstly in this study all the parameters are assumed to be independent of scale and time in reality the dispersivity or dispersion coefficient could be scale dependent gao et al 2010 logan 1996 pickens and grisak 1981 the fracture apertures and dispersion can even be time dependent if the stress strain condition of the fracture matrix is a concern secondly this study relies on a presumption that advection dispersion equation ade is the correct governing equation of transport in the fracture and diffusion equation is the correct governing equation of transport in the matrix such governing equations may be subject to debate as some other investigators have adopted different types of approaches such mobile immobile model zhou et al 2017 fractional ade benson et al 2000a 2000b or continuous time random walk ctrw berkowitz and scher 1997 berkowitz and scher 1998 to study transport in the fracture if flow in the matrix is also a concern then the diffusion equation of transport in the matrix also must be revised to accommodate the advective transport in the matrix rezaei et al 2016 zhan et al 2009a thirdly the study is focused on a single idealized fracture it may be extended to multiple paralleled fractures following the procedures used by zhu et al 2016 for symmetric cases however if the single fracture has a torturous and irregular trajectory one may need to either use a totally different approach or to substantially revise the present model of this study in general the problem becomes a three dimensional rather than a two dimensional for a torturous and irregular fracture fourthly the possible complexity at the fracture matrix interface is not considered such complexity may include the discontinuity of concentration at such an interface among other factors one problem of this study is that there is no direct field data to validate the proposed model despite the obvious importance of studying asymmetric fracture rock matrixes and or aquifer aquitard systems as documented by abundant evidences present in the introduction lack of experimental studies on the subject may come from a host of reasons firstly it is usually much more difficult to obtain concentration and mass information directly from rock matrixes and or aquitards rather than from fractures and aquifers which are much more permeable in the future innovative experimental designs have to be devised to measure preferably non invasively concentration and mass in the rock matrixes and or aquitards secondly for a long time hydrologists have focused their attention on studying flow and transport in permeable media such as fractures and aquifers and have tried to avoid less permeable media such as rock matrixes and aquitards such a mindset has resulted in much less attention paid to designing instrumentations specifically targeting the rock matrixes and aquitards over many decades thirdly because of the lack of theoretical models on asymmetric systems models of symmetric systems have been routinely used to interpret data for transport in aquifer aquitard systems without knowing that whether the systems investigated are truly symmetric or not it is our hope that the theoretical study of this work may help reinvigorate the interests of experimental study of rock matrixes and aquitards for mass and heat transport in the fracture matrix and aquifer aquitard systems 5 conclusions general solutions have been developed for reactive solute transport in a fracture rock matrix system with asymmetric transport properties in the upper and lower rock matrixes advection and dispersion along the single fracture diffusion in the rock matrix and radioactive decay and adsorption in the entire system are considered in this model the corresponding steady state solutions and penetration depth are also provided for the long term evaluation of environment impact a comparison between the first type and the third type boundary conditions are made and explained in terms of solute flux from the entrance source the following conclusions can be made 1 the case studies indicate that the asymmetric case would cause a very different solute distribution in the rock matrix as compared to the symmetric case however reactive solute transport in the fracture seems to be less affected by the asymmetry of diffusion in the rock matrix see figs 5 and 6 2 during the water flushing phase which occurs sometime later after the tracer flushing the flushed water significantly dilutes the contaminant in the fracture leading to a sharp drop of concentration in the fracture however the rock matrix responses to water flushing in a much slower fashion the characteristic time of the peak concentration in the rock matrix is inversely proportional to the effective molecular diffusion coefficient 3 the patterns of diffusive mass exchange between the fracture and rock matrix are also studied during the water flushing phase solute in the fracture is quickly diluted and the back diffusion happens from the rock matrix to the fracture with more dispersion involved there would be greater difference between the characteristic distance with dispersion and the characteristic distance for the hypothetical case without dispersion where the characteristic distance is defined as the distance at which the diffusive mass exchange between the fracture and the rock matrix becomes zero 4 the relative amount of mass stored in each domain is studied and the mass stored in the fracture is the major part of the total mass which is more sensitive to water flushing a greater diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix means the ability to store more mass within the same time supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version
