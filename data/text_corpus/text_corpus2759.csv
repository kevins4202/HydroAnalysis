13795,photocatalysis is an efficacious technology for pollutants degradation however there remains ample room for the improvement of its degradation efficiency herein a system involving a g c3n4 biocooh photocatalyst coupled with peroxymonosulfate pms was developed using malachite green mg rhodamine b rhb ciprofloxacin hydrochloride cip and levofloxacin hydrochloride lvf as target pollutants the prepared g c3n4 biocooh nanocomposites were systematically characterized in contrast to pure g c3n4 or biocooh the photocatalytic activities of the nanocomposites were enhanced due to the formation of g c3n4 biocooh heterojunctions extensive specific surface areas and more efficient charge separation the degradation of rhb mg cip and lvf was further improved in this g c3n4 biocooh pms system due to the synergistic effects between the photocatalysts and pms the degradation of mg in the photocatalyst pms system was four fold that of a single photocatalyst system an exploration of these synergetic mechanisms indicated that o2 and 1o2 were the most significant reactive oxygen species in the single photocatalysis system whereas in the photocatalyst pms system additional 1o2 was generated due to the addition of pms and became the dominant species this research suggests that the combination of photocatalysts and pms is a feasible strategy for improving the pollutant removal activities of photocatalysts which have strong potential for myriad applications in environmental remediation keywords photocatalysis biocooh g c3n4 peroxymonosulfate superoxide radicals 1 introduction photocatalyst technologies have been extensively applied in many areas including the environment energy health care and more 1 6 however there is still much room for improvement particularly for the degradation of refractory pollutants the combination of photocatalysts with advanced oxidation techniques such as ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fenton reagents persulfate s2o8 2 and peroxymonosulfate pms 7 have demonstrated outstanding efficacy toward improving the decomposition of contaminants among these pms is distinguished due to its non toxicity chemical stability low cost and easy transport and storage 8 pms serves as an electron acceptor in photocatalyst pms systems to capture photogenerated electrons in the conduction band thus inhibiting the recombination of electron hole pairs moreover pms also generates so4 free radicals that have robust oxidizing properties e0 2 5 3 1 ev with the capacity to decompose most pollutants consequently the degradation efficiencies of photocatalyst pms systems are greatly improved due to their synergistic activities previous reports have described numerous composite materials which were selected to combine with pms for the degradation of pollutants for example the degradation efficiency of an agtcm ucn pms system was approximately two fold higher that of an agtcm ucn system under visible light irradiation 9 the first order kinetic constant for the degradation of bpa was increased 16 21 times following the combination of a wo3 mos2 ag photocatalyst with pms 10 in recent years graphite like carbon nitride g c3n4 has garnered significant attention from researchers due to its low cost earth abundance and suitable band gap 2 7 ev with unique optical and electronic properties it has been applied in various fields including water splitting co2 reduction pollutant degradation and biomedical applications 11 12 among these the application of g c3n4 in environmental remediation as a robust photocatalyst was preferred 13 however several limitations still need to be resolved such as a low specific surface area poor photonic response and the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs multiple techniques have been developed to overcome these drawbacks for instance the morphology of g c3n4 can be altered through the use of ultrathin nanosheets 14 nanorods 15 quantum dots 16 etc to increase its specific surface area thus improving its photocatalytic performance for the degradation of pollutants and hydrogen evolution further the synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites has been proven to be an effective strategy for decreasing electron hole recombination and modulation of optical properties several metals e g ag au pt pd and ni 17 20 inorganic semiconductors e g tio2 21 zno 22 and bismuth semiconductors 23 27 as well as c based materials e g carbon nanotubes cnts 28 29 graphene oxides go 30 fullerenes c60 31 and carbon nanofibers 32 have been selected for combining with g c3n4 these hybrid materials exhibited enhanced absorbance in the visible light region and stronger capacities for the decomposition of organic pollutants and water splitting among the bi based semiconductors much more attention has been paid to biox x cl br i 33 35 materials due to their layered bi2o2 2 structure which is favorable for light absorption further biocooh possesses a zigzag structure wherein acidic groups are arranged as polymer chains which can effectively absorb photons in addition the basic composition of biocooh no sulfur halogen or other substances implies an excellent photocatalytic candidate that generates no secondary pollution however biocooh is responsive only to uv light due to its wide band gap which severely limits its utilization of light to enable the functionality of biocooh under visible light while improving its photocatalytic activities various combined or elemental doping materials have been synthesized e g silver halide biocooh 36 38 biox x cl br i biocooh 39 41 cqd biocooh 42 rgo biocooh 43 mwcnt biocooh 44 and i doped biocooh 45 although g c3n4 and bi based materials have been widely explored g c3n4 bi based composites coupled with pms have rarely been reported in this study for the first time g c3n4 biocooh heterojunction photocatalysts were synthesized and combined with pms technology to develop a hybrid photocatalyst pms system the photocatalytic activities of the g c3n4 biocooh heterojunctions and the improved degradation capabilities of the g c3n4 biocooh pms system were systematically investigated through the degradation of dyes e g an anion dye mg and a cationic dye rhb and antibiotics ciprofloxacin hydrochloride cip and levofloxacin hydrochloride lvf the results revealed that the formation of heterojunctions significantly inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs thus improving the photocatalytic activities the incorporation of pms generated so4 free radicals and additional 1o2 further enhanced the degradation of the dyes and antibiotics subsequently a potential synergistic mechanism was proposed and the stability of the photocatalysis pms system was evaluated

heating rate of 3 c min next the product was naturally cooled to room temperature rinsed with water ethanol three times and dried at 60 c overnight to obtain the g c3n4 nanosheets 2 3 synthesis of biocooh microspheres comprised of biocooh were synthesized using a hydrothermal method 36 typically 25 ml glycerol 5 ml ultrapure water and 10 ml dmf were evenly mixed to form solution a subsequently 2 mmol bi no3 5h2o was ultrasonically dissolved into the solution a the resulting solution was then transferred into a 100 ml autoclave and heated at 160 c for 15 h after cooling naturally to room temperature the samples were rinsed with water ethanol three times and dried at 60 c overnight 2 4 synthesis of g c3n4 biocooh composites concisely 50 mg g c3n4 nanosheets and a certain amount of biocooh were ultrasonically dispersed into a mixture of 20 ml ethanol and 10 ml ultrapure water for 30 min next the suspension was placed into a tube furnace and heated at 180 c for 3 h cooled naturally to room temperature and wash up with ultrapure water three times afterwards the composites were dried at 60 c overnight the mass ratios of biocooh to g c3n4 were 0 2 1 0 5 1 and 0 8 1 respectively and designated as 0 2 bc 0 5 bc and 0 8 bc 2 5 characterization methods the crystalline structures of the as prepared materials were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd using a bruker d8 axs germany diffractometer system and performed under cu kα radiation λ 1 5418 nm scanning electron microscopy sem and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem were performed using a jeol jsm 6390lv japan and jeol jem 2100 f japan respectively the spatial elemental distribution was investigated by eds a component of the sem instrument brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas were detected on the basis of nitrogen adsorption isotherms using a micromeritics asap 2020 apparatus usa the chemical states and atomic surface elements were measured using a xsam 800 uk x ray photoelectron spectrophotometer xps all binding energies were calibrated by taking the c1s peak as a reference at 284 6 ev of contaminant carbon infrared absorption spectra were recorded using an infrared spectrometer ir in the frequency range of from 400 to 4000 cm 1 using kbr as the reference raman spectra were collected with a horiba labram hr evo france at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs were obtained using an uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 950 usa with baso4 as a reflectance standard the photoluminescence pl spectra were collected using

flash lamp as the excitation source the electron spin resonance esr signals of free radical species were detected with a jeol jesf 200 japan instrument using dmpo and temp as trapping agents 2 6 pollutant degradation briefly in a multi channel photocatalytic reactor with a 5 w led λ 390 nm light 15 mg of the as prepared materials were added into 50 ml quartz bottles which contained malachite green mg 10 mg l 1 rhodamine b rhb 6 mg l 1 ciprofloxacin cip 10 mg l 1 or levofloxacin hydrochloride lvf 10 mg l 1 the suspensions were magnetically stirred in darkness for 30 min to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium after which a certain amount of pms was added to the suspensions simultaneously with the onset of light exposure during irradiation 3 ml volumes of the suspension were extracted at certain intervals and immediately mixed with methanol to quench any residual pms prior to being centrifuged for 10 min the supernatants were analyzed using an uv 2900 spectrophotometer at 618 554 275 or 289 nm wavelengths for mg rhb cip or lvf respectively the degradation efficiency was calculated as follows η c 0 c t c 0 100 where η is the degradation rate c0 is the absorbance of the original mg rhb cip or lvf solution following adsorption and ct is the concentration at a certain time interval during the reaction following led light exposure 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization analysis the morphology of the as prepared materials was observed via sem and hrtem with the images displayed in fig 1 the pure biocooh fig 1a exhibited a flower like structure with a diameter of 2 μm which was comprised of irregular nanosheets the bright rings in the selected area diffraction ring image saed fig 1a inset suggested the polycrystalline structure of biocooh the g c3n4 fig 1b consisted of thin flakes with thicknesses of 20 nm which contained with many voids no crystal diffraction ring was observed in the saed image fig 1b inset which indicated the amorphous structure of g c3n4 for the nanocomposites the flower bone was reserved and several g c3n4 flakes were attached to the petals fig 1c d the luminance of the crystal diffraction rings in the saed image fig 1c inset was weakened due to the introduction of amorphous g c3n4 the lattice fringes of the biocooh in the nanocomposites could be clearly observed in the hrtem image fig 1e where the lattice distances of biocooh 0 356 nm and 0 275 nm corresponded to the 102 and 110 facets of biocooh respectively fig 1e reveals that the g c3n4 was comprised of amorphous nanosheets which was corresponded to the saed results shown in fig 1b 46 the eds and elemental mapping fig 1f insert suggested that the surfaces of the 0 5 bc nanocomposite consisted of bi o c and n as can be seen in the xrd patterns fig 2 a the primary peaks of g c3n4 nanosheets at 2θ 12 8 and 27 6 were indexed to the 001 and 002 crystal planes jcpds 87 1526 47 the peaks of biocooh at 24 1 30 0 32 8 42 2 46 9 53 3 and 56 7 were correlated with 101 102 110 113 200 211 and 212 crystal planes jcpds no 35 0939 respectively most of the diffraction peaks of the g c3n4 biocooh composites were consistent with those of pure biocooh 48 49 moreover the diffraction peak at 2θ 27 6 which belonged to the 002 crystal plane of g c3n4 was observed in all of the nanocomposites where its intensity gradually decreased along with the quantity of biocooh which suggested that the g c3n4 and biocooh were successfully combined further compared to pure biocooh the peak at 2θ 30 0 shifted to a higher position in all of the nanocomposites which was likely caused by interactions between g c3n4 and biocooh the ir spectra fig 2b elucidated the surface functional groups of the as prepared materials for the g c3n4 biocooh nanocomposite the band at 810 cm 1 originated from external bending vibration of the c n heterocycle 9 16 the wide vibration bands at 1000 1700 cm 1 were attributed to the c n stretching vibrations in the c n heterocycle 48 while the absorption bands between 3100 3400 cm 1 were assigned to the n h and c oh groups 41 the g c3n4 biocooh revealed similar spectra to that of g c3n4 which indicated that the loading of biocooh did not alter the chemical structure of the g c3n4 however the characteristic absorption peak of the coo stretching vibration of biocooh appeared in the spectra which verified the successful synthesis of the g c3n4 biocooh nanocomposites 38 the surface functional groups of the materials were further characterized by raman spectroscopy fig s1 supporting information the characteristic peaks at 406 cm 1 and 1400 1600 cm 1 in the raman spectra were attributed to the c c c n h heterocyclic ring and c n stretching which also confirmed the successful introduction of g c3n4 into biocooh 42 xps was performed to further analyze the elemental arrangement and chemical status of the nanocomposites a survey scan fig 3 a revealed that the surface of the nanocomposite contained bi o c and n the bi spectra fig 3b exhibited two peaks bi7 2 and bi5 2 with binding energies of 158 97 and 164 28 ev in both the biocooh and the nanocomposite which suggested that bismuth was in the bi3 state 34 42 49 the c1s spectra of fig 3c could be divided into two peaks at 284 8 and 288 4 ev which corresponded to c c binding and carboxyl groups respectively 50 the n1s spectra in fig 3d were fitted to three peaks at 398 9 401 2 and 404 4 ev which could be attributed to sp2 hybridized nitrogen in triazine c n c n h and π π excitation respectively 10 28 49 the three peaks in the o1s spectra fig 3e located at 529 7 530 5 and 531 2 ev were attributed to bi o o h and cooh respectively 33 42 51 the bet surface area and pore sizes were measured via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 3f all of the samples were purely at the h3 type hysteresis loop 47 between the higher pressure levels 0 5 0 9 this indicated that the sample possessed a mesoporous structure due to the narrow gap formed by the stacking of the flower like biocooh nanosheets themselves and the g c3n4 nanosheets 52 the specific surface area of 0 5 bc 48 063 m2g 1 table s1 supporting information was significantly larger than that of the biocooh 28 408 m2g 1 and marginally larger than the g c3n4 the total pore volume of the 0 5 bc 0 1005 cm3g 1 was roughly twice that of the biocooh 0 0563 cm3g 1 which indicated that the nanocomposites had the capacity for improved photocatalytic performance by providing additional reaction sites the optical properties of the samples were investigated by uv visible diffuse reflection uv vis drs with the results displayed in fig 4 a it can be seen that the light absorption range of pure biocooh was located in the ultraviolet light region which was consistent with the wide band gap of biocooh 3 46 ev the exhibited absorption edge of g c3n4 was located at 460 nm whereas the absorption edges of the g c3n4 biocooh heterojunctions with different mass ratios were situated between biocooh and g c3n4 in contrast to pure biocooh the composites showed some adsorption in visible light regions fig 4b depicts the band gaps for a semiconductor calculated by the tauc equation 1 α h ν a h ν e g n 2 in eq 1 α is the absorption coefficient h is the planck constant a is the constant eg is the forbidden band width of the semiconductor n is constant and the value of n is 4 for both g c3n4 and biocooh as indirect semiconductors fig 4b was obtained by the plotting of ahν 1 2 versus hν the band gaps of pure g c3n4 biocooh and g c3n4 biocooh composites were obtained by drawing tangent lines from the curves and extending to the x axis accordingly the band gaps of the g c3n4 biocooh and g c3n4 biocooh composites were 2 91 3 46 2 92 0 2 bc 3 0 0 5 bc and 3 01 ev 0 8 bc respectively the separation of photogenerated catalyst carriers was investigated via photoluminescence pl compared with g c3n4 the photoluminescence emission peak intensities of the composites were significantly reduced fig 4c which indicated that the combination of g c3n4 and biocooh facilitated the separation of photogenerated carriers further longer fluorescence lifetimes translated to higher transfer efficiencies the fluorescence lifetime fig 4d of the biocooh g c3n4 0 2 bc 0 5 bc and 0 8 bc were 2 52 6 36 6 84 7 12 and 6 57 ns respectively in addition the fluorescence quantum yields of biocooh g c3n4 0 2 bc 0 5 bc and 0 8 bc were 0 62 4 17 14 25 19 79 and 11 97 respectively fig 4d which also verified the more efficient carrier separation of the nanocomposites 53 3 2 degradation of pollutants the degradation of pollutants was performed using a single photocatalyst and photocatalyst pms system respectively with mg rhb cip and lvf as targeted pollutants as shown in fig 5 a the anion dye mg degraded only by 20 0 within 180 min under led light irradiation without a catalyst the degradation rates over g c3n4 biocooh with different ratios 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 were 95 20 97 71 and 96 34 which were higher than g c3n4 90 08 or biocooh 39 89 which showed that the combination of g c3n4 and biocooh improved the efficacy of the photocatalytic activities and the optimal ratio was 0 5 bc when pms was incorporated into the system fig 5c the degradation of mg significantly increased and complete decomposition was attained in 25 min the degradation rate in the photocatalyst pms system was four fold that of the single photocatalyst system which suggested that the integration of pms was effective in facilitating the degradation of pollutants in another trial rhb was only slightly degraded under led light exposure without a catalyst fig 5b revealing that rhb possessed good stability for all of the g c3n4 biocooh nanocomposites the degradation rate of rhb attained was more than 90 within 20 min which was far higher than that of biocooh 46 2 or g c3n4 70 1 in particular the degradation rate with 0 5 bc achieved 96 6 within 20 min and the first order reaction constant was 0 171 min 1 the degradation of rhb followed the first order reaction fig s2 supporting information the kinetic constant increased to 0 228 min 1 in the 0 5 bc pms system while the first order kinetic constant of rhb with pms was only 0 009 min 1 under led irradiation indicating a synergistic effect between the photocatalyst and pms generally the addition of pms improved the separation of photogenerated carriers by reacting with electrons while promoting the generation of active species e g o2 1o2 oh and so4 etc 54 in order to exclude the influence of dye sensitization the degradation experiments were carried out using antibiotics cip and lvf as model pollutants as shown in fig 5d the degradation of cip without catalyst was negligible within 120 min under the led light irradiation in the single pms or 0 5 bc photocatalytic system the degradation rates of cip were 30 5 or 27 3 respectively whereas in the 0 5 bc pms system the degradation rate reached 72 1 within 120 minutes similarly for lvf fig 5f the decomposition rates were 0 11 28 01 59 08 and 86 15 within 120 min for without catalyst pms 0 5 bc and 0 5 bc pms systems respectively under the led light irradiation the results of cip and lvf decomposition also verified the synergetic effect in the photocatalysis pms system although the effective degradation of the pollutants was obtained which can be directly observed through uv vis absorption spectra fig s3 supporting information the mineralization of the pollutants was unclear herein toc detection was carried out with the results displayed in fig s4 supporting information it can be seen that the mineralization rates of rhb or mg were far more behind the relevant degradation rates which suggested the extension of the reaction process is required to transform the organic pollutants into inorganic compounds further we studied the impacts of the quantity of pms on the activities of the system fig 5f within a certain range when the amount of pms was increased from zero to 0 03 mm the kinetic degradation constant of rhb was gradually elevated from 0 171 to 0 228 min 1 however when the dosage of pms continued to increase to 0 04 mm the kinetic constant was almost unchanged as a result we selected 0 03 mm pms as the optimal quantity in the photocatalysis pms system to investigate the stability of the g c3n4 biocooh pms system repeated experiments were conducted under identical conditions with the results shown in fig 5g at 25 min of led exposure the degradation efficiency of rhb still attained 97 6 after four cycles which indicated that the photocatalyst pms system possessed high stability for the degradation of contaminants the xrd detection of the nanocomposites prior to and following the reactions were carried out to explore the structural stability of the as prepared samples with the results suggesting that they were quite stable and promising for recyclability in practice fig 5h 3 3 elucidation of mechanism 3 3 1 chemical detection of various ros to explore the reactive oxygen species ros in the photocatalyst pms system free radical trapping experiments were conducted using p benzoquinone bq l histidine l ii ammonium oxalate ao and tertiary butanol tba as trapping agents for o2 1o2 h and oh 51 54 56 respectively for comparison methanol meoh was applied to capture both oh and so4 in the photocatalyst pms system 9 57 59 the degradation of mg was slightly inhibited with the addition of ao and tba fig 6 a and the inhibition rates were 10 17 and 12 45 respectively which suggested that the contributions of h and oh radials were limited in the photocatalysis pms system fig 6b the inhibition rates were 8 44 11 79 and 16 94 with the addition of ao tba and meoh respectively it was observed that the inhibition rate with meoh was significantly higher than that of tba which indicated that some so4 was formed in the photocatalyst pms system meoh could trap both oh and so4 radicals conversely the bq and l ii had significant effects on the degradation of mg in the photocatalyst system where the inhibition rates attained were 59 89 and 50 17 respectively which indicated that o2 and 1o2 played key roles in the degradation of mg in the photocatalyst system for the photocatalyst pms system the inhibition rates with the addition of bq and l ii attained 41 87 and 64 91 respectively the increased inhibition with l ii suggested that additional 1o2 was generated in the photocatalyst pms system for the cation dye rhb trial figs 6c 6d similar results were obtained the importance of the ros was presented in the order of o2 1o2 h oh in the single photocatalyst system however in the photocatalyst pms system the role of 1o2 was increased additional 1o2 was generated due to the integration of pms and the order was changed to 1o2 o2 h so4 oh in summary the main ros were o2 1o2 h and oh in the photocatalysis system while in the photocatalysis pms system so4 radicals and more 1o2 were generated among these o2 and 1o2 were the dominant radicals that played the most significant roles in the photocatalyst and photocatalyst pms systems respectively 60 to further verify the reactive radicals involved in the g c3n4 biocooh pms system esr detection was conducted using dmpo and temp as trapping agents 61 63 as shown in fig 7 for g c3n4 biocooh pms there was a weak temp 1o2 signal in darkness and no obvious dmpo o2 dmpo oh and dmpo so4 signals were observed under light exposure intensive dmpo o2 dmpo oh and dmpo so4 signals were observed and increased along with exposure duration and the signals of temp 1o2 were significantly enhanced compared to that in the dark which demonstrated that o2 1o2 oh and so4 were generated in the g c3n4 biocooh pms system which accelerated the degradation of pollutants 3 3 2 potential photocatalytic mechanism based on the experimental results the potential catalytic mechanisms of the photocatalyst and photocatalyst pms systems were proposed as g c3n4 was a p type semiconductor and biocooh was an n type semiconductor a p n heterojunction might be formed at the interface 24 41 for the single photocatalyst system fig 8 a the g c3n4 was excited under led light irradiation and generated electrons e and holes h in the cb and vb eg 2 respectively since the cb position of the g c3n4 was higher than that of the biocooh the electrons could be transferred to the cb of the biocooh thus the recombination rate of electron holes was suppressed and the adsorbed o2 on the surface was converted to o2 e o2 o2 0 33 ev by capturing the electrons eg 3 48 64 further o2 radicals can react with h2o to form 1o2 eg 4 65 67 simultaneously the holes remaining in the vb of the g c3n4 evb 1 6 ev may directly react with pollutants this is because the vb of the g c3n4 was 1 66 ev which was lower than the redox potential of oh oh 1 99 ev therefore the holes could not oxidize oh to produce oh 9 further the oh in the photocatalyst system could be generated by o2 eg 5 in the photocatalyst pms system fig 8b the electrons transferred onto the cb band of the biocooh could also be captured by pms to form sulfate e hso5 so4 1 75 ev 67 eg 6 and 1o2 was generated through the decomposition of pms eg 7 68 in addition oh could be produced not only from the o2 eg 5 but also through the reaction of h2o and so4 eg 8 in summary o2 1o2 h so4 and oh were the active species that degraded the organic dyes to small molecular compounds eg 9 2 g c3n4 biocooh hν e h 3 o2 e o2 4 o2 h2o h 1o2 h2o2 5 o2 h oh 6 e hso5 so4 oh 7 hso5 so5 2 so4 2 hso4 1o2 8 so4 h2o oh so4 2 h 9 organic dye o2 1o2 so4 oh small molecules 4 conclusion to summarize an efficient photocatalyst pms nanocomposite system was developed using g c3n4 biocooh heterojunction photocatalysts and applied to the degradation of organic pollutants the pollutant degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst pms system was much higher than that of a single photocatalyst system which suggested that the incorporation of pms was an effective strategy for improving photocatalytic activities further the photocatalyst pms system demonstrated very stable and repeatable performance for the degradation the model pollutants due to the structural stability of g c3n4 biocooh in recycling experiments which supported the potential application of the g c3n4 biocooh pms system in practice however the efficient recovery of the photocatalysts may prove to be challenging in real world applications declaration of competing interest

the prepared g c3n4 biocooh nanocomposites were systematically characterized in contrast to pure g c3n4 or biocooh the photocatalytic activities of the nanocomposites were enhanced due to the formation of g c3n4 biocooh heterojunctions extensive specific surface areas and more efficient charge separation the degradation of rhb mg cip and lvf was further improved in this g c3n4 biocooh pms

these synergetic mechanisms indicated that o2 and 1o2 were the most significant reactive oxygen species in the single photocatalysis system whereas in the photocatalyst pms system additional 1o2 was generated due to the addition of pms and became the dominant species this research suggests that the combination of photocatalysts and pms is a feasible strategy for improving the pollutant removal activities of photocatalysts which have strong potential for myriad applications in environmental remediation keywords photocatalysis biocooh g c3n4 peroxymonosulfate superoxide radicals 1 introduction photocatalyst technologies have been extensively applied in many areas including the environment energy health care and more 1 6 however there is still much room for improvement particularly for the degradation of refractory pollutants the combination of photocatalysts with advanced oxidation techniques such as ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fenton reagents persulfate s2o8 2 and peroxymonosulfate pms 7 have demonstrated outstanding efficacy toward improving the decomposition of contaminants among these pms is distinguished due to its non toxicity chemical stability low cost and easy transport and storage 8 pms serves as an electron acceptor in photocatalyst pms systems to capture photogenerated electrons in the conduction band thus inhibiting the recombination of electron hole pairs moreover pms also generates so4 free radicals that have robust oxidizing properties e0 2 5 3 1 ev with the capacity to decompose most pollutants consequently the degradation efficiencies of photocatalyst pms systems are greatly improved due to their synergistic activities previous reports have described numerous composite materials which were selected to combine with pms for the degradation of pollutants for example the degradation efficiency of an agtcm ucn pms system was approximately two fold higher that of an agtcm ucn system under visible light irradiation 9 the first order kinetic constant for the degradation of bpa was increased 16 21 times following the combination of a wo3 mos2 ag photocatalyst with pms 10 in recent years graphite like carbon nitride g c3n4 has garnered significant attention from researchers due to its low cost earth abundance and suitable band gap 2 7 ev with unique optical and electronic properties it has been applied in various fields including water splitting co2 reduction pollutant degradation and biomedical applications 11 12 among these the application of g c3n4 in environmental remediation as a robust photocatalyst was preferred 13 however several limitations still need to be resolved such as a low specific surface area poor photonic response and the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs multiple techniques have been developed to overcome these drawbacks for instance the morphology of g c3n4 can be altered through the use of ultrathin nanosheets 14 nanorods 15 quantum dots 16 etc to increase its specific surface area thus improving its photocatalytic performance for the degradation of pollutants and hydrogen evolution further the synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites has been proven to be an effective strategy for decreasing electron hole recombination and modulation of optical properties several metals e g ag au pt pd and ni 17 20 inorganic semiconductors e g tio2 21 zno 22 and bismuth semiconductors 23 27 as well as c based materials e g carbon nanotubes cnts 28 29 graphene oxides go 30 fullerenes c60 31 and carbon nanofibers 32 have been selected for combining with g c3n4 these hybrid materials exhibited enhanced absorbance in the visible light region and stronger capacities for the decomposition of organic pollutants and water splitting among the bi based semiconductors much more attention has been paid to biox x cl br i 33 35 materials due to their layered bi2o2 2 structure which is favorable for light absorption further biocooh possesses a zigzag structure wherein acidic groups are arranged as polymer chains which can effectively absorb photons in addition the basic composition of biocooh no sulfur halogen or other substances implies an excellent photocatalytic candidate that generates no secondary pollution however biocooh is responsive only to uv light due to its wide band gap which severely limits its utilization of light to enable the functionality of biocooh under visible light while improving its photocatalytic activities various combined or elemental doping materials have been synthesized e g silver halide biocooh 36

coupled with pms have rarely been reported in this study for the first time g c3n4 biocooh heterojunction photocatalysts were synthesized and combined with pms technology to develop a hybrid photocatalyst pms system the photocatalytic activities of the g c3n4 biocooh heterojunctions and the improved degradation capabilities of the g c3n4 biocooh pms system were systematically investigated through the degradation of dyes e g an anion dye mg and a cationic dye rhb and antibiotics ciprofloxacin hydrochloride cip and levofloxacin hydrochloride lvf the results revealed that the formation of heterojunctions significantly inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs thus improving the photocatalytic activities the incorporation of pms generated so4 free radicals and additional 1o2 further enhanced the degradation of the dyes and antibiotics subsequently a potential synergistic mechanism was proposed and the stability of the photocatalysis pms system was evaluated

temperature the samples were rinsed with water ethanol three times and dried at 60 c overnight 2 4 synthesis of g c3n4 biocooh composites concisely 50 mg g c3n4 nanosheets and a certain amount of biocooh were ultrasonically dispersed into a mixture of 20 ml ethanol and 10 ml ultrapure water for 30 min next the suspension was placed into a tube furnace and heated at 180 c for 3 h cooled naturally to room temperature and wash up with ultrapure water three times afterwards the composites were dried at 60 c overnight the mass ratios of biocooh to g c3n4 were 0 2 1 0 5 1 and 0 8 1 respectively and designated as 0 2 bc 0 5 bc and 0 8 bc 2 5 characterization methods the crystalline structures of the as prepared materials were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd using a bruker

jeol jsm 6390lv japan and jeol jem 2100 f japan respectively the spatial elemental distribution was investigated by eds a component of the sem instrument brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas were detected on the basis of nitrogen adsorption isotherms using a micromeritics asap 2020 apparatus usa the chemical states and atomic surface elements were measured using a xsam 800 uk x ray photoelectron spectrophotometer xps all binding energies were calibrated by taking the c1s peak as a reference at 284 6 ev of contaminant carbon infrared absorption spectra were recorded using an

pollutant degradation briefly in a multi channel photocatalytic reactor with a 5 w led λ 390 nm light 15 mg of the as prepared materials were added into 50 ml quartz bottles which contained malachite green mg 10 mg l 1 rhodamine b rhb 6 mg l 1 ciprofloxacin cip 10 mg l 1 or levofloxacin hydrochloride lvf 10 mg l 1 the suspensions were magnetically stirred in darkness for 30 min to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium after which a certain amount of pms was added to the suspensions simultaneously with the onset of light exposure during irradiation 3 ml volumes of the suspension were extracted at certain intervals and immediately mixed with methanol to quench any residual pms prior to being centrifuged for 10 min the supernatants were analyzed using an uv 2900 spectrophotometer at 618 554 275 or 289 nm wavelengths for mg rhb cip or lvf respectively the degradation efficiency was calculated as follows η c 0 c t c 0 100 where η is the degradation rate c0 is the absorbance of the original mg rhb cip or lvf solution following adsorption and ct is the concentration at a certain time interval during the reaction following led light exposure 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization analysis the morphology of the as prepared materials was observed via sem and hrtem with the images displayed in fig 1 the pure biocooh fig 1a exhibited a flower like structure with a diameter of 2 μm which was comprised of irregular nanosheets the bright rings in the selected area diffraction ring image saed fig 1a inset suggested the polycrystalline structure of biocooh the g c3n4 fig 1b consisted of thin flakes with thicknesses of 20 nm which contained with many voids no crystal diffraction ring was observed in the saed image fig 1b inset which indicated the amorphous structure of g c3n4 for the nanocomposites the flower bone was reserved and several g c3n4 flakes were attached to the petals fig 1c d the luminance of the crystal diffraction rings in the saed image fig 1c inset was weakened due to the introduction of amorphous g c3n4 the lattice fringes of the biocooh in the nanocomposites could be clearly observed in the hrtem image fig 1e where the lattice distances of biocooh 0 356 nm and 0 275 nm corresponded to the 102 and 110 facets of biocooh respectively fig 1e reveals that the g c3n4 was comprised of amorphous nanosheets which was corresponded to the saed results shown in fig 1b 46 the eds and elemental mapping fig 1f insert suggested that the surfaces of the 0 5 bc nanocomposite consisted of bi o c and n as can be seen in the xrd patterns fig 2 a the primary peaks of g c3n4 nanosheets at 2θ 12 8 and 27 6 were indexed to the 001 and 002 crystal planes jcpds 87 1526 47 the peaks of biocooh at 24 1 30 0 32 8 42 2 46 9 53 3 and 56 7 were correlated with 101 102 110 113 200 211 and 212 crystal planes jcpds no 35 0939 respectively most of the diffraction peaks of the g c3n4 biocooh composites were consistent with those of pure biocooh 48 49 moreover the diffraction peak at 2θ 27 6 which belonged to the 002 crystal plane of g c3n4 was observed in all of the nanocomposites where its intensity gradually decreased along with the quantity of biocooh which suggested that the g c3n4 and biocooh were successfully combined further compared to pure biocooh the peak at 2θ 30 0 shifted to a higher position in all of the nanocomposites which was likely caused by interactions between g c3n4 and biocooh the ir spectra fig 2b elucidated the surface functional groups of the as prepared materials for the g c3n4 biocooh nanocomposite the band at 810 cm 1 originated from external bending vibration of the c n heterocycle 9 16 the wide vibration bands at 1000 1700 cm 1 were attributed to the c n stretching vibrations in the c n heterocycle 48 while the absorption bands between 3100 3400 cm 1 were assigned to the n h and c oh groups 41 the g c3n4 biocooh revealed similar spectra to that of g c3n4 which indicated that the loading of biocooh did not alter the chemical structure of the g c3n4 however the characteristic absorption peak of the coo stretching vibration of biocooh appeared in the spectra which verified the successful synthesis of the g c3n4 biocooh nanocomposites 38 the surface functional groups of the materials were further characterized by raman spectroscopy fig s1 supporting information the characteristic peaks at 406 cm 1 and 1400 1600 cm 1 in the raman spectra were attributed to the c c c n h heterocyclic ring and c n stretching which also confirmed the successful introduction of g c3n4 into biocooh 42 xps was performed to further analyze the elemental arrangement and chemical status of the nanocomposites a survey scan fig 3 a revealed that the surface of the nanocomposite contained bi o c and n the bi spectra fig 3b exhibited two peaks bi7 2 and bi5 2 with binding energies of 158 97 and 164 28 ev in both the biocooh and the nanocomposite which suggested that bismuth was in the bi3 state 34 42 49 the c1s spectra of fig 3c could be divided into two peaks at 284 8 and 288 4 ev which corresponded to c c binding and carboxyl groups respectively 50 the n1s spectra in fig 3d were fitted to three peaks at 398 9 401 2 and 404 4 ev which could be attributed to sp2 hybridized nitrogen in triazine c n c n h and π π excitation respectively 10 28 49 the three peaks in the o1s spectra fig 3e located at 529 7 530 5 and 531 2 ev were attributed to bi o o h and cooh respectively 33 42 51 the bet surface area and pore sizes were measured via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 3f all of the samples were purely at the h3 type hysteresis loop 47 between the higher pressure levels 0 5 0 9 this indicated that the sample possessed a mesoporous structure due to the narrow gap formed by the stacking of the flower like biocooh nanosheets themselves and the g c3n4 nanosheets 52 the specific surface area of 0 5 bc 48 063 m2g 1 table s1 supporting information was significantly larger than that of the biocooh 28 408 m2g 1 and marginally larger than the g c3n4 the total pore volume of the 0 5 bc 0 1005 cm3g 1 was roughly twice that of the biocooh 0 0563 cm3g 1 which indicated that the nanocomposites had the capacity for improved photocatalytic performance by providing additional reaction sites the optical properties of the samples were investigated by uv visible diffuse reflection uv vis drs with the results displayed in fig 4 a it can be seen that the light absorption range of pure biocooh was located in the ultraviolet light region which was consistent with the wide band gap of biocooh 3 46 ev the exhibited absorption edge of g c3n4 was located at 460 nm whereas the absorption edges of the g c3n4 biocooh heterojunctions with different mass ratios were situated between biocooh and g c3n4 in contrast to pure biocooh the composites showed some adsorption in visible light regions fig 4b depicts the band gaps for a semiconductor calculated by the tauc equation 1 α h ν a h ν e g n 2 in eq 1 α is the absorption coefficient h is the planck constant a is the constant eg is the forbidden band width of the semiconductor n is constant and the value of n is 4 for both g c3n4 and biocooh as indirect semiconductors fig 4b was obtained by the plotting of ahν 1 2 versus hν the band gaps of pure g c3n4 biocooh and g c3n4 biocooh composites were obtained by drawing tangent lines from the curves and extending to the x axis accordingly the band gaps of the g c3n4 biocooh and g c3n4 biocooh composites were 2 91 3 46 2 92 0 2 bc 3 0 0 5 bc and 3 01 ev 0 8 bc respectively the separation of photogenerated catalyst carriers was investigated via photoluminescence pl compared with g c3n4 the photoluminescence emission peak intensities of the composites were significantly reduced fig 4c which indicated that the combination of g c3n4 and biocooh facilitated the separation of photogenerated carriers further longer fluorescence lifetimes translated to higher transfer efficiencies the fluorescence lifetime fig 4d of the biocooh g c3n4 0 2 bc 0 5 bc and 0 8 bc were 2 52 6 36 6 84 7 12 and 6 57 ns respectively in addition the fluorescence quantum yields of biocooh g c3n4 0 2 bc 0 5 bc and 0 8 bc were 0 62 4 17 14 25 19 79 and 11 97 respectively fig 4d which also verified the more efficient carrier separation of the nanocomposites 53 3 2 degradation of pollutants the degradation of pollutants was performed using a single photocatalyst and photocatalyst pms system respectively with mg rhb cip and lvf as targeted pollutants as shown in fig 5 a the anion dye mg degraded only by 20 0 within 180 min under led light irradiation without a catalyst the degradation rates over g c3n4 biocooh with different ratios 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 were 95 20 97 71 and 96 34 which were higher than g c3n4 90 08 or biocooh 39 89 which showed that the combination of g c3n4 and biocooh improved the efficacy of the photocatalytic activities and the optimal ratio was 0 5 bc when pms was incorporated into the system fig 5c the degradation of mg significantly increased and complete decomposition was attained in 25 min the degradation rate in the photocatalyst pms system was four fold that of the single photocatalyst system which suggested that the integration of pms was effective in facilitating the degradation of pollutants in another trial rhb was only slightly degraded under led light exposure without a catalyst fig 5b revealing that rhb possessed good stability for all of the g c3n4 biocooh nanocomposites the degradation rate of rhb attained was more than 90 within 20 min which was far higher than that of biocooh 46 2 or g c3n4 70 1 in particular the degradation rate with 0 5 bc achieved 96 6 within 20 min and the first order reaction constant was 0 171 min 1 the degradation of rhb followed the first order reaction fig s2 supporting information the kinetic constant increased to 0 228 min 1 in the 0 5 bc pms system while the first order kinetic constant of rhb with pms was only 0 009 min 1 under led irradiation indicating a synergistic effect between the photocatalyst and pms generally the addition of pms improved the separation of photogenerated carriers by reacting with electrons while promoting the generation of active species e g o2 1o2 oh and so4 etc 54 in order to exclude the influence of dye sensitization the degradation experiments were carried out using antibiotics cip and lvf as model pollutants as shown in fig 5d the degradation of cip without catalyst was negligible within 120 min under the led light irradiation in the single pms or 0 5 bc photocatalytic system the degradation rates of cip were 30 5 or 27 3 respectively whereas in the 0 5 bc pms system the degradation rate reached 72 1 within 120 minutes similarly for lvf fig 5f the decomposition rates were 0 11 28 01 59 08 and 86 15 within 120 min for without catalyst pms 0 5 bc and 0 5 bc pms systems respectively under the led light irradiation the results of cip and lvf decomposition also verified the synergetic effect in the photocatalysis pms system although the effective degradation of the pollutants was obtained which can be directly observed through uv vis absorption spectra fig s3 supporting information the mineralization of the pollutants was unclear herein toc detection was carried out with the results displayed in fig s4 supporting information it can be seen that the mineralization rates of rhb or mg were far more behind the relevant degradation rates which suggested the extension of the reaction process is required to transform the organic pollutants into inorganic compounds further we studied the impacts of the quantity of pms on the activities of the system fig 5f within a certain range when the amount of pms was increased from zero to 0 03 mm the kinetic degradation constant of rhb was gradually elevated from 0 171 to 0 228 min 1 however when the dosage of pms continued to increase to 0 04 mm the kinetic constant was almost unchanged as a result we selected 0 03 mm pms as the optimal quantity in the photocatalysis pms system to investigate the stability of the g c3n4 biocooh pms system repeated experiments were conducted under identical conditions with the results shown in fig 5g at 25 min of led exposure the degradation efficiency of rhb still attained 97 6 after four cycles which indicated that the photocatalyst pms system possessed high stability for the degradation of contaminants the xrd detection of the nanocomposites prior to and following the reactions were carried out to explore the structural stability of the as prepared samples with the results suggesting that they were quite stable and promising for recyclability in practice fig 5h 3 3 elucidation of mechanism 3 3 1 chemical detection of various ros to explore the reactive oxygen species ros in the photocatalyst pms system free radical trapping experiments were conducted using p benzoquinone bq l histidine l ii ammonium oxalate ao and tertiary butanol tba as trapping agents for o2 1o2 h and oh 51 54 56 respectively for comparison methanol meoh was applied to capture both oh and so4 in the photocatalyst pms system 9 57 59 the degradation of mg was slightly inhibited with the addition of ao and tba fig 6 a and the inhibition rates were 10 17 and 12 45 respectively which suggested that the contributions of h and oh radials were limited in the photocatalysis pms system fig 6b the inhibition rates were 8 44 11 79 and 16 94 with the addition of ao tba and meoh respectively it was observed that the inhibition rate with meoh was significantly higher than that of tba which indicated that some so4 was formed in the photocatalyst pms system meoh could trap both oh and so4 radicals conversely the bq and l ii had significant effects on the degradation of mg in the photocatalyst system where the inhibition rates attained were 59 89 and 50 17 respectively which indicated that o2 and 1o2 played key roles in the degradation of mg in the photocatalyst system for the photocatalyst pms system the inhibition rates with the addition of bq and l ii attained 41 87 and 64 91 respectively the increased inhibition with l ii suggested that additional 1o2 was generated in the photocatalyst pms system for the cation dye rhb trial figs 6c 6d similar results were obtained the importance of the ros was presented in the order of o2 1o2 h oh in the single photocatalyst system however in the photocatalyst pms system the role of 1o2 was increased additional 1o2 was generated due to the integration of pms and the order was changed to 1o2 o2 h so4 oh in summary the main ros were o2 1o2 h and oh in the photocatalysis system while in the photocatalysis pms system so4 radicals and more 1o2 were generated among these o2 and 1o2 were the dominant radicals that played the most significant roles in the photocatalyst and photocatalyst pms systems respectively 60 to further verify the reactive radicals involved in the g c3n4 biocooh pms system esr detection was conducted using dmpo and temp as trapping agents 61 63 as shown in fig 7 for g c3n4 biocooh pms there was a weak temp 1o2 signal in darkness and no obvious dmpo o2 dmpo oh and dmpo so4 signals were observed under light exposure intensive dmpo o2 dmpo oh and dmpo so4 signals were observed and increased along with exposure duration and the signals of temp 1o2 were significantly enhanced compared to that in the dark which demonstrated that o2 1o2 oh and so4 were generated in the g c3n4 biocooh pms system which accelerated the degradation of pollutants 3 3 2 potential photocatalytic mechanism based on the experimental results the potential catalytic mechanisms of the photocatalyst and photocatalyst pms systems were proposed as g c3n4 was a p type semiconductor and biocooh was an n type semiconductor a p n heterojunction might be formed at the interface 24 41 for the single photocatalyst system fig 8 a the g c3n4 was excited under led light irradiation and generated electrons e and holes h in the cb and vb eg 2 respectively since the cb position of the g c3n4 was higher than that of the biocooh the electrons could be transferred to the cb of the biocooh thus the recombination rate of electron holes was suppressed and the adsorbed o2 on the surface was converted to o2 e o2 o2 0 33 ev by capturing the electrons eg 3 48 64 further o2 radicals can react with h2o to form 1o2 eg 4 65 67 simultaneously the holes remaining in the vb of the g c3n4 evb 1 6 ev may directly react with pollutants this is because the vb of the g c3n4 was 1 66 ev which was lower than the redox potential of oh oh 1 99 ev therefore the holes could not oxidize oh to produce oh 9 further the oh in the photocatalyst system could be generated by o2 eg 5 in the photocatalyst pms system fig 8b the electrons transferred onto the cb band of the biocooh could also be captured by pms to form sulfate e hso5 so4 1 75 ev 67 eg 6 and 1o2 was generated through the decomposition of pms eg 7 68 in addition oh could be produced not only from the o2 eg 5 but also through the reaction of h2o and so4 eg 8 in summary o2 1o2 h so4 and oh were the active species that degraded the organic dyes to small molecular compounds eg 9 2 g c3n4 biocooh hν e h 3 o2 e o2 4 o2 h2o h 1o2 h2o2 5 o2 h oh 6 e hso5 so4 oh 7 hso5 so5 2 so4 2 hso4 1o2 8 so4 h2o oh so4 2 h 9 organic dye o2 1o2 so4 oh small molecules 4 conclusion to summarize an efficient photocatalyst pms nanocomposite system was developed using g c3n4 biocooh heterojunction photocatalysts and applied to the degradation of organic pollutants the pollutant degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst pms system was much higher than that of a single photocatalyst system which suggested that the incorporation of pms was an effective strategy for improving photocatalytic activities further the photocatalyst pms system demonstrated very stable and repeatable performance for the degradation the model pollutants due to the structural stability of g c3n4 biocooh in recycling experiments which supported the potential application of the g c3n4 biocooh pms system in practice however the efficient recovery of the photocatalysts may prove to be challenging in real world applications declaration of competing interest

13796,nitrogen levels in landfill leachate ll could potentially pollute water bodies and surrounding groundwater when discharged untreated against this backdrop pollutant removal from leachate generated at landfill sites is essential however a cost efficient approach which could concurrently remove various pollutants within ll via single stage approach and under microaerobic conditions has not been fully explored in this study single stage nitrogen removal using anammox and partial nitritation snap process was proposed and employed to treat ll under microaerobic condition in an upflow sludge blanket when reactor dissolved oxygen do of 0 2 mg l was implemented along with nitrogen loading rate nlr ranging 0 31 1 84 kg m3 d 99 5 nh4 n 94 3 tn and 31 04 chemical oxygen demand cod removals was concurrently achieved conversely when do was elevated to 0 6 mg l nitrogen removal was curtailed to 20 no2 n accumulation reached 98 68 indicating inhibition of anammox bacterial amxb activities 16s rrna high throughput gene sequencing revealed ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas and sphingomonas amxb candidatus kuenenia heterotrophic denitrifiers hdb comamonas dechloromonas and cod degrading bacteria bellilinea ignavibacterium as the dominant genera which coordinated synergistic activities to establish the snap process and led to the single stage pollutants removal from the ll sludge morphological revealed by sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy indicated that reactor sludge comprised of granulated sludge and was noticeably embedded in extracellular polymeric substances eps an indication of a defense mechanism initiated by microbes against heavy metals toxicity the snap process demonstrated a promising cost efficient simultaneous nitrogen and carbon removal from ll keywords partial nitritation anammox process microbial community dynamics landfill leachate oxygen limited condition 1 introduction landfills have often been proposed for the disposal of municipal solid waste msw across the world 1 2 although the technology landfills could achieve remarkable success the aftermath effect including by products from the technology could adversely impact profoundly on water bodies groundwater and land table s1 in the supplementary file thus landfilling technique generates a considerable volume of leachate which contains high concentrations of nh4 n refractory chemical oxygen demand codr biodegradable chemical oxygen demand codb heavy metals humic acids and suspended solids 3 4 one of the notable characteristics of landfill leachate ll is its drastic reduction of biodegradable organics but elevated nh4 n concentration as they mature with time this observable phenomenon of mature ll often leads to a gradual reduction in the carbon nitrogen c n ratio 5 against this backdrop employing conventional nitrification denitrification process to remove nitrogen and organics from ll having a low c n ratio possess significant challenges until sufficient dissolved oxygen do and external carbon resources are supplied to the responsible nitrifiers and denitrifiers respectively 6 however supplying external organic carbon resources and providing the necessary required concentration of do via mechanical aeration to the biological process employed often elevates the operational cost of the treatment process 7 therefore the need to select an effective and a cost efficient process that could effectively treat ll at a reduced cost is the essential factor during the planning of ll treatment in recent years coupling partial nitritation p n to anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a process in either single stage or two stage configuration for autotrophic nitrogen removal is gaining significant attention in that p n a process 1 saves cost on aeration eqs 1 2 requires no external carbon supplies to reach its full potential in the nitrogen conversion and removal process eq 2 8 3 reduces co2 emission 4 lessens biomass yield significantly and 5 performs nitrogen removal via autotrophic denitrification pathways by the anammox bacteria anb 1 nh 4 1 5o 2 2hco 3 no 2 2co 2 3h 2 o 2

of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob within the mixed consortium which mostly comprises of ammonium oxidation bacteria aob anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria amxb and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb ideally aob has a higher affinity or lower affinity constant ks for oxygen as opposed to nob this implies that aob can grow in limited do environments in contrast nob is inhibited or washed out under that same condition allowing sufficient no2 n for amxb within the p n a process 9 the latter assertion suggests that excessive do supply is the main reason behind the promotion of nob activities and consequent no3 accumulation in p n a systems therefore limiting the do levels within the environments of these two microbes aob and nob is one excellent approach for achieving nob out selection 10 besides nob growth that tends to be a major challenge faced by the p n a process autotrophic amxb is often considerably inhibited by certain levels of biodegradable organics contained in nitrogenous rich wastewater this occurrence is mainly caused by heterotrophic a bacterium that out competes anammox bacteria in the quest for nitrite the latter suggests that single stage carbon oxidation partial nitritation heterotrophic autotrophic denitrification process based on the combined activities of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria will be appropriate while cost has always ranked top among factors that require extensive consideration in the selection of a treatment process single stage nitrogen removal using anammox and partial nitritation snap process is a sure way to reducing nitrogen removal cost as opposed to the two stage carbon oxidation partial nitritation denitrification and anammox t nap this argument is justified based on the lessened number of bioreactors and space required for installation for a snap process 8 although snap process has somehow been explored a few times there exist some knowledge gaps that have not yet been explicitly reported for instance no consensus has been established on the optimum or exact do levels that could ensure maximum efficiency in treating nitrogen rich wastewater 8 11 13 also the feasibility of employing a microaerobic condition to achieve a cost efficient snap process during treatment of ll has not yet been reported again no work has been done investigating the effects of various microaerobic conditions on a snap process efficiency its related microbial community structure morphology and extracellular polymeric substances eps therefore an extensive study to address these research gaps would be beneficial to identify control strategies help exploit the full potential of snap process and possibly promotes its commercial implementation another justification for proposing a snap process over conventional nitrification and denitrification process is that nh4 n removal via anammox process is considered autotrophic which yields no3 n 16 26 of nitrogen removed as a by product from the biochemical reaction steered by amxb eq 2 to elevate total nitrogen removal efficiency in amxb based reactors some researchers supported denitrification dn and total nitrogen tn removal process by dosing the system with external organic carbon to remove the no3 n which is a by product of the amxb 14 however when organic carbon dosed in the reactor is high heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb will exploit the carbon resources for growth and subsequently fall on the available no2 n due to their strong affinity for oxygen 15 in such scenarios amxb for the autotrophic nitrogen removal process within the p n a system will not have enough substrate for growth 16 therefore the effects of cod and various do levels on a snap process efficiency and its microbial communities are worth studying to ascertain possibilities of accommodating additional services from hdb in the nitrogen removal and nob out selection processes as indicated earlier despite previous studies the pool of knowledge to tap on ideas for the commercial application of the snap process for the treatment of ll is relatively insufficient consequently deeper investigation on the effects of microaerobic conditions and cod on the snap process efficiency as well as the microbial communities could help gain comprehensive insights for optimizing operational strategies of the snap process and microbial community structures again the possibility of a snap process to restore or recover from an adverse effect imposed by high do has also not been investigated and this cast many doubts as to how a deteriorated snap process could recover its removal efficiency to the best of our knowledge no studies have reported on the effects of various microaerobic conditions as well as cod on the snap process treating ll in this study the effect of various microaerobic conditions within snap system treating ll in an upflow sludge blanket reactor was investigated the specific objective of this study includes 1 to assess the optimum microaerobic condition with the tendency to simultaneously promote activities of aob amxb hdb and out select nob in one stage 2 to investigate the influence of biodegradable organics on the activities of autotrophic amxb 3 to investigate the response of microbial community diversity to various microaerobic conditions and cod concentration using 16s rrna gene sequencing 4 to establish possible restoration of removal efficiency when a snap process is deteriorated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sourcing and characterization of landfill leachate the ll was

in the usb 3 1 1 nitrogen and organics removal from ll the proposed snap process conducted in a packed bed usb reactor for nitrogen and organics removal from ll was evaluated on daily bases fig 2 as presented in table 1 the usb reactor was operated for 146 days under four different stages stages i ii iii and iv the four delineated operational stages comprised of unique do but constant hydraulic retention time hrt during the operation of the usb nlr at each stage ranging 0 31 1 84 kgtn m3 d was introduced progressively by increasing or decreasing influent nh4 concentration 200 to 1000 mg l in stage i day 1 32 of the usb operation where reactor internal do of 0 2 mg l was maintained along with a stepwise increase of nlr from 0 31 1 82 kgtn m3 d minimum removal rate in terms of nh4 n tn nox no2 n and no3 n and codb were observed and recorded fig 2 with an average influent nlr of 0 35 kg n m3 d introduced during the first ten days day 1 10 of the usb operation nh4 n and tn removal fluctuated significantly however removal efficiency could still reach 46 15 and 38 36 respectively the phenomenal observation made within the first 10 days suggested that microbes had not adapted sufficiently to the do conditions or the likelihood of shock loading effect due to elevated nlr however after full acclimatization of the inoculum to the environment and operational conditions nh4 n and tn removal was much satisfactory during the steady state thus nh4 n fig 2a and tn fig 2b removals recorded by the end of the steady state of stage i day 27 day 32 averaged 89 6 and 84 8 respectively the remarkable performance witnessed in stage i implied that do of 0 2 mg l was suitable and promoted the activities of both amxb and aob but inhibited nob it was also evident in stage i that nitrite no2 n accumulation was continuously stable as concentration in the effluent nox was 3 mg l fig 2c conversely no3 n accumulation which continuously fluctuated in stage i was relatively higher during the steady state performance fig 2c notably no3 n concentration reached 23 1 mg l with a corresponding nitrate accumulation ratio of about 90 during the steady period this observation indicated that nitrogen removal process in stage i was partly steered by anammox activities the overall nitrogen removal performance demonstrated in stage i was an indication that the snap process could efficiently treat ll without threat of no3 n accumulation as often seen other traditional nitrogen removal systems it has been established that biodegradable cod could adversely affect the performance of autotrophic microorganisms responsible within the snap process the latter assertion is highly feasible in that 1 hdb will compete with aob for do which will subsequently lead to lagged pn process and high energy consumption via oxygen control and 2 availability of cod could promote hdb to consume no2 n and subsequently inhibit amxb growth whiles performing for autotrophic denitrification 24 for instance in a study conducted by vilar and coworkers it was discussed that the performance of aobs during partial nitritation on ll having biodegradable cod was unsatisfactory this corroborated with the earlier assertion in that the presence of cod in the wastewater might had affect the efficiency of pn process 25 in another report it was further mentioned that when c n was 0 8 aob in the p n system could be inhibited or wash out from the system 26 in this study cod removal observed in stage i predominantly ranged from 11 to 24 indicating biodegradable cod within the ll was relatively low against this backdrop it suggest to this study that the residual cod determined in the reactor s effluent was mainly refractory organic matter fig 2d notably cod removal rate observed in this study agreed with ealier reports where cod in a matured ll was reported mainly as being refractory with bod5 cod ratio of 0 45 27 to correlate biomass growth with the nutrient removal within the usb in stage i the sludge was evaluated in terms of volatile solids vs by the end of the first stage vs of the sludge in the usb had increased from 5 12 g l inoculum to 8 79 g l which accounted for 71 increase it has been established that in the absence of nob activities and heterotrophic denitrification process nitrate production as well as tn removal could only be achieved by anammox process 18 28 therefore to establish the ppossible denitrification pathways and process stability within the present usb some essential stoichiometric ratios were estimated and illustrated in fig s2 in the supplementary file this includes total nitrogen removal to nh4 nitrogen removal δtn δnh4 const and no3 production to nh4 nitrogen removal δno3 δnh4 const having constant of 0 86 and 0 11 respectively 28 the fundamental governing rule of the proposed no3 nprod nh4 nrem stoichiometric ratio suggests that if the proposed ratio and its corresponding value exceed the threshold value 0 11 it implies the presence of nob activities oxidizing the available no2 n in the same vein when tnrem nh4 nrem ratio exceeds the threshold value of 0 86 it indicates the presence of heterotrophic denitrifiers as opposed to anammox bacteria 18 28 the estimated tnrem nh4 nrem ratio and δno3 δnh4 estimated in at stage i averaged 0 89 and 0 12 respectively with a majority of the data pointing around the vicinity of 0 86 and 0 11 these estimates suggested that anammox was the the leading player in the nitrogen removal mechanism followed by heterotrophic denitrification by hbd after satisfactory nitrogen removal performance was achieved in stage i stage ii day 33 82 and its proposed operational parameters was initiated table 1 thus do concentration in the usb was elevating to 0 6 mg l along with a gradual increased of nlr from 0 72 to1 77 kg n m3 d by increasing influent nitrogen concentration from 400 mg l to 900 mg l under a stable hrt of 12 5 h table 1 when reactor do was increased in stage ii nh4 n removal rate could still reach 90 from day 33 to day 39 however when the maximum influent nlr 1 77 kg n m3 d was introduced nh4 n removal attained was slightly 80 mg l fig 2a on the other hand tn removal reduced significantly to an average of 22 3 during the steady phase of stage ii fig 2b nitrite accumulation was very pronounced during stage ii as no3 n concentration rose steadily in the effluent from 12 25 mg l day 39 to 428 75 mg l day 77 fig 2c the observed inadequate nitrogen removal nh4 n and tn suggested that the new do level 0 6 mg l introduced in the reactor had inhibited anammox bacteria activities but had promoted aob and nob activities on the whole it was found that the elevated do concentration adversely affected the total nitrogen removal process during this period stage ii the do concentration significantly correlated with tn removal as efficiency declined swiftly when do concentration of 0 6 mg l was employed fig 2b consequently the unsatisfactory tn removal observed at stage ii was predominantly attributed to the remarkable increase in no2 n production which subsequently accumulated in the effluent the observation made herein agreed with earlier reports where do concentration was reported to have inhibited or promoted the activities of aob nob and amxb 29 however due to oxygen mass transfer mechanism anammox bacteria and the denitrifying bacteria within granular sludge or biofilm utilizes ammonium and nitrate without any severe inhibition caused by oxygen in terms of cod removal in stage ii removal rate fluctuated remarkably but could still achieve a stable removal of 25 95 at the steady state fig 2d the observable cod removal along with subtle tn removal observed in stage ii was believed to have been possible via the exploitation of organics and no2 n by hdb compared to stage i the biomass population had reduced slightly from 8 79 g l to 8 52 g l in stage ii although the reduction was relatively insignificant it confirmed that strict anaerobes within the usb had been affected by the do implemented in stage ii furthermore tnrem nh4 nrem ratio and δno3 δnh4 estimated in stage ii averaged 0 34 and 0 005 respectively indicating ratios were nowhere near the theoretical constant 0 86 and 0 11 consequently the estimated stochiometric ratios illustrated in fig s2 in the supplementary file affirmed that nitrogen removal by anammox was profoundly inhibited by do of 0 6 mg l and that tn removal process noticed in stage ii was mainly attributted to heterotrophic denitrification carried out by hdb as nitrogen removal reduced significantly in stage ii do supplied to the usb was reduced to 0 4 mg l to establish a gradual restoration of the nitrogen removal process this newly introduced regime of do 0 4 mg l represented stage iii as illustrated in fig 2a nlr ranging from 1 60 to 1 74 kg n m3 d was employed which accounted for averaged influent nh4 n and tn concentration of 950 mg l and 970 mg l respectively fig 2 notably the nh4 n removals attained during steady state of stage iii day 105 day 110 averaged 73 83 fig 2a amazingly tn removal observed in stage iii although unsatisfactory but was slightly higher 20 53 compared to that observed in stage ii fig 2b the removal efficiencies observed herein further supported the conclusion given towards removals in stage ii that do of 0 6 mg l was detrimental to amxb but promoted aob nob and hdb to some extent furthermore it was evident that the performance associated with stage i compared to that in stage ii and iii implied that the most favorable do suitable for promoting amxb and aob activities and inhibiting nob simultaneously was 0 2 mg l the effect of do on the snap process was further deduced from the nox profile shown in fig 2c although no2 n accumulation was observable no2 n production rate was highly stable in stage iii as opposed to stage ii day 39 to day 77 where no2 n production steadily rose from time to time effluent no2 n concentration reached was 481 2 mg l fig 2c suggesting aob was the most favored bacterial group that benefitted thoroughly from the 0 4 mg l do environment compared to stage ii no3 n accumulation maintained a steady averaged concentration of 5 1 mg l in stage iii fig 2c this however suggested that nobs and amxb were inhibited during 0 4 mg l do regime at steady state cod removal averaged 31 48 in stage iii indicating biodegradable organics formed part of the nitrogen removal process associated with the inadequate tn removal observed fig 2d it was no surprise that cod removal in this study was relatively low as earlier reports had indicated that matured ll mainly comprise of refractory cod 27 in light of the overall performance observed in stage iii it was noticed that biomass growth in terms of vs during the organics and nutrient removal had decreased from 8 52 g l stage ii to 7 92 g l in stage iii implying other responsible microbes needed to realize a complete autotrophic denitrification within the usb had been washed out due to the do implemented to complement nitrogen removal efficiency tnrem nh4 nrem ratio and δno3 δnh4 were estimated in stage iii and averaged values reached were 0 31 and 0 06 respectively the estimated ratios shown in fig s2 in the supplementary file were still far from the vicinity of the theoretical constant 0 86 and 0 11 this suggested that autotrophic denitrification by anammox was still inhibited by do of 0 4 mg l however as tn and cod removal was recorded in stage iii these removals could were attributed to heterotrophic denitrification by hdb fig 2b in biological wastewater treatment streams recoverability of the treatment process from adverse effects is essential to justify whether a treatment process is worth for commercialization in this regard when removal efficiencies of the three reported stages viz stage i do 0 2 mg l stage ii do 0 6 mg l and stage iii do 0 4 mg l was compared it was found that stage i achieved the best performance in contrast stage ii was the worst fig 2 therefore to investigate the tendency of the snap process to restore or recover from an adverse effect as result of high do 0 6 and 0 4 mg l the best workable do concentration of 0 2 mg l was re introduced as stage iv and the corresponding removal efficiencies were then and illustrated in fig 2 nlr employed in stage iv ranged from 1 35 1 84 kg n m3 d almost similar to that in stage i which accounted for influent nh4 n and tn mean concentrations of 987 mg l and 1002 mg l respectively regardless of the high nlr employed high nh4 n and tn removals were restored by the end of the steady phase fig 2 within the first 9 days of stage iv nh4 n removal efficiency increased steadily from 73 83 day 110 to 97 87 day 119 indicating aobs were much efficient under do of 0 2 mg l fig 2a amazingly when do was curtailed to 0 2 mg l in stage iv an abrupt but steadily increasing tn removal was noticed within the first 23 days of stage iv the noticeable steady increase in tn removal suggested restoration of amxb activities within the usb fig 2b to established full trust of the system in terms of performance restoration stage iv was allowed to run until effluent nh4 n was 5 mg l as specified by municipal discharge standards 5 mg l at steady state in stage iv nh4 n and tn removals reached 99 5 fig 2a and 94 3 fig 2b respectively suggesting a correlation between removal efficiency and do by the end of steady state in stage iv effluent no3 n and no2 n concentration averaged 47 12 mg l and 1 26 mg l fig 2c as no3 n is a major by product from anammox reaction eq 2 it was expected that no3 n levels in the usb effluent needed to exceed the mesured 47 12 mg l observed at steady state of stage iv fig 2c this clearly revealed that denitrification within the present usb was not only steered by anammox bacterial but also heterotrophic denitrifiers which further perform hetertrophic denitrification by removing anammox by product no3 n using available organics as an electron donor based on the nutrients and organics removal pathways identified ot was concluded that synergistic relationship was established between heterotrophic bacterial and autotrophic bacterial and this synergy mainly promoted or scaled up for efficient tn removal observed in stage ii and iv notably the reduction in effluent no3 n as opposed to the expected concentration based on anammox reaction correlated with cod removals 31 04 observed in stage iv fig 2d the overall efficiency associated with stage iv was further measured with biomass growth in terms of vs it was observed that vs concentration in sludge biomass decreased in stage iii 7 92 g l but rather increased in stage iv to 12 16 g l implying do of 0 2 mg l was suitable again cod had no significant effect on anammox which lead to a satisfactory restoration of the snap process to elucidate the nitrogen removal pathway tnrem nh4 nrem and δno3 δnh4 ratios were further estimated to support arguments in stage iv as illustrated in fig s2 in the supplementary file the averaged values estimated for tnrem nh4 nrem and δno3 δnh4 ratios were 0 94 and 0 05 respectively it could be noticed that the estimated tnrem nh4 nrem ratios were a little higher than the theoretical constant of 0 86 indicating additional denitrification was carried out by other microbes other than anammox bacteria again the estimated δno3 δnh4 ratios were also less the theoretical value of 0 11 corresponding to the less nitrate observed in stage iv fig 2c 3 2 identification and removal behaviors of eem parafac components landfill leachate ll is well known to contain various dissolved organic matter including humic acids and volatile fatty acids vfa 30 notably young aged ll often comprise of vfas and that makes them biodegradable conversely when ll matures 5 10years about 60 of its dissolved organic matter dom turn out to be refractory 31 in this study fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom of raw ll and water samples collected at the end of each stage i ii iii and iv were identified and validated by parafac modeling fig 3 based on the core consistency diagnostic and split half validation technique only one parafac component was established with the eem dataset of the samples dom it has been reported that eem parafac components with emission wavelength 380 nm and 380 nm are generally described as protein like and humic components respectively 31 besides the raw ll and water sample collected at stage iv the fdom component c1 of all other samples exhibited primary and secondary peaks fig 3 it was found that the primary peak of raw ll and samples collected at stage i stage ii stage iii and stage iv was at excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 395 500 fig 3a 340 425 fig 3b 340 440 fig 3c 340 425 fig 3d and 333 425 fig 3e respectively whereas secondary peaks were only observable in stage i stage ii and stage iii with ex em of 260 440 fig 3b 270 450 fig 3c and 255 450 fig 3d respectively despite minimal shifts in the peak locations the observed fdom in this present study agreed with other literature where landfill leachate was reported 32 33 it was evident that the peak location of the identified fdom component was associated with a typical humic acid like component 34 wu and coworkers reported that protein like component fluorescence diminishes as leachate increases its biological stability with time 35 as a result tryptophan like component fulvic like component and protein like component were non existent in this study the locations where the fluorescence peaks were identified in effluent water samples collected at the end of each stage i ii iii and iv were not significantly different from that of the influent on the other hand the maximum fluorescence peak intensities fpimax observed among effluent water samples varied significantly from that associated with influent the difference in fluorescence intensities at various stages of usb operation suggested that the synergistic effect of aob amxb and hdb within the snap process enhanced both nutrients and organics removal in a study conducted by yu and coworkers it was established that fpimax was directly proportional to concentrations of the various components associated with dom 36 in another study the latter assertion was further affirmed as influent and effluent and the fpimax values demonstrated a strong correlation with the dom with a coefficient of determination r2 and p value reaching 0 912 and 0 01 respectively 37 against this backdrop fpimax was employed in this study to indicate the species and content of the refractory dom as illustrated in fig s3 in the supplementary file it could be seen that fpimax in the component affiliated to all samples exhibited high consistency compared to the influent it was found that removal of refractory dom within the usb stabled at 15 an indication of poor biodegradability of carbon cod content within the ll 3 3 microbial community structure as revealed by high throughput gene sequencing 3 3 1 diversity and richness of obtained sequences microbial communities and related structure within the inoculum s0 and sludge samples end of stage i x1 stage ii x2 stage iii x3 and stage iv x4 collected from the usb reactor while treating ll was probed using 16s rrna high throughput gene sequencing after sludge pretreatment dna extraction and pcr amplification and sequencing on the illumina platform filtered sequence reads obtained under a rejection rate of 0 1 mainly distributed in the range of 430 and 500 bp table 2 the total number of the operational taxonomic unit otu estimated by chao 1 in inoculum varied slightly from sludge samples obtained at the various stages of the usb operation based on 97 sequence identity otus secured for s0 x1 x2 x3 and x4 were 1627 1497 1607 1571 and 1276 respectively table 2 comparing reduction scenarios among inoculum and the usb sludge in terms of otu it was found that all sludges samples obtained from the usb had reduced possibly due to i washout phenomenon and or ii poor adaption of some bacterial goups to the operating condition employed in the usb employing statistical indicators such as shannon simpson inverse chao1 ace indices also revealed variation in microbial community dynamics of sludge obtained from usb as opposed to the inoculum table 2 shannon diversity is mostly employed on the account for microbial diversity characterization in terms of abundance and evenness of the species present 38 in this study the shannon index decrease from 5 54 s0 to 4 75 5 25 4 69 and 4 79 in x1 2 x3 and x4 respectively table 2 indicating microbial community structure had undergone some structural shift within the usb reactor notably both diversity shannon and simpsons and richness chao1 and ace index were highest in stage ii thus when do of 0 6 mg l was employed followed by stage iii and stage iv table 2 the observation made herein suggests that microbial diversity expanded under relatively high do implying that strict aerobic bacterial could not adapt to the low do 0 2 mg l supplied in the system thus autotroph bacteria found it tough to double their population under high do whereas heterotrophic bacteria were promoted 18 3 3 2 taxonomic classification and functional population assignments in the usb microbial community shift in terms of relative abundances was evaluated and presented in fig 4 at the phylum level it was found that microbial community structure within the inoculum varied from that observed in the usb sludge in terms of their relative abundances the illustration in fig 4a revealed that over 70 of the obtained sequences from the sludge samples s0 x1 x2 x3 and x4 belonged to proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria nitrospirae and ignavibacteriae fig 4a the most dominant phyla found in the inoculum s0 was proteobacteria 31 21 followed by planctomycetes 5 99 bacteroidetes 7 89 chloroflexi 9 93 ignavibacteriae 1 35 actinobacteria 4 62 and nitrospirae 0 04 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes have been mentioned as key players for both nitrogen removal and cod degradation bacteroidetes have explicitly been characterized as one of the most abundant heterotrophic groups observed in marine environments capable of degrading particulate organic matter especially with particulates high molecular weight compounds 39 another study has also suggested that acidobacteria which has been seen in many wastewater treatment systems has a role in facilitating the reduction of nitrate and nitrite 40 coupled with these phyla planctomycetes is also established as a major player in nitrogen removal and also accounts for about 30 50 nitrogen gas produced in marine environments 41 observably the microbial community dynamics of sludge collected from the usb had changed significantly from the community structure associated with the inoculum suggesting various do levels employed in the respective stages of the usb operation had impacted on the microbial community structure fig 4a at the genus level the overall number of genera identified in the inoculum s0 was 243 as opposed to that of the reactor s sludge that ranged from 208 and 224 fig 4b out of these many taxa observed at the genus level 30 had their relative abundance 1 in at least one sample among the 30 genera observed the most dominant ones found in all sludge samples included candidatus kuenenia dechloromonas nitrosomonas ignavibacterium thermomonas truepera comamonas ottowia thauera nitrobacter and nitrospira fig 4b although community composition at all stages of the usb operation was very different from the inoculum it could be seen that aob hdb amxb and other cod removing bacteria dominated in the usb sludge compared to the inoculum dechloromonas denitrifiers nitrobacter and nitrospira nob had reduced in terms of population at the various stages of the usb operation whereas nitrosomonas thermomonas truepera and ottowia presented an increasing trend which was contrary to the former fig 4b furthermore it was noticed that candidatus kuenenia and comamonas flourished and were promoted under do of 0 2 mg l whiles inhibited when do of 0 6 mg l was employed several reports have captured the metabolic functions of ignavibacterium and bellilinea thus it is well established that ignavibacterium is a novel facultative anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium 42 whiles bellilinea are anaerobic fermenters capable of producing vfas 43 consequently it was observed that ignavibacterium bellilinea and truepera were the primary bacterial genera responsible for the removal of the biodegradable cod witnessed in this study on the overall it could be deduced that the observable variations in the genus composition at the various stages of the usb operation were attributed to the implemented do as the microbial community dynamics were hugely impacted which subsequently influenced treatment performance of the snap process as illustrated in fig 4b the key functional genera within the microbial ecology at each stage of the usb operation included aob hdb amxb nob and other cod degrading bacteria comparatively the relative abundance of heterotrophic bacteria observed in this study was relatively more as opposed to the autotrophic nitrogen removal bacteria amazingly only one type of anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia was revealed at the genus level fig 4b however their relative abundances within the usb varied markedly among the sludge samples picked at each stage of the usb operation as depicted in fig 4b the abundance of candidatus kuenenia in s0 x1 x2 x3 and x4 was 7 68 8 99 4 21 4 61 and 9 65 respectively it could be seen that when do of 0 2 mg l was implemented in stage i and stage iv amxb growth increased by 17 31 and 25 65 respectively on the other hand candidatus kuenenia decreased in population by 45 18 and 39 97 at do of 0 6 mg l stage ii and 0 4 mg l stage iii respectively although the relative abundance of amxb reduced significantly in stage ii and stage iii mainly due to the elevated do fig 4b the acute reduction in the relative abundance of the anammox microbes could closely be linked with the poor nitrogen removal efficiency witnessed at stages ii and iii of the usb operation fig 2 regardless of the reduction phenomenon observed with candidatus kuenenia based on the inhibition and impairment of the do this anammox genus restored its dominance in stage iv when do of 0 2 mg l was re introduced in the usb fig 4b an indication that anammox bacterial could not withstand do 0 2 mg l 44 in terms of nitrifying bacteria genera belonging to aob and nob that have been discussed in other reports as key players responsible for nitrogen removal were also observable in varying proportions in the inoculum and usb sludge 45 the aob genera observed in microbial communities within the inoculum and sludge obtained at stage i ii iii and iv belonged to nitrosomonas and sphingomonas with the proportion of 4 65 and 0 03 in s0 5 64 and 1 65 in x1 7 54 and 0 11 in x2 8 01 and 0 05 in x3 and 7 95 and 2 01 in x4 respectively fig 4b clearly when the relative abundance of aob in the inoculum was compared to that in the usb it could be seen that aob was promoted under all do conditions exploited in this study fig 4b suggesting nitrite accumulation could be stably maintained to perform partial nitritation rather than nitrification within the usb interestingly other nitrifying genera belonging to nob were mainly nitrospira and nitrobacter but their abundances reduced significantly within the usb suggesting the operational do ranging from 0 2 0 6 mg l was not suitable or sufficient to sustain their existence 46 nitrobacter reduced from 2 64 in inoculum to 0 05 0 91 0 42 and 0 03 in stage i stage ii stage iii and stage iv respectively as well as nitrospira reducing from 4 07 in inoculum to 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 02 in stage i stage ii stage iii and stage iv respectively these genera accorded with the ammonia conversion profile observed during the usb operation fig 2 besides anammox and nitrifiers revealed by the gene sequencing approach heterotrophic denitrifiers were also visible within the microbial consortia with higher concentrations fig 4b denitrifiers were the predominant genera within the usb with sixteen of them being more pronounced among the total genera detected these key denitrifiers include thermogutta caldimonas comamonas dechloromonas defluviimonas hyphomicrobium mesorhizobium ottowia pseudomonas rheinheimera rhodopseudomonas thauera thermomonas thiobacillus gemmatimonas bacillus fig 4b the total relative abundance of denitrifiers in s0 x1 x2 x3 and x4 was 22 98 24 04 28 33 22 21 and 25 99 respectively fig 5 which partly accounted for the nitrogen removal mechanism observed in the usb fig 2 besides other cod degrading bacteria including bellilinea 47 ignavibacterium 48 and truepera were also in the usb although ignavibacterium and thauera have been reported to have cod degrading and denitrification capabilities respectively it is also established that these genera could simultaneously perform nitrogen and carbon removal 49 3 3 3 pollutant removal mechanism within the usb via snap process regarding the microbial community structure fig 4 revealed by the 16s rrna gene sequencing and the removal profiles illustrated in fig 3 it could be deduced that the snap process was attained based on the synergistic relationship between key functional genera including aob amxb hdb and cod degrading bacteria these genera were believed to have performed processes including i partial nitrification ii and heterotrophic denitrification iii autotrophic denitrification in the microaerobic process treating ll 50 reports have established that the most significant factor that propels snap process is mainly dependent on the do gradient profile within the sludge bed 51 consequently the do gradient established in the present usb reactor created a microaerobic condition and anoxic environment which subsequently supported and promoted the growth of aob amxb hdb and cod degrading bacteria 51 52 as heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria has the potential to survive environments ranging from aerobic to anaerobic it was no surprise that denitrifiers proportion was dominant at all stages of this study irrespective of the do 0 2 0 6 mg l supplied in the reactor fig 5 nitrogen removal was poor in stages ii and iii indicating denitrifiers activity was inhibited due to insufficient biodegradable organics in the ll in term of anammox bacteria amxb and aob the study revealed that candidatus kuenenia as the main amxb in the usb at stage i x1 stage ii x2 stage iii x3 and stage iv x4 accounting for 8 99 4 21 4 61 and 9 65 respectively figs 4b and 5 whereas aobs grew from 4 68 to a 7 29 in stage i and subsequently maintained its relative abundances in the range of 7 29 9 96 throughout the stages of operation of the usb anammox bacteria was inhibited under do stress in stages ii and iii nobs were significantly out selected or inhibited at all stages as their ratio dropped hugely from 6 71 in the inoculum to 0 07 0 93 0 44 and 0 05 at stage i x1 stage ii x2 stage iii x3 and stage iv x4 respectively although nob abundance only reached 0 05 in stage iv their presence contributed to the short lived nitrate accumulation observed in the stage iv by competing with candidatus kuenenia for nitrite in the usb based on the reported community structure it was found that bacteria responsible for partial nitritation heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification and cod degradation coexisted for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and biodegradable cod within the usb reactor thus synergistic interaction among aob hdb amxb and cod degraders were promoted under do of 0 2 mg l employed in a snap process to achieve both nitrogen and cod removal 3 4 morphology of sludge obtained at various stages to ascertain the effect of heavy metal presence in the ll on the microbial activities and related nitrogen removal performance sem edx was employed to investigate changes in the morphology of sludge seed sludge s0 end of stage ii x2 and stage iv x4 as illustrated in fig 6 the sem micrograph and edx revealed sludge granulations and biosorption of heavy metals within the different bacteria structures of the sludge samples compared to the inoculum fig 6a sludge samples x2 and x4 obtained from the ubs were more densely packed and abundant in spherical bacteria cells fig 6c and e wang zhang and coworkers earlier established that spherical cells are mostly aob or anammox indicating that the densely packed nature of the sludge due to the abundance eps may be the most contributing factor which had supported the retention of aob and anammox in the usb 7 53 eps was observable within sludge cells suspected to evolve some defense mechanisms to bacteria cells against external inhibitions such as heavy metals 54 this phenomenon subsequently benefited anammox bacteria to persevere metal toxicity leading to improved nitrogen removal performance in stages ii and iv although numerous benefits abound the presence or production of the eps to the bacterial diversity in the usb high eps content or excessive eps production may also pose significant challenges such as mass transfer resistance 55 and thereby leading to inadequate nitrogen removal in the snap process compared to the elements found on the inoculum x0 surface al ti fe p and as increased their weight in x1 and x2 as revealed by edx spectra and illustrated in fig 6 on the other hand the presence of the heavy metals showed no inhibition effect on the sludge samples indicating microbial communities could utilize important elements for their growth or perform biosorption of the metals within the sludge body mass table s2 3 5 evolution of eps as revealed by confocal laser scanning microscope to further explore the effect of metals within ll on microbial communities eps distribution in sludge samples inoculum s0 and sludge obtained at the end of stage iv x4 were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscope clsm and presented fig 7 a three main types of eps components were studied viz protein α polysaccharide and β polysaccharide it has been reported that blue green and red regions on a clsm image indicated β polysaccharide α polysaccharide and protein respectively 20 as shown in fig 7 a i iii eps β polysaccharide α polysaccharide and protein in s0 was uniformly distributed over the observed region suggesting the inoculum was mainly flocs which had no granules again the color code revealed that the inoculum body mass was mainly dominated by α polysaccharide and protein as opposed to β polysaccharide fig 7a i iii the observation made in this study corroborated with earlier published reports where protein and polysaccharide were reported as the dominant eps distributed in the core of the activated sludge flocs with no trace of coating 56 however the distribution of eps within the x4 sludge was in direct contrast to the inoculum as blue green and red stains were conspicuously concentrated on the outer surface of the sludge granules fig 7b i iii 20 although the required stains were more visible on the outer surface of the granules it was also evident that β polysaccharide was more concentrated in the periphery of the granular sludge whereas protein and α polysaccharide were primarily distributed in the inner layer furthermore the blue stain was more prominent as opposed to the red and green stains indicating β polysaccharide content was the most dominant eps in on the sludge granules the observable distribution of eps on the circumference of the sludge granules revealed a defense mechanism put up by microbes against metal toxicity expected to inhibit the snap process and its related microbes the result further suggested that microbes could produce ample eps to counter any adverse effect from the environments 57 4 conclusion synchronous nitrogen and carbon removal from ll using snap process under microaerobic condition was explored and reported at steady state 99 5 nh4 n 94 3 tn and 31 04 cod removals were concurrently achieved when reactor do of 0 2 mg l and nlr ranging 0 31 1 84 kg m3 d was employed conversely with do of 0 6 mg l nitrogen removal reduced significantly 20 whereas no2 n accumulation increased 98 68 along with inhibition of anammox bacterial amxb activities high throughput gene sequencing revealed coexistence and synergistic activities among ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas and sphingomonas amxb candidatus kuenenia heterotrophic denitrifiers hdb comamonas dechloromonas and cod degrading bacteria bellilinea ignavibacterium within the snap process while treating ll sludge morphology revealed by sem edx and clsm indicated that biomass comprised of granulated sludge embedded in extracellular polymeric substances but this was suspected as a defense

13796,nitrogen levels in landfill leachate ll could potentially pollute water bodies and surrounding groundwater when discharged untreated against this backdrop pollutant removal from leachate generated at landfill sites is essential however a cost efficient approach which could concurrently remove various pollutants within ll via single stage approach and under microaerobic conditions has not been fully explored in this study single stage nitrogen removal using anammox and partial nitritation snap process was proposed and employed to treat ll under microaerobic condition in an upflow sludge blanket when reactor dissolved oxygen do of 0 2 mg l was implemented along with nitrogen loading rate nlr ranging 0 31 1 84 kg m3 d 99 5 nh4 n 94 3 tn and 31 04 chemical oxygen demand cod removals was concurrently achieved conversely when do was elevated to 0 6 mg l nitrogen removal was curtailed to 20 no2 n accumulation reached 98 68 indicating inhibition of anammox bacterial amxb activities 16s rrna high throughput gene sequencing revealed ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas and sphingomonas amxb candidatus kuenenia heterotrophic denitrifiers hdb comamonas dechloromonas and cod degrading bacteria bellilinea ignavibacterium as the dominant genera which coordinated synergistic activities to establish the snap process and led to the single stage pollutants removal from the ll sludge morphological revealed by sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy indicated that reactor sludge comprised of granulated sludge and was noticeably embedded in extracellular polymeric substances eps an indication of a defense mechanism initiated by microbes against heavy metals toxicity the snap process demonstrated a promising cost efficient simultaneous nitrogen and carbon removal from ll keywords partial nitritation anammox process microbial community dynamics landfill leachate oxygen limited condition 1 introduction landfills have often been proposed for the disposal of municipal solid waste msw across the world 1 2 although the technology landfills could achieve remarkable success the aftermath effect including by products from the technology could adversely impact profoundly on water bodies groundwater and land table s1 in the supplementary file thus landfilling technique generates a considerable volume of leachate which contains high concentrations of nh4 n refractory chemical oxygen demand codr biodegradable chemical oxygen demand codb heavy metals humic acids and suspended solids 3 4 one of the notable characteristics of landfill leachate ll is its drastic reduction of biodegradable organics but elevated nh4 n concentration as they mature with time this observable phenomenon of mature ll often leads to a gradual reduction in the carbon nitrogen c n ratio 5 against this backdrop employing conventional nitrification denitrification process to remove nitrogen and organics from ll having a low c n ratio possess significant challenges until sufficient dissolved oxygen do and external carbon resources are supplied to the responsible nitrifiers and denitrifiers respectively 6 however supplying external organic carbon resources and providing the necessary required concentration of do via mechanical aeration to the biological process employed often elevates the operational cost of the treatment process 7 therefore the need to select an effective and a cost efficient process that could effectively treat ll at a reduced cost is the essential factor during the planning of ll treatment in recent years coupling partial nitritation p n to anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a process in either single stage or two stage configuration for autotrophic nitrogen removal is gaining significant attention in that p n a process 1 saves cost on aeration eqs 1 2 requires no external carbon supplies to reach its full potential in the nitrogen conversion and removal process eq 2 8 3 reduces co2 emission 4 lessens biomass yield significantly and 5 performs nitrogen removal via autotrophic denitrification pathways by the anammox bacteria anb 1 nh 4 1 5o 2 2hco 3 no 2 2co 2 3h 2 o 2

of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob within the mixed consortium which mostly comprises of ammonium oxidation bacteria aob anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria amxb and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb ideally aob has a higher affinity or lower affinity constant ks for oxygen as opposed to nob this implies that aob can grow in limited do environments in contrast nob is inhibited or washed out under that same condition allowing sufficient no2 n for amxb within the p n a process 9 the latter assertion suggests that excessive do supply is the main reason behind the promotion of nob activities and consequent no3 accumulation in p n a systems therefore limiting the do levels within the environments of these two microbes aob and nob is one excellent approach for achieving nob out selection 10 besides nob growth that tends to be a major challenge faced by the p n a process autotrophic amxb is often considerably inhibited by certain levels of biodegradable organics contained in nitrogenous rich wastewater this occurrence is mainly caused by heterotrophic a bacterium that out competes anammox bacteria in the quest for nitrite the latter suggests that single stage carbon oxidation partial nitritation heterotrophic autotrophic denitrification process based on the combined activities of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria will be appropriate while cost has always ranked top among factors that require extensive consideration in the selection of a treatment process single stage nitrogen removal using anammox and partial nitritation snap process is a sure way to reducing nitrogen removal cost as opposed to the two stage carbon oxidation partial nitritation denitrification and anammox t nap this argument is justified based on the lessened number of bioreactors and space required for installation for a snap process 8 although snap process has somehow been explored a few times there exist some knowledge gaps that have not yet been explicitly reported for instance no consensus has been established on the optimum or exact do levels that could ensure maximum efficiency in treating nitrogen rich wastewater 8 11 13 also the feasibility of employing a microaerobic condition to achieve a cost efficient snap process during treatment of ll has not yet been reported again no work has been done investigating the effects of various microaerobic conditions on a snap process efficiency its related microbial community structure morphology and extracellular polymeric substances eps therefore an extensive study to address these research gaps would be beneficial to identify control strategies help exploit the full potential of snap process and possibly promotes its commercial implementation another justification for proposing a snap process over conventional nitrification and denitrification process is that nh4 n removal via anammox process is considered autotrophic which yields no3 n 16 26 of nitrogen removed as a by product from the biochemical reaction steered by amxb eq 2 to elevate total nitrogen removal efficiency in amxb based reactors some researchers supported denitrification dn and total nitrogen tn removal process by dosing the system with external organic carbon to remove the no3 n which is a by product of the amxb 14 however when organic carbon dosed in the reactor is high heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb will exploit the carbon resources for growth and subsequently fall on the available no2 n due to their strong affinity for oxygen 15 in such scenarios amxb for the autotrophic nitrogen removal process within the p n a system will not have enough substrate for growth 16 therefore the effects of cod and various do levels on a snap process efficiency and its microbial communities are worth studying to ascertain possibilities of accommodating additional services from hdb in the nitrogen removal and nob out selection processes as indicated earlier despite previous studies the pool of knowledge to tap on ideas for the commercial application of the snap process for the treatment of ll is relatively insufficient consequently deeper investigation on the effects of microaerobic conditions and cod on the snap process efficiency as well as the microbial communities could help gain comprehensive insights for optimizing operational strategies of the snap process and microbial community structures again the possibility of a snap process to restore or recover from an adverse effect imposed by high do has also not been investigated and this cast many doubts as to how a deteriorated snap process could recover its removal efficiency to the best of our knowledge no studies have reported on the effects of various microaerobic conditions as well as cod on the snap process treating ll in this study the effect of various microaerobic conditions within snap system treating ll in an upflow sludge blanket reactor was investigated the specific objective of this study includes 1 to assess the optimum microaerobic condition with the tendency to simultaneously promote activities of aob amxb hdb and out select nob in one stage 2 to investigate the influence of biodegradable organics on the activities of autotrophic amxb 3 to investigate the response of microbial community diversity to various microaerobic conditions and cod concentration using 16s rrna gene sequencing 4 to establish possible restoration of removal efficiency when a snap process is deteriorated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sourcing and characterization of landfill leachate the ll was collected from a nearby municipal landfill site leachate pond owned by a municipal solid waste landfill facility in ganzhou city jiangxi province china the quality of the raw ll was analyzed and presented in table s1 in the supplementary file 2 2 experimental setup and operational conditions a lab scale upflow sludge bed usb reactor with an effective and total working volume of 1 4 l and 1 6 l respectively was constructed fig 1 and employed for the snap process proposed in this study the usb reactor was equipped with a three phase separator and functional carriers with diameter length specific gravity and specific surface area of 4 mm 4 mm 0 98 g cm3 1500 m2 m3 respectively to enhance anammox biomass retention activated sludge mixed liquor suspended solids of 6 71 g l and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids of 5 12 g l and anammox sludge was employed as inoculum during startup of the usb operation temperature prescribed for the usb operation averaged 25 c 1 supplied and controlled by a hot water bath thermistor and digital temperature controller the usb reactor was covered to prevent light sources from reaching the inoculum particularly anammox biomass influent ll

supplied by aerating whitewater silent air pumps model v201 fraction of effluent in a middle tank to a do of about 2 mg l and subsequently recycling back to the reactor with a reflux ratio of 15 1 the

high throughput gene sequencing 2 4 1 sampling and dna extraction to ascertain the effect of do cod and nlr on the performance of the snap process the dynamics within microbial communities of sludge samples inoculum so sludge obtained at the end of stage i x1 stage ii x2 stage iii x3 and stage iv x4 was investigated the samples were analyzed for microbial community structures using 16s rrna high

agarose gel electrophoresis genomic dna quantification and pcr amplification performed in eppendorf mastercycler were conducted as described in our previous works 8 7 14 the extracted genomic dna was sequenced on an illumina miseq sequencing platform pe300 sangon biotech shanghai china sequence cluster analysis homology search and taxonomic classification of the obtained sequences were conducted with the protocols given in the supplementary file 2 5 morphological analysis and metal distribution on sludge to complement the microbial community analysis morphological studies and the distribution

destruction of the collected sludges samples was prevented by adding glutaraldehyde 2 5 ph of 6 8 and phosphate buffer 0 1 mol l ph of 6 8 18 samples were adequately rinsed and subsequently dehydrated using 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol solutions 7 after dehydration was reasonably achieved samples were soaked in absolute ethanol and isoamyl acetate mixture as well as pure isoamyl acetate and dried till complete dehydration was observed high resolution field emission sem model mira3 lmh tescan orsay holdings equipped with an edx was finally employed to observed morphological structure and elemental composition and distribution of heavy metal within the pre treated samples 19 for high efficiency and accuracy only pure element oxides and natural minerals were employed as standards for the heavy metal analysis 19 2 6 eps fluorescence staining and imaging using confocal laser scanning microscopy an appropriate volume of sludge was sampled into a 5 ml centrifuge tube after which 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution ph of 6 8 was added and refrigerated at 4 c for 1 5 hours next 100 μl of 0 1 m nahco3 was added to each sample to maintain the amine group in non protonated form the

in the usb 3 1 1 nitrogen and organics removal from ll the proposed snap process conducted in a packed bed usb reactor for nitrogen and organics removal from ll was evaluated on daily bases fig 2 as presented in table 1 the usb reactor was operated for 146 days under four different stages stages i ii iii and iv the four delineated operational stages comprised of unique do but constant hydraulic retention time hrt during the operation of the usb nlr at each stage ranging 0 31 1 84 kgtn m3 d was introduced progressively by increasing or decreasing influent nh4 concentration 200 to 1000 mg l in stage i day 1 32 of the usb operation where reactor internal do of 0 2 mg l was maintained along with a stepwise increase of nlr from 0 31 1 82 kgtn m3 d minimum removal rate in terms of nh4 n tn nox no2 n and no3 n and codb were observed and recorded fig 2 with an average influent nlr of 0 35 kg n m3 d introduced during the first ten days day 1 10 of the usb operation nh4 n and tn removal fluctuated significantly however removal efficiency could still reach 46 15 and 38 36 respectively the phenomenal observation made within the first 10 days suggested that microbes had not adapted sufficiently to the do conditions or the likelihood of shock loading effect due to elevated nlr however after full acclimatization of the inoculum to the environment and operational conditions nh4 n and tn removal was much satisfactory during the steady state thus nh4 n fig 2a and tn fig 2b removals recorded by the end of the steady state of stage i day 27 day 32 averaged 89 6 and 84 8 respectively the remarkable performance witnessed in stage i implied that do of 0 2 mg l was suitable and promoted the activities of both amxb and aob but inhibited nob it was also evident in stage i that nitrite no2 n accumulation was continuously stable as concentration in the effluent nox was 3 mg l fig 2c conversely no3 n accumulation which continuously fluctuated in stage i was relatively higher during the steady state performance fig 2c notably no3 n concentration reached 23 1 mg l with a corresponding nitrate accumulation ratio of about 90 during the steady period this observation indicated that nitrogen removal process in stage i was partly steered by anammox activities the overall nitrogen removal performance demonstrated in stage i was an indication that the snap process could efficiently treat ll without threat of no3 n accumulation as often seen other traditional nitrogen removal systems it has been established that biodegradable cod could adversely affect the performance of autotrophic microorganisms responsible within the snap process the latter assertion is highly feasible in that 1 hdb will compete with aob for do which will subsequently lead to lagged pn process and high energy consumption via oxygen control and 2 availability of cod could promote hdb to consume no2 n and subsequently inhibit amxb growth whiles performing for autotrophic denitrification 24 for instance in a study conducted by vilar and coworkers it was discussed that the performance of aobs during partial nitritation on ll having biodegradable cod was unsatisfactory this corroborated with the earlier assertion in that the presence of cod in the wastewater might had affect the efficiency of pn process 25 in another report it was further mentioned that when c n was 0 8 aob in the p n system could be inhibited or wash out from the system 26 in this study cod removal observed in stage i predominantly ranged from 11 to 24 indicating biodegradable cod within the ll was relatively low against this backdrop it suggest to this study that the residual cod determined in the reactor s effluent was mainly refractory organic matter fig 2d notably cod removal rate observed in this study agreed with ealier reports where cod in a matured ll was reported mainly as being refractory with bod5 cod ratio of 0 45 27 to correlate biomass growth with the nutrient removal within the usb in stage i the sludge was evaluated in terms of volatile solids vs by the end of the first stage vs of the sludge in the usb had increased from 5 12 g l inoculum to 8 79 g l which accounted for 71 increase it has been established that in the absence of nob activities and heterotrophic denitrification process nitrate production as well as tn removal could only be achieved by anammox process 18 28 therefore to establish the ppossible denitrification pathways and process stability within the present usb some essential stoichiometric ratios were estimated and illustrated in fig s2 in the supplementary file this includes total nitrogen removal to nh4 nitrogen removal δtn δnh4 const and no3 production to nh4 nitrogen removal δno3 δnh4 const having constant of 0 86 and 0 11 respectively 28 the fundamental governing rule of the proposed no3 nprod nh4 nrem stoichiometric ratio suggests that if the proposed ratio and its corresponding value exceed the threshold value 0 11 it implies the presence of nob activities oxidizing the available no2 n in the same vein when tnrem nh4 nrem ratio exceeds the threshold value of 0 86 it indicates the presence of heterotrophic denitrifiers as opposed to anammox bacteria 18 28 the estimated tnrem nh4 nrem ratio and δno3 δnh4 estimated in at stage i averaged 0 89 and 0 12 respectively with a majority of the data pointing around the vicinity of 0 86 and 0 11 these estimates suggested that anammox was the the leading player in the nitrogen removal mechanism followed by heterotrophic denitrification by hbd after satisfactory nitrogen removal performance was achieved in stage i stage ii day 33 82 and its proposed operational parameters was initiated table 1 thus do concentration in the usb was elevating to 0 6 mg l along with a gradual increased of nlr from 0 72 to1 77 kg n m3 d by increasing influent nitrogen concentration from 400 mg l to 900 mg l under a stable hrt of 12 5 h table 1 when reactor do was increased in stage ii nh4 n removal rate could still reach 90 from day 33 to day 39 however when the maximum influent nlr 1 77 kg n m3 d was introduced nh4 n removal attained was slightly 80 mg l fig 2a on the other hand tn removal reduced significantly to an average of 22 3 during the steady phase of stage ii fig 2b nitrite accumulation was very pronounced during stage ii as no3 n concentration rose steadily in the effluent from 12 25 mg l day 39 to 428 75 mg l day 77 fig 2c the observed inadequate nitrogen removal nh4 n and tn suggested that the new do level 0 6 mg l introduced in the reactor had inhibited anammox bacteria activities but had promoted aob and nob activities on the whole it was found that the elevated do concentration adversely affected the total nitrogen removal process during this period stage ii the do concentration significantly correlated with tn removal as efficiency declined swiftly when do concentration of 0 6 mg l was employed fig 2b consequently the unsatisfactory tn removal observed at stage ii was predominantly attributed to the remarkable increase in no2 n production which subsequently accumulated in the effluent the observation made herein agreed with earlier reports where do concentration was reported to have inhibited or promoted the activities of aob nob and amxb 29 however due to oxygen mass transfer mechanism anammox bacteria and the denitrifying bacteria within granular sludge or biofilm utilizes ammonium and nitrate without any severe inhibition caused by oxygen in terms of cod removal in stage ii removal rate fluctuated remarkably but could still achieve a stable removal of 25 95 at the steady state fig 2d the observable cod removal along with subtle tn removal observed in stage ii was believed to have been possible via the exploitation of organics and no2 n by hdb compared to stage i the biomass population had reduced slightly from 8 79 g l to 8 52 g l in stage ii although the reduction was relatively insignificant it confirmed that strict anaerobes within the usb had been affected by the do implemented in stage ii furthermore tnrem nh4 nrem ratio and δno3 δnh4 estimated in stage ii averaged 0 34 and 0 005 respectively indicating ratios were nowhere near the theoretical constant 0 86 and 0 11 consequently the estimated stochiometric ratios illustrated in fig s2 in the supplementary file affirmed that nitrogen removal by anammox was profoundly inhibited by do of 0 6 mg l and that tn removal process noticed in stage ii was mainly attributted to heterotrophic denitrification carried out by hdb as nitrogen removal reduced significantly in stage ii do supplied to the usb was reduced to 0 4 mg l to establish a gradual restoration of the nitrogen removal process this newly introduced regime of do 0 4 mg l represented stage iii as illustrated in fig 2a nlr ranging from 1 60 to 1 74 kg n m3 d was employed which accounted for averaged influent nh4 n and tn concentration of 950 mg l and 970 mg l respectively fig 2 notably the nh4 n removals attained during steady state of stage iii day 105 day 110 averaged 73 83 fig 2a amazingly tn removal observed in stage iii although unsatisfactory but was slightly higher 20 53 compared to that observed in stage ii fig 2b the removal efficiencies observed herein further supported the conclusion given towards removals in stage ii that do of 0 6 mg l was detrimental to amxb but promoted aob nob and hdb to some extent furthermore it was evident that the performance associated with stage i compared to that in stage ii and iii implied that the most favorable do suitable for promoting amxb and aob activities and inhibiting nob simultaneously was 0 2 mg l the effect of do on the snap process was further deduced from the nox profile shown in fig 2c although no2 n accumulation was observable no2 n production rate was highly stable in stage iii as opposed to stage ii day 39 to day 77 where no2 n production steadily rose from time to time effluent no2 n concentration reached was 481 2 mg l fig 2c suggesting aob was the most favored bacterial group that benefitted thoroughly from the 0 4 mg l do environment compared to stage ii no3 n accumulation maintained a steady averaged concentration of 5 1 mg l in stage iii fig 2c this however suggested that nobs and amxb were inhibited during 0 4 mg l do regime at steady state cod removal averaged 31 48 in stage iii indicating biodegradable organics formed part of the nitrogen removal process associated with the inadequate tn removal observed fig 2d it was no surprise that cod removal in this study was relatively low as earlier reports had indicated that matured ll mainly comprise of refractory cod 27 in light of the overall performance observed in stage iii it was noticed that biomass growth in terms of vs during the organics and nutrient removal had decreased from 8 52 g l stage ii to 7 92 g l in stage iii implying other responsible microbes needed to realize a complete autotrophic denitrification within the usb had been washed out due to the do implemented to complement nitrogen removal efficiency tnrem nh4 nrem ratio and δno3 δnh4 were estimated in stage iii and averaged values reached were 0 31 and 0 06 respectively the estimated ratios shown in fig s2 in the supplementary file were still far from the vicinity of the theoretical constant 0 86 and 0 11 this suggested that autotrophic denitrification by anammox was still inhibited by do of 0 4 mg l however as tn and cod removal was recorded in stage iii these removals could were attributed to heterotrophic denitrification by hdb fig 2b in biological wastewater treatment streams recoverability of the treatment process from adverse effects is essential to justify whether a treatment process is worth for commercialization in this regard when removal efficiencies of the three reported stages viz stage i do 0 2 mg l stage ii do 0 6 mg l and stage iii do 0 4 mg l was compared it was found that stage i achieved the best performance in contrast stage ii was the worst fig 2 therefore to investigate the tendency of the snap process to restore or recover from an adverse effect as result of high do 0 6 and 0 4 mg l the best workable do concentration of 0 2 mg l was re introduced as stage iv and the corresponding removal efficiencies were then and illustrated in fig 2 nlr employed in stage iv ranged from 1 35 1 84 kg n m3 d almost similar to that in stage i which accounted for influent nh4 n and tn mean concentrations of 987 mg l and 1002 mg l respectively regardless of the high nlr employed high nh4 n and tn removals were restored by the end of the steady phase fig 2 within the first 9 days of stage iv nh4 n removal efficiency increased steadily from 73 83 day 110 to 97 87 day 119 indicating aobs were much efficient under do of 0 2 mg l fig 2a amazingly when do was curtailed to 0 2 mg l in stage iv an abrupt but steadily increasing tn removal was noticed within the first 23 days of stage iv the noticeable steady increase in tn removal suggested restoration of amxb activities within the usb fig 2b to established full trust of the system in terms of performance restoration stage iv was allowed to run until effluent nh4 n was 5 mg l as specified by municipal discharge standards 5 mg l at steady state in stage iv nh4 n and tn removals reached 99 5 fig 2a and 94 3 fig 2b respectively suggesting a correlation between removal efficiency and do by the end of steady state in stage iv effluent no3 n and no2 n concentration averaged 47 12 mg l and 1 26 mg l fig 2c as no3 n is a major by product from anammox reaction eq 2 it was expected that no3 n levels in the usb effluent needed to exceed the mesured 47 12 mg l observed at steady state of stage iv fig 2c this clearly revealed that denitrification within the present usb was not only steered by anammox bacterial but also heterotrophic denitrifiers which further perform hetertrophic denitrification by removing anammox by product no3 n using available organics as an electron donor based on the nutrients and organics removal pathways identified ot was concluded that synergistic relationship was established between heterotrophic bacterial and autotrophic bacterial and this synergy mainly promoted or scaled up for efficient tn removal observed in stage ii and iv notably the reduction in effluent no3 n as opposed to the expected concentration based on anammox reaction correlated with cod removals 31 04 observed in stage iv fig 2d the overall efficiency associated with stage iv was further measured with biomass growth in terms of vs it was observed that vs concentration in sludge biomass decreased in stage iii 7 92 g l but rather increased in stage iv to 12 16 g l implying do of 0 2 mg l was suitable again cod had no significant effect on anammox which lead to a satisfactory restoration of the snap process to elucidate the nitrogen removal pathway tnrem nh4 nrem and δno3 δnh4 ratios were further estimated to support arguments in stage iv as illustrated in fig s2 in the supplementary file the averaged values estimated for tnrem nh4 nrem and δno3 δnh4 ratios were 0 94 and 0 05 respectively it could be noticed that the estimated tnrem nh4 nrem ratios were a little higher than the theoretical constant of 0 86 indicating additional denitrification was carried out by other microbes other than anammox bacteria again the estimated δno3 δnh4 ratios were also less the theoretical value of 0 11 corresponding to the less nitrate observed in stage iv fig 2c 3 2 identification and removal behaviors of eem parafac components landfill leachate ll is well known to contain various dissolved organic matter including humic acids and volatile fatty acids vfa 30 notably young aged ll often comprise of vfas and that makes them biodegradable conversely when ll matures 5 10years about 60 of its dissolved organic matter dom turn out to be refractory 31 in this study fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom of raw ll and water samples collected at the end of each stage i ii iii and iv were identified and validated by parafac modeling fig 3 based on the core consistency diagnostic and split half validation technique only one parafac component was established with the eem dataset of the samples dom it has been reported that eem parafac components with emission wavelength 380 nm and 380 nm are generally described as protein like and humic components respectively 31 besides the raw ll and water sample collected at stage iv the fdom component c1 of all other samples exhibited primary and secondary peaks fig 3 it was found that the primary peak of raw ll and samples collected at stage i stage ii stage iii and stage iv was at excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 395 500 fig 3a 340 425 fig 3b 340 440 fig 3c 340 425 fig 3d and 333 425 fig 3e respectively whereas secondary peaks were only observable in stage i stage ii and stage iii with ex em of 260 440 fig 3b 270 450 fig 3c and 255 450 fig 3d respectively despite minimal shifts in the peak locations the observed fdom in this present study agreed with other literature where landfill leachate was reported 32 33 it was evident that the peak location of the identified fdom component was associated with a typical humic acid like component 34 wu and coworkers reported that protein like component fluorescence diminishes as leachate increases its biological stability with time 35 as a result tryptophan like component fulvic like component and protein like component were non existent in this study the locations where the fluorescence peaks were identified in effluent water samples collected at the end of each stage i ii iii and iv were not significantly different from that of the influent on the other hand the maximum fluorescence peak intensities fpimax observed among effluent water samples varied significantly from that associated with influent the difference in fluorescence intensities at various stages of usb operation suggested that the synergistic effect of aob amxb and hdb within the snap process enhanced both nutrients and organics removal in a study conducted by yu and coworkers it was established that fpimax was directly proportional to concentrations of the various components associated with dom 36 in another study the latter assertion was further affirmed as influent and effluent and the fpimax values demonstrated a strong correlation with the dom with a coefficient of determination r2 and p value reaching 0 912 and 0 01 respectively 37 against this backdrop fpimax was employed in this study to indicate the species and content of the refractory dom as illustrated in fig s3 in the supplementary file it could be seen that fpimax in the component affiliated to all samples exhibited high consistency compared to the influent it was found that removal of refractory dom within the usb stabled at 15 an indication of poor biodegradability of carbon cod content within the ll 3 3 microbial community structure as revealed by high throughput gene sequencing 3 3 1 diversity and richness of obtained sequences microbial communities and related structure within the inoculum s0 and sludge samples end of stage i x1 stage ii x2 stage iii x3 and stage iv x4 collected from the usb reactor while treating ll was probed using 16s rrna high throughput gene sequencing after sludge pretreatment dna extraction and pcr amplification and sequencing on the illumina platform filtered sequence reads obtained under a rejection rate of 0 1 mainly distributed in the range of 430 and 500 bp table 2 the total number of the operational taxonomic unit otu estimated by chao 1 in inoculum varied slightly from sludge samples obtained at the various stages of the usb operation based on 97 sequence identity otus secured for s0 x1 x2 x3 and x4 were 1627 1497 1607 1571 and 1276 respectively table 2 comparing reduction scenarios among inoculum and the usb sludge in terms of otu it was found that all sludges samples obtained from the usb had reduced possibly due to i washout phenomenon and or ii poor adaption of some bacterial goups to the operating condition employed in the usb employing statistical indicators such as shannon simpson inverse chao1 ace indices also revealed variation in microbial community dynamics of sludge obtained from usb as opposed to the inoculum table 2 shannon diversity is mostly employed on the account for microbial diversity characterization in terms of abundance and evenness of the species present 38 in this study the shannon index decrease from 5 54 s0 to 4 75 5 25 4 69 and 4 79 in x1 2 x3 and x4 respectively table 2 indicating microbial community structure had undergone some structural shift within the usb reactor notably both diversity shannon and simpsons and richness chao1 and ace index were highest in stage ii thus when do of 0 6 mg l was employed followed by stage iii and stage iv table 2 the observation made herein suggests that microbial diversity expanded under relatively high do implying that strict aerobic bacterial could not adapt to the low do 0 2 mg l supplied in the system thus autotroph bacteria found it tough to double their population under high do whereas heterotrophic bacteria were promoted 18 3 3 2 taxonomic classification and functional population assignments in the usb microbial community shift in terms of relative abundances was evaluated and presented in fig 4 at the phylum level it was found that microbial community structure within the inoculum varied from that observed in the usb sludge in terms of their relative abundances the illustration in fig 4a revealed that over 70 of the obtained sequences from the sludge samples s0 x1 x2 x3 and x4 belonged to proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria nitrospirae and ignavibacteriae fig 4a the most dominant phyla found in the inoculum s0 was proteobacteria 31 21 followed by planctomycetes 5 99 bacteroidetes 7 89 chloroflexi 9 93 ignavibacteriae 1 35 actinobacteria 4 62 and nitrospirae 0 04 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes have been mentioned as key players for both nitrogen removal and cod degradation bacteroidetes have explicitly been characterized as one of the most abundant heterotrophic groups observed in marine environments capable of degrading particulate organic matter especially with particulates high molecular weight compounds 39 another study has also suggested that acidobacteria which has been seen in many wastewater treatment systems has a role in facilitating the reduction of nitrate and nitrite 40 coupled with these phyla planctomycetes is also established as a major player in nitrogen removal and also accounts for about 30 50 nitrogen gas produced in marine environments 41 observably the microbial community dynamics of sludge collected from the usb had changed significantly from the community structure associated with the inoculum suggesting various do levels employed in the respective stages of the usb operation had impacted on the microbial community structure fig 4a at the genus level the overall number of genera identified in the inoculum s0 was 243 as opposed to that of the reactor s sludge that ranged from 208 and 224 fig 4b out of these many taxa observed at the genus level 30 had their relative abundance 1 in at least one sample among the 30 genera observed the most dominant ones found in all sludge samples included candidatus kuenenia dechloromonas nitrosomonas ignavibacterium thermomonas truepera comamonas ottowia thauera nitrobacter and nitrospira fig 4b although community composition at all stages of the usb operation was very different from the inoculum it could be seen that aob hdb amxb and other cod removing bacteria dominated in the usb sludge compared to the inoculum dechloromonas denitrifiers nitrobacter and nitrospira nob had reduced in terms of population at the various stages of the usb operation whereas nitrosomonas thermomonas truepera and ottowia presented an increasing trend which was contrary to the former fig 4b furthermore it was noticed that candidatus kuenenia and comamonas flourished and were promoted under do of 0 2 mg l whiles inhibited when do of 0 6 mg l was employed several reports have captured the metabolic functions of ignavibacterium and bellilinea thus it is well established that ignavibacterium is a novel facultative anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium 42 whiles bellilinea are anaerobic fermenters capable of producing vfas 43 consequently it was observed that ignavibacterium bellilinea and truepera were the primary bacterial genera responsible for the removal of the biodegradable cod witnessed in this study on the overall it could be deduced that the observable variations in the genus composition at the various stages of the usb operation were attributed to the implemented do as the microbial community dynamics were hugely impacted which subsequently influenced treatment performance of the snap process as illustrated in fig 4b the key functional genera within the microbial ecology at each stage of the usb operation included aob hdb amxb nob and other cod degrading bacteria comparatively the relative abundance of heterotrophic bacteria observed in this study was relatively more as opposed to the autotrophic nitrogen removal bacteria amazingly only one type of anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia was revealed at the genus level fig 4b however their relative abundances within the usb varied markedly among the sludge samples picked at each stage of the usb operation as depicted in fig 4b the abundance of candidatus kuenenia in s0 x1 x2 x3 and x4 was 7 68 8 99 4 21 4 61 and 9 65 respectively it could be seen that when do of 0 2 mg l was implemented in stage i and stage iv amxb growth increased by 17 31 and 25 65 respectively on the other hand candidatus kuenenia decreased in population by 45 18 and 39 97 at do of 0 6 mg l stage ii and 0 4 mg l stage iii respectively although the relative abundance of amxb reduced significantly in stage ii and stage iii mainly due to the elevated do fig 4b the acute reduction in the relative abundance of the anammox microbes could closely be linked with the poor nitrogen removal efficiency witnessed at stages ii and iii of the usb operation fig 2 regardless of the reduction phenomenon observed with candidatus kuenenia based on the inhibition and impairment of the do this anammox genus restored its dominance in stage iv when do of 0 2 mg l was re introduced in the usb fig 4b an indication that anammox bacterial could not withstand do 0 2 mg l 44 in terms of nitrifying bacteria genera belonging to aob and nob that have been discussed in other reports as key players responsible for nitrogen removal were also observable in varying proportions in the inoculum and usb sludge 45 the aob genera observed in microbial communities within the inoculum and sludge obtained at stage i ii iii and iv belonged to nitrosomonas and sphingomonas with the proportion of 4 65 and 0 03 in s0 5 64 and 1 65 in x1 7 54 and 0 11 in x2 8 01 and 0 05 in x3 and 7 95 and 2 01 in x4 respectively fig 4b clearly when the relative abundance of aob in the inoculum was compared to that in the usb it could be seen that aob was promoted under all do conditions exploited in this study fig 4b suggesting nitrite accumulation could be stably maintained to perform partial nitritation rather than nitrification within the usb interestingly other nitrifying genera belonging to nob were mainly nitrospira and nitrobacter but their abundances reduced significantly within the usb suggesting the operational do ranging from 0 2 0 6 mg l was not suitable or sufficient to sustain their existence 46 nitrobacter reduced from 2 64 in inoculum to 0 05 0 91 0 42 and 0 03 in stage i stage ii stage iii and stage iv respectively as well as nitrospira reducing from 4 07 in inoculum to 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 02 in stage i stage ii stage iii and stage iv respectively these genera accorded with the ammonia conversion profile observed during the usb operation fig 2 besides anammox and nitrifiers revealed by the gene sequencing approach heterotrophic denitrifiers were also visible within the microbial consortia with higher concentrations fig 4b denitrifiers were the predominant genera within the usb with sixteen of them being more pronounced among the total genera detected these key denitrifiers include thermogutta caldimonas comamonas dechloromonas defluviimonas hyphomicrobium mesorhizobium ottowia pseudomonas rheinheimera rhodopseudomonas thauera thermomonas thiobacillus gemmatimonas bacillus fig 4b the total relative abundance of denitrifiers in s0 x1 x2 x3 and x4 was 22 98 24 04 28 33 22 21 and 25 99 respectively fig 5 which partly accounted for the nitrogen removal mechanism observed in the usb fig 2 besides other cod degrading bacteria including bellilinea 47 ignavibacterium 48 and truepera were also in the usb although ignavibacterium and thauera have been reported to have cod degrading and denitrification capabilities respectively it is also established that these genera could simultaneously perform nitrogen and carbon removal 49 3 3 3 pollutant removal mechanism within the usb via snap process regarding the microbial community structure fig 4 revealed by the 16s rrna gene sequencing and the removal profiles illustrated in fig 3 it could be deduced that the snap process was attained based on the synergistic relationship between key functional genera including aob amxb hdb and cod degrading bacteria these genera were believed to have performed processes including i partial nitrification ii and heterotrophic denitrification iii autotrophic denitrification in the microaerobic process treating ll 50 reports have established that the most significant factor that propels snap process is mainly dependent on the do gradient profile within the sludge bed 51 consequently the do gradient established in the present usb reactor created a microaerobic condition and anoxic environment which subsequently supported and promoted the growth of aob amxb hdb and cod degrading bacteria 51 52 as heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria has the potential to survive environments ranging from aerobic to anaerobic it was no surprise that denitrifiers proportion was dominant at all stages of this study irrespective of the do 0 2 0 6 mg l supplied in the reactor fig 5 nitrogen removal was poor in stages ii and iii indicating denitrifiers activity was inhibited due to insufficient biodegradable organics in the ll in term of anammox bacteria amxb and aob the study revealed that candidatus kuenenia as the main amxb in the usb at stage i x1 stage ii x2 stage iii x3 and stage iv x4 accounting for 8 99 4 21 4 61 and 9 65 respectively figs 4b and 5 whereas aobs grew from 4 68 to a 7 29 in stage i and subsequently maintained its relative abundances in the range of 7 29 9 96 throughout the stages of operation of the usb anammox bacteria was inhibited under do stress in stages ii and iii nobs were significantly out selected or inhibited at all stages as their ratio dropped hugely from 6 71 in the inoculum to 0 07 0 93 0 44 and 0 05 at stage i x1 stage ii x2 stage iii x3 and stage iv x4 respectively although nob abundance only reached 0 05 in stage iv their presence contributed to the short lived nitrate accumulation observed in the stage iv by competing with candidatus kuenenia for nitrite in the usb based on the reported community structure it was found that bacteria responsible for partial nitritation heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification and cod degradation coexisted for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and biodegradable cod within the usb reactor thus synergistic interaction among aob hdb amxb and cod degraders were promoted under do of 0 2 mg l employed in a snap process to achieve both nitrogen and cod removal 3 4 morphology of sludge obtained at various stages to ascertain the effect of heavy metal presence in the ll on the microbial activities and related nitrogen removal performance sem edx was employed to investigate changes in the morphology of sludge seed sludge s0 end of stage ii x2 and stage iv x4 as illustrated in fig 6 the sem micrograph and edx revealed sludge granulations and biosorption of heavy metals within the different bacteria structures of the sludge samples compared to the inoculum fig 6a sludge samples x2 and x4 obtained from the ubs were more densely packed and abundant in spherical bacteria cells fig 6c and e wang zhang and coworkers earlier established that spherical cells are mostly aob or anammox indicating that the densely packed nature of the sludge due to the abundance eps may be the most contributing factor which had supported the retention of aob and anammox in the usb 7 53 eps was observable within sludge cells suspected to evolve some defense mechanisms to bacteria cells against external inhibitions such as heavy metals 54 this phenomenon subsequently benefited anammox bacteria to persevere metal toxicity leading to improved nitrogen removal performance in stages ii and iv although numerous benefits abound the presence or production of the eps to the bacterial diversity in the usb high eps content or excessive eps production may also pose significant challenges such as mass transfer resistance 55 and thereby leading to inadequate nitrogen removal in the snap process compared to the elements found on the inoculum x0 surface al ti fe p and as increased their weight in x1 and x2 as revealed by edx spectra and illustrated in fig 6 on the other hand the presence of the heavy metals showed no inhibition effect on the sludge samples indicating microbial communities could utilize important elements for their growth or perform biosorption of the metals within the sludge body mass table s2 3 5 evolution of eps as revealed by confocal laser scanning microscope to further explore the effect of metals within ll on microbial communities eps distribution in sludge samples inoculum s0 and sludge obtained at the end of stage iv x4 were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscope clsm and presented fig 7 a three main types of eps components were studied viz protein α polysaccharide and β polysaccharide it has been reported that blue green and red regions on a clsm image indicated β polysaccharide α polysaccharide and protein respectively 20 as shown in fig 7 a i iii eps β polysaccharide α polysaccharide and protein in s0 was uniformly distributed over the observed region suggesting the inoculum was mainly flocs which had no granules again the color code revealed that the inoculum body mass was mainly dominated by α polysaccharide and protein as opposed to β polysaccharide fig 7a i iii the observation made in this study corroborated with earlier published reports where protein and polysaccharide were reported as the dominant eps distributed in the core of the activated sludge flocs with no trace of coating 56 however the distribution of eps within the x4 sludge was in direct contrast to the inoculum as blue green and red stains were conspicuously concentrated on the outer surface of the sludge granules fig 7b i iii 20 although the required stains were more visible on the outer surface of the granules it was also evident that β polysaccharide was more concentrated in the periphery of the granular sludge whereas protein and α polysaccharide were primarily distributed in the inner layer furthermore the blue stain was more prominent as opposed to the red and green stains indicating β polysaccharide content was the most dominant eps in on the sludge granules the observable distribution of eps on the circumference of the sludge granules revealed a defense mechanism put up by microbes against metal toxicity expected to inhibit the snap process and its related microbes the result further suggested that microbes could produce ample eps to counter any adverse effect from the environments 57 4 conclusion synchronous nitrogen and carbon removal from ll using snap process under microaerobic condition was explored and reported at steady state 99 5 nh4 n 94 3 tn and 31 04 cod removals were concurrently achieved when reactor do of 0 2 mg l and nlr ranging 0 31 1 84 kg m3 d was employed conversely with do of 0 6 mg l nitrogen removal reduced significantly 20 whereas no2 n accumulation increased 98 68 along with inhibition of anammox bacterial amxb activities high throughput gene sequencing revealed coexistence and synergistic activities among ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas and sphingomonas amxb candidatus kuenenia heterotrophic denitrifiers hdb comamonas dechloromonas and cod degrading bacteria bellilinea ignavibacterium within the snap process while treating ll sludge morphology revealed by sem edx and clsm indicated that biomass comprised of granulated sludge embedded in extracellular polymeric substances but this was suspected as a defense mechanism initiated by microbes against heavy metals toxicity the snap process demonstrated promising cost efficient nitrogen and carbon removal from ll declaration of competing interest the authors

13797,sanitation is the basic quality index of life and proper sanitation practices play a vital role in maintaining the hygienic conditions use of human waste urine and faeces as a substrate for microbial oxidation is found to be sustainable approach towards improving the sanitation facilities advancement in microbial fuel cell mfc system towards field scale application for treatment of human waste is restricted by several technological social economical material science and bio electrochemical limitations however recently developed pee power urinal and bioelectric toilet demonstrated the field scale applicability of mfc for human waste treatment and simultaneous electricity generation for onsite use this review mainly focuses on suitability and applicability of human waste as a substrate in mfc to improve the sanitation facilities and also the challenges faced while scaling up of this system for field applications are being discussed along with possible solutions recent advancement towards field scale application of mfc demonstrated that this technology is getting ready for the commercialization in sanitation infrastructure keywords bioelectric toilet field application human waste treatment microbial fuel cells sanitation scaling up 1 introduction sanitation practices in any region determine the quality of human life and its development index most rural people in developing countries are lacking adequate sanitation facilities and a large portion of the population is living without access to hygienic life conditions earlier report on sanitation presents that the developing countries are going to face severe sanitation issues in the upcoming decades 1 rapidly developing countries are missed out on having enough onsite sanitation facilities for almost 40 50 of its total population 2 residents in rural communities are forced to defecate out in the open due to lack of toilet facilities this leads to health problem as well as raises concerns about environment and results into water contamination climate change possess risk of heavy rain as well as flooding conditions and risks to water and sanitation services with damage to infrastructure due to adverse climatic condition results in changes in quality of water in the sources and thus affecting the human health in present scenario more than 35 of worldwide population is lacking with adequate water supply lack of toilet facilities nearby houses and drainage services in addition to the lack of electricity supply most of waterborne diseases originate from consumption of contaminated potable water due to untreated human waste disposal unacceptable onsite sanitation and lack of awareness on personal hygiene facilities proper sanitation practices are crucial from the health perspective and also for the protection of water quality in general at present different types of onsite sanitation practices are adopted which are not properly managed and leads to pollution of water bodies several new initiative programs have been recently launched in developing and developed countries to construct the toilets and to make open defecation free for improving the sanitation index of people with great success 3 4 though millions of toilet superstructures have been built in last few years with the aim to provide access to sanitation which has reasonably solved the social problem however at most of the places solution for treatment of the waste generated from toilet is not provided hence the environmental challenges still persist as before 1 1 conventional onsite sanitation practices improper management of human waste causes environmental pollution unpleasant odour growth and multiplication of insects rodents and may lead to transmission of waterborne diseases such as typhoid cholera etc at present different types of in situ sanitation strategies are favoured in rural communities such as aqua privy and soak pit privy latrine with bore hole dug well latrines conventional septic tank cst with soak pit arrangement composting toilets etc these practices if not properly managed are responsible for contamination of water bodies table 1 apart from various decentralized sanitation systems conventional septic tank system with soak pit arrangement is most widely used in urban and rural part which offers sludge settling for longer duration in sedimentation pit in other words a septic tank is a combined sedimentation cum digestion tank for these settled solids the septic tank is only able to remove about 30 40 of organic matter from sewage by anaerobic digestion and leftover organics as well as pathogens are disposed to the environment without any treatment for achieving higher treatment efficiency there is an urgent need to design the conventional septic tank system in more effective and efficient way with additional provisions to address the above mentioned issues 5 1 2 human waste as an energy source human waste is a waste product generated during digestion of food in human body which contains human faeces and urine it is usually considered as a bio waste and can be a vector for viral and bacterial diseases generally human excreta contains high amount of carbonaceous compounds and about 50 70 g cod chemical oxygen demand is present in human waste generated per capita per day 6 in addition energy content value for mixed wastewater is reported as approximately 14 7 kj g cod 6 7 taken together black water or urine plus faeces have annual nutrient content of 4 5 kg of nitrogen and 0 55 kg of phosphorus per capita 8 human waste contains energy which is approximately equal to the energy stored in coal 9 by theoretical consideration the per capita generated human waste will be able to produce approximately 25 w power and for a family of four about 100 w power can be produced which is enough energy to illuminate incandescent light bulbs 9 additionally faecal sludge after composting contains organic material and nutrients which can be useful as fertilizer and soil conditioning agent after processing 10 11 considering the high energy content of human faeces and nitrogen rich urine it can be considered as a valuable and renewable energy source for electricity production and energy recovery as per the composition of wastewater major nitrogen about 75 and phosphorous about 50 load to centralized municipal sewage treatment plant is contributed by human urine and wastewater received from toilets 10 however urine only contributes about 1 2 of the total volume of wastewater received at treatment plant 10 thus human urine is a potential candidate for recovery of precious resource for nutrient i e struvite and energy due to its high nutrient contents which is otherwise a major pollutant if discharged into water bodies without any further treatment during conventional onsite sanitation practices about 50 60 of organic matter and nutrients are directly disposed to water streams without treatment and hence losing the energy value of human waste existing septic tank is not capable to deal with high wastewater treatment efficiency and to facilitate resource recovery options hence septic tank system need to be designed from engineering perspectives to harvest the energy from human waste with improving the organic matter removal by integrating it with upcoming advanced treatment system like microbial fuel cell mfc in this direction present review focused on application of mfc coupled with septic tank for onsite treatment of human waste in addition the recent advancement in this research and scaling up challenges faced by this system while implementing at field scale are discussed 2 microbial fuel cells towards sanitation 2 1 microbial fuel cell for energy harvesting and resource recovery for utilization of wastewater as a potential renewable energy resource attention is being paid by researchers on the development of waste to energy recovery techniques 12 the mfc is one of such waste to energy recovery system which converts energy stored in organics from waste substrate into electrical output by employing the bacteria as a biocatalyst through various electrochemical redox reactions 13 18 effluents varying from monomer sugars i e acetate glucose to composite industrial wastewater as well as lignocellulosic effluent can be treated in this biofuel cell 18 20 whereas potential source i e human faeces have not been much exploited in mfc along with the treatment of complex industrial wastewater few reports are available on treatment of human excreta 9 and urine 21 23 in mfc previously cow dung cow s urine swine wastewater elephant s urine artificial human wastes have been successfully demonstrated to be effectively treated in mfcs 24 similar to animal waste human excreta and urine contain high carbon and nutrient however pharmaceutical residual compounds and pathogenic load are major additional concern present in human waste which increase the complexity of human waste treatment considering the energy value human waste contains significant amount of organic as well as nutrient compounds ammonium nitrogen present in urine 25 about 2 urea by weight is available in human urine in urea compound four hydrogen atoms per molecule of urea are chemically bounded in loose structure to the molecule as compared to protons in water breaking of such chemical bonds needs minimal input energy and generates protons and electrons more effectively in electrochemical reactions 24 similarly human faeces contains high amount of carbonaceous compounds which can release electrons during microbial oxidation these electrons are being harvested through external electrical load bearing circuit in mfc to produce direct current fig 1 even the sludge settled in septic tank can be effectively hydrolyzed and utilized as a feed source for biocatalytic oxidation in mfc 26 thus during projection of sanitation from improved to sustainable sanitation in circular economy by adopting this bioelectrochemical technology human waste shall not be considered as harmful waste and shall be considered as the precious resource that can be reutilized 27 concerning the implementation potential of mfc technology for practical application it can be suitable either in sewage treatment plant or onsite sanitation facilities ge and he 28 tested 96 modules of mfcs having capacity of 200 l for treatment of primary effluent received at local common effluent treatment plant however low power output variation in wastewater characteristics and complexity in design made the system complicated for operation such limitations can be minimized by implementing the mfc for treatment of waste generated from toilet system with using novel cathode catalysts having higher catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions orr as well as using advanced power management system and suitable engineering design of the system to reduce the complexity of substrate flow distribution thus implementing the mfc in septic tank system new or existing is a feasible solution for improved sanitation facilities considering the simple substrate with nearly constant flow implementing mfc for human waste treatment can help in ecological and improved sanitation facilities mostly for rural areas along with generating electricity already mfcs have been operated at pilot scale using either synthetic acetate based substrate 85 l mfc 29 and real municipal wastewater 255 l mfc 30 2 2 bio electrochemical septic tank system bio electrochemical septic tank or bioelectric toilet bet system is a novel mfc technology in which human excreta and faecal sludge can be used as feedstock for microbial oxidation to harvest bioelectricity during treatment 5 fig 1 this system is capable to oxidize the organic matter present in human waste 31 it is a modification of cst and bioelectrochemical system provided with power management system pms the csts are lacking with energy harvesting capability hence these additional features are recommended for rural part having no supply of electricity advanced pms is generally used to store the charge generated from individual mfc units and releases it in series parallel connections depending on use for electric appliances it consists of charge pump supercapacitor boost converter and electric circuitry as well as charge control circuit 32 charge control circuit controls the flow of charge from stronger cell to weaker cell and thus restricts the voltage reversal to some extent supercapacitor and booster in pms take care of fluctuations in charge and current generated against change in operating conditions in anodic chamber of mfc such bet system with advanced pms once developed can be used by individuals and community houses for managing waste generated from toilet and generating onsite electricity 5 the concept of stacked bet mfc with capacity of 100 l was successfully tested for treatment of human waste received from hostels at indian institute of technology iit kharagpur and it demonstrated about 87 92 of organic matter removal efficiency and showed its application for charging mobile battery and illuminated light emission diode led bulbs by using harvested electricity 33 this bet system was constructed with acrylic material having 36 modules of separator electrode assemblies and modified clayware battery separators and it was operated in up flow mode with continuous supply of wastewater collected from septic tank 33 34 for field application the largest bioelectric toilet mfc of 1 5 m3 capacity was developed at iit kharagpur india for treatment of human waste along with generation of electricity the system designed consists of hexagonal middle settling chamber and 5 outer anodic chambers with air cathode arrangement and sixth one chlorinated aqueous cathodic chamber this system is built up of total 49 pairs of separator electrode assemblies made with carbon felt as both anode and cathode electrode material and modified clayware ceramic tile with 20 montmorillonite cation exchanger as separator fig 2 it is one of the largest mfc design in the world fabricated using fibre reinforced plastic material and employing various cathode catalysts to enhance the performance and it is reported to be under successful continuous operation for past three years 35 this mfc system was capable to remove about 5 6 log scale pathogens from anodic treated effluent using hypochlorite dosing in the final aqueous cathodic chamber fig 2 the harvested electrical energy is reported to be capable of powering the led bulbs for illumination whenever needed during night as well as served as external power supply for small electronic appliances hexagonal design with six peripheral chambers provided with multiple separator electrode assembly is one of the best configurations proposed for mfc design for practical applications to permit the proper substrate distribution and with provision for disinfection in final chamber to facilitate the reuse of treated effluent for toilet flushing purpose 33 on asimilar design another mfc of 720 l capacity treating human excreta was successfully demonstrated at national thermal power corporation ntpc noida india site for onsite sanitation 36 such self sustained bioelectric toilet has additional facilities to use energy from solar panel for pumping the treated water to the water tank placed above the toilet to be able to use it for flushing as and when required the bet is a sustainable field scale demonstration of mfc technology where treatment of human waste organic carbon removal eq 1 reuse recycle of treated water and simultaneous electricity generation for illuminating toilet at night time are being achieved oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen gas under anoxic conditions eq 2 and sulphide to elemental sulphur eq 3 eliminate the odour problem in this system 5 hypochlorite is used as disinfectant in the final aqueous cathodic chamber of this system to deal with pathogens from effluent eq 4 37 the detailed electrochemical redox reaction mechanisms for removal of organic carbon nitrogen sulphur and pathogens in mfc are represented in eqs 1 5 sludge generation is very less in this system and such sludge can be used as compost manure and fertilizer these incentives will encourage adaptation and proliferation of this mfc based latrine waste management system as its products can be monetized for economic benefit electrochemical reactions occurring in mfc 1 carbon removal ch3cooh 2h2o 2co2 8h 8e 2 ammonium n

conventional onsite treatment systems at present various types of decentralized sanitation practices are utilized in rural areas viz aqua privy soak pit privy bore hole latrine deep dug well latrines septic tank biotoilet composting toilets etc 38 41 septic tank is only able to remove organic matter of about 30 40 from slurry and the treatment efficiency was improved up to 90 along with bio electricity generation when cst is modified with bioelectric toilets also energy generation capability and disinfection treatment for effluent in cathodic chamber of mfc make it superior as compared to septic tank 5 37 from construction point of view bio electrochemical septic tank system require less area for construction than cst as it replaces soak pits with mfc table 1 also effluent treated after disinfection in mfc can be safely reused for toilet flushing thus reducing overall water consumption in toilet this bet mfc system minimizes the environmental footprint minimizes the smell no spoiling of environment or groundwater and doesn t need any external energy when compared to conventional sanitation practices like composting toilet sludge generated from mfc systems can be utilized for compost and fertilizer application table 1 summarizes the benefits and drawbacks of conventional onsite sanitation practices and bioelectric toilet system the bio toilet system developed by defence research and development organisation drdo scientists for indian railways is an eco friendly waste management approach which reduces the solid human waste to biogas and treated water with the help of bacterial inoculum 41 however it has its own disadvantages such as biogas emission handling sludge volume no possibility of energy or electricity recovery etc which limits its use as compared to bio electrochemical septic tank system table 1 thus dual purpose of elatrine or green latrine or bioelectric toilet make them more competitive over other options of decentralized sanitation treatment systems the advantages discussed above offers superiority of this technology over other existing technologies 4 application of mfc for sanitation from last 100 years of research several scientific and technological developments have contributed for moving forward the mfc technology towards the commercialization considering the present status of mfc research field application of this technology is constrained by low power output and fabrication cost associated with it field application of mfc can be suitable and feasible option for sustainable sanitation application to overcome the low treatment efficiency of presently adopted cst system in addition human waste excreta and urine can be considered as a sustainable yellow gold substrate for application in mfc to harvest electricity during effective wastewater treatment along with by product recovery fig 3 and facilitate the reuse of treated water fig 3 represents various aspects of utilizing human waste in mfc such ecofriendly bio electrochemical system is proposed as independent and renewable energy source from the perspective of sustainable sanitation environmental aspects and public health as with the sediment mfcs the field application of mfcs for sanitation can only be feasible and realistic solution if septic tank systems are modified with advanced bio electrochemical system thus this newly developed bio electrochemical technology can become viable alternative for the efficient and sustainable sanitation along with recovery of bio energy such bet technology can offer effective organic matter removal nutrient removal sulfur removal disinfection treatment to the effluent efficient faecal sludge degradation odour removal and valuable resource recovery along with generating the power to operate the led bulbs biosensors and different electronic appliances 5 4 1 urine treatment and resource recovery in mfc as discussed earlier possibility of recovery of resources i e n p k and energy can be explored from urine which is otherwise a pollutant if discharged in to the environment without treatment 10 42 the chemical energy present in urine can either be recovered in the form of electricity in mfc or as hydrogen gas during electrolysis in microbial electrolysis cell mec by imposing external potential 10 43 with recent development in microbial electrochemical systems mfc mec can provide innovative solution for treatment of urine 12 such urine waste to energy approach for bioelectricity generation in mfc has been reported in recent years 19 and research continued for practical applications to charge the mobile phone battery using stacked arrangement of mfc units 43 from resource recovery point of view zang et al 44 reported novel approach of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o recovery and energy generation from human urine using 3 stage integrated mfc system ammonium recovery and simultaneous energy recovery was achieved by kuntke et al 10 using real and synthetic urine in mfc additionally ieropoulos et al 43 tested the artificial urine in 1 ml mfc which produced net power output of 962 94 mw m3 in 2016 ieropoulos and team 45 conducted the field trial of pee power urinal and obtained a maximum power of 800 mw when light was connected directly to about 432 mfc units and cod removal efficiency higher than 95 was demonstrated by this system this study was the first attempt towards field trial of mfc for wastewater generated from urinal and confirmed the adaptability of mfcs for simultaneous electricity harvesting and direct urine treatment since then urine is widely used as substrate in mfc for ammonia recovery 46 magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitation 47 in situ pathogen killing 48 21 struvite recovery 49 and long term sustainable power source 50 4 2 human excreta as a substrate in mfc disposing human excreta through mfc can treat the waste generated from toilet and recover electrical power simultaneously 51 to harvest the potential energy from human waste kretzschmar et al 52 designed elatrine mfc with low cost corrugated cardboard as an electrode material using human faeces as a substrate during anodic oxidation initial study of perlow 9 on mfc treating such waste through microbial oxidation generated low open circuit voltage of 200 mv from contaminant degradation point of view dual chamber mfc treating actual human waste was capable to remove the total chemical oxygen demand tcod soluble cod and nh4 by 71 88 and 44 along with power generation of 70 8 mw m2 53 similarly cubical shaped dual chambered mfc developed by li et al 54 showed that a maximum power of 251 mw m2 was produced when faeces wastewater was fed to the anodic chamber power density of 142 6 71 mw m2 was harvested when three units of air cathode column mfcs were connected in stack arrangement during treatment of wastewater received at septic tank 55 recently leton et al 56 utilized septage wastewater in 20 l mfc and achieved 99 8 86 4 and 82 8 of total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod and nitrate removal efficiencies when operated at 1000 ω external resistance bacterial sp pseudomonas otitidis aatb4 isolated from septic tank wastewater showed current density of 800 ma m2 with coulombic efficiency ce of 15 in plexiglass mfc 57 thus few attempts have been made by the researchers for harvesting the energy from human waste 9 58 however lower power output limits the scaling up of such mfcs 59 4 3 faecal sludge as substrate for mfc faecal sludge is semisolid slurry either undigested or partially digested and biomass generated from the process of collecting storing or treating the human excreta as well as blackwater which takes more time for degradation than human excreta 60 38 chemical energy stored in the organic matter of faecal sludge or activated sludge can be bio electrochemically converted into electrical energy through mfc technology during experimentation operating voltage of 0 45 0 65 v with ce of 1 5 4 3 was obtained in single chambered mfc treating faecal matter as substrate 61 additionally microbial population present in the faecal sludge itself can be used as electrogenic inoculum and no external seeding during start up of mfc will be required 62 4 4 resource recovery during human waste treatment urine is an ideal feed for bio electrochemical system and offers possibility to recover the key nutrients as well as hydrogen gas during its treatment 63 urine can be considered as a traditional balanced fertilizer due to its high concentration of nitrogen 21 g l of urea co nh2 2 for a total of 9 g n l phosphorous 0 7 g p l and potassium 2 g k l which are the main constituents in major commercial fertilizers 63 human urine can be utilized as fertilizer in the form of struvite and can be recovered during treatment in mfc additionally microbial electrochemical technologies mets proved the potential of n recovery in source separated urine 64 such ammonium n recovery concept was successfully demonstrated with a power output of 250 mw m2 3 5 mj kgn along with nh3 recovery rate of 3 3 g n m2 day 10 hybrid system by coupling mfc with electrodialysis can be capable of precipitating the nutrients n p and k in salt form which can be reused for fertilizer applications 65 struvite precipitation is one of the main strategies to recover nutrients from source separated urine jimenez et al 66 reported that hydrogen peroxide catholyte produced from mfc treating urine as fuel is effective in facilitating disinfection and can kill the pathogens in mec diluted urine was found to be a suitable feed for ammonium recovery and hydrogen production 67 similarly bio electrochemical system offers production of value added resources such as hydrogen hydrogen peroxide magnesium ammonium phosphate ethanol methane gaseous products nutrient recovery struvite as well as other multi carbon compounds along with effective treatment of human waste 68 the recovered resources from human waste during downstream processing can be useful for industrial applications as well as having fertilizer value 4 5 scaling up applications 4 5 1 faecal waste treatment scaling up application of mfc technology has been restricted due to several microbial electrochemical engineering economical material science and technological constraints 69 70 however by taking into account the low efficiencies of existing conventional onsite sanitation practices field application of this bioelectrochemical system can be feasible and practicable in the field of sanitation only by overcoming the scaling up limitations moving towards this direction concept of elatrine mfc was developed using low cost corrugated cardboard electrodes by kretzschmar et al 52 for utilizing human faeces as a substrate for microbial oxidation in 2009 du et al 71 used 1 l capacity mfc for treatment of human faeces the tcod and ammonium removal of 71 and 44 was achieved in dual chambered mfc operated for 190 h with maximum power generation of 70 8 mw m2 in another investigation the mfc fed with human faeces wastewater after fermentation pre treatment showed power density of 22 mw m2 which is 47 higher as compared to control mfc without providing fermentation pre treatment to substrate 71 the mfc based green latrine concept for treatment of human waste during microbial oxidation and generation of compost and electricity was deployed by castro et al 59 in agona nyakrom ghana however the power production from such unit was too low i e 0 268 mw m2 over period of 2 years of operation butler s pit latrine is similar to a battery having electrodes and the research work of mfc latrine was sponsored by the bill and melinda gates foundation 58 59 recently from stacked arrangement of mfcs deployed for treatment of wastewater generated from toilets of public housing a maximum power of 124 mw m3 was obtained at organic loading rate of 1 05 kg cod m3 day from these 15 cartridges of mfcs 72 cubic shaped dual chambered mfc was capable to produce a maximum power of 251 mw m2 while treating human faeces wastewater 54 table 2 summarizes the energy production reported from scaled up mfcs used for sanitation application novel concept of microbial electrochemical septic tank mest which is modified configuration of cst was developed by lin et al 73 74 for enhancing the performance of conventional system with minimal modifications along with electricity generation total phosphorous removal of 98 7 was achieved along with complete removal of sulfide in 1 l capacity mest operated at 25 c previously perlow 9 used human waste as a substrate for a field scale mfc implemented in uganda 2012 the power output from this unit was enough to make a small light blink this mfc designed cost around 20 us and demonstrated successful application of mfc in coupling with septic tank system 9 however low power output and associated capital cost made barrier for its practical use 4 5 2 urine treatment ieropoulos and colleagues 42 stacked the small sized 24 ceramic mfcs to utilize the output voltage for charging the mobile phone battery application of field trial of pee power urinal has confirmed the suitability of biological fuel cells for direct urine treatment and energy generation 45 one of the public urinals installed by same group for field trial at glastonbury the united kingdom s largest music festival generated sufficient electricity to illuminate the light of cubicle s led tubes using mfcs stacked arrangements these results showed mfc as an independent power source utilizing waste as renewable energy source in the perspective of sanitation as well as public health particularly for immense applications in the developing and developed nations also the concept of smart bioelectric toilet developed at iit kharagpur as discussed earlier promotes the commercialization and field application of hexagonal mfcs towards self sustained sanitation system 5 4 6 applications of septic tank mfcs as stated earlier mfc is a bioelectrochemical technology to harvest electricity recover the valuable by products offers post treatment option for disinfection nutrient and organics removal sludge manuring as well as power source during treatment of human waste further first innovative design of self sustainable wearable mfc assembled within a pair of socks and manual foot pump was demonstrated by taghavi et al 75 which is used as an energy source for operating the transportable electronic appliances urine is well known as the fuel substrate for mfc and natural walking as the physical pumping for driving such fuels thus the power generated from such wearable urine fed mfc can be capable for powering the portable and wearable electronic appliances 76 novel origami tetrahedron design of mfcs using photocopier paper was capable to power the portable emergency locator transmitter reporting system 77 pilot scale bioelectric toilet of 100 l capacity was able to operate the photodiode sensors which can be used for security alarm system 5 ieropoulos and his team from bristol university uk developed first artificial muscle driven pump artificial heartbeat actuator and mfc powered robots ecobots system to be powered by mfc treating urine as a substrate 78 such mfcs can be suitable for space applications as well as refugee camps astronaut space applications robotics applications and rural parts of developing country for simultaneous human waste treatment and electricity generation 5 economic and energy analysis of mfc for sanitation as per experimental investigation carried out initial investment of rs 329 000 4386 including electrode material and toilet assembly fabrication cost will be required to develop the bioelectric toilet mfc of 1 5 m3 capacity that is designed for family of 5 persons for lifespan of 10 years whereas total initial fixed cost of rs 83 000 1106 will be required for constructing the conventional septic tank system with soak pit arrangement 5 considering the 10 year lifespan overall estimated cost of about 1 to 2 required for treatment of 1 kl of wastewater received from septic tank though the bioelectric toilet unit has higher cost of fabrication however considering the saving in terms of water consumption and facilitating the reuse of treated water and generation of electricity for onsite illumination a payback period of 10 years is estimated for such system 5 with large scale production of this system the capital cost is expected to get reduced and thus it is expected that such system can be economically sustainable and feasible solution however total operational cost for bet mfc per annum will be compensated if the ce more than 5 7 can be maintained moreover bet mfc offers higher cod removal efficiency upto 80 85 surplus energy recovery water saving low area requirement as well as treated effluent can be reused for flushing and other uses which will further avoid the groundwater contamination with proper design and selection of efficient materials for its fabrication so as to maintain ce above 6 then the mfc can be an energy neutral or energy gaining system 79 a solar power operated pump can be utilized to pump the treated effluent for flushing purpose in overhead tanks of the toilet 6 scaling up issues and challenges for practical application of mfc the performance of mfc mainly depends upon electrode material design aspects inoculum conditions wastewater characteristics operating conditions and other parameters scaling up of such technology is a multidisciplinary approach related to material science electrochemistry biotechnology economics environmental engineering chemical engineering and applied engineering fields therefore scaling up and practical application of such biofuel cell is restricted by several electrochemical and microbiological constraints engineering aspects economic challenges and other operational problems as stated in table 3 6 1 scaling up and stacked arrangement from practical perspective of mfc for contaminant removal and energy recovery mfc can be scaled up with increasing the size of reactor or number of units can be connected together in electrically stacked arrangement of electrodes either in series or parallel connections however power density proportionally decreased with enlargement of reactor size also electrochemistry and charge utilization does not support with increase in size beyond certain limit hence number of mfc units can be stacked together in series or parallel connections and total charge harvested can be stored in power management system moreover issue of voltage reversal in stacked mfcs resulted into dropdown in power performance also monitoring and analyzing the results of number of mfc units are tremendous job and at the same time to ensure that no voltage reversal occurs in this stack is a bigger challenge therefore multiplicity of mfc units with modularity is a way forward to minimize the mass transport losses and ohmic resistance against enlarging the size of individual units 80 6 2 electrochemical limitations theoretically mfc can produce anodic half cell potential of 0 3 v and cathodic half cell potential of 0 8 v while using oxygen as cathodic terminal electron acceptor to obtain overall maximum voltage of 1 1 v however in reality voltage obtained from mfc is too low and could be up to 0 8 v in open circuit condition and about 0 6 to 0 7 v in external load conditions due to various polarization losses such as ohmic activation concentration and bacterial metabolism losses even with use of novel and efficient cathodic catalysts minimizing the cathodic overpotential is still a challenge such low voltage generated is unable to operate the electronic appliances or to serve as an energy source to make it a feasible solution number of mfc units need to be connected in stacked arrangement which further leads to voltage reversal in mfcs voltage reversal occurred in mfcs connected in series due to non spontaneous anodic overpotential in some of mfcs that has retarded anodic reaction kinetics due to mass diffusion limitations 81 6 3 microbiological restrictions the performance of mfc is majorly governed by activities of bacteria in anodic chamber and electron transfer mechanism during redox reactions 82 field scale application of mfc for contaminant degradation requires in depth understanding of bacteria and biochemical metabolic and electron transfer pathways followed by electrogenic populations 83 till date understanding of physiology of most of electrogens and its electron transfer mechanism is unknown to research community and need to be addressed for field scale application of mfc 84 70 for upcoming future needs more emphasis should be given on microbial constraints which will likely lead to significant advances in taking mfc technology forward from the laboratory designs to the pilot scale and beyond as well as to make it competitive with existing conventional wastewater treatment processes 85 6 4 material cost and efficiency recent advancement in electrode material development of novel efficient cathode catalysts design of mfc architecture and low cost membrane made fabrication of mfc somewhat economical however success of field scale mfc depends upon cost economics and energy analysis from fuel cell point of view several cathode catalysts metal doped catalyst and other modifications have been reported earlier however these modifications may not be realistic solution for field application due to high cost associated in its synthesis 85 86 a novel low cost separator material such ceramic clayware and modified cement can be alternatives for expensive polymeric membranes however its mechanical strength electrochemical properties as well as long term stability still need to be improved the development of inexpensive highly proton transferable and long term stable separator materials are very significant aspects for practicability of mfcs in the future 86 6 5 fluid dynamics flow dynamics of wastewater in reactor is important aspect as it controls the mass transport in the anodic chamber uneven distribution of substrate throughout the reactor can result in non uniform contact of wastewater with anodic biofilm and hence increase the mass transport resistance the homogeneity of fluid flow relies on the intensity of mixing and its pattern which can be improved by mechanical mixing 87 proper mixing of substrate and ensuring uniform distribution of it to the entire anode surface area is possible in the lab scale reactors however this can be faced as a challenge in large scale mfc system mixing of substrate can be done by providing the upflow mode of substrate i e wastewater addition in individual chamber of bet mfc additionally it ensured that the reactor design and fluid dynamics permit proper distribution of substrate in anodic chamber of mfc hence proper architectural design of the scaled up system is equally essential to ensure this to obtain similar performance in such larger system as obtained in small bench top mfcs 6 6 engineering aspects enlarging the size of anodic chamber is essential for making mfc capable to handle the large flow of wastewater however it increases the complexity of architecture and design of reactor over last decade mfc technology has grown surprisingly in almost each dimension including contaminant degradation capacity energy production capability and cost optimization however its architectural design is main governing constraint for practical applications compact design with cascade arrangement of electrodes could be a possible preferred architecture for scaling up of this system 34 also selection of electrode material membrane electrode spacing leads to lower down the economics of the mfc 88 6 7 economic challenges modernization in the design of new mfcs has been motivated with outcome of drastic improvement in power output as well as reduction in overall capital cost investment to be on safe cost benefit ratio 87 most of the cost in mfc fabrication is contributed by membrane electrode catalyst and current collectors for which low cost alternatives need to be find out economic analysis conducted recently by trapero et al 89 showed that mfc is more profitable and commercially viable option as compared to conventional activated sludge process in spite of even the costly pt c catalyst used in the cathode also energy and valuable resources recovery benefits make it sustainable option over conventional wastewater treatment system in present scenario more focus has been given to make mfc as self sufficient and energy positive system for wastewater treatment over conventional anaerobic treatment processes 90 however significant numerous challenges need to be addressed before mfcs shall fulfill their potential as a multibillion dollar global market scenario 6 8 system complexity mfc is a multidisciplinary technology in which contribution of electrochemistry biotechnology material science environmental chemistry chemical engineering and other applied engineering fields is essential to make it successful wastewater treatment system during treatment of real industrial wastewaters operating conditions such heavy metal content ph organic loading rate etc and toxicity offered to the bacterial metabolism because of presence of some of the ingredients may lead to poor performance of mfc and hence operating conditions need to be optimized in laboratory scale mfcs before going for scaling up trials even in field applications mfc is exposed to unpredictable fluctuations in the environment of real wastewater which is expected to change its performance drastically 87 present issues about variation in wastewater characteristics odour problem aesthetic value to utilize the resources recovered from human excreta use of antimicrobial disinfection chemicals for washing make mfc system more complicated and need to be taken care while dealing with biological communities 6 9 operational problems and issues handling large amount of wastewater flow and ensuring its uniform distribution to the number of mfcs used is a challenging task while going for field applications considering the longevity of operation fouling of membrane by biological and chemical means need to be taken into account to maintain the stable performance of mfcs for long in addition to this leakage in reactor clogging of effluent pipelines substrate diffusion unavailability of skilled labour for operation and maintenance are few operational challenges in most of clayware mfcs biomass sludge granule formation occurred in the anodic chamber particularly when operated in up flow mode and washing out of excess anodic biofilm can lead to the clogging of the effluent pipelines 85 formation of sludge blanket in anodic chamber also promotes the growth of methanogenic populations and decrease the power generation from mfc during long term operation 29 5 a proper strategy is required to be brought out for suppressing such methanogenesis in mfc at the same time which will be environmental friendly affordable and implementable under onsite conditions 6 10 commercialization system stability and reliability commercialization of mfc technology is still a challenge due to robustness and lack of reproducibility of results as well as system stability issues the risk related to commercialization of biofuel cell systems is yet to be extensively established at full scale practical operations also stability of system performance its replicability and reliability are several issues to be considered for the commercialization 91 in general significant upfront business in the wastewater treatment and recovery market is limited 85 however field scale operation of bioelectric toilet pee power urinal and elatrine are few of the success stories and attempts made towards practical applications of mfc and way forward towards commercialization on the plus side there appears to be growing interest in mfcs recently and with the entry of several companies and start ups such as cambrian innovation lebone usa plant e netherlands trophos energy usa emefcy israel intact labs llc usa hy syence usa indian oil corporation ltd india and few other early stage start ups entering into the market interest in this system may continue to grow 91 92 7 practical scalability of mfc currently mfc technology is facing limitations of low power output high fabrication cost and complexity of system to make it sustainable and energy positive system researchers are moving towards successful trial of mfc technology e g bioelectric toilet pee power urinal and microbial electrochemical septic tank system for practical application by overcoming the above cited limitations successful trials of 100 l 720 l and 1500 l capacity bioelectric toilet system at iit kharagpur showed a path forwards for practical utility of mfc for improved onsite sanitation practices 93 94 5 considering the large volume of wastewater to be treated in decentralized onsite sanitation scaled up design with stacked arrangement of electrodes can be preferred for dealing with electrochemical and other limitations further efforts in this direction with reducing overall cost and increasing power output can lead to the commercialization of this technology circular economy concentrated on goods that are at the end of their useful life into resources for others closing the loops in industrial ecosystems and minimizing waste generation from environmental prospective as well as reduction in raw material requirement 95 during circular economy valuable resources byproducts and industrial chemicals can be effectively recovered in electrochemical system by controlling the redox reactions in bet mfc such bioelectric toilet system favours the recovery of resources along with facilitating reuse of treated effluent for flushing purpose and other use moreover the process safety and cleaner effluent production for water reuse is major concern while dealing with treatment of human waste in scalable mfc 8 future prospects wastewater received at septic tank can be used as a potential substrate in mfc for bioelectricity production adoption of bio electrochemical system in conventional septic tank would boost the function of septic tank for onsite sanitation as well as environmental protection even the modification in the existing system leads to enhancement in organic matter removal to achieve higher treatment efficiency taking into account the economic constraints yazdi et al 55 reported that system costs about us 25 to be capable to power led light of 6 w capacity daily for 4 h with vast improvement in potential based on preliminary economic calculation although the power from human faeces is kind of low for practical application however with the development of the techniques that could improve the power generation electricity generation from human faeces will become more useful for commercial exploration bio electrochemical system proposes a substitution way that appears to be more feasible and practical from technical as well as economic perspectives the economic constraints for adopting the microbial electrochemical technology into toilet system are more challenging aspects at this moment jadhav 5 reported comparable net present value in case of bet mfc over cst for lifespan of 10 years the land requirement for such toilets is considerably lower as compared to conventional septic tank with soak pit system with further enhancement in energy recovery from mfc people can have easy access to an inexpensive and renewable power source and this system will simultaneously treat wastewater to produce treated water suitable for various onsite reuse however the factor that affects the most for such kind of systems from being successfully implemented worldwide is the user perception of sanitation and reusing human waste nearly 11 000 research articles have been published till date dealing with various broad dimensions of mfc system however less than 0 1 articles focused on actual scaling up of mfc and couple of investigations are reporting actual field applications 96 99 application of mfc for sanitation opens new directions towards its field application and commercialization such sanitation application of mfc can play lead role in provision of treatment to effluent improved sanitation and hygienic conditions for protecting the human health 9 conclusions treatment of the human faeces as a substrate in mfc can degrade the contaminants from waste and simultaneously recover electrical power from it integrating the mfc centred toilet system into user community s typical sanitation practices is a key for successful implementation of mfc as a sanitation technique successful trials of bioelectric toilet system india and pee power urinal uk are the key successive indicators that showed the practical applicability of mfc towards onsite sanitation this review summarized the implementation of bio electrochemical system into septic tank for improving the treatment efficiency of existing sanitation practices and creates a loop for adopting such system towards the commercialization such

13797,sanitation is the basic quality index of life and proper sanitation practices play a vital role in maintaining the hygienic conditions use of human waste urine and faeces as a substrate for microbial oxidation is found to be sustainable approach towards improving the sanitation facilities advancement in microbial fuel cell mfc system towards field scale application for treatment of human waste is restricted by several technological social economical material science and bio electrochemical limitations however recently developed pee power urinal and bioelectric toilet demonstrated the field scale applicability of mfc for human waste treatment and simultaneous electricity generation for onsite use this review mainly focuses on suitability and applicability of human waste as a substrate in mfc to improve the sanitation facilities and also the challenges faced while scaling up of this system for field applications are being discussed along with possible solutions recent advancement towards field scale application of mfc demonstrated that this technology is getting ready for the commercialization in sanitation infrastructure keywords bioelectric toilet field application human waste treatment microbial fuel cells sanitation scaling up 1 introduction sanitation practices in any region determine the quality of human life and its development index most rural people in developing countries are lacking adequate sanitation facilities and a large portion of the population is living without access to hygienic life conditions earlier report on sanitation presents that the developing countries are going to face severe sanitation issues in the upcoming decades 1 rapidly developing countries are missed out on having enough onsite sanitation facilities for almost 40 50 of its total population 2 residents in rural communities are forced to defecate out in the open due to lack of toilet facilities this leads to health problem as well as raises concerns about environment and results into water contamination climate change possess risk of heavy rain as well as flooding conditions and risks to water and sanitation services with damage to infrastructure due to adverse climatic condition results in changes in quality of water in the sources and thus affecting the human health in present scenario more than 35 of worldwide population is lacking with adequate water supply lack of toilet facilities nearby houses and drainage services in addition to the lack of electricity supply most of waterborne diseases originate from consumption of contaminated potable water due to untreated human waste disposal unacceptable onsite sanitation and lack of awareness on personal hygiene facilities proper sanitation practices are crucial from the health perspective and also for the protection of water quality in general at present different types of onsite sanitation practices are adopted which are not properly managed and leads to pollution of water bodies several new initiative programs have been recently launched in developing and developed countries to construct the toilets and to make open defecation free for improving the sanitation index of people with great success 3 4 though millions of toilet superstructures have been built in last few years with the aim to provide access to sanitation which has reasonably solved the social problem however at most of the places solution for treatment of the waste generated from toilet is not provided hence the environmental challenges still persist as before 1 1 conventional onsite sanitation practices improper management of human waste causes environmental pollution unpleasant odour growth and multiplication of insects rodents and may lead to transmission of waterborne diseases such as typhoid cholera etc at present different types of in situ sanitation strategies are favoured in rural communities such as aqua privy and soak pit privy latrine with bore hole dug well latrines conventional septic tank cst with soak pit arrangement composting toilets etc these practices if not properly managed are responsible for contamination of water bodies table 1 apart from various decentralized sanitation systems conventional septic tank system with soak pit arrangement is most widely used in urban and rural part which offers sludge settling for longer duration in sedimentation pit in other words a septic tank is a combined sedimentation cum digestion tank for these settled solids the septic tank is only able to remove about 30 40 of organic matter from sewage by anaerobic digestion and leftover organics as well as pathogens are disposed to the environment without any treatment for achieving higher treatment efficiency there is an urgent need to design the conventional septic tank system in more effective and efficient way with additional provisions to address the above mentioned issues 5 1 2 human waste as an energy source human waste is a waste product generated during digestion of food in human body which contains human faeces and urine it is usually considered as a bio waste and can be a vector for viral and bacterial diseases generally human excreta contains high amount of carbonaceous compounds and about 50 70 g cod chemical oxygen demand is present in human waste generated per capita per day 6 in addition energy content value for mixed wastewater is reported as approximately 14 7 kj g cod 6 7 taken together black water or urine plus faeces have annual nutrient content of 4 5 kg of nitrogen and 0 55 kg of phosphorus per capita 8 human waste contains energy which is approximately equal to the energy stored in coal 9 by theoretical consideration the per capita generated human waste will be able to produce approximately 25 w power and for a family of four about 100 w power can be produced which is enough energy to illuminate incandescent light bulbs 9 additionally faecal sludge after composting contains organic material and nutrients which can be useful as fertilizer and soil conditioning agent after processing 10 11 considering the high energy content of human faeces and nitrogen rich urine it can be considered as a valuable and renewable energy source for electricity production and energy recovery as per the composition of wastewater major nitrogen about 75 and phosphorous about 50 load to centralized municipal sewage treatment plant is contributed by human urine and wastewater received from toilets 10 however urine only contributes about 1 2 of the total volume of wastewater received at treatment plant 10 thus human urine is a potential candidate for recovery of precious resource for nutrient i e struvite and energy due to its high nutrient contents which is otherwise a major pollutant if discharged into water bodies without any further treatment during conventional onsite sanitation practices about 50 60 of organic matter and nutrients are directly disposed to water streams without treatment and hence losing the energy value of human waste existing septic tank is not capable to deal with high wastewater treatment efficiency and to facilitate resource recovery options hence septic tank system need to be designed from engineering perspectives to harvest the energy from human waste with improving the organic matter removal by integrating it with upcoming advanced treatment system like microbial fuel cell mfc in this direction present review focused on application of mfc coupled with septic tank for onsite treatment of human waste in addition the recent advancement in this research and scaling up challenges faced by this system while implementing at field scale are discussed 2 microbial fuel cells towards sanitation 2 1 microbial fuel cell for energy harvesting and resource recovery for utilization of wastewater as a potential renewable energy resource attention is being paid by researchers on the development of waste to energy recovery techniques 12 the mfc is one of such waste to energy recovery system which converts energy stored in organics from waste substrate into electrical output by employing the bacteria as a biocatalyst through various electrochemical redox reactions 13 18 effluents varying from monomer sugars i e acetate glucose to composite industrial wastewater as well as lignocellulosic effluent can be treated in this biofuel cell 18 20 whereas potential source i e human faeces have not been much exploited in mfc along with the treatment of complex industrial wastewater few reports are available on treatment of human excreta 9 and urine 21 23 in mfc previously cow dung cow s urine swine wastewater elephant s urine artificial human wastes have been successfully demonstrated to be effectively treated in mfcs 24 similar to animal waste human excreta and urine contain high carbon and nutrient however pharmaceutical residual compounds and pathogenic load are major additional concern present in human waste which increase the complexity of human waste treatment considering the energy value human waste contains significant amount of organic as well as nutrient compounds ammonium nitrogen present in urine 25 about 2 urea by weight is available in human urine in urea compound four hydrogen atoms per molecule of urea are chemically bounded in loose structure to the molecule as compared to protons in water breaking of such chemical bonds needs minimal input energy and generates protons and electrons more effectively in electrochemical reactions 24 similarly human faeces contains high amount of carbonaceous compounds which can release electrons during microbial oxidation these electrons are being harvested through external electrical load bearing circuit in mfc to produce direct current fig 1 even the sludge settled in septic tank can be effectively hydrolyzed and utilized as a feed source for biocatalytic oxidation in mfc 26 thus during projection of sanitation from improved to sustainable sanitation in circular economy by adopting this bioelectrochemical technology human waste shall not be considered as harmful waste and shall be considered as the precious resource that can be reutilized 27 concerning the implementation potential of mfc technology for practical application it can be suitable either in sewage treatment plant or onsite sanitation facilities ge and he 28 tested 96 modules of mfcs having capacity of 200 l for treatment of primary effluent received at local common effluent treatment plant however low power output variation in wastewater characteristics and complexity in design made the system complicated for operation such limitations can be minimized by implementing the mfc for treatment of waste generated from toilet system with using novel cathode catalysts having higher catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions orr as well as using advanced power management system and suitable engineering design of the system to reduce the complexity of substrate flow distribution thus implementing the mfc in septic tank system new or existing is a feasible solution for improved sanitation facilities considering the simple substrate with nearly constant flow implementing mfc for human waste treatment can help in ecological and improved sanitation facilities mostly for rural areas along with generating electricity already mfcs have been operated at pilot scale using either synthetic acetate based substrate 85 l mfc 29 and real municipal wastewater 255 l mfc 30 2 2 bio electrochemical septic tank system bio electrochemical septic tank or bioelectric toilet bet system is a novel mfc technology in which human excreta and faecal sludge can be used as feedstock for microbial oxidation to harvest bioelectricity during treatment 5 fig 1 this system is capable to oxidize the organic matter present in human waste 31 it is a modification of cst and bioelectrochemical system provided with power management system pms the csts are lacking with energy harvesting capability hence these additional features are recommended for rural part having no supply of electricity advanced pms is generally used to store the charge generated from individual mfc units and releases it in series parallel connections depending on use for electric appliances it consists of charge pump supercapacitor boost converter and electric circuitry as well as charge control circuit 32 charge control circuit controls the flow of charge from stronger cell to weaker cell and thus restricts the voltage reversal to some extent supercapacitor and booster in pms take care of fluctuations in charge and current generated against change in operating conditions in anodic chamber of mfc such bet system with advanced pms once developed can be used by individuals and community houses for managing waste generated from toilet and generating onsite electricity 5 the concept of stacked bet mfc with capacity of 100 l was successfully tested for treatment of human waste received from hostels at indian institute of technology iit kharagpur and it demonstrated about 87 92 of organic matter removal efficiency and showed its application for charging mobile battery and illuminated light emission diode led bulbs by using harvested electricity 33 this bet system was constructed with acrylic material having 36 modules of separator electrode assemblies and modified clayware battery separators and it was operated in up flow mode with continuous supply of wastewater collected from septic tank 33 34 for field application the largest bioelectric toilet mfc of 1 5 m3 capacity was developed at iit kharagpur india for treatment of human waste along with generation of electricity the system designed consists of hexagonal middle settling chamber and 5 outer anodic chambers with air cathode arrangement and sixth one chlorinated aqueous cathodic chamber this system is built up of total 49 pairs of separator electrode assemblies made with carbon felt as both anode and cathode electrode material and modified clayware ceramic tile with 20 montmorillonite cation exchanger as separator fig 2 it is one of the largest mfc design in the world fabricated using fibre reinforced plastic material and employing various cathode catalysts to enhance the performance and it is reported to be under successful continuous operation for past three years 35 this mfc system was capable to remove about 5 6 log scale pathogens from anodic treated effluent using hypochlorite dosing in the final aqueous cathodic chamber fig 2 the harvested electrical energy is reported to be capable of powering the led bulbs for illumination whenever needed during night as well as served as external power supply for small electronic appliances hexagonal design with six peripheral chambers provided with multiple separator electrode assembly is one of the best configurations proposed for mfc design for practical applications to permit the proper substrate distribution and with provision for disinfection in final chamber to facilitate the reuse of treated effluent for toilet flushing purpose 33 on asimilar design another mfc of 720 l capacity treating human excreta was successfully demonstrated at national thermal power corporation ntpc noida india site for onsite sanitation 36 such self sustained bioelectric toilet has additional facilities to use energy from solar panel for pumping the treated water to the water tank placed above the toilet to be able to use it for flushing as and when required the bet is a sustainable field scale demonstration of mfc technology where treatment of human waste organic carbon removal eq 1 reuse recycle of treated water and simultaneous electricity generation for illuminating toilet at night time are being achieved oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen gas under anoxic conditions eq 2 and sulphide to elemental sulphur eq 3 eliminate the odour problem in this system 5 hypochlorite is used as disinfectant in the final aqueous cathodic chamber of this system to deal with pathogens from effluent eq 4 37 the detailed electrochemical redox reaction mechanisms for removal of organic carbon nitrogen sulphur and pathogens in mfc are represented in eqs 1 5 sludge generation is very less in this system and such sludge can be used as compost manure and fertilizer these incentives will encourage adaptation and proliferation of this mfc based latrine waste management system as its products can be monetized for economic benefit electrochemical reactions occurring in mfc 1 carbon removal ch3cooh 2h2o 2co2 8h 8e 2 ammonium n

conventional onsite treatment systems at present various types of decentralized sanitation practices are utilized in rural areas viz aqua privy soak pit privy bore hole latrine deep dug well latrines septic tank biotoilet composting toilets etc 38 41 septic tank is only able to remove organic matter of about 30 40 from slurry and the treatment efficiency was improved up to 90 along with bio electricity generation when cst is modified with bioelectric toilets also energy generation capability and disinfection treatment for effluent in cathodic chamber of mfc make it superior as compared to septic tank 5 37 from construction point of view bio electrochemical septic tank system require less area for construction than cst as it replaces soak pits with mfc table 1 also effluent treated after disinfection in mfc can be safely reused for toilet flushing thus reducing overall water consumption in toilet this bet mfc system minimizes the environmental footprint minimizes the smell no spoiling of environment or groundwater and doesn t need any external energy when compared to conventional sanitation practices like composting toilet sludge generated from mfc systems can be utilized for compost and fertilizer application table 1 summarizes the benefits and drawbacks of conventional onsite sanitation practices and bioelectric toilet system the bio toilet system developed by defence research and development organisation drdo scientists for indian railways is an eco friendly waste management approach which reduces the solid human waste to biogas and treated water with the help of bacterial inoculum 41 however it has its own disadvantages such as biogas emission handling sludge volume no possibility of energy or electricity recovery etc which limits its use as compared to bio electrochemical septic tank system table 1 thus dual purpose of elatrine or green latrine or bioelectric toilet make them more competitive over other options of decentralized sanitation treatment systems the advantages discussed above offers superiority of this technology over other existing technologies 4 application of mfc for sanitation from last 100 years of research several scientific and technological developments have contributed for moving forward the mfc technology towards the commercialization considering the present status of mfc research field application of this technology is constrained by low power output and fabrication cost associated with it field application of mfc can be suitable and feasible option for sustainable sanitation application to overcome the low treatment efficiency of presently adopted cst system in addition human waste excreta and urine can be considered as a sustainable yellow gold substrate for application in mfc to harvest electricity during effective wastewater treatment along with by product recovery fig 3 and facilitate the reuse of treated water fig 3 represents various aspects of utilizing human waste in mfc such ecofriendly bio electrochemical system is proposed as independent and renewable energy source from the perspective of sustainable sanitation environmental aspects and public health as with the sediment mfcs the field application of mfcs for sanitation can only be feasible and realistic solution if septic tank systems are modified with advanced bio electrochemical system thus this newly developed bio electrochemical technology can become viable alternative for the efficient and sustainable sanitation along with recovery of bio energy such bet technology can offer effective organic matter removal nutrient removal sulfur removal disinfection treatment to the effluent efficient faecal sludge degradation odour removal and valuable resource recovery along with generating the power to operate the led bulbs biosensors and different electronic appliances 5 4 1 urine treatment and resource recovery in mfc as discussed earlier possibility of recovery of resources i e n p k and energy can be explored from urine which is otherwise a pollutant if discharged in to the environment without treatment 10 42 the chemical energy present in urine can either be recovered in the form of electricity in mfc or as hydrogen gas during electrolysis in microbial electrolysis cell mec by imposing external potential 10 43 with recent development in microbial electrochemical systems mfc mec can provide innovative solution for treatment of urine 12 such urine waste to energy approach for bioelectricity generation in mfc has been reported in recent years 19 and research continued for practical applications to charge the mobile phone battery using stacked arrangement of mfc units 43 from resource recovery point of view zang et al 44 reported novel approach of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o recovery and energy generation from human urine using 3 stage integrated mfc system ammonium recovery and simultaneous energy recovery was achieved by kuntke et al 10 using real and synthetic urine in mfc additionally ieropoulos et al 43 tested the artificial urine in 1 ml mfc which produced net power output of 962 94 mw m3 in 2016 ieropoulos and team 45 conducted the field trial of pee power urinal and obtained a maximum power of 800 mw when light was connected directly to about 432 mfc units and cod removal efficiency higher than 95 was demonstrated by this system this study was the first attempt towards field trial of mfc for wastewater generated from urinal and confirmed the adaptability of mfcs for simultaneous electricity harvesting and direct urine treatment since then urine is widely used as substrate in mfc for ammonia recovery 46 magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitation 47 in situ pathogen killing 48 21 struvite recovery 49 and long term sustainable power source 50 4 2 human excreta as a substrate in mfc disposing human excreta through mfc can treat the waste generated from toilet and recover electrical power simultaneously 51 to harvest the potential energy from human waste kretzschmar et al 52 designed elatrine mfc with low cost corrugated cardboard as an electrode material using human faeces as a substrate during anodic oxidation initial study of perlow 9 on mfc treating such waste through microbial oxidation generated low open circuit voltage of 200 mv from contaminant degradation point of view dual chamber mfc treating actual human waste was capable to remove the total chemical oxygen demand tcod soluble cod and nh4 by 71 88 and 44 along with power generation of 70 8 mw m2 53 similarly cubical shaped dual chambered mfc developed by li et al 54 showed that a maximum power of 251 mw m2 was produced when faeces wastewater was fed to the anodic chamber power density of 142 6 71 mw m2 was harvested when three units of air cathode column mfcs were connected in stack arrangement during treatment of wastewater received at septic tank 55 recently leton et al 56 utilized septage wastewater in 20 l mfc and achieved 99 8 86 4 and 82 8 of total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod and nitrate removal efficiencies when operated at 1000 ω external resistance bacterial sp pseudomonas otitidis aatb4 isolated from septic tank wastewater showed current density of 800 ma m2 with coulombic efficiency ce of 15 in plexiglass mfc 57 thus few attempts have been made by the researchers for harvesting the energy from human waste 9 58 however lower power output limits the scaling up of such mfcs 59 4 3 faecal sludge as substrate for mfc faecal sludge is semisolid slurry either undigested or partially digested and biomass generated from the process of collecting storing or treating the human excreta as well as blackwater which takes more time for degradation than human excreta 60 38 chemical energy stored in the organic matter of faecal sludge or activated sludge can be bio electrochemically converted into electrical energy through mfc technology during experimentation operating voltage of 0 45 0 65 v with ce of 1 5 4 3 was obtained in single chambered mfc treating faecal matter as substrate 61 additionally microbial population present in the faecal sludge itself can be used as electrogenic inoculum and no external seeding during start up of mfc will be required 62 4 4 resource recovery during human waste treatment urine is an ideal feed for bio electrochemical system and offers possibility to recover the key nutrients as well as hydrogen gas during its treatment 63 urine can be considered as a traditional balanced fertilizer due to its high concentration of nitrogen 21 g l of urea co nh2 2 for a total of 9 g n l phosphorous 0 7 g p l and potassium 2 g k l which are the main constituents in major commercial fertilizers 63 human urine can be utilized as fertilizer in the form of struvite and can be recovered during treatment in mfc additionally microbial electrochemical technologies mets proved the potential of n recovery in source separated urine 64 such ammonium n recovery concept was successfully demonstrated with a power output of 250 mw m2 3 5 mj kgn along with nh3 recovery rate of 3 3 g n m2 day 10 hybrid system by coupling mfc with electrodialysis can be capable of precipitating the nutrients n p and k in salt form which can be reused for fertilizer applications 65 struvite precipitation is one of the main strategies to recover nutrients from source separated urine jimenez et al 66 reported that hydrogen peroxide catholyte produced from mfc treating urine as fuel is effective in facilitating disinfection and can kill the pathogens in mec diluted urine was found to be a suitable feed for ammonium recovery and hydrogen production 67 similarly bio electrochemical system offers production of value added resources such as hydrogen hydrogen peroxide magnesium ammonium phosphate ethanol methane gaseous products nutrient recovery struvite as well as other multi carbon compounds along with effective treatment of human waste 68 the recovered resources from human waste during downstream processing can be useful for industrial applications as well as having fertilizer value 4 5 scaling up applications 4 5 1 faecal waste treatment scaling up application of mfc technology has been restricted due to several microbial electrochemical engineering economical material science and technological constraints 69 70 however by taking into account the low efficiencies of existing conventional onsite sanitation practices field application of this bioelectrochemical system can be feasible and practicable in the field of sanitation only by overcoming the scaling up limitations moving towards this direction concept of elatrine mfc was developed using low cost corrugated cardboard electrodes by kretzschmar et al 52 for utilizing human faeces as a substrate for microbial oxidation in 2009 du et al 71 used 1 l capacity mfc for treatment of human faeces the tcod and ammonium removal of 71 and 44 was achieved in dual chambered mfc operated for 190 h with maximum power generation of 70 8 mw m2 in another investigation the mfc fed with human faeces wastewater after fermentation pre treatment showed power density of 22 mw m2 which is 47 higher as compared to control mfc without providing fermentation pre treatment to substrate 71 the mfc based green latrine concept for treatment of human waste during microbial oxidation and generation of compost and electricity was deployed by castro et al 59 in agona nyakrom ghana however the power production from such unit was too low i e 0 268 mw m2 over period of 2 years of operation butler s pit latrine is similar to a battery having electrodes and the research work of mfc latrine was sponsored by the bill and melinda gates foundation 58 59 recently from stacked arrangement of mfcs deployed for treatment of wastewater generated from toilets of public housing a maximum power of 124 mw m3 was obtained at organic loading rate of 1 05 kg cod m3 day from these 15 cartridges of mfcs 72 cubic shaped dual chambered mfc was capable to produce a maximum power of 251 mw m2 while treating human faeces wastewater 54 table 2 summarizes the energy production reported from scaled up mfcs used for sanitation application novel concept of microbial electrochemical septic tank mest which is modified configuration of cst was developed by lin et al 73 74 for enhancing the performance of conventional system with minimal modifications along with electricity generation total phosphorous removal of 98 7 was achieved along with complete removal of sulfide in 1 l capacity mest operated at 25 c previously perlow 9 used human waste as a substrate for a field scale mfc implemented in uganda 2012 the power output from this unit was enough to make a small light blink this mfc designed cost around 20 us and demonstrated successful application of mfc in coupling with septic tank system 9 however low power output and associated capital cost made barrier for its practical use 4 5 2 urine treatment ieropoulos and colleagues 42 stacked the small sized 24 ceramic mfcs to utilize the output voltage for charging the mobile phone battery application of field trial of pee power urinal has confirmed the suitability of biological fuel cells for direct urine treatment and energy generation 45 one of the public urinals installed by same group for field trial at glastonbury the united kingdom s largest music festival generated sufficient electricity to illuminate the light of cubicle s led tubes using mfcs stacked arrangements these results showed mfc as an independent power source utilizing waste as renewable energy source in the perspective of sanitation as well as public health particularly for immense applications in the developing and developed nations also the concept of smart bioelectric toilet developed at iit kharagpur as discussed earlier promotes the commercialization and field application of hexagonal mfcs towards self sustained sanitation system 5 4 6 applications of septic tank mfcs as stated earlier mfc is a bioelectrochemical technology to harvest electricity recover the valuable by products offers post treatment option for disinfection nutrient and organics removal sludge manuring as well as power source during treatment of human waste further first innovative design of self sustainable wearable mfc assembled within a pair of socks and manual foot pump was demonstrated by taghavi et al 75 which is used as an energy source for operating the transportable electronic appliances urine is well known as the fuel substrate for mfc and natural walking as the physical pumping for driving such fuels thus the power generated from such wearable urine fed mfc can be capable for powering the portable and wearable electronic appliances 76 novel origami tetrahedron design of mfcs using photocopier paper was capable to power the portable emergency locator transmitter reporting system 77 pilot scale bioelectric toilet of 100 l capacity was able to operate the photodiode sensors which can be used for security alarm system 5 ieropoulos and his team from bristol university uk developed first artificial muscle driven pump artificial heartbeat actuator and mfc powered robots ecobots system to be powered by mfc treating urine as a substrate 78 such mfcs can be suitable for space applications as well as refugee camps astronaut space applications robotics applications and rural parts of developing country for simultaneous human waste treatment and electricity generation 5 economic and energy analysis of mfc for sanitation as per experimental investigation carried out initial investment of rs 329 000 4386 including electrode material and toilet assembly fabrication cost will be required to develop the bioelectric toilet mfc of 1 5 m3 capacity that is designed for family of 5 persons for lifespan of 10 years whereas total initial fixed cost of rs 83 000 1106 will be required for constructing the conventional septic tank system with soak pit arrangement 5 considering the 10 year lifespan overall estimated cost of about 1 to 2 required for treatment of 1 kl of wastewater received from septic tank though the bioelectric toilet unit has higher cost of fabrication however considering the saving in terms of water consumption and facilitating the reuse of treated water and generation of electricity for onsite illumination a payback period of 10 years is estimated for such system 5 with large scale production of this system the capital cost is expected to get reduced and thus it is expected that such system can be economically sustainable and feasible solution however total operational cost for bet mfc per annum will be compensated if the ce more than 5 7 can be maintained moreover bet mfc offers higher cod removal efficiency upto 80 85 surplus energy recovery water saving low area requirement as well as treated effluent can be reused for flushing and other uses which will further avoid the groundwater contamination with proper design and selection of efficient materials for its fabrication so as to maintain ce above 6 then the mfc can be an energy neutral or energy gaining system 79 a solar power operated pump can be utilized to pump the treated effluent for flushing purpose in overhead tanks of the toilet 6 scaling up issues and challenges for practical application of mfc the performance of mfc mainly depends upon electrode material design aspects inoculum conditions wastewater characteristics operating conditions and other parameters scaling up of such technology is a multidisciplinary approach related to material science electrochemistry biotechnology economics environmental engineering chemical engineering and applied engineering fields therefore scaling up and practical application of such biofuel cell is restricted by several electrochemical and microbiological constraints engineering aspects economic challenges and other operational problems as stated in table 3 6 1 scaling up and stacked arrangement from practical perspective of mfc for contaminant removal and energy recovery mfc can be scaled up with increasing the size of reactor or number of units can be connected together in electrically stacked arrangement of electrodes either in series or parallel connections however power density proportionally decreased with enlargement of reactor size also electrochemistry and charge utilization does not support with increase in size beyond certain limit hence number of mfc units can be stacked together in series or parallel connections and total charge harvested can be stored in power management system moreover issue of voltage reversal in stacked mfcs resulted into dropdown in power performance also monitoring and analyzing the results of number of mfc units are tremendous job and at the same time to ensure that no voltage reversal occurs in this stack is a bigger challenge therefore multiplicity of mfc units with modularity is a way forward to minimize the mass transport losses and ohmic resistance against enlarging the size of individual units 80 6 2 electrochemical limitations theoretically mfc can produce anodic half cell potential of 0 3 v and cathodic half cell potential of 0 8 v while using oxygen as cathodic terminal electron acceptor to obtain overall maximum voltage of 1 1 v however in reality voltage obtained from mfc is too low and could be up to 0 8 v in open circuit condition and about 0 6 to 0 7 v in external load conditions due to various polarization losses such as ohmic activation concentration and bacterial metabolism losses even with use of novel and efficient cathodic catalysts minimizing the cathodic overpotential is still a challenge such low voltage generated is unable to operate the electronic appliances or to serve as an energy source to make it a feasible solution number of mfc units need to be connected in stacked arrangement which further leads to voltage reversal in mfcs voltage reversal occurred in mfcs connected in series due to non spontaneous anodic overpotential in some of mfcs that has retarded anodic reaction kinetics due to mass diffusion limitations 81 6 3 microbiological restrictions the performance of mfc is majorly governed by activities of bacteria in anodic chamber and electron transfer mechanism during redox reactions 82 field scale application of mfc for contaminant degradation requires in depth understanding of bacteria and biochemical metabolic and electron transfer pathways followed by electrogenic populations 83 till date understanding of physiology of most of electrogens and its electron transfer mechanism is unknown to research community and need to be addressed for field scale application of mfc 84 70 for upcoming future needs more emphasis should be given on microbial constraints which will likely lead to significant advances in taking mfc technology forward from the laboratory designs to the pilot scale and beyond as well as to make it competitive with existing conventional wastewater treatment processes 85 6 4 material cost and efficiency recent advancement in electrode material development of novel efficient cathode catalysts design of mfc architecture and low cost membrane made fabrication of mfc somewhat economical however success of field scale mfc depends upon cost economics and energy analysis from fuel cell point of view several cathode catalysts metal doped catalyst and other modifications have been reported earlier however these modifications may not be realistic solution for field application due to high cost associated in its synthesis 85 86 a novel low cost separator material such ceramic clayware and modified cement can be alternatives for expensive polymeric membranes however its mechanical strength electrochemical properties as well as long term stability still need to be improved the development of inexpensive highly proton transferable and long term stable separator materials are very significant aspects for practicability of mfcs in the future 86 6 5 fluid dynamics flow dynamics of wastewater in reactor is important aspect as it controls the mass transport in the anodic chamber uneven distribution of substrate throughout the reactor can result in non uniform contact of wastewater with anodic biofilm and hence increase the mass transport resistance the homogeneity of fluid flow relies on the intensity of mixing and its pattern which can be improved by mechanical mixing 87 proper mixing of substrate and ensuring uniform distribution of it to the entire anode surface area is possible in the lab scale reactors however this can be faced as a challenge in large scale mfc system mixing of substrate can be done by providing the upflow mode of substrate i e wastewater addition in individual chamber of bet mfc additionally it ensured that the reactor design and fluid dynamics permit proper distribution of substrate in anodic chamber of mfc hence proper architectural design of the scaled up system is equally essential to ensure this to obtain similar performance in such larger system as obtained in small bench top mfcs 6 6 engineering aspects enlarging the size of anodic chamber is essential for making mfc capable to handle the large flow of wastewater however it increases the complexity of architecture and design of reactor over last decade mfc technology has grown surprisingly in almost each dimension including contaminant degradation capacity energy production capability and cost optimization however its architectural design is main governing constraint for practical applications compact design with cascade arrangement of electrodes could be a possible preferred architecture for scaling up of this system 34 also selection of electrode material membrane electrode spacing leads to lower down the economics of the mfc 88 6 7 economic challenges modernization in the design of new mfcs has been motivated with outcome of drastic improvement in power output as well as reduction in overall capital cost investment to be on safe cost benefit ratio 87 most of the cost in mfc fabrication is contributed by membrane electrode catalyst and current collectors for which low cost alternatives need to be find out economic analysis conducted recently by trapero et al 89 showed that mfc is more profitable and commercially viable option as compared to conventional activated sludge process in spite of even the costly pt c catalyst used in the cathode also energy and valuable resources recovery benefits make it sustainable option over conventional wastewater treatment system in present scenario more focus has been given to make mfc as self sufficient and energy positive system for wastewater treatment over conventional anaerobic treatment processes 90 however significant numerous challenges need to be addressed before mfcs shall fulfill their potential as a multibillion dollar global market scenario 6 8 system complexity mfc is a multidisciplinary technology in which contribution of electrochemistry biotechnology material science environmental chemistry chemical engineering and other applied engineering fields is essential to make it successful wastewater treatment system during treatment of real industrial wastewaters operating conditions such heavy metal content ph organic loading rate etc and toxicity offered to the bacterial metabolism because of presence of some of the ingredients may lead to poor performance of mfc and hence operating conditions need to be optimized in laboratory scale mfcs before going for scaling up trials even in field applications mfc is exposed to unpredictable fluctuations in the environment of real wastewater which is expected to change its performance drastically 87 present issues about variation in wastewater characteristics odour problem aesthetic value to utilize the resources recovered from human excreta use of antimicrobial disinfection chemicals for washing make mfc system more complicated and need to be taken care while dealing with biological communities 6 9 operational problems and issues handling large amount of wastewater flow and ensuring its uniform distribution to the number of mfcs used is a challenging task while going for field applications considering the longevity of operation fouling of membrane by biological and chemical means need to be taken into account to maintain the stable performance of mfcs for long in addition to this leakage in reactor clogging of effluent pipelines substrate diffusion unavailability of skilled labour for operation and maintenance are few operational challenges in most of clayware mfcs biomass sludge granule formation occurred in the anodic chamber particularly when operated in up flow mode and washing out of excess anodic biofilm can lead to the clogging of the effluent pipelines 85 formation of sludge blanket in anodic chamber also promotes the growth of methanogenic populations and decrease the power generation from mfc during long term operation 29 5 a proper strategy is required to be brought out for suppressing such methanogenesis in mfc at the same time which will be environmental friendly affordable and implementable under onsite conditions 6 10 commercialization system stability and reliability commercialization of mfc technology is still a challenge due to robustness and lack of reproducibility of results as well as system stability issues the risk related to commercialization of biofuel cell systems is yet to be extensively established at full scale practical operations also stability of system performance its replicability and reliability are several issues to be considered for the commercialization 91 in general significant upfront business in the wastewater treatment and recovery market is limited 85 however field scale operation of bioelectric toilet pee power urinal and elatrine are few of the success stories and attempts made towards practical applications of mfc and way forward towards commercialization on the plus side there appears to be growing interest in mfcs recently and with the entry of several companies and start ups such as cambrian innovation lebone usa plant e netherlands trophos energy usa emefcy israel intact labs llc usa hy syence usa indian oil corporation ltd india and few other early stage start ups entering into the market interest in this system may continue to grow 91 92 7 practical scalability of mfc currently mfc technology is facing limitations of low power output high fabrication cost and complexity of system to make it sustainable and energy positive system researchers are moving towards successful trial of mfc technology e g bioelectric toilet pee power urinal and microbial electrochemical septic tank system for practical application by overcoming the above cited limitations successful trials of 100 l 720 l and 1500 l capacity bioelectric toilet system at iit kharagpur showed a path forwards for practical utility of mfc for improved onsite sanitation practices 93 94 5 considering the large volume of wastewater to be treated in decentralized onsite sanitation scaled up design with stacked arrangement of electrodes can be preferred for dealing with electrochemical and other limitations further efforts in this direction with reducing overall cost and increasing power output can lead to the commercialization of this technology circular economy concentrated on goods that are at the end of their useful life into resources for others closing the loops in industrial ecosystems and minimizing waste generation from environmental prospective as well as reduction in raw material requirement 95 during circular economy valuable resources byproducts and industrial chemicals can be effectively recovered in electrochemical system by controlling the redox reactions in bet mfc such bioelectric toilet system favours the recovery of resources along with facilitating reuse of treated effluent for flushing purpose and other use moreover the process safety and cleaner effluent production for water reuse is major concern while dealing with treatment of human waste in scalable mfc 8 future prospects wastewater received at septic tank can be used as a potential substrate in mfc for bioelectricity production adoption of bio electrochemical system in conventional septic tank would boost the function of septic tank for onsite sanitation as well as environmental protection even the modification in the existing system leads to enhancement in organic matter removal to achieve higher treatment efficiency taking into account the economic constraints yazdi et al 55 reported that system costs about us 25 to be capable to power led light of 6 w capacity daily for 4 h with vast improvement in potential based on preliminary economic calculation although the power from human faeces is kind of low for practical application however with the development of the techniques that could improve the power generation electricity generation from human faeces will become more useful for commercial exploration bio electrochemical system proposes a substitution way that appears to be more feasible and practical from technical as well as economic perspectives the economic constraints for adopting the microbial electrochemical technology into toilet system are more challenging aspects at this moment jadhav 5 reported comparable net present value in case of bet mfc over cst for lifespan of 10 years the land requirement for such toilets is considerably lower as compared to conventional septic tank with soak pit system with further enhancement in energy recovery from mfc people can have easy access to an inexpensive and renewable power source and this system will simultaneously treat wastewater to produce treated water suitable for various onsite reuse however the factor that affects the most for such kind of systems from being successfully implemented worldwide is the user perception of sanitation and reusing human waste nearly 11 000 research articles have been published till date dealing with various broad dimensions of mfc system however less than 0 1 articles focused on actual scaling up of mfc and couple of investigations are reporting actual field applications 96 99 application of mfc for sanitation opens new directions towards its field application and commercialization such sanitation application of mfc can play lead role in provision of treatment to effluent improved sanitation and hygienic conditions for protecting the human health 9 conclusions treatment of the human faeces as a substrate in mfc can degrade the contaminants from waste and simultaneously recover electrical power from it integrating the mfc centred toilet system into user community s typical sanitation practices is a key for successful implementation of mfc as a sanitation technique successful trials of bioelectric toilet system india and pee power urinal uk are the key successive indicators that showed the practical applicability of mfc towards onsite sanitation this review summarized the implementation of bio electrochemical system into septic tank for improving the treatment efficiency of existing sanitation practices and creates a loop for adopting such system towards the commercialization such sustainable and renewable mfc system can generate onsite electricity from human waste in the rural part and improve the existing sanitation practices and thus it will provide access to safe sanitation

13798,many papers on wastewater treatment by algal bacterial systems have been published current reactor models cannot model the simultaneous removal of organic matter ammonium and phosphate from an algal bacterial reactor because a powerful theoretical analysis platform is not available how the consortia function in bioreactors is still not clear in this study the activated sludge model no 3 was extended with a modified algal biokinetics for modeling wastewater treatment by algal bacterial consortia the applied model was calibrated and verified by experiments the model shows that phosphate accumulating organisms paos and nitrifying bacteria consumed over 80 of phosphate and 60 of ammonium under different aeration conditions respectively whereas algae played a minor role in removing nutrients in addition the model shows that maintaining alkalinity at 1 mol m3 100 mg l caco3 can significantly promote nutrient removal by increasing activities of paos and nitrifying bacteria despite that algae consume less nutrients light intensity decreased quickly in suspended algal bacterial consortia which was accurately modelled compared with algae bacteria played a more significant role in reducing light intensity a defined light utilization efficiency decreased by 50 when doubling biomass concentration showing that concentrated biomass should not be applied at large scale when artificial illumination is applied the model predicts that efficient wastewater treatment by algal bacterial consortia at a biomass concentration of approximately 1 g l can be achieved in eight hours under non aerated conditions this study proved that biological wastewater treatment by algal bacterial consortia can be modeled while heterotrophic bacteria nitrifying bacteria paos and algae simultaneously function in the consortia the model can be a useful tool to study and optimize algal bacterial reactors keywords algal bacterial algae model wastewater sewage 1 introduction current biological wastewater treatment technologies require heterotrophic bacteria nitrifiers and phosphate accumulating organisms paos for organic matter and nutrient removal in addition alternative aerobic and anaerobic conditions are applied indicating that these technologies are complex in operation in contrast to these technologies that apply bacteria for wastewater treatment algal bacterial consortia have a potential for wastewater treatment 1 when algae and activated sludge are applied as inoculum hydraulic retention times hrts of 2 10 days are usually required for removing pollutants in sewage 2 5 apparently the high hrts indicate that current algal bacterial consortia usually are not as efficient as activated sludge based systems a better understanding of algal bacterial consortia is required for improving the consortia s efficiency although hundreds of papers regarding wastewater treatment by algal bacterial consortia have been published how pollutants in wastewaters are removed is still not well understood for instance organic matter and ammonium are usually removed efficiently by algal bacteria consortia however it is still difficult to explain why phosphate removal efficiency is usually low 6 9 furthermore our works show that in a concentrated algal bacterial reactor algae nitrifiers paos and heterotrophic bacteria coexisted and efficiently polished wastewater 1 10 11 nevertheless how these microorganisms cooperated in reactors is still not clear moreover n and p uptake in reactors was in excess of the stoichiometric requirements for the observed biomass growth which has not been explained 12 reactor models are helpful in understanding reactor operation and thereby improving reactor performance which has been proved by the implementation of activated sludge models asms 13 in addition to the asms many algal biokinetics have been reported 14 19 a few researchers tried to combine bacterial and algal models together to explain pollutant removal by algal bacterial reactors 19 22 however these models usually do not include paos activity or phosphate removal for instance zambrano et al 23 report a model integrating activities of algae and ammonium oxidation bacteria aob whereas heterotrophic bacteria and paos are not included reports show that oxygen concentration had significant impacts on phosphate removal indicating that phosphate removal by paos in algal bacterial consortia cannot be ignored 10 it is straightforward that a widely applied activated sludge model can be extended with an algal kinetics for modeling the simultaneous removal of organic matter ammonium and phosphate surprisingly such work has not been performed an algal model asm a was proposed for modeling algal activity in wastewater treatment 24 in this study this algal model was modified and combined with the widely accepted activated sludge model no 3 asm no 3 in order to explain how pollutants were removed from wastewater the asm no 3 model can model the activities of heterotrophic bacteria nitrifiers and paos the validity of the asm no 3 has been verified by world wide researchers nevertheless the asm no 3 model does not include algal activity therefore it must be extended with an algal kinetics for modeling algal bacterial reactors because the asm no 3 model and the ams a model are both expressed in matrix forms the combination of the two models is convenient as a result the obtained comprehensive model should enable modeling variations in concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium phosphate and nitrate by including activities of heterotrophic bacteria nitrifier paos and algae in this study in order to verify the applicability of the combined model experiments were conducted to calibrate and verify the obtained model then the model was applied to analyze how organic matter ammonium and phosphate were removed by algal bacterial consortia and explain how to optimize reactor operation if the obtained model could successfully model the activities of algal bacterial consortia it would be a useful tool to study algal bacterial systems for other researchers 2 methods and materials 2 1 batch experiment inoculated algae and bacteria came from an algal bacterial reactor treating synthetic sewage with sludge retention time srt of 10 days 11 the reactor had been operated for over 100 days at this time the exact algae bacteria ratio was not clear and could not be known the total biomass concentration in this reactor was approximately 2 g l the biomass in the reactor was then separated equally for performing two independent batch experiments under different aeration conditions then two reactors were applied and were made of transparent plastic one reactor was aerated and oxygen concentration was maintained at 2 mg l via manual control aeration was not applied in the other reactor but algal activity produced oxygen in this reactor and oxygen concentration in this non aerated reactor was approximately 0 2 mg l the experiments were operated at room temperature 20 c each experiment was implemented for eight hours the schematic view of the experimental setup can be seen in supplementary material the initial reactor conditions can be seen in table 1 there was no reactor influent and effluent during the experiments the initial chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium phosphate concentrations were 300 mg l 40 mg l and 10 mg l respectively initial ph was approximately 7 0 by applying naoh and hcl a light source yun7 u shanghai bolitong lumination co ltd china was applied the light intensity on the surface of the light was 200 μmol m2 s and decreased to 113 μmol m2 s after light penetrating a wall of the reactor 2 2 measurement dissolved oxygen do concentration was measured sg9 mettler toledo international inc co cod ammonium phosphate total suspended solids tss alkalinity were measured following standard methods 23 measurement for each parameter was conducted for three times when a sample was taken from a reactor standard measurement errors were calculated based on these measurements 2 3 parameter estimation an algal model asm a was developed by wágner et al 24 this model was combined with the activated sludge model no 3 for modeling biomass activity in the two reactors 25 our previous work shows that there was not heterotrophic algal activity in the applied algal bacteria consortia 10 in addition algae prefer ammonium over nitrate when ammonium is available therefore the processes of organic matter and nitrate removal by algae in the asm a model were not included in the combined model in addition it is reported that activated sludge models cannot be extended with an algal kinetics directly as the asm a model does not include algal bacterial interactions 1 therefore a parameter estimation procedure must be applied before applying the combined model for modeling wastewater treatment by algal bacteria consortia in contrast to an smart parameter estimation procedure 26 the parameter estimation procedure was implemented step by step and included the following steps a when dissolve oxygen do concentration was 2 mg l organic matter was adsorbed by heterotrophic bacteria the ksto and kss h of the aerobic storage of organic matter process for heterotrophic bacteria were estimated by using measured cod concentrations default value for ko h was maintained as oxygen concentration significantly impacted organic matter removal b when do concentration was 2 mg l nitrate was produced and not denitrified measured nitrate concentration was applied to estimate μa in the bacterial nitrification processes when the modelled bacterial nitrification process was estimated the gap in ammonium concentration between modelled ammonium concentration resulted from the nitrification process and measured ammonium concentration was applied to estimate ammonium removal process by algae then the parameter knh4 alg was estimated c more phosphate was adsorbed by paos when a reactor was aerated than the other reactor that was not aerated this difference was applied to estimate qpp in the aerobic storage of xpp for paos then when do concentration was 2 mg l the gap in phosphate concentration between modelled phosphate concentration resulted from paos activity and measured phosphate concentration was applied to estimate phosphate removal process by algae then the parameter kpo alg was estimated the above six parameters were estimated in this parameter estimation procedure because they were the most sensitivity parameters other parameters in the asm a and asm no 3 models were applied using their default values the parameter estimation procedure was implemented in aquasim version 2 0 that is a computer program for identification and simulation of aquatic systems 27 2 4 parameter sensitivity analysis after performing the parameter estimation procedure when some parameters deviated from default values aquasim was applied to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for testing the validity of these estimated parameters 2 5 light utilization evaluation eq 3 is usually applied to model light attenuation in an algal mixture iav is applied to calculate corresponding average light intensity light intensity has an impact on algal activity according to the asm a model the maximum autotrophic algal growth rate should be multiplied by the eq 5 to obtain an actual maximum autotrophic algal growth rate therefore eq 5 was treat as the impacts or output of light on algal bacterial consortia while the initial light intensity io was treat as input as a result eq 6 was constructed to evaluate light utilization efficiency in algal bacterial consortia despite the exact light utilization efficiency must be much more complex and difficult to evaluate 3 i x i o e x p k x t x 4 i a v i o k x t l 1 e x p k x t l 5 o u t p u t i a v i s e x p 1 i a v i s 6 e f f i c i e n c y o u t p u t i n p u t i a v i o i s e

rather than algal suspension were applied in this study the eq 3 could not be applied directly and should be refined to obtain eq 7 in order to obtain eq 7 activated sludge were taken from an aeration tank of a local sewage treatment plant beibei china and algae were scratched from the wall of a secondary settler in the sewage treatment plant the obtained sludge and algae were only applied for determining how light penetrated algal bacterial consortia the algae and sludge were mixed to make various mixtures of algae and sludge sludge and algae concentrations ranged from 0 5 g l to 4 g l respectively light intensity was measured with a machine mq 510 apogee instrument usa when eq 7 was obtained it was applied to replace the eq 3 and the eqs 4 6 were revised accordingly 7 i x i o e x p

cm 1 3 results 3 1 model calibration and verification fig 1 shows that aeration had significant impacts on reactor performance organic matter was removed with a higher rate compared with the case when external oxygen was not supplied in addition aeration enhanced phosphate removal showing that paos functioned in the consortia this was because the applied oxygen concentration did not have impact on algal activity and the significant reduction in phosphate concentration was impossible to result from activities of heterotrophic bacteria and nitrifiers moreover aeration significantly improved ammonium removal but also increased nitrate concentration indicating significant nitrifying activity in the aerated reactor despite the significant differences in reactor performance fig 1 shows that no matter whether the reactors were aerated or not the model matched measured results well in the model inss was zero because acetate was applied as substrate in the experiments and no ammonium was released from acetate in the parameter estimation process two parameters were applied using values deviated from default values in the asm no 3 and asm a models table 2 summarizes these deviations fig 2 shows sensitivity of the two parameters on modelled phosphate concentration phosphate concentration was more sensitive to the variation of qpp than the variation of kpo alg furthermore the shapes of the two curves are different showing that the two parameters are identifiable and not correlated the sensitivity of phosphate concentration with respect to kpo alg and qpp was further analyzed and is shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows that a slight deviation from the applied value for kpo alg can result in significant deviations from the measured phosphate concentrations showing that the default parameter value range of kpo alg i e 0 077 0 31 g n g 1 cod d 1 cannot be applied in the model similarly fig 3b indicates that the default value of qpp i e 1 5 d 1 in the asm no 3 cannot be applied in order to fit the measured data the two parameters i e qpp kpo alg had to deviate from their default values in order to make the model fit the measured data this could be attributed to algal bacterial interactions in the reactor it was found that urocanic acid was detected in algal bacterial consortia 28 the urocanic acid could significantly reduce algal activity even at low concentrations therefore the reduction in kpo alg in the model would be reasonable the inoculated biomass was taken from an algal bacterial membrane bioreactor operated with an srt of 10 days r10 there was an identical algal bacterial membrane bioreactor operated with an srt of 20 days r20 microbial ecology analysis shows that more otu number for paos were detected in the r10 reactor 500 for r10 and 142 for r20 see supplementary material despite higher selection pressure in the r10 reactor more otu for paos were detected indicating that the growth of paos might be promoted by algae in the experimental conditions therefore the applied qpp kpo alg appeared to be reasonable nevertheless further experiments should be done to confirm this 3 2 how microorganisms shared organic matter and nutrients fig 4 shows how paos algae heterotrophic bacteria and nitrifying bacteria shared phosphate organic matter and ammonium in the two batch experiments when external oxygen was supplied paos adsorbed over 80 3 of phosphate while algae adsorbed 3 5 of phosphate and minimal phosphate was shared by nitrifying bacteria heterotrophic bacteria adsorbed 95 6 of organic matter and only 4 4 of organic matter was adsorbed by paos as for ammonium removal nitrifying bacteria consumed 76 8 of ammonium and 11 7 and 10 4 of ammonium was removed by heterotrophic bacteria and algae respectively when external oxygen was not supplied phosphate removal did not vary significantly from the case when external oxygen was supplied nitrifying bacteria adsorbed less than 1 of phosphate similarly heterotrophic bacteria consumed 93 3 of organic matter leaving minimal organic matter to paos only 60 4 of ammonium was consumed by nitrifying bacteria while heterotrophic bacteria and algae consumed more ammonium compared with the case when external oxygen was supplied this is in accordance with our long term previous experimental results showing that nitrifying bacteria almost shared half of ammonium in a non aerated algal bacterial reactor 10 which further confirmed the validity of the combined model 3 3 light utilization efficiency aeration requires a large amount of energy in activated sludge systems while lighting is the major energy demand for algal bacterial systems in algal suspensions light intensity decreases which can be modelled by the equation 1 however it is not clear how light intensity decreases in algal bacteria consortia fig 5 shows that light intensity quickly decreased from 200 μmol m2 s to 0 μmol m2 s in 3 cm showing that light penetration is difficult in algal bacterial systems the location of light sources must be carefully located inside an algal bacterial reactor if the reactor needs to maintain algal autotrophic activity in each part of a reactor if external illumination is applied an algal bacterial reactor must be shallow or else algal activity must be minimal this has been proved by current full scale activated sludge reactors in which bacteria dominate despite sunlight is available however managing light sources is easier if a dark phase for algae is required as only part of a reactor should be illuminated according the experimental data shown in fig 5 the constants in the eq 7 were determined and the eq 7 is replaced by eq 8 eq 8 indicates that bacteria play a more significant role in reducing the light penetration distance than algae fig 8 shows that activated sludge played a much more significant role in restricting light penetration in algal bacterial systems as 2 818 is much higher than 0 808 8 i x i o e x p 2 818 x b 0 808 x a 2 096 x fig 6 indicates light utilization efficiency decreased slowly when io increases from 100 μmol m2 s to 600 μmol m2 s nevertheless the increase in biomass concertation significantly decreased the defined efficiency when biomass concentration increases by two times the efficiency decreased from approximately 0 8 10 4 4 10 4 fig 6 indicates that when artificial illumination is applied biomass concentration should be maintained at low concentrations in order to achieve efficient light utilization alternatively applying algal bacterial biofilm reactors and applying sunlight as light source is also a reasonable alternative this is because sunlight is a free energy source and sunlight utilization efficiency is not of concern 3 4 phosphate removal via alkalinity control many studies show that phosphate removal efficiencies in algal bacterial reactors were low 1 29 therefore there is an urgent need to improve the phosphate removal efficiency fig 1 shows that when not aerated the reactor showed high organic matter and ammonium efficiencies while phosphate removal efficiencies were low after 8 h phosphate concentrations were still higher than 5 8 mg l the reason to the high residual phosphate concentration was that alkalinity quickly decreased to below 0 1 mol m3 in three hours data not shown because nitrification and algal autotrophic activity both consumed alkalinity significantly however the relevant half saturation coefficients for phosphate adsorption by paos and algae i e khco pao and kalk alg are 0 1 mol m3 and 0 25 mol m3 respectively are close to 0 1 mol m3 this indicates that alkalinity in the batch experiment had restrict phosphate removal it is expected that by maintaining sufficient alkalinity phosphate removal in the two batch experiments should be improved significantly fig 7 shows that the increase in alkalinity can improve phosphate removal nevertheless the increase in alkalinity also significantly promote ammonium removal the lack in ammonium cannot sustain phosphate removal by either algae and bacteria as a result residual phosphate concentration decreased from approximately 6 mg l fig 1 to 4 mg l fig 7 fig 7 shows that the complete removal of phosphate removal is not achieved however influent phosphate concertation at practical sewage treatment plants can be as low as 3 mg l therefore fig 7 shows that a high level phosphate removal could be achieved by low concentrated algal bacteria consortia under low oxygen concentrations increasing biomass concentration can also promote nutrient removal in reactors however high biomass concentration will result in low light utilization efficiency as shown in fig 6 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first study that tried to model organic matter ammonium and phosphate removal by algal bacterial consortia by including paos nitrifiers heterotrophic bacteria and algae in a model the paos are assumed to be representative for all types of polyphosphate accumulating organisms 25 several models regarding biological wastewater treatment by algal bacterial consortia have been published however none of these studies included phosphate removal or paos 19 23 30 32 our previous studies show that phosphate removal by paos in algal bacterial consortia was significant 10 therefore paos activity should be included in models for accurate wastewater treatment modeling wágner et al 24 proposed an asm a model is ready to be combined with the asm 2d model the authors suggest that the asm a model was developed by using algal experiments and cannot be directly applied to model algal bacterial consortia as algal bacterial interaction is not included in this study the modified asm a model was combined with the asm no 3 it is found that the combined model well matched experimental results the algal bacterial interactions have not been well studied in biological wastewater treatment therefore it is not clear how exactly the interactions impacted reactor activity although qpp and kpo alg deviated from their default values sensitivity analysis shows that this deviations were reasonable considering the model accurately fit experimental data the combined model is expected to be applied as a platform to predict biological wastewater treatment by algal bacterial consortia nevertheless algal bacterial interactions are complex when a dominant microbial community differs from the microbial community applied in this study values for qpp and kpo alg might differ from their default values in the asm a and asm no 3 models and the values applied in this study this study proves the feasibility of applying the asm no 3 and asm a models for modeling algal bacterial reactors the obtained model could be further modified for modeling different algal bacterial reactors such as algal bacterial biofilm and granular sludge reactors 33 41 for instance when oxygen concentration was 0 1 mg l nitrite concentration could be as high as 5 mg l 11 in this case the asm no 3 can be extended by including more bioprocesses such as nitrite accumulation 42 then the extended asm no3 model can be combined with the asm a model to model an algal bacterial reactor operated at this low oxygen concentration fig 4 shows that algae played a minor role in ammonium and phosphate removal this is because nitrifiers and paos have much stronger capacity in adsorbing nutrients than algae for instance the saturation constants for ammonium for nitrifiers and algae are 1 0 g n m3 and 7 87 g n m3 respectively similarly the saturation constants for phosphate for paos and algae are 0 2 g p m3 and 4 49 g p m3 respectively nitrification played an important role in ammonium removal fig 4 shows that a majority of ammonium was removed by nitrifiers while external oxygen was not supplied the nitrate concentration was minimal this was because nitrate was consumed by algae resulting in minimal nitrate accumulation however fig 1 shows that when aerated nitrate accumulated in the reactor aeration promoted nitrification and resulted in nitrate accumulation showing that nitrate uptake by algae was much more slowly than nitrate production alkalinity has impacts on the activities of paos algae and nitrifiers when alkalinity depleted nitrifiers and algae are not active as a result ammonium will not be consumed moreover the storage of organic matter by paos and growth of paos depend on alkalinity therefore the depletion of alkalinity will result in poor phosphate removal fig 7 shows that nutrient removal can be significantly improved by maintaining alkalinity at 1 mol m3 however the high alkalinity cannot significantly improve nutrient removal by algae fig 8 therefore the main role of algae in algal bacterial consortia is supplying oxygen to bacteria that play a major role in polishing wastewater in addition when applied for wastewater treatments most algal bacterial reactors required hrts as high as 2 10 days that are significantly higher than the hrts required by activated sludge systems 2 5 the high hrts restrict the application of algal bacterial reactors for wastewater treatment in our studies we have achieved hrts below one day by applying an algal bacterial reactor 10 when maintaining the same operational conditions algal bacterial consortia are robust systems as a consortia finally entered a status no matter which inoculum conditions were applied 11 nevertheless the mechanisms behind the experimental results were not clear the model well modelled activities of biomass taken from the algal bacterial reactor which explained how pollutants were removed from the reactor furthermore current algal bacterial reactors are poor in phosphate removal phosphate accumulating algae are proposed for enhancing phosphate removal although it is not clear how to achieve phosphate accumulation in algae at this stage 10 in this study the model indicates that a sophisticated alkalinity control is a feasible approach for promoting phosphate removal 5 conclusions a model which combined asm no3 and a refined algal biokinetics was successfully constructed and calibrated according to the model the following conclusions can be obtained 1 paos and nitrifying bacteria consumed over 80 of phosphate and 60 of ammonium under different aeration conditions respectively whereas algae played a minor role in removing nutrient 2 maintaining alkalinity at 1 mol m3 promotes nutrient removal by increasing activities of paos and nitrifying bacteria despite algae consume less nutrients 3 bacteria played a more significant role in reducing light intensity than algae concentrated biomass should not be applied at large scale when artificial illumination is applied 4 the model predicts that efficient wastewater treatment can be achieved by applying low concentrated algal bacterial consortia without manual external oxygen supply declaration of competing interest the

are removed is still not well understood for instance organic matter and ammonium are usually removed efficiently by algal bacteria consortia however it is still difficult to explain why phosphate removal efficiency is usually low 6 9 furthermore our works show that in a concentrated algal bacterial reactor algae nitrifiers paos and heterotrophic bacteria coexisted and efficiently polished wastewater 1 10 11 nevertheless how these microorganisms cooperated in reactors is still not clear moreover n and p uptake in reactors was in excess of the stoichiometric requirements for the observed biomass growth which has not been explained 12 reactor models are helpful in understanding reactor operation and thereby improving reactor performance which has been proved by the implementation of activated sludge models asms 13 in addition to the asms many algal biokinetics have been reported 14 19 a few researchers tried to combine bacterial and algal models together to explain pollutant removal by algal bacterial reactors 19 22 however these models usually do not include paos activity or phosphate removal for instance zambrano et al 23 report a model integrating activities of algae and ammonium oxidation bacteria aob whereas heterotrophic bacteria and paos are not included reports show that oxygen concentration had significant impacts on phosphate removal indicating that phosphate removal by paos in algal bacterial consortia cannot be ignored 10 it is straightforward that a widely applied activated sludge model can be extended with an algal kinetics for modeling the simultaneous removal of organic matter ammonium and phosphate surprisingly such work has not been performed an algal model asm a was proposed for modeling algal activity in wastewater treatment 24 in this study this algal model was modified and combined with the widely accepted activated sludge model no 3 asm no 3 in order to explain how pollutants were removed from wastewater the asm no 3 model can model the activities of heterotrophic bacteria nitrifiers and paos the validity of the asm no 3 has been verified by world wide researchers nevertheless the asm no 3 model does not include algal activity therefore it must be extended with an algal kinetics for modeling algal bacterial reactors because the asm no 3 model and the ams a model are both expressed in matrix forms the combination of the two models is convenient as a result the obtained comprehensive model should enable modeling variations in concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium phosphate and nitrate by including activities of heterotrophic bacteria nitrifier paos and algae in this study in order to verify the applicability of the combined model experiments were conducted to calibrate and verify the obtained model then the model was applied to analyze how organic matter ammonium and phosphate were removed by algal bacterial consortia and explain how to optimize reactor operation if the obtained model could successfully model the activities of algal bacterial consortia it would be a useful tool to study algal bacterial systems for other researchers 2 methods and materials 2 1 batch experiment inoculated algae and bacteria came from an algal bacterial reactor treating synthetic sewage with sludge retention time srt of 10 days 11 the reactor had been operated for over 100 days at this time the exact algae bacteria ratio was not clear and could not be known the total biomass concentration in this reactor was approximately 2 g l the biomass in the reactor was then separated equally for performing two independent batch experiments under different aeration conditions then two reactors were applied and were made of transparent plastic one reactor was aerated and oxygen concentration was maintained at 2 mg l via manual control aeration was not applied in the other reactor but algal activity produced oxygen in this reactor and oxygen concentration in this non aerated reactor was approximately 0 2 mg l the experiments were operated at room temperature 20 c each experiment was implemented for eight hours the schematic view of the experimental setup can be seen in supplementary material the initial reactor conditions can be seen in table 1 there was no reactor influent and effluent during the experiments the initial chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium phosphate concentrations were 300 mg l 40 mg l and 10 mg l respectively initial ph was approximately 7 0 by applying naoh and hcl a light source yun7 u shanghai bolitong lumination co ltd china was applied the light intensity on the surface of the light was 200 μmol m2 s and decreased to 113 μmol m2 s after light penetrating a wall of the reactor 2 2 measurement dissolved oxygen do concentration was measured sg9 mettler toledo international inc co cod ammonium phosphate total suspended solids tss alkalinity were measured following standard methods 23 measurement for each parameter was conducted for three times when a sample was taken from a reactor standard measurement errors were calculated based on these measurements 2 3 parameter estimation an algal model asm a was developed by wágner et al 24 this model was combined with the activated sludge model no 3 for modeling biomass activity in the two reactors 25 our previous work shows that there was not heterotrophic algal activity in the applied algal bacteria consortia 10 in addition algae prefer ammonium over nitrate when ammonium is available therefore the processes of organic matter and nitrate removal by algae in the asm a model were not included in the combined model in addition it is reported that activated sludge models cannot be extended with an algal kinetics directly as the asm a model does not include algal bacterial interactions 1 therefore a parameter estimation procedure must be applied before applying the combined model for modeling wastewater treatment by algal bacteria consortia in contrast to an smart parameter estimation procedure 26 the parameter estimation procedure was implemented step by step and included the following steps a when dissolve oxygen do concentration was 2 mg l organic matter was adsorbed by heterotrophic bacteria the ksto and kss h of the aerobic storage of organic matter process for heterotrophic bacteria were estimated by using measured cod concentrations default value for ko h was maintained as oxygen concentration significantly impacted organic matter removal b when do concentration was 2 mg l nitrate was produced and not denitrified measured nitrate concentration was applied to estimate μa in the bacterial nitrification processes when the modelled bacterial nitrification process was estimated the gap in ammonium concentration between modelled ammonium concentration resulted from the nitrification process and measured ammonium concentration was applied to estimate ammonium removal process by algae then the parameter knh4 alg was estimated c more phosphate was adsorbed by paos when a reactor was aerated than the other reactor that was not aerated this difference was applied to estimate qpp in the aerobic storage of xpp for paos then when do concentration was 2 mg l the gap in phosphate concentration between modelled phosphate concentration resulted from paos activity and measured phosphate concentration was applied to estimate phosphate removal process by algae then the parameter kpo alg was estimated the above six parameters were estimated in this parameter estimation procedure because they were the most sensitivity parameters other parameters in the asm a and asm no 3 models were applied using their default values the parameter estimation procedure was implemented in aquasim version 2 0 that is a computer program for identification and simulation of aquatic systems 27 2 4 parameter sensitivity analysis after performing the parameter estimation procedure when some parameters deviated from default values aquasim was applied to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for testing the validity of these estimated parameters 2 5 light utilization evaluation eq 3 is usually applied to model light attenuation in an algal mixture iav is applied to calculate corresponding average light intensity light intensity has an impact on algal activity according to the asm a model the maximum autotrophic algal growth rate should be multiplied by the eq 5 to obtain an actual maximum autotrophic algal growth rate therefore eq 5 was treat as the impacts or output of light on algal bacterial consortia while the initial light intensity io was treat as input as a result eq 6 was constructed to evaluate light utilization efficiency in algal bacterial consortia despite the exact light utilization efficiency must be much more complex and difficult to evaluate 3 i x i o e x p k x t x 4 i a v i o k x t l 1 e x p k x t l 5 o u t p u t i a v i s e x p 1 i a v i s 6 e f f i c i e n c y o u t p u t i n p u t i a v i o i s e

rather than algal suspension were applied in this study the eq 3 could not be applied directly and should be refined to obtain eq 7 in order to obtain eq 7 activated sludge were taken from an aeration tank of a local sewage treatment plant beibei china and algae were scratched from the wall of a secondary settler in the sewage treatment plant the obtained sludge and algae were only applied for determining how light penetrated algal bacterial consortia the algae and sludge were mixed to make various mixtures of algae and sludge sludge and algae concentrations ranged from 0 5 g l to 4 g l respectively light intensity was measured with a machine mq 510 apogee instrument usa when eq 7 was obtained it was applied to replace the eq 3 and the eqs 4 6 were revised accordingly 7 i x i o e x p

cm 1 3 results 3 1 model calibration and verification fig 1 shows that aeration had significant impacts on reactor performance organic matter was removed with a higher rate compared with the case when external oxygen was not supplied in addition aeration enhanced phosphate removal showing that paos functioned in the consortia this was because the applied oxygen concentration did not have impact on algal activity and the significant reduction in phosphate concentration was impossible to result from activities of heterotrophic bacteria and nitrifiers moreover aeration significantly improved ammonium removal but also increased nitrate concentration indicating significant nitrifying activity in the aerated reactor despite the significant differences in reactor performance fig 1 shows that no matter whether the reactors were aerated or not the model matched measured results well in the model inss was zero because acetate was applied as substrate in the experiments and no ammonium was released from acetate in the parameter estimation process two parameters were applied using values deviated from default values in the asm no 3 and asm a models table 2 summarizes these deviations fig 2 shows sensitivity of the two parameters on modelled phosphate concentration phosphate concentration was more sensitive to the variation of qpp than the variation of kpo alg furthermore the shapes of the two curves are different showing that the two parameters are identifiable and not correlated the sensitivity of phosphate concentration with respect to kpo alg and qpp was further analyzed and is shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows that a slight deviation from the applied value for kpo alg can result in significant deviations from the measured phosphate concentrations showing that the default parameter value range of kpo alg i e 0 077 0 31 g n g 1 cod d 1 cannot be applied in the model similarly fig 3b indicates that the default value of qpp i e 1 5 d 1 in the asm no 3 cannot be applied in order to fit the measured data the two parameters i e qpp kpo alg had to deviate from their default values in order to make the model fit the measured data this could be attributed to algal bacterial interactions in the reactor it was found that urocanic acid was detected in algal bacterial consortia 28 the urocanic acid could significantly reduce algal activity even at low concentrations therefore the reduction in kpo alg in the model would be reasonable the inoculated biomass was taken from an algal bacterial membrane bioreactor operated with an srt of 10 days r10 there was an identical algal bacterial membrane bioreactor operated with an srt of 20 days r20 microbial ecology analysis shows that more otu number for paos were detected in the r10 reactor 500 for r10 and 142 for r20 see supplementary material despite higher selection pressure in the r10 reactor more otu for paos were detected indicating that the growth of paos might be promoted by algae in the experimental conditions therefore the applied qpp kpo alg appeared to be reasonable nevertheless further experiments should be done to confirm this 3 2 how microorganisms shared organic matter and nutrients fig 4 shows how paos algae heterotrophic bacteria and nitrifying bacteria shared phosphate organic matter and ammonium in the two batch experiments when external oxygen was supplied paos adsorbed over 80 3 of phosphate while algae adsorbed 3 5 of phosphate and minimal phosphate was shared by nitrifying bacteria heterotrophic bacteria adsorbed 95 6 of organic matter and only 4 4 of organic matter was adsorbed by paos as for ammonium removal nitrifying bacteria consumed 76 8 of ammonium and 11 7 and 10 4 of ammonium was removed by heterotrophic bacteria and algae respectively when external oxygen was not supplied phosphate removal did not vary significantly from the case when external oxygen was supplied nitrifying bacteria adsorbed less than 1 of phosphate similarly heterotrophic bacteria consumed 93 3 of organic matter leaving minimal organic matter to paos only 60 4 of ammonium was consumed by nitrifying bacteria while heterotrophic bacteria and algae consumed more ammonium compared with the case when external oxygen was supplied this is in accordance with our long term previous experimental results showing that nitrifying bacteria almost shared half of ammonium in a non aerated algal bacterial reactor 10 which further confirmed the validity of the combined model 3 3 light utilization efficiency aeration requires a large amount of energy in activated sludge systems while lighting is the major energy demand for algal bacterial systems in algal suspensions light intensity decreases which can be modelled by the equation 1 however it is not clear how light intensity decreases in algal bacteria consortia fig 5 shows that light intensity quickly decreased from 200 μmol m2 s to 0 μmol m2 s in 3 cm showing that light penetration is difficult in algal bacterial systems the location of light sources must be carefully located inside an algal bacterial reactor if the reactor needs to maintain algal autotrophic activity in each part of a reactor if external illumination is applied an algal bacterial reactor must be shallow or else algal activity must be minimal this has been proved by current full scale activated sludge reactors in which bacteria dominate despite sunlight is available however managing light sources is easier if a dark phase for algae is required as only part of a reactor should be illuminated according the experimental data shown in fig 5 the constants in the eq 7 were determined and the eq 7 is replaced by eq 8 eq 8 indicates that bacteria play a more significant role in reducing the light penetration distance than algae fig 8 shows that activated sludge played a much more significant role in restricting light penetration in algal bacterial systems as 2 818 is much higher than 0 808 8 i x i o e x p 2 818 x b 0 808 x a 2 096 x fig 6 indicates light utilization efficiency decreased slowly when io increases from 100 μmol m2 s to 600 μmol m2 s nevertheless the increase in biomass concertation significantly decreased the defined efficiency when biomass concentration increases by two times the efficiency decreased from approximately 0 8 10 4 4 10 4 fig 6 indicates that when artificial illumination is applied biomass concentration should be maintained at low concentrations in order to achieve efficient light utilization alternatively applying algal bacterial biofilm reactors and applying sunlight as light source is also a reasonable alternative this is because sunlight is a free energy source and sunlight utilization efficiency is not of concern 3 4 phosphate removal via alkalinity control many studies show that phosphate removal efficiencies in algal bacterial reactors were low 1 29 therefore there is an urgent need to improve the phosphate removal efficiency fig 1 shows that when not aerated the reactor showed high organic matter and ammonium efficiencies while phosphate removal efficiencies were low after 8 h phosphate concentrations were still higher than 5 8 mg l the reason to the high residual phosphate concentration was that alkalinity quickly decreased to below 0 1 mol m3 in three hours data not shown because nitrification and algal autotrophic activity both consumed alkalinity significantly however the relevant half saturation coefficients for phosphate adsorption by paos and algae i e khco pao and kalk alg are 0 1 mol m3 and 0 25 mol m3 respectively are close to 0 1 mol m3 this indicates that alkalinity in the batch experiment had restrict phosphate removal it is expected that by maintaining sufficient alkalinity phosphate removal in the two batch experiments should be improved significantly fig 7 shows that the increase in alkalinity can improve phosphate removal nevertheless the increase in alkalinity also significantly promote ammonium removal the lack in ammonium cannot sustain phosphate removal by either algae and bacteria as a result residual phosphate concentration decreased from approximately 6 mg l fig 1 to 4 mg l fig 7 fig 7 shows that the complete removal of phosphate removal is not achieved however influent phosphate concertation at practical sewage treatment plants can be as low as 3 mg l therefore fig 7 shows that a high level phosphate removal could be achieved by low concentrated algal bacteria consortia under low oxygen concentrations increasing biomass concentration can also promote nutrient removal in reactors however high biomass concentration will result in low light utilization efficiency as shown in fig 6 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first study that tried to model organic matter ammonium and phosphate removal by algal bacterial consortia by including paos nitrifiers heterotrophic bacteria and algae in a model the paos are assumed to be representative for all types of polyphosphate accumulating organisms 25 several models regarding biological wastewater treatment by algal bacterial consortia have been published however none of these studies included phosphate removal or paos 19 23 30 32 our previous studies show that phosphate removal by paos in algal bacterial consortia was significant 10 therefore paos activity should be included in models for accurate wastewater treatment modeling wágner et al 24 proposed an asm a model is ready to be combined with the asm 2d model the authors suggest that the asm a model was developed by using algal experiments and cannot be directly applied to model algal bacterial consortia as algal bacterial interaction is not included in this study the modified asm a model was combined with the asm no 3 it is found that the combined model well matched experimental results the algal bacterial interactions have not been well studied in biological wastewater treatment therefore it is not clear how exactly the interactions impacted reactor activity although qpp and kpo alg deviated from their default values sensitivity analysis shows that this deviations were reasonable considering the model accurately fit experimental data the combined model is expected to be applied as a platform to predict biological wastewater treatment by algal bacterial consortia nevertheless algal bacterial interactions are complex when a dominant microbial community differs from the microbial community applied in this study values for qpp and kpo alg might differ from their default values in the asm a and asm no 3 models and the values applied in this study this study proves the feasibility of applying the asm no 3 and asm a models for modeling algal bacterial reactors the obtained model could be further modified for modeling different algal bacterial reactors such as algal bacterial biofilm and granular sludge reactors 33 41 for instance when oxygen concentration was 0 1 mg l nitrite concentration could be as high as 5 mg l 11 in this case the asm no 3 can be extended by including more bioprocesses such as nitrite accumulation 42 then the extended asm no3 model can be combined with the asm a model to model an algal bacterial reactor operated at this low oxygen concentration fig 4 shows that algae played a minor role in ammonium and phosphate removal this is because nitrifiers and paos have much stronger capacity in adsorbing nutrients than algae for instance the saturation constants for ammonium for nitrifiers and algae are 1 0 g n m3 and 7 87 g n m3 respectively similarly the saturation constants for phosphate for paos and algae are 0 2 g p m3 and 4 49 g p m3 respectively nitrification played an important role in ammonium removal fig 4 shows that a majority of ammonium was removed by nitrifiers while external oxygen was not supplied the nitrate concentration was minimal this was because nitrate was consumed by algae resulting in minimal nitrate accumulation however fig 1 shows that when aerated nitrate accumulated in the reactor aeration promoted nitrification and resulted in nitrate accumulation showing that nitrate uptake by algae was much more slowly than nitrate production alkalinity has impacts on the activities of paos algae and nitrifiers when alkalinity depleted nitrifiers and algae are not active as a result ammonium will not be consumed moreover the storage of organic matter by paos and growth of paos depend on alkalinity therefore the depletion of alkalinity will result in poor phosphate removal fig 7 shows that nutrient removal can be significantly improved by maintaining alkalinity at 1 mol m3 however the high alkalinity cannot significantly improve nutrient removal by algae fig 8 therefore the main role of algae in algal bacterial consortia is supplying oxygen to bacteria that play a major role in polishing wastewater in addition when applied for wastewater treatments most algal bacterial reactors required hrts as high as 2 10 days that are significantly higher than the hrts required by activated sludge systems 2 5 the high hrts restrict the application of algal bacterial reactors for wastewater treatment in our studies we have achieved hrts below one day by applying an algal bacterial reactor 10 when maintaining the same operational conditions algal bacterial consortia are robust systems as a consortia finally entered a status no matter which inoculum conditions were applied 11 nevertheless the mechanisms behind the experimental results were not clear the model well modelled activities of biomass taken from the algal bacterial reactor which explained how pollutants were removed from the reactor furthermore current algal bacterial reactors are poor in phosphate removal phosphate accumulating algae are proposed for enhancing phosphate removal although it is not clear how to achieve phosphate accumulation in algae at this stage 10 in this study the model indicates that a sophisticated alkalinity control is a feasible approach for promoting phosphate removal 5 conclusions a model which combined asm no3 and a refined algal biokinetics was successfully constructed and calibrated according to the model the following conclusions can be obtained 1 paos and nitrifying bacteria consumed over 80 of phosphate and 60 of ammonium under different aeration conditions respectively whereas algae played a minor role in removing nutrient 2 maintaining alkalinity at 1 mol m3 promotes nutrient removal by increasing activities of paos and nitrifying bacteria despite algae consume less nutrients 3 bacteria played a more significant role in reducing light intensity than algae concentrated biomass should not be applied at large scale when artificial illumination is applied 4 the model predicts that efficient wastewater treatment can be achieved by applying low concentrated algal bacterial consortia without manual external oxygen supply declaration of competing interest the

13799,in the current study the synthesis of hydroxyapatite hap and its composite by various techniques are abridged highlighting the eco friendly technique a green synthesis that involves the use of eco friendly solvents like water and precursor substitution by waste resources magnetic hap plays a major role in the hap composites because of the ease of recovery and reuse this study also emphasizes the prowess of the adsorption technique for the removal of various pollutants such as heavy metals dyes and emerging pollutants a detailed adsorption mechanism is explained to understand the possible reactions taking place between the adsorbent and the adsorbate recent literature regarding the adsorption of various environmental pollutants by hap and its composites are reported to support the efficiency of the adsorption process keywords hydroxyapatite hap composites magnetic hap dyes heavy metals emerging pollutants 1 introduction hydroxyapatite hap is a mineral form of calcium apatite having a chemical formula of ca5 po4 3 oh the most common form of hap is hexagonal and is biocompatible 1 it is the major component of teeth and bone mineral and constitutes about 70 bone weight and 90 enamel weight 2 the physical and chemical characteristics are very important because the qualities such as structure purity and flowability will rely on those characteristics hap is usually white to off white with a molecular weight of 502 31 g mol 3 in vertebrates the key mineral is naturally occurring in the form of calcium phosphate with a ca p ratio of less than 1 67 4 5 hap is a unique form of calcium phosphate the superior characteristic of hap is its capacity of accepting a large number of anionic and cationic substituents 6 which facilitates the possibility of using it in various applications 7 the effectiveness of hap depends on its microstructure such as grain size and distribution its shape and distribution porosity and crystallinity 8 for example the chemical composition of hap and bone tissues are similar which makes it applicable for biomedical purposes 9 hap is studied for various applications such as fluorescent lamps fuel cell materials and adsorption of various pollutants 6 to prevent the phase impurities in hap its crystal structure and chemical composition should be controlled which can be achieved by developing new methods besides hap synthesis has complexities in controlling microstructure stoichiometry and agglomeration 10 to enhance the specific properties of hap it may be doped with other compounds like heavy metals and polymers to form hap composites fig 1 shows the trend of studies on hap nanoparticles up to 2020 as per scopus the increasing trend in the number of articles evinced the importance of hydroxyapatite and its composites besides adsorption plays a major role in the development of wastewater treatment techniques in which hydroxyapatite and its composites are used as adsorbents for the removal of various pollutants such as heavy metals dyes and emerging pollutants adsorption process not only removes the pollutants but also recovers the pollutants by desorption present in wastewater which can be reused fig 2 the current review aims to deliver insights into the arena of hap and its composite synthesis and the adsorption of pollutants the first section outlines the common paths that are applied to the synthesis of hap and its composites the second section describes the adsorption mechanism and the adsorption of various pollutants such as heavy metals dye and emerging pollutants 2 synthesis of hydroxyapatite hap is used in several forms such as powders granules and porous blocks several methods are used for the synthesis of hap which includes sol gel synthesis 11 hydrothermal reactions 12 ultrasound microwave method u m 13 co precipitation method 14 and sonochemical method 15 as described in fig 3 2 1 co precipitation method in this method calcium and phosphate salts are mixed along with a chelating agent to obtain a white turbid solution which is later subjected to centrifugation and calcination by using cysteine as a chelating agent hap nanoparticles were obtained by this method 14 calcium source was mixed dropwise in a solution of cysteine and phosphate source until a white turbid suspension was obtained later by centrifugation and calcination hap was obtained in another method phosphate salt solution was added slowly to the calcium salt solution at an alkaline ph and stirred for 2 h followed by 5 h of aging which resulted in the formation of hap nanoparticles on washing and drying the precipitate formed 16 2 2 hydrothermal method in this method after mixing calcium and phosphate salts the solution obtained is hydrothermally treated at high temperatures in an autoclave or a microwave hap zn incorporated hap was synthesized as follows ca and zn were mixed in a definite molar ratio the phosphate precursor was added to the former by maintaining the ion molar ratio of 1 67 the solution was heated in the microwave after ph was adjusted to an alkaline condition the product formed was washed and dried resulting in a zn incorporated hap thus increasing the potential application of hap 17 the addition of vitamin c as a template to the calcium and phosphate mixture in an alkaline condition which is hydrothermally treated simplified the formation of hap as described 18 2 3 sol gel method sol gel technique involves the mixing of calcium and phosphate precursor to form a 3d inorganic system gr hap glutinous rice particles were synthesized by the sol gel method and calcined under changing temperature calcium and phosphate salts were mixed to maintain the ca p ratio of 1 67 on the formation of gel it was aged for 16 h and then washed and dried in a muffle furnace another sample was synthesized similarly but was assisted with ultrasonic agitation after gel formation both the samples were compared and it was found that ultrasonic agitation increased its mechanical and morphological properties 11 stirring and sonication of calcium and phosphate precursor with an organic modifier resulted in the formation of gel which on aging and sintering produced mesoporous hap 19 2 4 sonochemical method in this method after or during the mixing of calcium and phosphate salts the solution is subjected to sonochemical treatment viz ultrasonic waves are passed through the solution calcined mussel shell powder was used as a calcium source which was mixed with nitric acid to produce calcium nitrate while maintaining an alkaline ph the phosphate source was added dropwise along with ultrasonic irradiation to produce the hap solution the hap nanoparticles were obtained by centrifugation and overnight drying of the solution 20 a similar process was reported in which a mixture of calcium and phosphate ions were irradiated with the ultrasonic device to produce hap particles 15 2 5 ultrasound microwave treatment in this technique during the mixing of calcium and phosphate the solution is subjected to ultrasound treatment after which it is microwaved hap was synthesized using pomacea sp shell powder with citric acid under ultrasound radiation the phosphate precursor was added to the shell powder to maintain the ca p ratio of 1 67 after the ultrasound process the mixture was refluxed with microwave resulting in hap with excellent properties 13 poly styrene sulfonic acid sodium salt pss was used to synthesize calcium carbonate by blending this salt with calcium chloride this calcium source along with the phosphate source was mixed at basic ph and heated in a microwave reactor the product obtained was spun in a centrifuge and washed using microwave irradiation size and morphology could be controlled 21 different methods of synthesis of hap nanoparticles are given in table 1 along with the advantages 2 6 green sources for hap synthesis 2 6 1 calcium substitute for the synthesis of hap the use of natural resources containing calcium components can be substituted instead of commercial calcium salts 27 fig 4 indicates the various waste resources such as eggshells shells fish bones fish scales animal bones and algae that can be used to synthesize hap the phosphate salt solution was gently added to the eggshells treated with hcl at room temperature and left for one week after aging the hap particles were formed and were washed and oven dried hap particles were formed by one more method by using a green template a green template is defined as a naturally available material that is used in the synthesis process the extract from the natural source was added to the calcium salt and incubated the phosphate salt was then added to this mixture and aged for one week followed by washing and oven drying this study proved that the biomolecules affected the microstructure enhancing their properties 28 oyster shell powders and phosphate salt were mixed and put in a ball milling machine for a different time interval this slurry was dried in the oven and calcined for one hour due to the addition of oyster shell powder the cost of calcium salt was eliminated pure hap particles with a good crystalline structure were obtained 29 cuttlefish bones were used as a calcium source to synthesize hap treated bones were subjected to hydrothermal treatment along with the phosphate precursors such that the ca p ratio was 1 67 after this the pieces of bones were boiled with deionized water and dried at 105 c hap was then glazed with poly ε caprolactone pcl which increased the strength and other properties of hap 30 in another study 31 the fish bones were cleaned by water acetone and sodium hydroxide for the removal of remains followed by oven drying and powdering this powder was heated with naoh at a high temperature until the impurities were removed the solution was centrifuged and oven dried characterization of this powder proved that hap had been isolated from salmon fishbone concluding that hap formed has a high potential for biomedical applications fish scales also contain calcium which makes them a source to synthesize hap particles the fish scales were washed and deproteinized by hcl and naoh and heated for 5 h the precipitate formed was separated and desiccated followed by alkali heat treatment for 1 h the final product obtained was washed until the solution became neutral and dried the hap showed a high porosity and adsorption capacity 32 in another study the animal bone was thermally treated at different temperatures the change in color after calcination indicated the removal of organic matter this study proved that chicken bones could be used as a bioresource for the synthesis of hap 33 the use of algae in the synthesis of hap was examined in a study 34 algae was washed and heated to remove the organic matter the phosphate salt and pyrolyzed algae were mixed in a stirrer at a high temperature for 24 h by maintaining the alkaline ph after cooling this precipitate was filtered and washed with acetic acid to remove the remaining phosphate salt the material was washed until neutral and dried high purity hap was obtained at a low cost chicken beaks were cleaned by boiling and immersing in acetone ether mixture followed by drying and calcination at high temperatures and powdered characterization of this powder concluded that hap with good crystallinity was formed with increasing calcination temperatures 35 various natural sources used for the synthesis of hap are mentioned in table 2 2 6 2 green synthesis of hap green synthesis involves the use of plant extract for the synthesis of hap it not only reduces the expense but also enhances the properties of nanoparticles the use of a green template affects the crystalline size of the nanoparticles by adding extracts from natural sources the size of the particles decreases due to the reduction in agglomeration if there is an increase in size it may be due to the interfacial reaction between the salts and the extract change in the nucleation centers during the addition of the extract into the precursors different extracts along with the synthesis methods are given in table 3 in a study the leaf extracts of neem and ivy gourd leaves were prepared by boiling the finely cut clean leaves for 2 h after cooling the extract was filtered and stored at a low temperature for further use the calcium and phosphate solutions were made by using the extract as a solvent and by maintaining alkaline ph the calcium salt solution was stirred simultaneously and the phosphate solution was added to it dropwise for 1 h after aging for 24 h the precipitate was spun in a centrifuge and dried to obtain the hap powders the results indicated that the addition of extract decreased crystallinity 51 the neem extract addition resulted in fine particles due to the interactions between the carboxyl and hap similar studies were conducted by using the aloe vera leaf extract 52 aloe vera leaves were cut into fragments and simmered at 30 c under stirring both the calcium and phosphate salts were added to the extract the solution was stirred at a high temperature until the dried precursor was gained to gain hap particles the dried precursor was calcinated at different temperatures it was found that with the addition of the extract a clear crystal structure was formed without the extract non uniform and agglomerated particles were formed drumstick flowers were washed boiled filtered and used as extract 55 phosphoric acid was mixed with a calcium salt solution in an alkaline ph maintained by naoh the extract was added to the latter the precipitate obtained was dried and calcined for 1 h the results showed that the addition of the extract caused a size increment due to the interfacial reaction soapnut shells were used as a green template for the synthesis of hap 57 the extract was prepared by boiling soapnut shells in water and filtrating it the extract and the calcium salt solution were mixed thoroughly for 1 5 h to which the phosphate salt solution was added dropwise at a basic ph the resulting precipitate was sterilized in an autoclave for 5 h this mixture was filtered and sintered to gain pure hap the addition of the extract enhanced the structure the spherical structure changed to flaky due to the addition of the extract and enhanced the size of the hap particles in a study sucrose from natural sources and commercial sucrose were used to form complexes the extracts of pineapple carrot and sugarcane were used the calcium salt solution was mixed with the powdered extract under continuous stirring to which the phosphate solution was added dropwise at ph 9 the precipitate formed was kept in the oven for 24 h followed by washing and drying the dried powder was then calcined for 2 h the results indicated that the extract improved morphological and crystalline properties the sugarcane extract had a well defined spherical structure with a low crystalline size 58 the apple extract powder containing malic acid was mixed with the calcium salt solution under stirring for 1 h to this mixture the phosphate solution was added dropwise by maintaining an alkaline ph the precipitate obtained was kept in an oven for 24 h after washing with ethanol it was again oven dried and sintered for 2 h commercially available malic acid was also used

of emerging pollutants apart from heavy metals and dyes there are certain pollutants with highly stable structures and whose effects on wastewater are not completely known these are known as emerging pollutants cosmetics herbicides pesticides pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics and drugs are common emerging pollutants they are not treated efficiently when they are discharged into the wastewater 116 various primary and secondary conventional treatment processes are found to be less efficient in the removal of these pollutants to prevent chronic effects an efficient technique for

ofloxacin and triclosan which are pharmaceutical products were adsorbed by the green synthesized hap synthesized by the co precipitation method cotton was used as a green template the adsorption of triclosan was 133 3 mg g high than ofloxacin 29 15 mg g low due to a strong hydrogen bonding between ofloxacin and water hap was found to be efficient in adsorbing both pharmaceutical products 117 hap

alternative method to the existing conventional synthesis methods minimizing the expense of adsorption can be achieved by reducing the cost of the adsorbent which can be achieved by opting for a synthesis method with less energy consumption less chemical usage the substitution of precursors with naturally available materials hap is an adsorbent that can be synthesized easily from the natural sources available modification of which enhances adsorption to overcome the drawbacks of hap viz difficulty in removal and stability at extreme conditions doping it with another compound is recently practiced doping can result in the presence of compounds with a higher affinity towards the adsorbate easy removal of the adsorbent as in the case of hap magnetic composite and increasing the

calcium apatite having a chemical formula of ca5 po4 3 oh the most common form of hap is hexagonal and is biocompatible 1 it is the major component of teeth and bone mineral and constitutes about 70 bone weight and 90 enamel weight 2 the physical and chemical characteristics are very important because the qualities such as structure purity and flowability will rely on those characteristics hap is usually white to off white with a molecular weight of 502 31 g mol 3 in vertebrates the key mineral is naturally occurring in the form of calcium phosphate with a ca p ratio of less than 1 67 4 5 hap is a unique form of calcium phosphate the superior characteristic of hap is its capacity of accepting a large number of anionic and cationic substituents 6 which facilitates the possibility of using it in various applications 7 the effectiveness of hap depends on its microstructure such as grain size and distribution its shape and distribution porosity and crystallinity 8 for example the chemical composition of hap and bone tissues are similar which makes it applicable for biomedical purposes 9 hap is studied for various applications such as fluorescent lamps fuel cell materials and adsorption

advantages such as high yield simple process easy recovery and reuse more than one compound can be nobbled into hap iron oxide nanoparticles are of different forms including magnetite maghemite hematite and goethite the surface energy of iron oxide nanoparticles tends to reduce due to their high energy level resulting in the loss of their magnetization phytogenic synthesis overcomes this problem by providing a coating of biomolecules over the iron oxide nanoparticles 69 the use of green solvents prevents the use of commonly used reducing agents such as sodium borohydride which is toxic the amines and phenols are capable of reducing ferric and ferrous ions to iron oxide nanoparticles 70 the general process of doping hap with iron oxide is given in fig 6 ferrous chloride

pollutants by hap and its composites 4 1 parameters impact on adsorption mechanism of hap various techniques have been developed for the treatment of pollutants which include biodegradation coagulation flocculation electrochemical oxidation electrocoagulation fenton oxidation ion exchange ozonation reverse osmosis and adsorption 89 90 simplicity low concentration pollutant removal low cost sorbents are the attractive aspects of the adsorption process the accumulation of pollutants on the sorbent surface due to the physical or chemical forces is the main mechanism of adsorption as described in the next section hap is used in the production of biomaterials and also for environmental applications such as removal of metal ions dyes and other emerging pollutants through adsorption by using hap as the adsorbent 91 4 2 heavy metal removal nanomaterials are used for several applications hap is efficient to remove various heavy metals such as arsenic cadmium cesium chromium lead and uranium etc arsenic penetrates groundwater from contaminated soils and the oral intake of this water is dangerous the toxic reference dose for arsenic is 0 0003 mg kg day 92 a long term exposure to arsenic increases the risk of cancer and skin diseases 93 the removal of arsenic can be done by various methods such as precipitation reverse osmosis coagulation ion exchange oxidation and adsorption adsorption can effectively remove arsenic in low concentrations arsenic removal by different nanoparticles and their efficiencies are mentioned in table 5 the study of adsorption of arsenic by the hap composite revealed 71 removal in 1 h the endothermic and spontaneous reaction was recorded with the maximum adsorption capacity of 12 7 mg g electrostatic interaction was a prominent mechanism in the adsorption process 95 in another study 88 arsenic removal was observed at high ph in 1 h multilayer adsorption with a high adsorption capacity of 526 mg g high was observed with

removal cadmium was adsorbed on the magnetic hap composite within 30 min with the maximum adsorption capacity of 84 8 mg g monolayer adsorption with 96 removal was observed indicating the affinity between cadmium and the magnetic hap 83 interaction time initial concentration ph and temperature affected chromium removal by the hap composite as reported in the literature 101 adsorption was well described by the langmuir isotherm and adsorption increased with an increase in temperature similar studies on chromium removal were conducted where chromium was adsorbed by the magnetic hap condensed alginate beads batch experiments were conducted for the adsorption of chromium the highest adsorption capacity was 28 4 mg g at 49 85 c which was well described by the langmuir model the electrostatic attraction was the main reason for adsorption the composite adsorbent adsorbed more chromium than the individuals 100 cobalt doped hap was used as an adsorbent to remove cesium the maximum adsorption capacity for the removal of cesium was 69 5 mg g comparative studies were done by using doped and undoped hap as adsorbents to remove cesium and strontium it was found that cesium was adsorbed more on the doped hap 102 hap nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning were used to adsorb heavy metals such as copper cadmium and lead 89 8 of lead removal was observed in 2 h with an adsorption capacity of

adsorption were studied 88 95 of metals were removed by hap 105 hence it could be concluded that the hap hap composites are efficient in removing heavy metals through adsorption 4 3 dye removal dyes are used to color the materials such that coloring is not easily altered by washing or other factors there are natural dyes that are extracted from natural sources such as flora and fauna whereas the synthetic dyes are usually obtained from petroleum products dye removal has gained interest after awareness has been created about the health hazards due to dyes 70 of the dyes are being consumed by the textile industry making them the largest consumer of dyes 106 table 6 provides the adsorption capacity of various hap adsorbents for the removal of different dyes fig 7 describes a simple mechanism of dye removal by fe3o4 core hydroxyapatite in a study iron doped hap cobalt doped hap and bare hap were used to adsorb the congo red dye the highest removal of 95 6 was obtained for the iron doped hap due to several active sites and porous structure of the adsorbent 115 it also depicts the easy removal of the used adsorbent by the application of a magnetic field hap doped with magnesium sodium alginate naalg and bare hap was used to remove acid yellow 220 hap and naalg hap showed high adsorption abilities of 169 5 mg g high and 212 8 mg g high compared to the mghap with 103 1 mg g low the ligands attached to hap had a high influence on its adsorptive capacity 107 rapid adsorption was observed within 2 min when hap was used to adsorb the methylene blue dye 14 3 mg g of dye was adsorbed at an alkaline ph of 9 and 0 1 g l dosage electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding were the main adsorption mechanisms 108 a similar study was conducted with the methylene blue dye which resulted in an adsorption capacity of 33 3 mg g at high ph on microwave irradiated hap electrostatic interaction was found to be the main adsorption mechanism 110 chitosan doped hap and bare hap were used as adsorbents for congo red removal the maximum adsorption capacity for congo red was 769 mg g for 50 weight of chitosan 112 chitosan coated magnetic hap was used to adsorb the reactive blue dye 60 9 mg g of dye was adsorbed by 0 1 g of adsorbent in 4 h electrostatic interaction was the prominent reason for the adsorption of the dye 113 polyalcohol coated hap was used to remove congo red methyl blue and methyl orange the maximum adsorption for congo red methyl blue and methyl orange was 170 7 mg g 379 1 mg g and 14 7 mg g respectively the acidic groups in the dye were affected by the adsorbent leading to adsorption the high surface area of 203 2 m2 g could also be considered as one of the reasons for the adsorption taking place 114 a polymer hap composite synthesized by radical copolymerization was used to adsorb methylene blue the maximum adsorption capacity of 25 8 mg g was obtained using langmuir isotherm physical multilayer adsorption between dye and sorbent was marked as a prominent adsorption mechanism as indicated by the isotherm models 109 therefore it is evident that the hap hap composites are efficient in the removal of dyes from wastewater 4 4 removal of emerging pollutants apart from heavy metals and dyes there are certain pollutants with highly stable structures and whose effects on wastewater are not completely known these are known as emerging pollutants cosmetics herbicides pesticides pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics and drugs are common emerging pollutants they are not treated efficiently when they are discharged into the wastewater 116 various primary and secondary conventional treatment processes are found to be less efficient in the removal of these pollutants to prevent chronic effects an efficient technique for the removal of emerging pollutants must be developed adsorption is an effective technique to remove the emerging pollutants as they are present in low concentrations in the wastewater in a study ofloxacin and triclosan which are pharmaceutical products were adsorbed by the green synthesized hap synthesized by the co precipitation method cotton was used as a green template the adsorption of triclosan was 133 3 mg g high than ofloxacin 29 15 mg g low due to a strong hydrogen bonding between ofloxacin and water hap was found to be efficient in adsorbing both pharmaceutical products 117 hap was also efficient in treating the herbicide atrazine more than 95 of atrazine was adsorbed onto hap the purpose of this study was to control the flow of atrazine along with runoff water ph and dosage were investigated during the process a removal percentage of greater than 95 at the optimum ph of 7 and a dosage of 10 mg l was obtained 118 hap biochar composite was able to remove antibiotics and heavy metal simultaneously from aqueous solutions in a study 119 the biochar from wood residues was doped with nano hap and was used to adsorb copper and tylosin sulfamethoxazole hydrogen bonding π π interactions and complex formation were the main interactions responsible for adsorption the adsorption capacity for tylosin and sulfamethoxazole was around 160 mg g and 140 mg g respectively diclofenac and fluoxetine the pharmaceutical pollutants were degraded by the hap doped titania hap obtained from codfish bones was annealed with titanium salt to produce a composite both hap and its composite were used to degrade these pollutants hap composite had a better degradation capacity of greater than 90 for both the pollutants by incomplete mineralization 120 fluoxetine was degraded to a greater extent when compared to diclofenac 5 conclusion the current article presents an outline of various methods for the synthesis of hap and its composites the green synthesis method can be an alternative method to the existing conventional synthesis methods minimizing the expense of adsorption can be achieved by reducing the cost of the adsorbent which can be achieved by opting for a synthesis method with less energy consumption less chemical usage the substitution of precursors with naturally available materials hap is an adsorbent that can be synthesized easily from the natural sources available modification of which enhances adsorption to overcome the drawbacks of hap viz difficulty in removal and stability at extreme conditions doping it with another compound is recently practiced doping can result in the presence of compounds with a higher affinity towards the adsorbate easy removal of the adsorbent as in the case of hap magnetic composite and increasing the stability of the adsorbent besides adsorption depends on the reaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate which can be explained by electrostatic interaction surface complexation ion exchange and precipitation which have been elaborated in the application of adsorption in various pollutant removal the adsorptive removal of various pollutants such as heavy metals synthetic dyes and emerging pollutants by the hap hap composite has been documented the uniqueness of the adsorption process with its mechanism and the significant factors have also been clearly explained in this review
