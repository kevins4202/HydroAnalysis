9545,plastic film mulching pm has been widely practiced for rainfed maize zea mays l in the loess plateau china however controversy remains regarding its impacts on field water balance components there is also scant quantitative information on water limited potential grain yield gyw and water productivity wpw a meta analysis and boundary line analysis were conducted using 1421 paired observations extracted from 83 peer reviewed publications to 1 assess pm induced changes in soil water storage at planting swsp evapotranspiration et and soil water storage at harvest swsh and 2 quantify gyw and wpw in pm fields pm significantly increased swsp by 4 0 on average due to an 83 2 average increase in precipitation storage during the fallow season overall et showed a significant positive response to pm 2 9 resulting in 56 4 more soil water depletion than no mulching nm fields over the growing season however swsh significantly increased by an average 1 8 after applying pm indicating that increased storage of fallow season precipitation replenished increased depletion of growing season soil water averaged across all samples pm had significant positive effects on gy 56 1 and wp 47 5 which were attributed to higher transpiration ratio of transpiration to et and harvest index from the perspective of effective crop water use based on gy and wp boundary lines gyw and wpw under nm were estimated to be 10 728 kg ha 1 and 26 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 on average respectively and the respective averages under pm were 13 702 kg ha 1 and 34 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 the gy and wp gaps i e differences between actual and potential values averaged around 3300 kg ha 1 and 7 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively in nm and pm fields in the gy versus et and wp versus et scatter plots the vertical distances between the measured data points on a specific field and the corresponding boundary line indicated field specific gaps for gy and wp this study increases our understanding of the effect

film mulching meta analysis boundary line analysis field water balance components grain yield water productivity 1 introduction the increasing global population and corresponding food consumption are placing unprecedented demands on grain yield gy fao 2020 foley et al 2011 dealing with this challenge is especially important in the context of climate change resource scarcity and environmental degradation fan et al 2012 rainfed agriculture is the predominant agricultural production system all over the world and the majority of the rural poor also reside in areas where rainfed agriculture is practiced fao 2011 as the world s most populous country 1 43 billion people in 2019 accounting for 19 of the global population china has 128 million hectares of arable land of which about 60 is rainfed huang et al 2011 however rainfed farming typically produces lower gys due to limited water resources fao 2011 kang 2019 for instance the average gy of the three main cereal crops maize zea mays l rice oryza sativa l and wheat triticum aestivum l in china is 3960 kg ha 1 under rainfed conditions 31 6 lower than under irrigated conditions yu et al 2018 therefore improving rainfed farming productivity will be significant for sustainable future food security in china with an arable area of nearly 19 million hectares the loess plateau is china s largest and most important rainfed agricultural region feeding more than 100 million people huang et al 2011 lü et al 2012 as a major grain crop of the loess plateau rainfed maize is almost entirely grown in semi arid and semi humid regions and thus its production is usually affected by available water shortages bu et al 2013 liu et al 2009 mo et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 there is high unproductive depletion of precipitation in rainfed fields with annual soil evaporation e of 270 mm accounting for 55 of annual precipitation thereby limiting the water available for maize transpiration t during the growing season fan and li 2017 an additional climatic consideration for maize production is the mismatch between water supply and demand the rainy season in the loess plateau spans from june to september whereas maize is generally planted at the end of april and harvested in september zhang et al 2014 so there can be an adverse impact on maize seedling emergence and establishment in the future water stress will likely become a more prevalent limiting factor for maize growth and development because of increased drought frequency duration and severity leng et al 2015 leng and hall 2019 yao et al 2020 numerous practices e g terrace building conservation tillage increased fertilizer rate and soil mulching using natural or artificial materials have been developed over the past several decades to efficiently use the limited precipitation in rainfed maize fields over the loess plateau li 2004 plastic film mulching pm has emerged as a widespread and effective management practice zhang et al 2014 2017 for example in gansu province pm use and area have increased nearly fivefold and sixfold respectively since 1992 reaching 0 11 million tons and 1 32 million hectares in 2018 which made a great contribution to an increase of 4 32 million tons in maize output between 1992 and 2018 https data cnki net in almost all cases pm positively affected maize gy and water productivity wp defined as the ratio of gy to growing season evapotranspiration lin and liu 2016 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 however the effects of pm on field water balance components are unclear during the maize growing season the field water balance soil depth 2 m can be simplified as follows li et al 1985 li and li 1995 zhang et al 1990 p e t s w s h s w s p where p is precipitation et is evapotranspiration sum of e and t swsh is soil water storage at harvest and swsp is soil water storage at planting it has been consistently proved that a substantial reduction in e is an important reason for gy increase induced by pm steinmetz et al 2016 in addition increased gy under pm relative to no mulching nm is commonly associated with increased t feng et al 2019 li et al 2013 liu 2015 zhou 2018 as a result there remains a large uncertainty across studies regarding the effect of pm on et with decreases no change or increases in et observed after applying pm liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 in the case of increased et pm may cause soil drying at the end of the growing season in comparison with nm for instance wang 2012 found 21 35 mm less swsh in the 0 2 m soil profile with pm than with nm and similar results were also reported by liu 2018 wu et al 2017 xie et al 2015 and zhang et al 2011 in contrast some field experiments concluded no decrease in swsh after use of pm which was attributed to water conservation during the fallow season that generated higher swsp lin et al 2016 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020c accordingly there is a basic need to diagnose the responses of field water balance components to pm for guaranteeing sustainable water use and maize production over the loess plateau meta analysis which can summarize the results of independent experiments on the same subject hedges et al 1999 provides a robust statistical method to synthetically answer the questions above quantifying water limited potential gy gyw and water productivity wpw defined as the ratio of gyw to growing season et is crucial for farmers researchers and policy makers to set realistic productivity goals for rainfed agricultural systems with limited water supplies rattalino edreira et al 2018 boundary line analysis performed by connecting the points located at the upper margin of the data cloud is a robust framework for estimating gyw and wpw french and schultz 1984a 1984b van ittersum et al 2013 recently this approach has been used for rainfed crops including wheat patrignani et al 2014 sadras and angus 2006 zhang et al 2013 maize grassini et al 2009 lin and liu 2016 zhang et al 2014 proso millet panicum miliaceum l nielsen and vigil 2017 and legume crops loss et al 1997 zhang et al 2000 despite a tight biophysical link between crop production and water consumption the parameters defining a boundary line function may change considerably due to climatic and or management differences grassini et al 2011 hence appropriate calibration of these parameters can redefine the boundary line applying to climate and or management specific crops numerous observed values have been reported for gy and wp in rainfed maize under pm in the loess plateau but they have not been analyzed using boundary line therefore the main objectives of this study were to conduct a meta analysis and boundary line analysis to 1 evaluate the effects of pm on water balance components swsp et and swsh in rainfed maize fields and 2 quantify the water limited potentials of rainfed maize gy and wp under pm in the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 data compilation we comprehensively searched the peer reviewed literature published up to the end of 2018 using web of science http apps webofknowledge com google scholar http scholar google com and the china knowledge resource integrated database http www cnki net the different combinations of search terms included maize or corn and mulch or mulching in the title abstract and keywords our searches returned more than 500 relevant published studies however only the studies meeting the following five criteria were selected 1 the experimental locations had to be within the loess plateau fig 1 2 using replicated experimental designs the studies were carried out in fields without irrigation at any time and included comparisons between nm and pm treatments 3 the studies included at least one parameter of interest i e response variables as swsp et swsh gy and wp 4 a soil depth of no less than 2 m was used in investigating field water balance and 5 if the same experimental results were reported in more than one literature citation only the source providing the most detailed description was included the raw data means x standard deviations sd and numbers of replicates n of the response variables in the selected literature was extracted from tables text or by digitizing graphs using getdata graph digitizer 2 26 software http getdata graph digitizer com sd was needed as a necessary input parameter for the meta analysis in cases where sd was not reported we calculated it as follows mei et al 2018 s d s e n where se is standard error if neither sd and se were available the average coefficient of variation acv of the response variables was first calculated using the relevant data within the database and then the missing sd was estimated as wang et al 2015a s d x a c v information on climate mean annual precipitation and temperature soil properties soil organic carbon total nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium and bulk density in the topsoil at the start of the field experiment and mulching managements pm pattern and ratio for each study was added to the database mean annual precipitation and temperature 1981 2015 for each experimental site were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn when not provided in the publications 2 2 meta analysis in this meta analysis we used the natural logarithm of the response ratio ln r to quantify the effect sizes of pm on swsp et swsh gy and wp relative to nm hedges et al 1999 ln r ln x e x c ln x e ln x c where x e and x c are the means of the response variables under pm and nm respectively the variance of ln r v was calculated as v 1 n e s d e x e 2 1 n c s d c x c 2 where n e and n c are the numbers of replicates and sd e and sd c are the standard deviations of x e and x c respectively the inverse of v was defined as the weighting factor for ln r w w 1 v the weighted average ln r was calculated as the overall effect sizes of pm on the response variables ln r ln r i w i w i where ln r i and w i are the effect size of pm and its weighting factor respectively obtained using the ith paired observations from the database the 95 confidence interval ci of ln r was calculated as 95 c i ln r 1 96 s e ln r where s e ln r is the standard error of ln r which was calculated as s e ln r 1 w i in order to explain the variations in the effects of pm on field water balance components all pm to nm comparisons for swsp et and swsh in the database were further classified into subgroups based on climate soil properties and mulching managements mean annual precipitation was grouped into 450 semi arid and 450 mm semi humid li 2004 mean annual temperature was grouped into 8 mid temperate and 8 c warm temperate zhang and liu 2007 the following classifications were made for soil properties soil organic carbon 7 7 8 5 and 8 5 g kg 1 soil total nitrogen 0 9 0 9 1 0 and 1 0 g kg 1 soil available phosphorus 12 12 20 and 20 mg kg 1 soil available potassium 125 125 165 and 165 mg kg 1 and soil bulk density 1 26 1 26 1 30 and 1 30 g cm 3 according to farmers practices in the loess plateau two pm patterns flat and ridge furrow mulching and ratios partial and full mulching were considered in this study the aforementioned calculations were implemented in metawin 2 1 software using a random effects model rosenberg et al 2000 in the categorical meta analysis the total heterogeneity of effect sizes was partitioned into within and between group heterogeneities that were both tested against a chi square distribution a significant between group heterogeneity p 0 05 implied that the mean effect sizes significantly varied with categorical factor the effect sizes above and below zero indicated increase and decrease respectively in the response variables after applying pm the mean effect sizes were considered statistically significant only when their 95 cis did not overlap zero similarly significant differences in the mean effect sizes among subgroups occurred if the 95 cis did not overlap to easily evaluate the meta analysis results the effect sizes were converted to percent change as exp ln r 1 100 due to the tendency for journals to only publish certain types of studies such as studies with statistically significant results publication bias may strongly impact the summary conclusions produced by the meta analysis luo et al 2018 rosenberg 2005 in the present study publication bias was confirmed or rejected according to the begg and mazumdar rank correlation test begg and mazumdar 1994 we also calculated rosenthal s fail safe number to assess publication bias rosenthal 1979 the meta analysis results were deemed robust and reliable if the fail safe number was above 5 n 10 where n is the sample size of the effect sizes rosenberg 2005 2 3 boundary line analysis a quantile regression cade and noon 2003 was conducted using sigmaplot 12 5 software https systatsoftware com products sigmaplot to derive boundary line functions for the relationships of gyw and wpw with et the gy data within the database were first ranked based on et and then divided into various classes using an et interval of 40 mm finally according to the methods proposed by hoogmoed et al 2018 and medinski et al 2010 we selected the 95th percentile of gy as the boundary data point in each class to regress against the average et of each class the fitted gy boundary at any level of et was also taken to be the upper limit for wp grassini et al 2009 rattalino edreira et al 2018 and thus the ratio of the gy boundary line function to et was defined as the wp boundary line function in the present study 3 results 3 1 overview of the database and analysis of publication bias after the screening procedure 83 field studies 33 and 50 published in english and chinese respectively conducted at 20 experimental sites across the loess plateau were selected table a 1 and fig 1 the database included 230 277 230 393 and 291 paired observations of swsp et swsh gy and wp respectively table 1 and 786 1143 and 783 records of climate soil properties and mulching managements respectively in some cases there was a publication bias for the mean effect sizes of pm on swsp et and swsh as indicated by the begg and mazumdar rank correlation test p 0 05 table a 2 however all results calculated by the meta analysis were considered robust and reliable because rosenthal s fail safe numbers far exceeded their respective thresholds of 5 n 10 table a 2 3 2 soil water and evapotranspiration the three field water balance components mainly investigated in this study swsp et and swsh all varied considerably across samples table 1 swsp et and swsh under nm ranged from 145 1130 173 644 and 116 1219 mm respectively with averages of 435 391 and 416 mm and under pm the respective ranges were 189 1209 204 604 and 135 1273 mm and the respective averages were 452 401 and 423 mm table 1 in the database pm negatively affected 17 38 and 39 of the total swsp et and swsh samples respectively and the maximum reductions were 11 9 in swsp 19 1 in et and 13 4 in swsh fig 2a c the remaining samples showed neutral to positive responses to pm with the maximum increases of 34 4 33 8 and 24 0 for swsp et and swsh respectively fig 2a c on average pm significantly increased swsp by 4 0 et by 2 9 and swsh by 1 8 compared with nm 95 ci 0 fig 2a c under different climate soil properties and mulching managements swsp et and swsh increased by an average of 2 3 12 1 1 4 5 1 and 0 8 8 1 respectively under pm relative to nm tables 2 4 however there were significant differences among some subgroups in the positive responses of swsp et and swsh to pm p 0 05 tables 2 4 the mean effect sizes of pm on swsp and swsh in semi arid and mid temperate regions were significantly greater than those in semi humid and warm temperate regions p 0 05 tables 2 and 4 overall in comparison with partial mulching full mulching had significantly higher mean effect sizes on swsp and et p 0 05 tables 2 and 3 3 3 grain yield water productivity and their boundary lines the minimum and maximum gys were 170 and 14 536 kg ha 1 respectively under nm and the respective values were 1120 and 17 700 kg ha 1 under pm table 1 averaged across all samples nm and pm produced gys of 7345 and 10 512 kg ha 1 respectively table 1 wp under nm and pm varied from 0 4 41 7 and 2 8 56 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively and averaged 20 2 and 27 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 table 1 in the database there were 1 and 4 of the total samples with gy reductions from 3 8 to 12 1 and wp reductions from 2 1 to 18 2 respectively after applying pm fig 2d and e in contrast 99 and 96 of the total gy and wp samples respectively were observed to positively respond to pm and the maximum increases were 1043 7 in gy and 1176 9 in wp fig 2d and e consequently pm generally exerted positive influences on gy and wp and on average gy and wp were significantly increased by 56 1 and 47 5 respectively under pm relative to nm 95 ci 0 fig 2d and e as shown in fig 3a and b the gy boundary lines demonstrate that gyw linearly increased as et increased at mean rates of 34 3 and 43 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 under nm and pm respectively however gyw plateaued at 13 212 kg ha 1 under nm and 15 848 kg ha 1 under pm when et exceeded 434 and 401 mm respectively fig 3a and b with increasing et wpw increased at first and then decreased under nm and pm fig 4a and b the maximum values of wpw were 30 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 under nm and 39 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 under pm which were achieved at et values of 434 and 401 mm respectively fig 4a and b it was observed that the gy boundary line under pm was well above that under nm over the entire et range fig 3a and b as was the case for the wp boundary line fig 4a and b indicating that pm increased both gyw and wpw mean gyw and wpw were 10 728 kg ha 1 and 26 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively under nm and the respective values rose to 13 702 kg ha 1 and 34 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 after applying pm figs 3c and 4c 4 discussion 4 1 field water balance components affected by pm during the crop growing season the field water balance is determined by 1 inputs from irrigation precipitation and capillary rise 2 outputs from surface runoff deep percolation and et and 3 change in soil water content i e difference between swsh and swsp li and li 1995 zhang et al 1990 however irrigation capillary rise surface runoff and deep percolation can be excluded when investigating the field water balance of a rainfed agricultural system in the loess plateau soil depth 2 m li et al 1985 li and li 1995 zhang et al 1990 thus the field water balance investigated in this study comprised four components precipitation et swsp and swsh growing season precipitation is an important determinant of maize production under rainfed conditions li and li 1995 nielsen et al 2010 however small precipitation events frequently occur in the loess plateau for example the sum of daily precipitation events 5 mm accounted for 13 3 of the total precipitation from 22 april to 5 september 2015 in changwu county shaanxi province lin et al 2019 such small amounts of precipitation that evaporate directly from the soil surface have essentially no effect on maize growth and development fan et al 2019 the dry environment of the loess plateau also leads to substantial non beneficial water losses by e from precipitation which has infiltrated into the soil fan and li 2017 as a result reducing e is a goal for rainfed maize production improvement in this region i e efficiently storing maximum amounts of precipitation in the soil for access by the crop root system pm especially under ridge furrow construction can not only accumulate precipitation including amounts from small precipitation events to enhance infiltration but also conserve soil water by blocking the exchange of water vapor at the soil atmosphere interface li et al 2020 ren et al 2017 while soil water at planting constitutes only 10 5 of growing season et li and li 1995 it is an indispensable part of the water supply for guaranteeing successful maize production due to limited precipitation in the early growing season zhang et al 2014 significant linear relationships between maize gy and swsp p 0 01 as shown in fig 5 also emphasize the importance of storing more soil water before planting in increasing maize production in practice mulching soil with plastic film usually occurs prior to maize planting and or these mulches are usually not removed from fields after maize harvest in the loess plateau for increased precipitation storage during the fallow season li et al 2020 lin et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b table 5 demonstrates that on average the storage of fallow season precipitation under pm 40 mm was 83 2 higher than that under nm 22 mm therefore there was a significant increase in swsp 95 ci 0 after applying pm in this study fig 2a especially in semi arid and mid temperate regions and full mulching conditions table 2 where more fallow season e decreases under pm ren et al 2021 in sum pm increases the total amount of plant available soil water during the growing season in the loess plateau et the sole consumer of soil water in rainfed maize fields was significantly increased after pm application 95 ci 0 fig 2b thus it can be inferred that increased t under pm relative to nm cannot be entirely offset by decreased e further analysis revealed that et exhibited a consistently positive response to pm under different climatic conditions soil properties and mulching managements table 3 however the magnitude of the response was significantly greater under full mulching than partial mulching p 0 05 table 3 this is because in comparison with partial mulching full mulching exerts a greater increasing effect on t which can be indicated by a greater increasing effect of full mulching on maize production ren et al 2021 wang et al 2021 increased et means more soil water used during the growing season under rainfed conditions li and li 1995 zhang et al 1990 table 6 shows that pm averaged 23 mm of growing season soil water depletion 56 4 higher than nm 15 mm but a significant increase caused by pm was observed for swsh 95 ci 0 in the present study fig 2c which was more remarkable in semi arid and mid temperate regions table 4 in rainfed maize fields with pm the increased swsh was attributed to increased swsp according to the water balance fig 6 a possible adverse impact of pm crop production enhancement after applying pm resulting in soil drying has recently aroused the concerns of some scholars liu 2018 wang 2012 wu et al 2017 xie et al 2015 based on multi site observations in the loess plateau our results indicate that pm will not cause soil drying from the perspective of total water storage in the soil profile because the higher soil water depletion over the growing season under pm than nm was replenished by higher precipitation storage over the fallow season fig 6 deeper root systems can capture deeper soil water in pm fields which may ultimately generate water reduction in the deep soil layers as found by qiao 2013 zhang 2012 and zhang et al 2011 whereas our study did not investigate this issue due to data availability limitations 4 2 pm increased grain yield and water productivity among the main rainfed maize producing countries worldwide there are generally high levels of gy and wp in relatively developed countries table a 3 the netherlands produces the highest mean gy and wp 11 756 kg ha 1 and 27 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively well above the respective values observed under nm in the loess plateau table 1 and a 3 however the mean gy and wp after applying pm in the loess plateau are basically comparable with their respective global maximums table 1 and a 3 thus pm is a successful agronomic practice for increasing maize production using limited water supplies under rainfed conditions the most fundamental process associated with crop water use is the exchange of water lost by transpiration for the assimilation of carbon dioxide steduto et al 2007 the net gain of assimilate generates biomass part of which is harvestable gy as a result maize gy can be expressed as follows stewart and peterson 2015 g y t 1 t r h i where tr is transpiration ratio water transpired per aboveground biomass and hi is harvest index ratio of gy to total aboveground biomass at harvest according to the definition of agricultural wp molden et al 2010 maize wp can be expressed by the following equation w p g y e t t e t 1 t r h i a large number of field experiments have consistently shown a significant increase in growing season t caused by pm feng et al 2019 li et al 2013 liu 2015 zhou 2018 this is largely because on the one hand pm provides more available soil water for t in fields see section 4 1 for more details on the other hand pm improves crop root growth and function gao et al 2014 li et al 2021 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a 2021 and thereby enhances the crop s ability to acquire soil water higher t and lower e induce a higher ratio of t to et under pm than nm tr behaves conservatively for a given atmospheric environment tanner and sinclair 1983 steduto et al 2007 systematically analyzed data from leaf to canopy scales and confirmed that tr of a crop species is approximately constant after normalization for atmospheric evaporative demand and carbon dioxide concentration therefore it is likely that pm has only a small impact on tr using the collected data for growing season t and aboveground biomass at harvest an indirect calculation of tr also demonstrated similar tr under pm and nm in most cases table 7 hi represents successful plant reproduction i e assimilate partitioning from vegetative to reproductive organs blum 2009 our previously published results indicated that overall rainfed maize hi was significantly increased by 12 6 95 ci 0 from 0 45 to 0 50 after pm application over the loess plateau wang et al 2020 consequently from the perspective of effective crop water use higher gy under pm relative to nm can be explained by higher t and hi and higher wp can be explained by higher t to et ratio and hi fig 6 4 3 boundary lines of grain yield and water productivity there are at least four approaches for quantifying gyw and or wpw including crop simulation models upper percentiles of actual values maximum values measured and boundary line analysis van ittersum et al 2013 a major strength of boundary line analysis is that estimates of gyw and wpw are not static or non spatially explicit values across a wide range of et rattalino edreira et al 2018 van ittersum et al 2013 our study differs from two previous studies lin and liu 2016 zhang et al 2014 regarding gy and wp boundary lines for rainfed maize of the loess plateau probably due to differences in sample sizes used and field treatments investigated using more data extracted from peer reviewed publications we carried out more targeted quantifications of the gy and wp boundaries at different levels of et under nm and pm higher gyw and wpw values occurred at each et level under pm than nm with average increases of 27 7 and 29 9 respectively in the loess plateau figs 3 and 4 closing the gy and wp gaps i e differences between actual and potential values will provide the greatest opportunities for conserving water while improving crop production in rainfed agricultural systems mateos and araus 2016 across the loess plateau the untapped gy and wp potentials of rainfed maize averaged around 3300 kg ha 1 and 7 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively under nm and pm actually there are generally large variations in the gaps of gy and wp across fields as a result of different natural conditions and management practices which suggests caution in applying generalized values rattalino edreira et al 2018 the gy and wp boundary lines under nm figs 3a and 4a or pm figs 3b and 4b can be used to quantify field specific gy and wp gaps of rainfed maize specifically the gy wp and et values measured on a specific field in the loess plateau can determine the locations in figs 3a and 4a or figs 3b and 4b and their vertical distances from the corresponding boundary line will indicate the applicable gaps of gy and wp in addition to the above uses gy and wp reduction factors can be diagnosed based on boundary line analysis fermont et al 2009 wairegi et al 2010 wang et al 2015b this is because the independent variable is assumed to be the only factor limiting the dependent variable at the boundary line and all other factors are non limiting imhoff et al 2010 lewandowski and schmidt 2006 the present study found that the optimal levels of rainfed maize et were 434 mm under nm figs 3a and 4a and 401 mm under pm figs 3b and 4b in the loess plateau in fields with nm mean et 391 mm table 1 was lower than the optimum and thus there was a reduction caused by water shortage for gy and wp in general but after applying pm mean et 401 mm table 1 was well comparable with the optimum indicating that on the whole water was no longer a factor limiting gy and wp 5 conclusions based on multi site observations collected from a variety of published studies in rainfed maize fields of the loess plateau a synthetic analysis showed that pm positively affected swsp due to increased storage of fallow season precipitation pm also increased et thereby causing more growing season soil water used whereas swsh showed a positive response to pm it can be concluded that the increased soil water depletion during the growing season after applying pm was replenished by increased precipitation storage during the fallow season higher gy and wp were achieved under pm than nm gyw and wpw also increased after use of pm which was indicated by gy and wp boundary lines under pm well above those under nm over the entire et range there is considerable potential for further increasing gy and wp in practice field specific gy and wp gaps could be quantified by assessing the vertical distances between the data points measured on a specific field gy versus et and wp versus et and the corresponding boundary line these findings are significant for farmers researchers and policy makers to diagnose sustainable water use and understand the untapped gy and wp potentials for rainfed maize under pm in the loess

quantify gyw and wpw in pm fields pm significantly increased swsp by 4 0 on average due to an 83 2 average increase in precipitation storage during the fallow season overall et showed a significant positive response to pm 2 9 resulting in 56 4 more soil water depletion than no mulching nm fields over the growing season however swsh significantly increased by an average 1 8 after applying pm indicating that increased storage of fallow season precipitation replenished increased depletion of growing season soil water averaged across all samples pm had significant positive effects on gy 56 1 and wp 47 5 which were attributed to higher transpiration ratio of transpiration to et and harvest index from the perspective of effective crop water use based on gy and wp boundary lines gyw and wpw under nm were estimated to be 10 728 kg ha 1 and 26 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 on average respectively and the respective averages under pm were 13 702 kg ha 1 and 34 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 the gy and wp gaps i e differences between actual and potential values averaged around 3300 kg ha 1 and 7 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively in nm and pm fields in the gy versus et and wp versus et scatter plots the vertical

placing unprecedented demands on grain yield gy fao 2020 foley et al 2011 dealing with this challenge is especially important in the context of climate change resource scarcity and environmental degradation fan et al 2012 rainfed agriculture is the predominant agricultural production system all over the world and the majority of the rural poor also reside in areas where rainfed agriculture is practiced fao 2011 as the world s most populous country 1 43 billion people in 2019 accounting for 19 of the global population china has 128 million hectares of arable land of which about 60 is rainfed huang et al 2011 however rainfed farming typically produces lower gys due to limited water resources fao 2011 kang 2019 for instance the average gy of the three main cereal crops maize zea mays l rice oryza sativa l and wheat triticum aestivum l in china is 3960 kg ha 1 under rainfed conditions 31 6 lower than under irrigated conditions yu et al 2018 therefore improving rainfed farming productivity will be significant for sustainable future food security in china with an arable area of nearly 19 million hectares the loess plateau is china s largest and most important rainfed agricultural region feeding more than 100 million people huang et al 2011 lü et al 2012 as a major grain crop of the loess plateau rainfed maize is almost entirely grown in semi arid and semi humid regions and thus its production is usually affected by available water shortages bu et al 2013 liu et al 2009 mo et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 there is high unproductive depletion of precipitation in rainfed fields with annual soil evaporation e of 270 mm accounting for 55 of annual precipitation thereby limiting the water available for maize transpiration t during the growing season fan and li 2017 an additional climatic consideration for maize production is the mismatch between water supply and demand the rainy season in the loess plateau spans from june to september whereas maize is generally planted at the end of april and harvested in september zhang et al 2014 so there can be an adverse impact on maize seedling emergence and establishment in the future water stress will likely become a more prevalent limiting factor for maize growth and development because of increased drought frequency duration and severity leng et al 2015 leng and hall 2019 yao et al 2020 numerous practices e g terrace building conservation tillage increased fertilizer rate and soil mulching using natural or artificial materials have been developed over the past several decades to efficiently use the limited precipitation in rainfed maize fields over the loess plateau li 2004 plastic film mulching pm has emerged as a widespread and effective management practice zhang et al 2014 2017 for example in gansu province pm use and area have increased nearly fivefold and sixfold respectively since 1992 reaching 0 11 million tons and 1 32 million hectares in 2018 which made a great contribution to an increase of 4 32 million tons in maize output between 1992 and 2018 https data cnki net in almost all cases pm positively affected maize gy and water productivity wp defined as the ratio of gy to growing season evapotranspiration lin and liu 2016 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 however the effects of pm on field water balance components are unclear during the maize growing season the field water balance soil depth 2 m can be simplified as follows li et al 1985 li and li 1995 zhang et al 1990 p e t s w s h s w s p where p is precipitation et is evapotranspiration sum of e and t swsh is soil water storage at harvest and swsp is soil water storage at planting it has been consistently proved that a substantial reduction in e is an important reason for gy increase induced by pm steinmetz et al 2016 in addition increased gy under pm relative to no mulching nm is commonly associated with increased t feng et al 2019 li et al 2013 liu 2015 zhou 2018 as a result there remains a large uncertainty across studies regarding the effect of pm on et with decreases no change or increases in et observed after applying pm liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 in the case of increased et pm may cause soil drying at the end of the growing season in comparison with nm for instance wang 2012 found 21 35 mm less swsh in the 0 2 m soil profile with pm than with nm and similar results were also reported by liu 2018 wu et al 2017 xie et al 2015 and zhang et al 2011 in contrast some field experiments concluded no decrease in swsh after use of pm which was attributed to water conservation during the fallow season that generated higher swsp lin et al 2016 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020c accordingly there is a basic need to diagnose the responses of field water balance components to pm for guaranteeing sustainable water use and maize production over the loess plateau meta analysis which can summarize the results of independent experiments on the same subject hedges et al 1999 provides a robust statistical method to synthetically answer the questions above quantifying water limited potential gy gyw and water productivity wpw defined as the ratio of gyw to growing season et is crucial for farmers researchers and policy makers to set realistic productivity goals for rainfed agricultural systems with limited water supplies rattalino edreira et al 2018 boundary line analysis performed by connecting the points located at the upper margin of the data cloud is a robust framework for estimating gyw and wpw french and schultz 1984a 1984b van ittersum et al 2013 recently this approach has been used for rainfed crops including wheat patrignani et al 2014 sadras and angus 2006 zhang et al 2013 maize grassini et al 2009 lin and liu 2016 zhang et al 2014 proso millet panicum miliaceum l nielsen and vigil 2017 and legume crops loss et al 1997 zhang et al 2000 despite a tight biophysical link between crop production and water consumption the parameters defining a boundary line function may change considerably due to climatic and or management differences grassini et al 2011 hence appropriate calibration of these parameters can redefine the boundary line applying to climate and or management specific crops numerous observed values have been reported for gy and wp in rainfed maize under pm in the loess plateau but they have not been analyzed using boundary line therefore the main objectives of this study were to conduct a meta analysis and boundary line analysis to 1 evaluate the effects of pm on water balance components swsp et and swsh in rainfed maize fields and 2 quantify the water limited potentials of rainfed maize gy and wp under pm in the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 data compilation we comprehensively searched the peer reviewed literature published up to the end of 2018 using web of science http apps webofknowledge com google scholar http scholar google com and the china knowledge resource integrated database http www cnki net the different combinations of search terms included maize or corn and mulch or mulching in the title abstract and keywords our searches returned more than 500 relevant published studies however only the studies meeting the following five criteria were selected 1 the experimental locations had to be within the loess plateau fig 1 2 using replicated experimental designs the studies were carried out in fields without irrigation at any time and included comparisons between nm and pm treatments 3 the studies included at least one parameter of interest i e response variables as swsp et swsh gy and wp 4 a soil depth of no less than 2 m was used in investigating field water balance and 5 if the same experimental results were reported in more than one literature citation only the source providing the most detailed description was included the raw data means x standard deviations sd and numbers of replicates n of the response variables in the selected literature was extracted from tables text or by digitizing graphs using getdata graph digitizer 2 26 software http getdata graph digitizer com sd was needed as a necessary input parameter for the meta analysis in cases where sd was not reported we calculated it as follows mei et al 2018 s d s e n where se is standard error if neither sd and se were available the average coefficient of variation acv of the response variables was first calculated using the relevant data within the database and then the missing sd was estimated as wang et al 2015a s d x a c v information on climate mean annual precipitation and temperature soil properties soil organic carbon total nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium and bulk density in the topsoil at the start of the field experiment and mulching managements pm pattern and ratio for each study was added to the database mean annual precipitation and temperature 1981 2015 for each experimental site were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn when not provided in the publications 2 2 meta analysis in this meta analysis we used the natural logarithm of the response ratio ln r to quantify the effect sizes of pm on swsp et swsh gy and wp relative to nm hedges et al 1999 ln r ln x e x c ln x e ln x c where x e and x c are the means of the response variables under pm and nm respectively the variance of ln r v was calculated as v 1 n e s d e x e 2 1 n c s d c x c 2 where n e and n c are the numbers of replicates and sd e and sd c are the standard deviations of x e and x c respectively the inverse of v was defined as the weighting factor for ln r w w 1 v the weighted average ln r was calculated as the overall effect sizes of pm on the response variables ln r ln r i w i w i where ln r i and w i are the effect size of pm and its weighting factor respectively obtained using the ith paired observations from the database the 95 confidence interval ci of ln r was calculated as 95 c i ln r 1 96 s e ln r where s e ln r is the standard error of ln r which was calculated as s e ln r 1 w i in order to explain the variations in the effects of pm on field water balance components all pm to nm comparisons for swsp et and swsh in the database were further classified into subgroups based on climate soil properties and mulching managements mean annual precipitation was grouped into 450 semi arid and 450 mm semi humid li 2004 mean annual temperature was grouped into 8 mid temperate and 8 c warm temperate zhang and liu 2007 the following classifications were made for soil properties soil organic carbon 7 7 8 5 and 8 5 g kg 1 soil total nitrogen 0 9 0 9 1 0 and 1 0 g kg 1 soil available phosphorus 12 12 20 and 20 mg kg 1 soil available potassium 125 125 165 and 165 mg kg 1 and soil bulk density 1 26 1 26 1 30 and 1 30 g cm 3 according to farmers practices in the loess plateau two pm patterns flat and ridge furrow mulching and ratios partial and full mulching were considered in this study the aforementioned calculations were implemented in metawin 2 1 software using a random effects model rosenberg et al 2000 in the categorical meta analysis the total heterogeneity of effect sizes was partitioned into within and between group heterogeneities that were both tested against a chi square distribution a significant between group heterogeneity p 0 05 implied that the mean effect sizes significantly varied with categorical factor the effect sizes above and below zero indicated increase and decrease respectively in the response variables after applying pm the mean effect sizes were considered statistically significant only when their 95 cis did not overlap zero similarly significant differences in the mean effect sizes among subgroups occurred if the 95 cis did not overlap to easily evaluate the meta analysis results the effect sizes were converted to percent change as exp ln r 1 100 due to the tendency for journals to only publish certain types of studies such as studies with statistically significant results publication bias may strongly impact the summary conclusions produced by the meta analysis luo et al 2018 rosenberg 2005 in the present study publication bias was confirmed or rejected according to the begg and mazumdar rank correlation test begg and mazumdar 1994 we also calculated rosenthal s fail safe number to assess publication bias rosenthal 1979 the meta analysis results were deemed robust and reliable if the fail safe number was above 5 n 10 where n is the sample size of the effect sizes rosenberg 2005 2 3 boundary line analysis a quantile regression cade and noon 2003 was conducted using sigmaplot 12 5 software https systatsoftware com products sigmaplot to derive boundary line functions for the relationships of gyw and wpw with et the gy data within the database were first ranked based on et and then divided into various classes using an et interval of 40 mm finally according to the methods proposed by hoogmoed et al 2018 and medinski et al 2010 we selected the 95th percentile of gy as the boundary data point in each class to regress against the average et of each class the fitted gy boundary at any level of et was also taken to be the upper limit for wp grassini et al 2009 rattalino edreira et al 2018 and thus the ratio of the gy boundary line function to et was defined as the wp boundary line function in the present study 3 results 3 1 overview of the database and analysis of publication bias after the screening procedure 83 field studies 33 and 50 published in english and chinese respectively conducted at 20 experimental sites across the loess plateau were selected table a 1 and fig 1 the database included 230 277 230 393 and 291 paired observations of swsp et swsh gy and wp respectively table 1 and 786 1143 and 783 records of climate soil properties and mulching managements respectively in some cases there was a publication bias for the mean effect sizes of pm on swsp et and swsh as indicated by the begg and mazumdar rank correlation test p 0 05 table a 2 however all results calculated by the meta analysis were considered robust and reliable because rosenthal s fail safe numbers far exceeded their respective thresholds of 5 n 10 table a 2 3 2 soil water and evapotranspiration the three field water balance components mainly investigated in this study swsp et and swsh all varied considerably across samples table 1 swsp et and swsh under nm ranged from 145 1130 173 644 and 116 1219 mm respectively with averages of 435 391 and 416 mm and under pm the respective ranges were 189 1209 204 604 and 135 1273 mm and the respective averages were 452 401 and 423 mm table 1 in the database pm negatively affected 17 38 and 39 of the total swsp et and swsh samples respectively and the maximum reductions were 11 9 in swsp 19 1 in et and 13 4 in swsh fig 2a c the remaining samples showed neutral to positive responses to pm with the maximum increases of 34 4 33 8 and 24 0 for swsp et and swsh respectively fig 2a c on average pm significantly increased swsp by 4 0 et by 2 9 and swsh by 1 8 compared with nm 95 ci 0 fig 2a c under different climate soil properties and mulching managements swsp et and swsh increased by an average of 2 3 12 1 1 4 5 1 and 0 8 8 1 respectively under pm relative to nm tables 2 4 however there were significant differences among some subgroups in the positive responses of swsp et and swsh to pm p 0 05 tables 2 4 the mean effect sizes of pm on swsp and swsh in semi arid and mid temperate regions were significantly greater than those in semi humid and warm temperate regions p 0 05 tables 2 and 4 overall in comparison with partial mulching full mulching had significantly higher mean effect sizes on swsp and et p 0 05 tables 2 and 3 3 3 grain yield water productivity and their boundary lines the minimum and maximum gys were 170 and 14 536 kg ha 1 respectively under nm and the respective values were 1120 and 17 700 kg ha 1 under pm table 1 averaged across all samples nm and pm produced gys of 7345 and 10 512 kg ha 1 respectively table 1 wp under nm and pm varied from 0 4 41 7 and 2 8 56 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively and averaged 20 2 and 27 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 table 1 in the database there were 1 and 4 of the total samples with gy reductions from 3 8 to 12 1 and wp reductions from 2 1 to 18 2 respectively after applying pm fig 2d and e in contrast 99 and 96 of the total gy and wp samples respectively were observed to positively respond to pm and the maximum increases were 1043 7 in gy and 1176 9 in wp fig 2d and e consequently pm generally exerted positive influences on gy and wp and on average gy and wp were significantly increased by 56 1 and 47 5 respectively under pm relative to nm 95 ci 0 fig 2d and e as shown in fig 3a and b the gy boundary lines demonstrate that gyw linearly increased as et increased at mean rates of 34 3 and 43 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 under nm and pm respectively however gyw plateaued at 13 212 kg ha 1 under nm and 15 848 kg ha 1 under pm when et exceeded 434 and 401 mm respectively fig 3a and b with increasing et wpw increased at first and then decreased under nm and pm fig 4a and b the maximum values of wpw were 30 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 under nm and 39 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 under pm which were achieved at et values of 434 and 401 mm respectively fig 4a and b it was observed that the gy boundary line under pm was well above that under nm over the entire et range fig 3a and b as was the case for the wp boundary line fig 4a and b indicating that pm increased both gyw and wpw mean gyw and wpw were 10 728 kg ha 1 and 26 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively under nm and the respective values rose to 13 702 kg ha 1 and 34 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 after applying pm figs 3c and 4c 4 discussion 4 1 field water balance components affected by pm during the crop growing season the field water balance is determined by 1 inputs from irrigation precipitation and capillary rise 2 outputs from surface runoff deep percolation and et and 3 change in soil water content i e difference between swsh and swsp li and li 1995 zhang et al 1990 however irrigation capillary rise surface runoff and deep percolation can be excluded when investigating the field water balance of a rainfed agricultural system in the loess plateau soil depth 2 m li et al 1985 li and li 1995 zhang et al 1990 thus the field water balance investigated in this study comprised four components precipitation et swsp and swsh growing season precipitation is an important determinant of maize production under rainfed conditions li and li 1995 nielsen et al 2010 however small precipitation events frequently occur in the loess plateau for example the sum of daily precipitation events 5 mm accounted for 13 3 of the total precipitation from 22 april to 5 september 2015 in changwu county shaanxi province lin et al 2019 such small amounts of precipitation that evaporate directly from the soil surface have essentially no effect on maize growth and development fan et al 2019 the dry environment of the loess plateau also leads to substantial non beneficial water losses by e from precipitation which has infiltrated into the soil fan and li 2017 as a result reducing e is a goal for rainfed maize production improvement in this region i e efficiently storing maximum amounts of precipitation in the soil for access by the crop root system pm especially under ridge furrow construction can not only accumulate precipitation including amounts from small precipitation events to enhance infiltration but also conserve soil water by blocking the exchange of water vapor at the soil atmosphere interface li et al 2020 ren et al 2017 while soil water at planting constitutes only 10 5 of growing season et li and li 1995 it is an indispensable part of the water supply for guaranteeing successful maize production due to limited precipitation in the early growing season zhang et al 2014 significant linear relationships between maize gy and swsp p 0 01 as shown in fig 5 also emphasize the importance of storing more soil water before planting in increasing maize production in practice mulching soil with plastic film usually occurs prior to maize planting and or these mulches are usually not removed from fields after maize harvest in the loess plateau for increased precipitation storage during the fallow season li et al 2020 lin et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b table 5 demonstrates that on average the storage of fallow season precipitation under pm 40 mm was 83 2 higher than that under nm 22 mm therefore there was a significant increase in swsp 95 ci 0 after applying pm in this study fig 2a especially in semi arid and mid temperate regions and full mulching conditions table 2 where more fallow season e decreases under pm ren et al 2021 in sum pm increases the total amount of plant available soil water during the growing season in the loess plateau et the sole consumer of soil water in rainfed maize fields was significantly increased after pm application 95 ci 0 fig 2b thus it can be inferred that increased t under pm relative to nm cannot be entirely offset by decreased e further analysis revealed that et exhibited a consistently positive response to pm under different climatic conditions soil properties and mulching managements table 3 however the magnitude of the response was significantly greater under full mulching than partial mulching p 0 05 table 3 this is because in comparison with partial mulching full mulching exerts a greater increasing effect on t which can be indicated by a greater increasing effect of full mulching on maize production ren et al 2021 wang et al 2021 increased et means more soil water used during the growing season under rainfed conditions li and li 1995 zhang et al 1990 table 6 shows that pm averaged 23 mm of growing season soil water depletion 56 4 higher than nm 15 mm but a significant increase caused by pm was observed for swsh 95 ci 0 in the present study fig 2c which was more remarkable in semi arid and mid temperate regions table 4 in rainfed maize fields with pm the increased swsh was attributed to increased swsp according to the water balance fig 6 a possible adverse impact of pm crop production enhancement after applying pm resulting in soil drying has recently aroused the concerns of some scholars liu 2018 wang 2012 wu et al 2017 xie et al 2015 based on multi site observations in the loess plateau our results indicate that pm will not cause soil drying from the perspective of total water storage in the soil profile because the higher soil water depletion over the growing season under pm than nm was replenished by higher precipitation storage over the fallow season fig 6 deeper root systems can capture deeper soil water in pm fields which may ultimately generate water reduction in the deep soil layers as found by qiao 2013 zhang 2012 and zhang et al 2011 whereas our study did not investigate this issue due to data availability limitations 4 2 pm increased grain yield and water productivity among the main rainfed maize producing countries worldwide there are generally high levels of gy and wp in relatively developed countries table a 3 the netherlands produces the highest mean gy and wp 11 756 kg ha 1 and 27 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively well above the respective values observed under nm in the loess plateau table 1 and a 3 however the mean gy and wp after applying pm in the loess plateau are basically comparable with their respective global maximums table 1 and a 3 thus pm is a successful agronomic practice for increasing maize production using limited water supplies under rainfed conditions the most fundamental process associated with crop water use is the exchange of water lost by transpiration for the assimilation of carbon dioxide steduto et al 2007 the net gain of assimilate generates biomass part of which is harvestable gy as a result maize gy can be expressed as follows stewart and peterson 2015 g y t 1 t r h i where tr is transpiration ratio water transpired per aboveground biomass and hi is harvest index ratio of gy to total aboveground biomass at harvest according to the definition of agricultural wp molden et al 2010 maize wp can be expressed by the following equation w p g y e t t e t 1 t r h i a large number of field experiments have consistently shown a significant increase in growing season t caused by pm feng et al 2019 li et al 2013 liu 2015 zhou 2018 this is largely because on the one hand pm provides more available soil water for t in fields see section 4 1 for more details on the other hand pm improves crop root growth and function gao et al 2014 li et al 2021 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a 2021 and thereby enhances the crop s ability to acquire soil water higher t and lower e induce a higher ratio of t to et under pm than nm tr behaves conservatively for a given atmospheric environment tanner and sinclair 1983 steduto et al 2007 systematically analyzed data from leaf to canopy scales and confirmed that tr of a crop species is approximately constant after normalization for atmospheric evaporative demand and carbon dioxide concentration therefore it is likely that pm has only a small impact on tr using the collected data for growing season t and aboveground biomass at harvest an indirect calculation of tr also demonstrated similar tr under pm and nm in most cases table 7 hi represents successful plant reproduction i e assimilate partitioning from vegetative to reproductive organs blum 2009 our previously published results indicated that overall rainfed maize hi was significantly increased by 12 6 95 ci 0 from 0 45 to 0 50 after pm application over the loess plateau wang et al 2020 consequently from the perspective of effective crop water use higher gy under pm relative to nm can be explained by higher t and hi and higher wp can be explained by higher t to et ratio and hi fig 6 4 3 boundary lines of grain yield and water productivity there are at least four approaches for quantifying gyw and or wpw including crop simulation models upper percentiles of actual values maximum values measured and boundary line analysis van ittersum et al 2013 a major strength of boundary line analysis is that estimates of gyw and wpw are not static or non spatially explicit values across a wide range of et rattalino edreira et al 2018 van ittersum et al 2013 our study differs from two previous studies lin and liu 2016 zhang et al 2014 regarding gy and wp boundary lines for rainfed maize of the loess plateau probably due to differences in sample sizes used and field treatments investigated using more data extracted from peer reviewed publications we carried out more targeted quantifications of the gy and wp boundaries at different levels of et under nm and pm higher gyw and wpw values occurred at each et level under pm than nm with average increases of 27 7 and 29 9 respectively in the loess plateau figs 3 and 4 closing the gy and wp gaps i e differences between actual and potential values will provide the greatest opportunities for conserving water while improving crop production in rainfed agricultural systems mateos and araus 2016 across the loess plateau the untapped gy and wp potentials of rainfed maize averaged around 3300 kg ha 1 and 7 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively under nm and pm actually there are generally large variations in the gaps of gy and wp across fields as a result of different natural conditions and management practices which suggests caution in applying generalized values rattalino edreira et al 2018 the gy and wp boundary lines under nm figs 3a and 4a or pm figs 3b and 4b can be used to quantify field specific gy and wp gaps of rainfed maize specifically the gy wp and et values measured on a specific field in the loess plateau can determine the locations in figs 3a and 4a or figs 3b and 4b and their vertical distances from the corresponding boundary line will indicate the applicable gaps of gy and wp in addition to the above uses gy and wp reduction factors can be diagnosed based on boundary line analysis fermont et al 2009 wairegi et al 2010 wang et al 2015b this is because the independent variable is assumed to be the only factor limiting the dependent variable at the boundary line and all other factors are non limiting imhoff et al 2010 lewandowski and schmidt 2006 the present study found that the optimal levels of rainfed maize et were 434 mm under nm figs 3a and 4a and 401 mm under pm figs 3b and 4b in the loess plateau in fields with nm mean et 391 mm table 1 was lower than the optimum and thus there was a reduction caused by water shortage for gy and wp in general but after applying pm mean et 401 mm table 1 was well comparable with the optimum indicating that on the whole water was no longer a factor limiting gy and wp 5 conclusions based on multi site observations collected from a variety of published studies in rainfed maize fields of the loess plateau a synthetic analysis showed that pm positively affected swsp due to increased storage of fallow season precipitation pm also increased et thereby causing more growing season soil water used whereas swsh showed a positive response to pm it can be concluded that the increased soil water depletion during the growing season after applying pm was replenished by increased precipitation storage during the fallow season higher gy and wp were achieved under pm than nm gyw and wpw also increased after use of pm which was indicated by gy and wp boundary lines under pm well above those under nm over the entire et range there is considerable potential for further increasing gy and wp in practice field specific gy and wp gaps could be quantified by assessing the vertical distances between the data points measured on a specific field gy versus et and wp versus et and the corresponding boundary line these findings are significant for farmers researchers and policy makers to diagnose sustainable water use and understand the untapped gy and wp potentials for rainfed maize under pm in the loess

9546,improving our knowledge on the relative contribution of irrigation water precipitation and groundwater to tree transpiration is necessary for an efficient and sustainable use of water resources in agriculture for this purpose we applied deuterium 2h enriched water to trace the uptake of irrigation water by apple trees under field and pot conditions 2h enriched water was supplied to apple trees in an alpine valley mimicking sprinkler irrigation labeled water infiltration in the soil and presence in apple tree shoots was measured over a week an ancillary experiment using potted trees was performed to elucidate the role of irrigation water after soil saturation with 2h enriched water under field conditions 2h enriched water infiltrated to a maximum depth of 0 6 m where most of the fine roots were present and mixed with pre irrigation soil water sprinkler irrigation water was taken up by apple trees 2 4 h after its supply and its contribution to the shoot water content increased in the first 24 h then it leveled off tree water absorbed from the enriched soil layer represented on average 48 3 and 26 2 of the total water in shoot axes and leaves respectively the results of the pot experiment confirmed the contribution of irrigation water to shoot water and allowed us to speculate that under field conditions groundwater ca 0 9 m deep with capillary rise expected up to 0 6 m depth did not significantly contribute to tree water uptake results indicate that a large fraction of shoot water 52 74 did not derive from recent soil water uptake suggesting a rather limited water mixing within tree organs keywords irrigation water soil water root water uptake isotope analysis deuterium tracing 1 introduction improving water management strategies in agriculture is pivotal to face future scenarios characterized by an increased extension of irrigated crops and a concurrent decrease in freshwater availability chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 in this context a better understanding of the dynamics of water uptake by crops and water use from multiple water pools e g precipitation irrigation groundwater to satisfy crop water requirements is highly necessary despite the extensive literature on crop irrigation the actual contribution of irrigation water to plant transpiration is still uncertain similarly the quantitative contribution of the different water sources to the overall water uptake by trees is unclear studies investigating these aspects have to face the complexity of soil water processes subjected to temporal and spatial variability jackisch et al 2020 li et al 2014 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the water molecule represent a reliable tracer of water source and its movements providing information about water fluxes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac penna et al 2020 sprenger et al 2016 in the last decades many authors studied the water uptake dynamics comparing the isotopic composition of plant water and that of the main local water sources mostly through the application of mixing models rothfuss and javaux 2017 several isotope based studies analyzed root water uptake and the proportional contribution of different water sources and or irrigation practices in relation to plant species growth stage and the depth of their root system cao et al 2018 liu et al 2020 mahindawansha et al 2018 wu et al 2018 however the outcomes of these studies are affected by several factors including the sampling representativeness of all the available water sources the necessity for a sufficiently appreciable difference in the isotopic composition of each water source in addition to methodological constraints berry et al 2018 beyer and penna 2021 orlowski et al 2016a moreover this approach is valid assuming that no isotope fractionation occurs during root uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 this assumption was questioned by several authors who measured an appreciable isotope fractionation in several tree species in relation to water movements at the soil root interface and within plants ellsworth and williams 2007 poca et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 recently water isotope heterogeneity both in the soil pores and tree stems was found to contribute to soil stem isotope offsets which might cause an incorrect interpretation of isotope data barbeta et al 2019 2020 2022 it is therefore evident that the above mentioned factors may hinder the identification of tree water sources when different water pools exist especially under natural environmental conditions beyer and penna 2021 the use of deuterium 2h enriched water makes possible to artificially modify the isotopic composition of a water reservoir and trace its uptake by plants without altering the water chemical and physical properties becker and coplen 2001 being part of the water molecule 2h is a conservative tracer and due to its low natural abundance ca 0 015 small additions of heavy water 2h2o in a confined environment can be successfully monitored after equilibration with local water becker and coplen 2001 adding an excess of 2h overcomes also the problem of potential isotope fractionation from the water source to the tree organs as the fractionation would result rather negligible compared to the measurable artificial enrichment beyer et al 2016 rowland et al 2008 in the past years the application of 2h enriched water in isotope based studies has encompassed several aspects related to ecohydrological studies including among the others soil water accessed by plants e g bogie et al 2018 beyer et al 2018 rasmussen et al 2020

et al 2007 koeniger et al 2010 grünberger et al 2011 nonetheless most of these studies were conducted in forest ecosystems with only a few applications regarding agricultural systems to the best of our knowledge none of the previous studies provided an in depth analysis of the role of irrigation water compared to other water pools in relation to plant water needs and hence the quantification and comprehension of irrigation water uptake dynamics remain weak the present study is a follow up of a previous research aimed at identifying the prevailing water sources for apple trees in an alpine valley of south tyrol in northern italy applying a stable isotope approach penna et al 2021 in this area intensive apple cultivation is widespread and to guarantee high fruit yield and quality irrigation water is frequently applied for most of the growing season to optimize irrigation water use it is necessary to evaluate its contribution to tree water in comparison with other locally available water sources such as rainwater and groundwater the latter if shallow enough might positively contribute to soil water recharge in the root zone through capillary rising processes grashey jansen 2010 to better understand the role of irrigation water in apple orchards and its contribution to tree water requirements in the summer period we designed two experiments using 2h enriched irrigation water the two labeling experiments addressed the following research questions 1 what is the fate of the irrigation water in the soil 2 to what extent do irrigation water and groundwater contribute to the overall tree water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment 1 field grown apple trees 2 1 1 site description experiment 1 was carried out in july 2019 in an apple orchard malus domestica cv pinova on m9 rootstock located in the municipality of laas lasa german and italian name respectively in the vinschgau venosta valley south tyrol italy and close to the adige river channel elevation 868 m a s l size 5000 m2 the apple orchard was planted in 2005 and was in full production in 2019 ca 70 ton ha 1 with a north south row orientation perpendicular to the direction of the river flow the tree spacing within single rows is 0 8 m while consecutive rows are 3 m apart in summer an overhead sprinkler system normally provides 20 mm of water once or twice a week depending on the rainfall events which are normally rather infrequent in summer in this area the long term precipitation record is 480 mm year 1 according to the usda classification the soil has a silt loam texture until 0 8 m depth with 26 7 sand and 10 8 clay on average table 1 a recent investigation on apple root distribution in the same field revealed that around 50 and around 90 of the fine roots are present in the 0 0 2 m and 0 0 6 m soil layers respectively penna et al 2021 meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity precipitations wind speed and net radiation were recorded by a weather station located at one edge of the orchard and are summarized in supplementary table s1 starting from meteorological data the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated at hourly time steps applying the fao modified version of the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2006 2 1 2 experimental design four consecutive tree rows were selected and in the middle of each row a block of three trees was chosen hereafter called experimental unit the selected trees were similar in tree height ca 3 5 m and crown volume ca 3 0 3 5 m3 the four experimental units had approximately the same distance from the river ca 80 m and we assumed that the depth to groundwater table was the same for all the trees each experimental unit included a control tree not irrigated tree and a tree to be irrigated with 2h enriched water separated by a buffer tree fig 1 a 1 3 m long piezometer not equipped with a level logger was installed outside one of the experimental units to daily measure the depth of the groundwater table using a meter stick to create a moderate level of soil water deficit before the addition of 2h enriched water infiltration of irrigation and rainwater was prevented covering the soil of the four experimental units with an impermeable plastic sheet length ca 3 m width per row side ca 0 8 m from july 11 until july 23 the last irrigation cycle before covering the soil occurred on july 5 and the last rainfall on july 6 3 mm on july 23 at 9 am cet 2h enriched water was poured into the soil of the irrigated plots before starting the irrigation the plastic sheets were removed and the plots to be irrigated 1 m2 were delimitated by plastic supports 0 1 m high partially driven into the soil to prevent water from spreading outside of the 1 m2 plot 2h enriched water was prepared in 20 l cans diluting 5 ml of 2h2o 99 9 into 20 l of local water δ 2h 98 8 taken from an irrigation pipe close to the orchard to reach a final δ 2h value of 1544 29 each tree received 40 l of water on a surface of 1 m2 40 mm in 15 min irrigation water was evenly distributed using rain shower watering cans at a slow application rate to minimize runoff no irrigation was provided to the control trees for the whole experimental period after adding the labeled water the plastic sheets were placed back on top of the soil and kept until the end of the experiment july 30 to prevent irrigation water and rainwater from entering the soil of the experimental plots a rain collector was placed at one edge of the apple orchard outside of the tree rows to collect rainwater from precipitations fallen during the experimental period 2 1 3 field sampling experiment 1 lasted one week after the application of the 2h enriched water during this period water tree and soil samples were collected periodically supplementary table s2 soil samples were collected 2 h after the irrigation and then at 24 h 48 h and 7 days 168 h in the four irrigated and control plots using a single gauge auger length 1 m diameter 2 5 cm positioned each time at 0 4 m from the tree trunk towards one of the corners of the squared experimental plot to a depth of 0 8 m the soil core was then divided into 8 layers each 0 1 m long and a soil aliquot was sampled from each layer shoot samples were collected at 2 4 8 24 48 72 and 168 h after irrigation from the irrigated plots both from the east and the west side of the canopy one shoot per side length of 10 15 cm with ca 8 leaves at 1 5 m and 2 5 m from the ground shoots sampled at 1 5 m height hereafter referred to as bottom samples were kept separate from those collected at 2 5 m hereafter top samples two fully expanded apical leaves with petioles were immediately removed from the shoot axes and both leaves and shoot axes were then transferred into separated vials based on average values for the leaf area index of apple trees cultivated in this area ca 2 5 and the actual tree density we estimated that the destructive shoot sampling reduced the leaf area by 5 hence we assumed that such a difference did not significantly affect tree transpiration control trees were sampled following the same procedure used for irrigated trees at the beginning and the end of the experiment 2 and 168 h starting from 24 h after irrigation tree sampling was always performed around 1 2 pm both before and after the experimental period a groundwater sample was collected from the piezometer at the end of the experiment rainwater collected between july 26 and 28 was sampled from the rain collector all the collected samples were directly transferred into airtight glass vials with a screw cap and rubber septum sealed and stored at 4 c until processing the water content of leaves and shoot axes sampled at the end of the experiment 168 h from both irrigated and control trees was determined gravimetrically through the loss on drying method 65 c 48 h and expressed on a wet weight basis the same procedure was applied to determine the moisture content of soil samples 105 c until constant weight expressed on a dry weight basis gravimetric water content liu et al 2020 orlowski et al 2016a 2 1 4 estimation of the water flux from the groundwater table using the soil moisture values measured in the irrigated plots at different depths and adapting eq 1 to a silt loam soil as indicated by villalobos et al 2016 the matric soil water potential at each soil depth was estimated as follows 1 ψ m ψ e θ v θ sat b where ψe is the air entry water potential which is 2 1 j kg 1 for silty loam soils villalobos et al 2016 b an empirical parameter which was set equal to 4 7 villalobos et al 2016 θv and θsat the volumetric and saturation water content respectively vertical water fluxes jw kg m 2 s 1 and converted to mm day 1 from the groundwater table to the unsaturated soil layers from 0 8 m depth to the topsoil layer were estimated based on the following equation villalobos et al 2016 2 j w k ψ m d ψ m dz g where k ψm represents the hydraulic conductivity as a function of matric potential ψm kpa which is 0 00019 kg s m 3 for silty loam soils villalobos et al 2016 z m is the vertical distance among two soil depths g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration 2 2 experiment 2 potted apple trees 2 2 1 experimental design four apple trees cv golden delicious rootstock m9 3 years old in 8 l pots filled with an organic substrate were transferred at the beginning of june 2020 in an area covered with a transparent shelter to protect them from precipitation during the preliminary phase of the experiment two weeks trees were regularly irrigated with local tap water δ 2h 80 8 0 4 the experiment started on june 23 2020 at 10 pm with the addition of 2h enriched water the enriched solution was prepared in a single tank just before the experiment δ 2h 1550 18 after a thorough homogenization 1 5 l of labeled water were applied to the pots using a rain shower watering cans after the irrigation the soil in each pot was covered with a plastic film to avoid evaporation from the soil surface pots were lifted from the ground using a metal ring and percolating water was collected in pot dishes the following day june 24 was sunny 11 h of sunshine with maximum temperatures above 30 c and ca 50 relative humidity 2 2 2 potted tree sampling before pot irrigation a soil sample was collected from each pot percolated water on average 0 5 0 1 l was taken from each pot dish at the end of percolation ca 30 min after irrigation tree samplings were scheduled before the irrigation 0 h and 6 10 14 18 and 30 h after the water supply at each sampling a single shoot min 20 cm length per plant was chosen and two fully expanded apical leaves and the shoot axis without bark differently from experiment 1 were collected at the end of the experiment soil cores were collected from each pot to obtain a representative subsample all the samples were directly transferred into airtight glass vials with a screw cap and rubber septum sealed and stored frozen until processing before each sampling the pot weight was recorded to estimate tree transpiration the water content of leaf shoot axis and soil samples was determined gravimetrically as previously described for experiment 1 section 2 1 3 2 3 cryogenic vacuum distillation cryogenic vacuum distillation cvd was applied to recover water from soil and tree samples collected during experiment 1 and 2 following the method described by koeniger et al 2011 and reported by beyer et al 2018 and millar et al 2018 with slight modifications the vials containing the frozen samples were connected to empty vials then vacuum sealed through stainless steel needles the filled vials were then placed in a thermoblock heated through a hot plate 200 c 15 min while the empty vials were immersed in liquid nitrogen the distilled water was transferred into 2 ml vials and stored in the refrigerator until analysis extraction efficiency was estimated comparing the sample weight after cvd and subsequent oven drying 105 c 24 h overall the extraction efficiency was 99 in agreement with other studies millar et al 2018 tsuruta et al 2019 wu et al 2019 such an extraction efficiency is high enough to prevent artifacts due to water isotope fractionation araguás araguás et al 1995 2 4 laboratory isotope analysis the isotopic composition δ 2h of water samples 2h enriched water irrigation water rainwater groundwater and water extracts from soil samples was measured through cavity ring down spectroscopy crds l2130 i picarro inc the instrument is equipped with a vaporizer unit for liquid water injection vaporization module a0211 picarro inc and an autosampler a0325 picarro inc injection volume was set at 1 8 µl sucked through a 10 µl syringe ten injections were performed for the in house water standards calibrated against vsmow and slap certified reference materials and seven for the water samples not subject to 2h enrichment in analytical sequences including samples for which an artificial 2h enrichment was expected the number of injections was increased to 15 and 12 for standards and samples respectively standards were measured repeatedly at the beginning at the end and after blocks of 8 10 samples to deal with memory effect sample to sample memory the first three for the water samples not subject to 2h enrichment or five for the 2h enriched samples measurements per sample were removed before averaging the ratios gröning 2018 penna et al 2012 results were processed using the picarro s chemcorrect post processing software package to identify samples affected by spectral interference of organic compounds heavy contamination was detected in less than 3 of the soil extracts the isotopic ratios of these samples were excluded from the data analysis the δ 2h of plant water extracts shoot axis and leaf samples in addition to all the samples from experiment 2 was determined with a gas bench ii thermo scientific coupled to a continuous flow isotopic ratio mass spectrometer cf irms delta v advantage conflo iv thermo scientific due to the high organic content that would have interfered with the crds analysis the methodology with the gas bench ii foresees that 0 2 ml of sample is added to a vial and subsequently the headspace flushed with an equilibration gas 2 h2 in helium a platinum stick was added to the vials as the catalyst for the equilibration phase after the required equilibration time 40 min the headspace was analyzed with the irms standards and blanks were analyzed within each sequence at the beginning at the end and after each block of 8 10 samples the number of injections was set to eight and the average per sample was calculated based on five injections isotopic ratios were expressed relative to the vsmow international standard vienna standard mean ocean water in per mil notation i e isotopic composition 3 δ 2 h r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard represent the heavy to light isotope ratios 2h 1h of the sample and the standard respectively instrumental long term precision for crds and irms were evaluated throughout the measuring period analyzing the in house water standards the precision expressed as twice the standard deviation of multiple injections was 1 04 for the crds and 3 0 for the irms in line with other studies beyer et al 2018 2016 millar et al 2018 according to beyer et al 2016 2018 for 2h artificially enriched samples the standard deviation can be up to five times higher our data are in agreement with this observation as the standard deviation of control samples was 0 27 while that of enriched samples was 1 13 on average the comparison between the crds and irms isotope ratio measurements performed on a set of water samples not subject to organic contamination reported in detail in a previous study penna et al 2021 showed only a negligible difference close to the instrumental precision between the measurements performed by the two instruments maruyama and tada 2014 wassenaar et al 2012 2 5 assessment of the water sources in soil and tree samples a two component mixing model was applied to quantify the fraction of 2h enriched irrigation water present in soil eq 4 and shoots eq 5 during the experiments for soil water the underlying assumption was that sampled soil water was a mixture of pre irrigation soil water considered to have the same isotopic composition of the soil water in the control plot and irrigation water analogously for shoot water the assumption was that the sampled shoot water was a mixture of pre irrigation shoot water considered to have the same isotopic composition than shoot water in the control trees and irrigation water the two components sum up to 100 of water in the soil or shoot sample based on these assumptions the mixing model was applied as follows 4 f i w i n s o i l δ 2 h i r r i g a t e d s o i l δ 2 h c o n t r o l s o i l δ 2 h i w δ 2 h c o n t r o l s o i l 5 f i w i n s h o o t s δ 2 h i r r i g a t e d t r e e δ 2 h c o n t r o l t r e e δ 2 h i w δ 2 h c o n t r o l t r e e where f is the fractional contribution of irrigation water iw in the water sampled from the soil eq 4 or shoot eq 5 in the irrigated plots δ 2h of irrigated and control plots represents the isotopic composition of the soil eq 4 or shoot eq 5 water sampled in the irrigated or control plots respectively the uncertainty of the mixing models was calculated according to genereux 1998 at 95 confidence for each component the uncertainty used to calculate the overall model uncertainty corresponded to the standard deviation of the multiple injections for each water extract through irms or crds multiplied by the corresponding critical value of the student s t distribution two tails 95 confidence another mixing model was performed to quantify the fraction of leaf and shoot axis water derived from soil water taken up by the trees during the experiment for this purpose we considered only the 0 0 6 m soil layer as its 2h signature was significantly affected by the labeling procedure the underlying assumption was that shoot water after irrigation was a mixture of pre event water corresponding to water in control soil and soil water present in the 0 0 6 m layer after irrigation and the sum of the two components in the shoots was 100 the following equations were applied for shoot axes and leaves respectively 6 f s w i n s h o o t a x e s δ 2 h i r r i g a t e d t r e e δ 2 h c o n t r o l s o i l δ 2 h i r r i g a t e d s o i l δ 2 h c o n t r o l s o i l 7 f

tree water δ 2hirrigated tree and δ 2hcontrol tree represent the isotopic composition of water in shoot axes or leaves and 2hirrigated soil and 2hcontrol soil the weighted isotopic composition of soil water at 0 0 6 m depth calculated considering the water content and the 2h enrichment of each soil layer due to fractionation processes related to transpiration leaf water is typically more enriched in 2h compared to shoot axis water benettin et al 2021 beyer et al 2016 applying eq 7 instead of eq 6 for leaves and hence subtracting the 2h abundance in control leaves to irrigated leaves we excluded the attribution of this enrichment to a fraction of artificially enriched water absorbed from the 0 0 6 m soil layer the uncertainty of the mixing models was calculated as described above for eq 4 and eq 5 a two component mixing model was also applied to data from experiment 2 to determine the isotopic composition of soil water sw at the end of the experiment given the isotopic composition of pre irrigation soil water pre sw and the 2h enriched irrigation water iw the underlying assumption was that soil water was a mixture of pre irrigation soil water and irrigation water and that the sum of the two components in the soil was 100 the model was applied according to the following equation 8 f i w i n s o i l δ 2 h s w δ 2 h p r e s w δ 2 h i w δ 2 h p r e s w to calculate the fractional contribution of soil water sw to shoot water f sw in shoots at each sampling we applied eq 6 and eq 7 comparing the isotopic composition of shoot and soil samples at the beginning 0 h with that measured at each sampling time 2 6 statistical analysis results are reported as mean standard deviation 1 sd applying the interquartile method outliers were identified and removed from the dataset t test and anova with tukey hsd post hoc test were applied to identify significant differences among groups control vs irrigated samples different soil layers sampling days on normally distributed and homoscedastic data if the conditions to apply parametric tests were not fulfilled non parametric tests were applied wilcoxon test instead of t test kruskal wallis test instead of anova when longitudinal data were compared namely data referred to the same sample over time a linear mixed model was applied the significance level was set at 0 05 the statistical analysis was carried out using the computing environment r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 field grown apple trees 3 1 1 soil water dynamic the groundwater table depth ranged between 0 9 and 1 0 m from the ground surface in the first days of the experiment july 23 26 2019 and subsequently it reached 0 84 m during the last sampling days in response to a rainfall event that occurred on july 26 27 2019 supplementary table s1 fig 2 reports soil water content at the first and final sampling 2 and 168 h after irrigation measured at different depths in the control and irrigated plot in both plots soil water content decreased moving from the top layer to 0 4 0 6 m depth and then increased again down to 0 8 m depth fig 2 two hours after the irrigation the highest difference in water content between the control and irrigated plot was measured in the shallowest soil layer upper 0 1 m depth 49 5 1 8 and 43 0 1 6 respectively significant differences were measured also between 0 2 and 0 4 m depth with higher water content in the irrigated plot between 0 2 and 0 3 m depth and an opposite trend in the following layer in general a gradual decrease of soil water content occurred from the top layer to depth of 0 4 0 5 m where it reached its minimum value 29 at depth between 0 3 and 0 7 m soil water content was rather stable 31 1 2 0 but it increased in the deepest investigated soil layer 0 7 0 8 m 37 2 2 6 in the subsequent samplings no significant variation in the soil water content at different depths and between irrigated and control plots was observed supplementary fig s1 applying soil moisture derived values of soil water potential and the soil physical properties eq 1 the estimated values of water flow from the groundwater table to 0 7 m and 0 6 m depth were 12 1 and 3 7 mm day 1 respectively eq 2 the capillary rise to soil layers above 0 6 m was on the contrary negligible fig 3 reports the average δ 2h of soil water extracts collected from the irrigated and control plots at the beginning 2 h upper panel and the end 168 h lower panel of the experiment in the control soil moving from the topsoil to 0 8 m depth the values of δ 2h constantly decreased towards more depleted values from 55 9 6 1 at 0 1 m depth to 87 5 1 4 at 0 7 0 8 m depth on average the water extracted from the deepest soil layer 0 7 0 8 m depth showed an isotope composition similar to that of groundwater δ 2h 89 6 1 0 collected from the piezometer no significant change of δ 2h was recorded in the control soil during the experiment indicating no lateral water movement from the adjacent irrigated plots the 2h enrichment after irrigation was particularly marked in the upper soil layer 0 1 m depth the maximum enrichment in this layer was measured 2 h after irrigation 847 180 while in the following days the measured ratio decreased and settled down to lower but still highly enriched values 748 282 611 252 and 635 49 after 24 48 and 168 h from irrigation respectively the decrease in the ratio of the first layer was followed by an increase of the ratio in the subsequent layers as mobile water slowly penetrated in depth for instance the second soil layer 0 1 0 2 m had a δ 2h equals to 89 58 at the first sampling 2 h after irrigation it increased to 421 280 the following day and then it settled down around 262 108 at the last sampling the δ 2h measured in the subsequent layers showed a similar trend with a lower increment at increasing sampling depth supplementary fig s2 the lowest δ 2h variation was measured in the deepest soil layers 0 6 0 8 m where a not significant increment was measured in the isotopic composition of soil water of the irrigated plots compared to that of the control plots 58 25 and 87 2 respectively no significant change in soil moisture or isotopic composition was registered following field irrigation 20 mm 98 8 and rainfall events 19 mm 40 2 hence their impact on our experiment was very likely negligible following eq 4 the fraction of soil water derived from 2h enriched irrigation water was estimated fig 4 in agreement with the enrichment measured in the different soil layers the contribution sharply decreased from 0 to 0 1 0 1 0 2 m where it represented 54 43 and 9 18 of the total water at 2 h and 168 h after irrigation respectively the contribution of irrigation water in the soil layer at 0 2 0 6 m depth was significantly lower and constant between 1 and 4 and 4 5 of the total water at 2 h and 168 h after irrigation respectively in general the deepest layer 0 6 0 8 m depth did not show a significant presence of irrigation water fig 4 a complete overview of the contribution of irrigation water including intermediate samplings is reported in supplementary fig s3 on average the applied irrigation water in the 0 0 6 m soil layer at the first and last sampling was respectively ca 12 and 14 of the total soil water 3 1 2 tree water uptake within the experimental period et0 was on average 3 25 mm day 1 et0 was highest in the first two days 5 mm day 1 then it decreased the lowest value was recorded 5 days after irrigation 1 mm day 1 on a rainy day after this event et0 raised again to pre rain values 3 8 mm day 1 on average daily et0 data are reported in supplementary table s1 on the last sampling occasion control and irrigated trees had a similar total water content average values recorded in leaves and shoot axes were 65 1 1 3 and 56 7 1 2 on fresh weight respectively the isotopic composition of the extracted water from leaf and shoot axis samples is shown in fig 5 in control trees transpiring leaves were more enriched in 2h than shoot axes δ 2h on average 9 9 5 7 and 72 1 5 6 respectively with no difference given by the sampling position as observed in control trees leaves of the irrigated trees had a significantly higher δ 2h than that of shoot axes when sampled at 2 h after irrigation at this sampling time irrigated and control trees had similar δ 2h in both organs fig 5 the following samplings highlighted a gradual but significant increase of δ 2h in both shoot axes and leaves until reaching a plateau no significant difference was observed comparing samples collected at the bottom and top of the canopy the δ 2h of the shoot axes increased within the first 24 h after the water supply and then remained steady for the entire experimental period 53 9 10 8 the leaf δ 2h steadily increased until 8 h after the water supply and then leveled off 43 2 8 0 with the only exception of the sampling at 72 h significantly lower the application of the two component mixing model eq 5 returned the fraction of shoot axis and leaf water deriving from irrigation water reported in fig 6 irrigation water fractions were larger in the shoot axes than in the leaves when the δ 2h of tree samples reached a plateau fig 5 the amount of water coming from irrigation water was 7 8 0 4 for the shoot axes and 3 3 0 5 for the leaves excluding the lowest value at 72 h after irrigation considering both the temporal and spatial data variability this was comparable to the estimated model uncertainty fig 6 considering that irrigation water infiltrated in the soil and mixed with the soil water already present before irrigation the fraction of 2h present in the tree samples that derived from soil water was estimated applying eqs 6 and 7 fig 7 as discussed above 2h enriched irrigation water infiltrated in the soil down to 0 6 m fig 4 hence the calculation was limited to the 0 0 6 m soil layer two hours after irrigation the contribution of soil water in tree samples was less than 5 but it increased to 10 15 at 4 h after irrigation when the δ 2h of tree samples reached a plateau after 8 h for the leaves and 24 h for the shoot axes as reported in fig 5 the calculated water fraction coming from the enriched soil layer was on average 48 3 for the shoot axes and 26 2 for the leaves such a contribution dropped at 72 h leaf sampling 14 despite a large data variability among the four irrigated trees indicated by the red vertical lines in fig 7 the contribution of soil water to shoot axes and leaf water was constant between 24 and 168 h after irrigation with a rather low estimated model uncertainty 3 2 experiment 2 potted apple trees 3 2 1 transpiration and shoot water content cumulative tree transpiration expressed as kg of water lost during the experiment for the different sampling times is reported in fig 8 as expected the highest water loss occurred between 8 am and 4 pm on average ca 85 of the irrigation water retained by the soil after irrigation was lost in 30 h by trees through transpiration nonetheless the gravimetric water content at the end of the experiment was still high 195 10 due to the large water holding capacity of the organic substrate the water content of leaves was higher than that of shoot axes without bark supplementary table s3 in agreement with experiment 1 and showed an expected pattern related to the sampling time and tree transpiration with the highest water contents during the night 3 2 2 soil and tree water isotopic composition percolated water was a mixture of both pre irrigation soil water and 2h enriched irrigation water as indicated by the average δ 2h value 644 277 the variability of the isotopic composition of percolated water among pots was likely related to differences in soil moisture before the irrigation with 2h enriched water the δ 2h of soil water measured at the end of the experiment was quite homogeneous among trees 712 51 and showed a high enrichment compared to the pre irrigation soil water 79 9 1 3 the enrichment obtained for soil water attested that pre irrigation soil water was still present in the soil and the proportion between the two water sources was similar irrigation water contributed to ca 50 of total soil water extracted with cvd eq 8 the isotopic composition of tree samples at the different sampling times is summarized in fig 8 the leaf transpiration explains the isotopic composition of leaf samples being more enriched compared to shoot axes before the addition of labeled water 24 5 on average as observed in experiment 1 the presence of labeled water in leaf samples significantly differed from that in shoot axes water extracts from the shoot axes without bark and leaves did not show the presence of labeled water at the pre dawn sampling of 4 am 6 h after the water supply providing no evidence of significant water uptake and transport to the canopy by root pressure during the night the delta ratios slightly increased 10 h after the irrigation cycle 8 am although they were not significantly different from the previous sampling between 10 and 14 h after irrigation from 8 am to 12 pm the δ 2h values of both shoot axes and leaves steeply increased and such increase continued until 4 pm then it leveled off showing final values of 401 21 and 242 26 at the last shoot axis and leaf sampling 30 h respectively the increase of δ 2h values in both shoot axes and leaves matched the tree transpiration rate fig 8 the isotopic composition of tree samples was significantly lower compared to that of soil water at the end of the experiment δ 2h 712 51 table 2 summarizes the soil water contribution to shoot water shoot axes and leaves estimated by eqs 6 and 7 in agreement with the lack of transpiration during the night there was no contribution of soil water to shoot water at the first two samplings after irrigation at the last sampling 30 h after irrigation 61 3 and 36 4 of the total water present in shoot axes and leaves was derived from root absorption the contribution of soil water uptake to total shoot axis and leaf water in experiment 2 using both data at 18 and 30 h from the water supply table 2 did not significantly differ from that quantified in experiment 1 using data at 24 h fig 7 according to a t test for independent samples 4 discussion 4 1 soil water dynamics root density data for the analyzed orchard indicate that about half of the fine root biomass was concentrated in the upper 0 0 2 m soil layer and that more than 90 of the fine roots was present in the 0 0 6 m soil layer penna et al 2021 soil moisture measured in control and irrigated samples during the experimental period was similar despite the lack of irrigation in the control plot based on soil moisture data we were not able to detect a temporal decrease in soil moisture caused by tree transpiration likely due to the different positions where samples were taken on each sampling time on average soil moisture was highest in the upper as well in the deepest soil layers whereas the lowest values were observed at a soil depth of 0 4 0 5 m in both control and irrigated plots the presence of the impermeable plastic cover on the soil surface most likely limited water evaporation from the soil surface maintaining high levels of soil moisture in the upper layer zheng et al 2017 even the lowest soil moisture values measured at depth of 0 4 0 5 m were on average higher than 30 suggesting that roots did not experience any water stress during the experiment the inversion in soil water content towards higher values measured in the deepest soil layers can be related to the presence of the groundwater table at ca 0 9 m depth data for a soil texture comparable to our case and with groundwater depths between 0 8 and 1 m reported possible upward flow rates up to 5 6 mm day 1 but only up to 0 6 m depth doorenbos and pruitt 1977 similar to the values of maximum capillary rise that we estimated 12 1 and 3 7 mm day 1 at 0 7 and 0 6 m depth respectively our findings support the results of the study conducted by penna et al 2021 in the same area who compared soil measurements at two depths 0 25 and 0 5 m depth and reported constantly higher water content and more depleted isotope signals in the deeper soil layer in the orchard with the shallower groundwater table same orchard of our study suggesting a possible groundwater contribution to soil water recharge at these depths the presence of a small portion of fine roots below 0 6 m depth and the relatively high soil water content at 0 6 0 8 m depth justifies the hypothesis that part of tree water might derive from the groundwater table we found a rather high variability of labeled soil water values among different irrigation plots figs 3 and 4 which might be due to the soil sampling procedure single soil core at each sampling and to an uneven soil infiltration pattern clothier et al 2007 gazis and feng 2004 zhang et al 2018 the effect of this variability was also propagated to the results of the mixing models that we applied to estimate the fraction of soil water absorbed by the trees and present in the shoots indeed results obtained applying the mixing models eqs 6 and 7 showed a rather high variability considering the independent experimental units while the goodness of the model itself was rather high as indicated by the low estimated uncertainty fig 7 this means that our estimations suffered more from soil spatial heterogeneity rather than from analytical factors related to isotope ratio measurements beyer and penna 2021 a key point of soil water studies is the choice of soil water recovering techniques to collect a water pool that is representative of the soil water bioavailable for root uptake as reported in numerous studies di bonito et al 2008 orlowski et al 2016a 2016b soil water extraction represents a critical step of the procedure applying different techniques often involves a different water extraction capacity affected also by the soil type orlowski et al 2016b tsuruta et al 2019 cryogenic extraction allows the recovery of the whole amount of water present in the soil only a fraction of this water can be effectively absorbed by roots depending on the potential gradient applied by plants with water held by the soil at low potentials being inaccessible for plants moreover interactions between mobile bound and tightly bound water in soil are difficult to quantify and variable depending on soil physical properties adams et al 2020 sprenger et al 2019 thielemann et al 2019 vargas et al 2017 based on soil water isotopic composition 2 h after irrigation most of the water was found in the first 0 2 m of soil in the following days irrigation water penetrated to deeper soil layers to a maximum of 0 6 m depth supplementary fig s2 and s3 and mixed with pre irrigation soil water such mixing occurred with different intensities along the profile but no significant enrichment was measured below 0 6 m depth fig 4 despite water movements between topsoil and deeper layers irrigation water represented ca 12 18 of the total soil water present to 0 6 m depth during the experimental period fig 4 and supplementary fig s3 considering that no more water was added to the experimental units after the irrigation with 2h enriched water and that the soil cover prevented evaporation from the surface a stable condition was established in the soil tree system during the field experiment 4 2 water uptake dynamics by field grown apple trees soil and leaf water content suggests an adequate water availability for tree requirement in both the irrigated and the control plots during experiment 1 the summer climate at this alpine site is also relatively mild with et0 values not particularly high supplementary table s1 compared to apple production areas at lower elevation in the same region montagnani et al 2018 zanotelli et al 2019 2022 analyzing the tree water isotopic composition we were able to delineate more precisely the dynamics of water uptake trees were irrigated at 9 am on a sunny summer day when tree transpiration was already ongoing as reported in fig 5 a slight increase in the water δ 2h compared to the control trees extracted both from shoot axes and the leaves was already visible after 2 h but it was more evident at the 4 h sampling indicating a rapid uptake of the irrigation water soon after its distribution the fact that fine root density was highest in the upper 0 0 2 m soil layer might have contributed to the rapid uptake of labeled water the time lag between the irrigation water supply and the presence of irrigation water in the tree transpiring organs is of practical importance in irrigation management although irrigation water might only represent a relatively low fraction of total leaf water its rapid transport from roots to the leaves could allow the recovery from drought stress conditions within the first sampling day shoot isotopic composition continued to increase showing a progressively higher contribution of irrigation water to shoot water fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 following the transpiration driven root water uptake interestingly shoot isotopic composition reached a plateau and remained rather constant from 24 h after irrigation to the end of the experiment without showing any additional significant increase in both leaves and shoot axes in the following six days except for leaves at 72 h from irrigation the low isotopic composition of leaf samples at this sampling point might have been determined by the low transpiration rate registered on that day farquhar et al 2007 gan et al 2002 sheshshayee et al 2005 additionally the night before this sampling trees were irrigated by an overhead sprinkler roughly 20 mm we hypothesized that part of the irrigation water δ 2h 98 8 fallen on the leaf surface might have been absorbed foliar water uptake berry et al 2019 schreel and steppe 2020 determining a decrease in the leaf isotopic composition similarly to what was observed in the field experiment the 2h abundance in potted trees sharply increased from 8 am to 12 pm but then it tended to level off at the two successive sampling occasions following a trend similar to transpiration rate fig 8 seeger and weiler 2021 who collected xylem sap at different heights from the stem of 90 100 year old fagus sylvatica l trees after the application of labeled water to the soil also found that tree isotopic composition gradually increased until reaching a plateau approximately 6 14 days after water distribution such a delay with respect to our experiment might be explained by the different size of the trees both shoot axes and leaves were characterized by a significantly lower isotopic composition with maximum δ value around 50 60 compared to that of soil water the estimated fraction of irrigation water present in the shoot axes and leaves was 7 8 0 4 and 3 3 0 5 of the total water respectively applying eqs 6 and 7 we estimated that the maximum contribution of the water taken from the 2h enriched soil layer 0 0 6 m depth to total plant water was 48 3 and 26 2 in shoot axes and leaves respectively fig 7 based on these results a significant water fraction did not derive from the soil layer where irrigation water had infiltrated similar results were obtained by rowland et al 2008 who applied 2h enriched irrigation water to evaluate water use in a peanut cultivation applying a two component mixing model they calculated that the fraction of irrigation water present in the peanut stem collected through cvd was ca 40 but they did not discuss the origin of the remaining water fraction 4 3 origin of the shoot water to explain the limited fraction of shoot water deriving from the 0 0 6 m soil depth during the experimental period we put forward two possible explanations 1 trees absorbed a significant amount of water in the deeper soil layer 0 6 0 8 m depth that had not been significantly enriched by labeled water 2 a significant fraction of the cryogenically extracted shoot water was already present before the starting of the experiment pre event water and it mixed at very low rates with the recently absorbed labeled water the first explanation would be plausible if a large part of the root system developed below 0 6 m depth as it happens when vigorous apple rootstocks are used song et al 2018 in our experiment however trees were grafted on the dwarfing m9 rootstock and most of the roots were located in the 0 0 6 m soil layer as reported for this apple orchard by penna et al 2021 measuring the water stable isotopic composition these authors showed that the tree isotopic composition partially overlapped with the isotopic composition of the topsoil 0 25 m depth which was significantly different from that of groundwater suggesting a negligible contribution of the latter the results of experiment 2 shed additional light on the low likelihood of the first possible explanation experiment 2 was designed to create a simplified model under pot conditions where the sources of tree water were only two namely the water already present in the shoots before starting the experiment and the soil water as the contribution of soil water uptake to total water in both the shoot axes and leaves was similar in the two experiments we speculate that the water uptake from the deepest soil layers 0 6 m depth did not account for a significant fraction of shoot water that was not derived from the 0 0 6 m soil layer we cannot however rule out the possibility that the capillary rise contributed to the transport of some water from the water table to the deepest part of the 0 0 6 m soil layer to be able to quantify this process groundwater should be labeled which is challenging under field conditions a major flux of water due to capillary rise however would have caused a decrease in the shoot isotopic composition over time which was not observed figs 3 and 5 according to the second possible explanation our results could be explained considering that a significant fraction of the cryogenically extracted shoot water was not ascribable to recently root absorbed water this explanation is plausible if it is assumed that to a certain extent water is compartmentalized within tree organs cernusak et al 2016 zwieniecki et al 2007 to support this explanation the mechanisms of water transport and distribution within plants need to be examined it is reasonable to assume that water moves inside the tree mainly through an apoplastic pathway even though transcellular and symplastic movements are also plausible and the extent of each mechanism may vary according to several factors including plant species sack and holbrook 2006 in experiment 1 the shoot axes collected at 9 am contained an amount of water similar to its dry weight 56 7 fw part of that water might have been contained in the xylem vessels while it is reasonable to assume that another water fraction was present in the other secondary xylem tissues namely the fibers the fiber tracheids and the ray parenchyma as well as in the cambium the secondary phloem and the bark pratt 1990 in the leaves the main xylem vessels split into progressively smaller veins embedded in leaf mesophyll water movements along pathways outside the veins are rather complicated and still partially unknown barbour et al 2017 similarly a precise identification of the position of evaporation sites is difficult although most of the evaporation processes occur at the intercellular spaces with the resulting water vapor diffusing to the atmosphere through the stomata cronquist 1971 in experiment 1 the leaf collected at 9 am water content was 65 of the leaf fresh weight and it is likely that most of the water was present in the veins the palisade cells and the spongy mesophyll with the latter two tissues accounting for most of the apple leaf volume pratt 1990 if an equilibrium process existed in the soil between pre event and recently absorbed water considering the potential evapotranspiration during the experimental period of the field experiment in the range of ca 7 l day 1 tree 1 we would have observed a gradual increase in the isotopic composition of shoots from day 1 to day 7 with a final isotopic composition close to that of soil water at 0 0 6 m depth since this was not observed we speculate that in the short period apple trees featuring no water stress dis did not significantly exchange and mix pre event and recently absorbed water neither in the shoot axes nor in the leaves in light of this explanation the fact that the total water content of leaves was around 9 higher than that of shoot axes could explain the lower δ 2h values found in the leaves as compared to the shoot axes to which extent water mixing processes within tree organs depends on the fact that trees did not suffer limitations in water supply and were not exposed to a high evaporative demand deserves further investigation this study represents a first attempt to trace irrigation water in an apple orchard and to quantify the contribution of irrigation water to tree water during the summer season we are aware that factors such as the local soil texture climate as well the type of irrigation system make our results site specific and thus further studies in different settings are needed before our conclusions can be generalized to other apple orchards 5 conclusions the two labeling experiments with 2h enriched water under field and pot conditions shed light on the fate of the irrigation water in the soil and the apple tree in an alpine orchard as expected most of the irrigation water was present in the 0 0 2 m soil layers but the labeled water also infiltrated until 0 6 m depth the uptake of irrigation water by apple trees in the field was rather rapid as indicated by the presence of labeled water in the shoots at 1 5 2 5 m height already after 2 4 h after the water supply the presence of a superficial root system might explain the rapid uptake of labeled water the contribution of irrigation water to shoot water increased during the first day after the irrigation but then leveled off reaching a maximum of 7 8 and 3 3 in shoot axes and leaves respectively such low values are not surprising considering the large water pool in the soil and the fact that irrigation water mixed with pre event soil water considering that the labeled water was localized in the 0 0 6 m soil layer where also around 90 of the fine roots were present we estimated that at the end of the experiment shoot axes and leaves contained on average 48 3 and 26 2 of labeled water taken up from such a layer respectively as indicated by the ancillary pot experiment a significant fraction of the cryogenically extracted shoot water was already present before the starting of the experiment and it mixed at very low rates with the recently absorbed labeled water probably due to the combination of low transpiration rates and the presence of highly available soil water it is unlikely that the water fraction unaccounted by the water uptake from the 0 0 6 m soil layer largely derived from unlabeled water taken up by the roots in the deepest soil layer 0 6 m although the capillary rise from the shallow water table could have contributed to the soil moisture at the bottom of the 0 0 6 m soil layer in light of our results it is evident that water mixing processes at the soil and tree level are still not fully understood this knowledge gap affects the ability to elaborate

9546,improving our knowledge on the relative contribution of irrigation water precipitation and groundwater to tree transpiration is necessary for an efficient and sustainable use of water resources in agriculture for this purpose we applied deuterium 2h enriched water to trace the uptake of irrigation water by apple trees under field and pot conditions 2h enriched water was supplied to apple trees in an alpine valley mimicking sprinkler irrigation labeled water infiltration in the soil and presence in apple tree shoots was measured over a week an ancillary experiment using potted trees was performed to elucidate the role of irrigation water after soil saturation with 2h enriched water under field conditions 2h enriched water infiltrated to a maximum depth of 0 6 m where most of the fine roots were present and mixed with pre irrigation soil water sprinkler irrigation water was taken up by apple trees 2 4 h after its supply and its contribution to the shoot water content increased in the first 24 h then it leveled off tree water absorbed from the enriched soil layer represented on average 48 3 and 26 2 of the total water in shoot axes and leaves respectively the results of the pot experiment confirmed the contribution of irrigation water to shoot water and allowed us to speculate that under field conditions groundwater ca 0 9 m deep with capillary rise expected up to 0 6 m depth did not significantly contribute to tree water uptake results indicate that a large fraction of shoot water 52 74 did not derive from recent soil water uptake suggesting a rather limited water mixing within tree organs keywords irrigation water soil water root water uptake isotope analysis deuterium tracing 1 introduction improving water management strategies in agriculture is pivotal to face future scenarios characterized by an increased extension of irrigated crops and a concurrent decrease in freshwater availability chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 in this context a better understanding of the dynamics of water uptake by crops and water use from multiple water pools e g precipitation irrigation groundwater to satisfy crop water requirements is highly necessary despite the extensive literature on crop irrigation the actual contribution of irrigation water to plant transpiration is still uncertain similarly the quantitative contribution of the different water sources to the overall water uptake by trees is unclear studies investigating these aspects have to face the complexity of soil water processes subjected to temporal and spatial variability jackisch et al 2020 li et al 2014 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the water molecule represent a reliable tracer of water source and its movements providing information about water fluxes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac penna et al 2020 sprenger et al 2016 in the last decades many authors studied the water uptake dynamics comparing the isotopic composition of plant water and that of the main local water sources mostly through the application of mixing models rothfuss and javaux 2017 several isotope based studies analyzed root water uptake and the proportional contribution of different water sources and or irrigation practices in relation to plant species growth stage and the depth of their root system cao et al 2018 liu et al 2020 mahindawansha et al 2018 wu et al 2018 however the outcomes of these studies are affected by several factors including the sampling representativeness of all the available water sources the necessity for a sufficiently appreciable difference in the isotopic composition of each water source in addition to methodological constraints berry et al 2018 beyer and penna 2021 orlowski et al 2016a moreover this approach is valid assuming that no isotope fractionation occurs during root uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 this assumption was questioned by several authors who measured an appreciable isotope fractionation in several tree species in relation to water movements at the soil root interface and within plants ellsworth and williams 2007 poca et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 recently water isotope heterogeneity both in the soil pores and tree stems was found to contribute to soil stem isotope offsets which might cause an incorrect interpretation of isotope data barbeta et al 2019 2020 2022 it is therefore evident that the above mentioned factors may hinder the identification of tree water sources when different water pools exist especially under natural environmental conditions beyer and penna 2021 the use of deuterium 2h enriched water makes possible to artificially modify the isotopic composition of a water reservoir and trace its uptake by plants without altering the water chemical and physical properties becker and coplen 2001 being part of the water molecule 2h is a conservative tracer and due to its low natural abundance ca 0 015 small additions of heavy water 2h2o in a confined environment can be successfully monitored after equilibration with local water becker and coplen 2001 adding an excess of 2h overcomes also the problem of potential isotope fractionation from the water source to the tree organs as the fractionation would result rather negligible compared to the measurable artificial enrichment beyer et al 2016 rowland et al 2008 in the past years the application of 2h enriched water in isotope based studies has encompassed several aspects related to ecohydrological studies including among the others soil water accessed by plants e g bogie et al 2018 beyer et al 2018 rasmussen et al 2020

et al 2007 koeniger et al 2010 grünberger et al 2011 nonetheless most of these studies were conducted in forest ecosystems with only a few applications regarding agricultural systems to the best of our knowledge none of the previous studies provided an in depth analysis of the role of irrigation water compared to other water pools in relation to plant water needs and hence the quantification and comprehension of irrigation water uptake dynamics remain weak the present study is a follow up of a previous research aimed at identifying the prevailing water sources for apple trees in an alpine valley of south tyrol in northern italy applying a stable isotope approach penna et al 2021 in this area intensive apple cultivation is widespread and to guarantee high fruit yield and quality irrigation water is frequently applied for most of the growing season to optimize irrigation water use it is necessary to evaluate its contribution to tree water in comparison with other locally available water sources such as rainwater and groundwater the latter if shallow enough might positively contribute to soil water recharge in the root zone through capillary rising processes grashey jansen 2010 to better understand the role of irrigation water in apple orchards and its contribution to tree water requirements in the summer period we designed two experiments using 2h enriched irrigation water the two labeling experiments addressed the following research questions 1 what is the fate of the irrigation water in the soil 2 to what extent do irrigation water and groundwater contribute to the overall tree water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment 1 field grown apple trees 2 1 1 site description experiment 1 was carried out in july 2019 in an apple orchard malus domestica cv pinova on m9 rootstock located in the municipality of laas lasa german and italian name respectively in the vinschgau venosta valley south tyrol italy and close to the adige river channel elevation 868 m a s l size 5000 m2 the apple orchard was planted in 2005 and was in full production in 2019 ca 70 ton ha 1 with a north south row orientation perpendicular to the direction of the river flow the tree spacing within single rows is 0 8 m while consecutive rows are 3 m apart in summer an overhead sprinkler system normally provides 20 mm of water once or twice a week depending on the rainfall events which are normally rather infrequent in summer in this area the long term precipitation record is 480 mm year 1 according to the usda classification the soil has a silt loam texture until 0 8 m depth with 26 7 sand and 10 8 clay on average table 1 a recent investigation on apple root distribution in the same field revealed that around 50 and around 90 of the fine roots are present in the 0 0 2 m and 0 0 6 m soil layers respectively penna et al 2021 meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity precipitations wind speed and net radiation were recorded by a weather station located at one edge of the orchard and are summarized in supplementary table s1 starting from meteorological data the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated at hourly time steps applying the fao modified version of the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2006 2 1 2 experimental design four consecutive tree rows were selected and in the middle of each row a block of three trees was chosen hereafter called experimental unit the selected trees were similar in tree height ca 3 5 m and crown volume ca 3 0 3 5 m3 the four experimental units had approximately the same distance from the river ca 80 m and we assumed that the depth to groundwater table was the same for all the trees each experimental unit included a control tree not irrigated tree and a tree to be irrigated with 2h enriched water separated by a buffer tree fig 1 a 1 3 m long piezometer not equipped with a level logger was installed outside one of the experimental units to daily measure the depth of the groundwater table using a meter stick to create a moderate level of soil water deficit before the addition of 2h enriched water infiltration of irrigation and rainwater was prevented covering the soil of the four experimental units with an impermeable plastic sheet length ca 3 m width per row side ca 0 8 m from july 11 until july 23 the last irrigation cycle before covering the soil occurred on july 5 and the last rainfall on july 6 3 mm on july 23 at 9 am cet 2h enriched water was poured into the soil of the irrigated plots before starting the irrigation the plastic sheets were removed and the plots to be irrigated 1 m2 were delimitated by plastic supports 0 1 m high partially driven into the soil to prevent water from spreading outside of the 1 m2 plot 2h enriched water was prepared in 20 l cans diluting 5 ml of 2h2o 99 9 into 20 l of local water δ 2h 98 8 taken from an irrigation pipe close to the orchard to reach a final δ 2h value of 1544 29 each tree received 40 l of water on a surface of 1 m2 40 mm in 15 min irrigation water was evenly distributed using rain shower watering cans at a slow application rate to minimize runoff no irrigation was provided to the control trees for the whole experimental period after adding the labeled water the plastic sheets were placed back on top of the soil and kept until the end of the experiment july 30 to prevent irrigation water and rainwater from entering the soil of the experimental plots a rain collector was placed at one edge of the apple orchard outside of the tree rows to collect rainwater from precipitations fallen during the experimental period 2 1 3 field sampling experiment 1 lasted one week after the application of the 2h enriched water during this period water tree and soil samples were collected periodically supplementary table s2 soil samples were collected 2 h after the irrigation and then at 24 h 48 h and 7 days 168 h in the four irrigated and control plots using a single gauge auger length 1 m diameter 2 5 cm positioned each time at 0 4 m from the tree trunk towards one of the corners of the squared experimental plot to a depth of 0 8 m the soil core was then divided into 8 layers each 0 1 m long and a soil aliquot was sampled from each layer shoot samples were collected at 2 4 8 24 48 72 and 168 h after irrigation from the irrigated plots both from the east and the west side of the canopy one shoot per side length of 10 15 cm with ca 8 leaves at 1 5 m and 2 5 m from the ground shoots sampled at 1 5 m height hereafter referred to as bottom samples were kept separate from those collected at 2 5 m hereafter top samples two fully expanded apical leaves with petioles were immediately removed from the shoot axes and both leaves and shoot axes were then transferred into separated vials based on average values for the leaf area index of apple trees cultivated in this area ca 2 5 and the actual tree density we estimated that the destructive shoot sampling reduced the leaf area by 5 hence we assumed that such a difference did not significantly affect tree transpiration control trees were sampled following the same procedure used for irrigated trees at the beginning and the end of the experiment 2 and 168 h starting from 24 h after irrigation tree sampling was always performed around 1 2 pm both before and after the experimental period a groundwater sample was collected from the piezometer at the end of the experiment rainwater collected between july 26 and 28 was sampled from the rain collector all the collected samples were directly transferred into airtight glass vials with a screw cap and rubber septum sealed and stored at 4 c until processing the water content of leaves and shoot axes sampled at the end of the experiment 168 h from both irrigated and control trees was determined gravimetrically through the loss on drying method 65 c 48 h and expressed on a wet weight basis the same procedure was applied to determine the moisture content of soil samples 105 c until constant weight expressed on a dry weight basis gravimetric water content liu et al 2020 orlowski et al 2016a 2 1 4 estimation of the water flux from the groundwater table using the soil moisture values measured in the irrigated plots at different depths and adapting eq 1 to a silt loam soil as indicated by villalobos et al 2016 the matric soil water potential at each soil depth was estimated as follows 1 ψ m ψ e θ v θ sat b where ψe is the air entry water potential which is 2 1 j kg 1 for silty loam soils villalobos et al 2016 b an empirical parameter which was set equal to 4 7 villalobos et al 2016 θv and θsat the volumetric and saturation water content respectively vertical water fluxes jw kg m 2 s 1 and converted to mm day 1 from the groundwater table to the unsaturated soil layers from 0 8 m depth to the topsoil layer were estimated based on the following equation villalobos et al 2016 2 j w k ψ m d ψ m dz g where k ψm represents the hydraulic conductivity as a function of matric potential ψm kpa which is 0 00019 kg s m 3 for silty loam soils villalobos et al 2016 z m is the vertical distance among two soil depths g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration 2 2 experiment 2 potted apple trees 2 2 1 experimental design four apple trees cv golden delicious rootstock m9 3 years old in 8 l pots filled with an organic substrate

before the experiment δ 2h 1550 18 after a thorough homogenization 1 5 l of labeled water were applied to the pots using a rain shower watering cans after the irrigation the soil in each pot was covered with a plastic film to avoid evaporation from the soil surface pots were lifted from the ground using a metal ring and percolating water was collected in pot dishes the following day june 24 was sunny 11 h of sunshine with maximum temperatures above 30 c and ca 50 relative humidity 2 2 2 potted tree sampling before pot irrigation a soil sample was collected from each pot percolated water

supply at each sampling a single shoot min 20 cm length per plant was chosen and two fully expanded apical leaves and the shoot axis without bark differently from experiment 1 were collected at the end of the experiment soil cores were collected from each pot to obtain a representative subsample all the samples were directly transferred into airtight glass vials with a screw cap and rubber septum sealed and stored frozen until processing before each sampling the pot weight was recorded to estimate tree transpiration the water content of leaf shoot axis and soil samples was determined gravimetrically as previously described for experiment 1 section 2 1 3 2 3 cryogenic vacuum distillation cryogenic vacuum distillation cvd was applied to recover water from soil and tree samples collected during experiment 1 and 2 following the method described by koeniger et al 2011 and reported by beyer et al 2018 and millar et al 2018 with slight modifications the vials containing the frozen samples were connected to empty vials then vacuum sealed through stainless steel needles the filled vials were then placed in a thermoblock heated through a hot plate 200 c 15 min while the empty vials were immersed in liquid nitrogen the distilled water was transferred into 2 ml vials and stored in the refrigerator until analysis extraction efficiency was estimated comparing the sample weight after cvd and subsequent oven drying 105 c 24 h overall the extraction efficiency was 99 in agreement with other studies millar et al 2018 tsuruta et al 2019 wu et al 2019 such an extraction efficiency is high enough to prevent artifacts due to water isotope fractionation araguás araguás et al 1995 2 4 laboratory isotope analysis the isotopic composition δ 2h of water samples 2h enriched

vaporizer unit for liquid water injection vaporization module a0211 picarro inc and an autosampler a0325 picarro inc injection volume was set at 1 8 µl sucked through a 10 µl syringe ten injections were performed for the in house water standards calibrated against vsmow and slap certified reference materials and seven for the water samples not subject to 2h enrichment in analytical sequences including samples for which an artificial 2h enrichment was expected the number of injections was increased to 15 and 12 for standards and samples respectively standards were measured repeatedly at the beginning at the end and after blocks of 8 10 samples to deal with memory effect sample to sample memory the first three for the water samples not subject to 2h enrichment or five for the 2h enriched samples measurements per sample were removed before averaging the ratios gröning 2018 penna et al 2012 results were processed using the picarro s chemcorrect post processing software package to identify samples affected by spectral interference of organic compounds heavy contamination was detected in less than 3 of the soil extracts the isotopic ratios of these samples were excluded from the data analysis the δ 2h of plant water extracts shoot axis and leaf samples in addition to all the samples from experiment 2 was determined with a gas bench ii thermo scientific coupled to a continuous flow isotopic ratio mass spectrometer cf irms delta v advantage conflo iv thermo scientific due to the high organic content that would have interfered with the crds analysis the methodology with the gas bench ii foresees that 0 2 ml of sample is added to a vial and subsequently the headspace flushed with an equilibration gas 2 h2 in helium a platinum stick was added to the vials as the catalyst for the equilibration phase after the required equilibration time 40 min the headspace was analyzed with the irms standards and blanks were analyzed within each sequence at the beginning at the end and after each block of 8 10 samples the number of injections was set to eight and the average per sample was calculated based on five injections isotopic ratios were expressed relative to the

isotope ratios 2h 1h of the sample and the standard respectively instrumental long term precision for crds and irms were evaluated throughout the measuring period analyzing the in house water standards the precision expressed as twice the standard deviation of multiple injections was 1 04 for the crds and 3 0 for the irms in line with other studies beyer et al 2018 2016 millar et al 2018 according to beyer et al 2016 2018 for 2h artificially enriched samples the standard deviation can be up to five times higher our data are in agreement with this observation as the standard deviation of control samples was 0 27 while that of enriched samples was 1 13 on average the comparison between the crds and irms isotope ratio measurements performed on a set of water samples not subject to organic contamination reported in detail in a previous study penna et al 2021 showed only a negligible difference close to the instrumental precision between the measurements performed by the two instruments maruyama and tada 2014 wassenaar et al 2012 2 5 assessment of the water sources in soil and tree samples a two component mixing model was applied to quantify the fraction of 2h enriched irrigation water present in soil eq 4 and shoots eq 5 during the experiments for soil water the underlying assumption was that sampled soil water was a mixture of pre irrigation soil water considered to have the same isotopic composition of the soil water in the control plot and irrigation water analogously for shoot water the assumption was that the sampled shoot water was a mixture of pre irrigation shoot water considered to have the same isotopic composition than shoot water in the control trees and irrigation water the two components sum up to 100 of water in the soil or shoot sample based on these assumptions the mixing model was applied as follows 4 f i w i n s o i l δ 2 h i r r i g a t e d s o i l δ 2 h c o n t r o l s o i l δ 2 h i w δ 2 h c o n t r o l s o i l 5 f i w i n s h

soil eq 4 or shoot eq 5 in the irrigated plots δ 2h of irrigated and control plots represents the isotopic composition of the soil eq 4 or shoot eq 5 water sampled in the irrigated or control plots respectively the uncertainty of the mixing models was calculated according to genereux 1998 at 95 confidence for each component the uncertainty used to calculate the overall model uncertainty corresponded to the standard deviation of the multiple injections for each water extract through irms or crds multiplied by the corresponding critical value of the student s t distribution two tails 95 confidence another mixing model was performed to quantify the fraction of leaf and shoot axis water derived from soil water taken up by the trees during the experiment for this purpose we considered only the 0 0 6 m soil layer as its 2h signature was significantly affected by the labeling procedure the underlying assumption was that shoot water after irrigation was a mixture of pre event water corresponding to water in control soil and soil water present in the 0 0 6 m layer after irrigation and the sum of the two components in the shoots was 100 the following equations were applied for shoot axes and leaves respectively 6 f s w i n s h o o t a x e s δ 2 h i r r i g a t e d t r e e δ 2 h c o n t r o l s o i l δ 2 h i r r i g a t e d s o i l δ 2 h c o n t r o l s o i l 7 f

tree water δ 2hirrigated tree and δ 2hcontrol tree represent the isotopic composition of water in shoot axes or leaves and 2hirrigated soil and 2hcontrol soil the weighted isotopic composition of soil water at 0 0 6 m depth calculated considering the water content and the 2h enrichment of each soil layer due to fractionation processes related to transpiration leaf water is typically more enriched in 2h compared to shoot axis water benettin et al 2021 beyer et al 2016 applying eq 7 instead of eq 6 for leaves and hence subtracting the 2h abundance in control leaves to irrigated leaves we excluded the attribution of this enrichment to a fraction of artificially enriched water absorbed from the 0 0 6 m soil layer the uncertainty of the mixing models was calculated as described above for eq 4 and eq 5 a two component mixing model was also applied to data from experiment 2 to determine the isotopic composition of soil water sw at the end of the experiment given the isotopic composition of pre irrigation soil water pre sw and the 2h enriched irrigation water iw the underlying assumption was that soil water was a mixture of pre irrigation soil water and irrigation water and that the sum of the two components in the soil was 100 the model was applied according to the following equation 8 f i w i n s o i l δ 2 h s w δ 2 h p r e s w δ 2 h i w δ 2 h p r e s w to calculate the fractional contribution of soil water sw to shoot water f sw in shoots at each sampling we applied eq 6 and eq 7 comparing the isotopic composition of shoot and soil samples at the beginning 0 h with that measured at each sampling time 2 6 statistical analysis results are reported as mean standard deviation 1 sd applying the interquartile method outliers were identified and removed from the dataset t test and anova with tukey hsd post hoc test were applied to identify significant differences among groups control vs irrigated samples different soil layers sampling days on normally distributed and homoscedastic data if the conditions to apply parametric tests were not fulfilled non parametric tests were applied wilcoxon test instead of t test kruskal wallis test instead of anova when longitudinal data were compared namely data referred to the same sample over time a linear mixed model was applied the significance level was set at 0 05 the statistical analysis was carried out using the computing environment r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 field grown apple trees 3 1 1 soil water dynamic the groundwater table depth ranged between 0 9 and 1 0 m from the ground surface in the first days of the experiment july 23 26 2019 and subsequently it reached 0 84 m during the last sampling days in response to a rainfall event that occurred on july 26 27 2019 supplementary table s1 fig 2 reports soil water content at the first and final sampling 2 and 168 h after irrigation measured at different depths in the control and irrigated plot in both plots soil water content decreased moving from the top layer to 0 4 0 6 m depth and then increased again down to 0 8 m depth fig 2 two hours after the irrigation the highest difference in water content between the control and irrigated plot was measured in the shallowest soil layer upper 0 1 m depth 49 5 1 8 and 43 0 1 6 respectively significant differences were measured also between 0 2 and 0 4 m depth with higher water content in the irrigated plot between 0 2 and 0 3 m depth and an opposite trend in the following layer in general a gradual decrease of soil water content occurred from the top layer to depth of 0 4 0 5 m where it reached its minimum value 29 at depth between 0 3 and 0 7 m soil water content was rather stable 31 1 2 0 but it increased in the deepest investigated soil layer 0 7 0 8 m 37 2 2 6 in the subsequent samplings no significant variation in the soil water content at different depths and between irrigated and control plots was observed supplementary fig s1 applying soil moisture derived values of soil water potential and the soil physical properties eq 1 the estimated values of water flow from the groundwater table to 0 7 m and 0 6 m depth were 12 1 and 3 7 mm day 1 respectively eq 2 the capillary rise to soil layers above 0 6 m was on the contrary negligible fig 3 reports the average δ 2h of soil water extracts collected from the irrigated and control plots at the beginning 2 h upper panel and the end 168 h lower panel of the experiment in the control soil moving from the topsoil to 0 8 m depth the values of δ 2h constantly decreased towards more depleted values from 55 9 6 1 at 0 1 m depth to 87 5 1 4 at 0 7 0 8 m depth on average the water extracted from the deepest soil layer 0 7 0 8 m depth showed an isotope composition similar to that of groundwater δ 2h 89 6 1 0 collected from the piezometer no significant change of δ 2h was recorded in the control soil during the experiment indicating no lateral water movement from the adjacent irrigated plots the 2h enrichment after irrigation was particularly marked in the upper soil layer 0 1 m depth the maximum enrichment in this layer was measured 2 h after irrigation 847 180 while in the following days the measured ratio decreased and settled down to lower but still highly enriched values 748 282 611 252 and 635 49 after 24 48 and 168 h from irrigation respectively the decrease in the ratio of the first layer was followed by an increase of the ratio in the subsequent layers as mobile water slowly penetrated in depth for instance the second soil layer 0 1 0 2 m had a δ 2h equals to 89 58 at the first sampling 2 h after irrigation it increased to 421 280 the following day and then it settled down around 262 108 at the last sampling the δ 2h measured in the subsequent layers showed a similar trend with a lower increment at increasing sampling depth supplementary fig s2 the lowest δ 2h variation was measured in the deepest soil layers 0 6 0 8 m where a not significant increment was measured in the isotopic composition of soil water of the irrigated plots compared to that of the control plots 58 25 and 87 2 respectively no significant change in soil moisture or isotopic composition was registered following field irrigation 20 mm 98 8 and rainfall events 19 mm 40 2 hence their impact on our experiment was very likely negligible following eq 4 the fraction of soil water derived from 2h enriched irrigation water was estimated fig 4 in agreement with the enrichment measured in the different soil layers the contribution sharply decreased from 0 to 0 1 0 1 0 2 m where it represented 54 43 and 9 18 of the total water at 2 h and 168 h after irrigation respectively the contribution of irrigation water in the soil layer at 0 2 0 6 m depth was significantly lower and constant between 1 and 4 and 4 5 of the total water at 2 h and 168 h after irrigation respectively in general the deepest layer 0 6 0 8 m depth did not show a significant presence of irrigation water fig 4 a complete overview of the contribution of irrigation water including intermediate samplings is reported in supplementary fig s3 on average the applied irrigation water in the 0 0 6 m soil layer at the first and last sampling was respectively ca 12 and 14 of the total soil water 3 1 2 tree water uptake within the experimental period et0 was on average 3 25 mm day 1 et0 was highest in the first two days 5 mm day 1 then it decreased the lowest value was recorded 5 days after irrigation 1 mm day 1 on a rainy day after this event et0 raised again to pre rain values 3 8 mm day 1 on average daily et0 data are reported in supplementary table s1 on the last sampling occasion control and irrigated trees had a similar total water content average values recorded in leaves and shoot axes were 65 1 1 3 and 56 7 1 2 on fresh weight respectively the isotopic composition of the extracted water from leaf and shoot axis samples is shown in fig 5 in control trees transpiring leaves were more enriched in 2h than shoot axes δ 2h on average 9 9 5 7 and 72 1 5 6 respectively with no difference given by the sampling position as observed in control trees leaves of the irrigated trees had a significantly higher δ 2h than that of shoot axes when sampled at 2 h after irrigation at this sampling time irrigated and control trees had similar δ 2h in both organs fig 5 the following samplings highlighted a gradual but significant increase of δ 2h in both shoot axes and leaves until reaching a plateau no significant difference was observed comparing samples collected at the bottom and top of the canopy the δ 2h of the shoot axes increased within the first 24 h after the water supply and then remained steady for the entire experimental period 53 9 10 8 the leaf δ 2h steadily increased until 8 h after the water supply and then leveled off 43 2 8 0 with the only exception of the sampling at 72 h significantly lower the application of the two component mixing model eq 5 returned the fraction of shoot axis and leaf water deriving from irrigation water reported in fig 6 irrigation water fractions were larger in the shoot axes than in the leaves when the δ 2h of tree samples reached a plateau fig 5 the amount of water coming from irrigation water was 7 8 0 4 for the shoot axes and 3 3 0 5 for the leaves excluding the lowest value at 72 h after irrigation considering both the temporal and spatial data variability this was comparable to the estimated model uncertainty fig 6 considering that irrigation water infiltrated in the soil and mixed with the soil water already present before irrigation the fraction of 2h present in the tree samples that derived from soil water was estimated applying eqs 6 and 7 fig 7 as discussed above 2h enriched irrigation water infiltrated in the soil down to 0 6 m fig 4 hence the calculation was limited to the 0 0 6 m soil layer two hours after irrigation the contribution of soil water in tree samples was less than 5 but it increased to 10 15 at 4 h after irrigation when the δ 2h of tree samples reached a plateau after 8 h for the leaves and 24 h for the shoot axes as reported in fig 5 the calculated water fraction coming from the enriched soil layer was on average 48 3 for the shoot axes and 26 2 for the leaves such a contribution dropped at 72 h leaf sampling 14 despite a large data variability among the four irrigated trees indicated by the red vertical lines in fig 7 the contribution of soil water to shoot axes and leaf water was constant between 24 and 168 h after irrigation with a rather low estimated model uncertainty 3 2 experiment 2 potted apple trees 3 2 1 transpiration and shoot water content cumulative tree transpiration expressed as kg of water lost during the experiment for the different sampling times is reported in fig 8 as expected the highest water loss occurred between 8 am and 4 pm on average ca 85 of the irrigation water retained by the soil after irrigation was lost in 30 h by trees through transpiration nonetheless the gravimetric water content at the end of the experiment was still high 195 10 due to the large water holding capacity of the organic substrate the water content of leaves was higher than that of shoot axes without bark supplementary table s3 in agreement with experiment 1 and showed an expected pattern related to the sampling time and tree transpiration with the highest water contents during the night 3 2 2 soil and tree water isotopic composition percolated water was a mixture of both pre irrigation soil water and 2h enriched irrigation water as indicated by the average δ 2h value 644 277 the variability of the isotopic composition of percolated water among pots was likely related to differences in soil moisture before the irrigation with 2h enriched water the δ 2h of soil water measured at the end of the experiment was quite homogeneous among trees 712 51 and showed a high enrichment compared to the pre irrigation soil water 79 9 1 3 the enrichment obtained for soil water attested that pre irrigation soil water was still present in the soil and the proportion between the two water sources was similar irrigation water contributed to ca 50 of total soil water extracted with cvd eq 8 the isotopic composition of tree samples at the different sampling times is summarized in fig 8 the leaf transpiration explains the isotopic composition of leaf samples being more enriched compared to shoot axes before the addition of labeled water 24 5 on average as observed in experiment 1 the presence of labeled water in leaf samples significantly differed from that in shoot axes water extracts from the shoot axes without bark and leaves did not show the presence of labeled water at the pre dawn sampling of 4 am 6 h after the water supply providing no evidence of significant water uptake and transport to the canopy by root pressure during the night the delta ratios slightly increased 10 h after the irrigation cycle 8 am although they were not significantly different from the previous sampling between 10 and 14 h after irrigation from 8 am to 12 pm the δ 2h values of both shoot axes and leaves steeply increased and such increase continued until 4 pm then it leveled off showing final values of 401 21 and 242 26 at the last shoot axis and leaf sampling 30 h respectively the increase of δ 2h values in both shoot axes and leaves matched the tree transpiration rate fig 8 the isotopic composition of tree samples was significantly lower compared to that of soil water at the end of the experiment δ 2h 712 51 table 2 summarizes the soil water contribution to shoot water shoot axes and leaves estimated by eqs 6 and 7 in agreement with the lack of transpiration during the night there was no contribution of soil water to shoot water at the first two samplings after irrigation at the last sampling 30 h after irrigation 61 3 and 36 4 of the total water present in shoot axes and leaves was derived from root absorption the contribution of soil water uptake to total shoot axis and leaf water in experiment 2 using both data at 18 and 30 h from the water supply table 2 did not significantly differ from that quantified in experiment 1 using data at 24 h fig 7 according to a t test for independent samples 4 discussion 4 1 soil water dynamics root density data for the analyzed orchard indicate that about half of the fine root biomass was concentrated in the upper 0 0 2 m soil layer and that more than 90 of the fine roots was present in the 0 0 6 m soil layer penna et al 2021 soil moisture measured in control and irrigated samples during the experimental period was similar despite the lack of irrigation in the control plot based on soil moisture data we were not able to detect a temporal decrease in soil moisture caused by tree transpiration likely due to the different positions where samples were taken on each sampling time on average soil moisture was highest in the upper as well in the deepest soil layers whereas the lowest values were observed at a soil depth of 0 4 0 5 m in both control and irrigated plots the presence of the impermeable plastic cover on the soil surface most likely limited water evaporation from the soil surface maintaining high levels of soil moisture in the upper layer zheng et al 2017 even the lowest soil moisture values measured at depth of 0 4 0 5 m were on average higher than 30 suggesting that roots did not experience any water stress during the experiment the inversion in soil water content towards higher values measured in the deepest soil layers can be related to the presence of the groundwater table at ca 0 9 m depth data for a soil texture comparable to our case and with groundwater depths between 0 8 and 1 m reported possible upward flow rates up to 5 6 mm day 1 but only up to 0 6 m depth doorenbos and pruitt 1977 similar to the values of maximum capillary rise that we estimated 12 1 and 3 7 mm day 1 at 0 7 and 0 6 m depth respectively our findings support the results of the study conducted by penna et al 2021 in the same area who compared soil measurements at two depths 0 25 and 0 5 m depth and reported constantly higher water content and more depleted isotope signals in the deeper soil layer in the orchard with the shallower groundwater table same orchard of our study suggesting a possible groundwater contribution to soil water recharge at these depths the presence of a small portion of fine roots below 0 6 m depth and the relatively high soil water content at 0 6 0 8 m depth justifies the hypothesis that part of tree water might derive from the groundwater table we found a rather high variability of labeled soil water values among different irrigation plots figs 3 and 4 which might be due to the soil sampling procedure single soil core at each sampling and to an uneven soil infiltration pattern clothier et al 2007 gazis and feng 2004 zhang et al 2018 the effect of this variability was also propagated to the results of the mixing models that we applied to estimate the fraction of soil water absorbed by the trees and present in the shoots indeed results obtained applying the mixing models eqs 6 and 7 showed a rather high variability considering the independent experimental units while the goodness of the model itself was rather high as indicated by the low estimated uncertainty fig 7 this means that our estimations suffered more from soil spatial heterogeneity rather than from analytical factors related to isotope ratio measurements beyer and penna 2021 a key point of soil water studies is the choice of soil water recovering techniques to collect a water pool that is representative of the soil water bioavailable for root uptake as reported in numerous studies di bonito et al 2008 orlowski et al 2016a 2016b soil water extraction represents a critical step of the procedure applying different techniques often involves a different water extraction capacity affected also by the soil type orlowski et al 2016b tsuruta et al 2019 cryogenic extraction allows the recovery of the whole amount of water present in the soil only a fraction of this water can be effectively absorbed by roots depending on the potential gradient applied by plants with water held by the soil at low potentials being inaccessible for plants moreover interactions between mobile bound and tightly bound water in soil are difficult to quantify and variable depending on soil physical properties adams et al 2020 sprenger et al 2019 thielemann et al 2019 vargas et al 2017 based on soil water isotopic composition 2 h after irrigation most of the water was found in the first 0 2 m of soil in the following days irrigation water penetrated to deeper soil layers to a maximum of 0 6 m depth supplementary fig s2 and s3 and mixed with pre irrigation soil water such mixing occurred with different intensities along the profile but no significant enrichment was measured below 0 6 m depth fig 4 despite water movements between topsoil and deeper layers irrigation water represented ca 12 18 of the total soil water present to 0 6 m depth during the experimental period fig 4 and supplementary fig s3 considering that no more water was added to the experimental units after the irrigation with 2h enriched water and that the soil cover prevented evaporation from the surface a stable condition was established in the soil tree system during the field experiment 4 2 water uptake dynamics by field grown apple trees soil and leaf water content suggests an adequate water availability for tree requirement in both the irrigated and the control plots during experiment 1 the summer climate at this alpine site is also relatively mild with et0 values not particularly high supplementary table s1 compared to apple production areas at lower elevation in the same region montagnani et al 2018 zanotelli et al 2019 2022 analyzing the tree water isotopic composition we were able to delineate more precisely the dynamics of water uptake trees were irrigated at 9 am on a sunny summer day when tree transpiration was already ongoing as reported in fig 5 a slight increase in the water δ 2h compared to the control trees extracted both from shoot axes and the leaves was already visible after 2 h but it was more evident at the 4 h sampling indicating a rapid uptake of the irrigation water soon after its distribution the fact that fine root density was highest in the upper 0 0 2 m soil layer might have contributed to the rapid uptake of labeled water the time lag between the irrigation water supply and the presence of irrigation water in the tree transpiring organs is of practical importance in irrigation management although irrigation water might only represent a relatively low fraction of total leaf water its rapid transport from roots to the leaves could allow the recovery from drought stress conditions within the first sampling day shoot isotopic composition continued to increase showing a progressively higher contribution of irrigation water to shoot water fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 following the transpiration driven root water uptake interestingly shoot isotopic composition reached a plateau and remained rather constant from 24 h after irrigation to the end of the experiment without showing any additional significant increase in both leaves and shoot axes in the following six days except for leaves at 72 h from irrigation the low isotopic composition of leaf samples at this sampling point might have been determined by the low transpiration rate registered on that day farquhar et al 2007 gan et al 2002 sheshshayee et al 2005 additionally the night before this sampling trees were irrigated by an overhead sprinkler roughly 20 mm we hypothesized that part of the irrigation water δ 2h 98 8 fallen on the leaf surface might have been absorbed foliar water uptake berry et al 2019 schreel and steppe 2020 determining a decrease in the leaf isotopic composition similarly to what was observed in the field experiment the 2h abundance in potted trees sharply increased from 8 am to 12 pm but then it tended to level off at the two successive sampling occasions following a trend similar to transpiration rate fig 8 seeger and weiler 2021 who collected xylem sap at different heights from the stem of 90 100 year old fagus sylvatica l trees after the application of labeled water to the soil also found that tree isotopic composition gradually increased until reaching a plateau approximately 6 14 days after water distribution such a delay with respect to our experiment might be explained by the different size of the trees both shoot axes and leaves were characterized by a significantly lower isotopic composition with maximum δ value around 50 60 compared to that of soil water the estimated fraction of irrigation water present in the shoot axes and leaves was 7 8 0 4 and 3 3 0 5 of the total water respectively applying eqs 6 and 7 we estimated that the maximum contribution of the water taken from the 2h enriched soil layer 0 0 6 m depth to total plant water was 48 3 and 26 2 in shoot axes and leaves respectively fig 7 based on these results a significant water fraction did not derive from the soil layer where irrigation water had infiltrated similar results were obtained by rowland et al 2008 who applied 2h enriched irrigation water to evaluate water use in a peanut cultivation applying a two component mixing model they calculated that the fraction of irrigation water present in the peanut stem collected through cvd was ca 40 but they did not discuss the origin of the remaining water fraction 4 3 origin of the shoot water to explain the limited fraction of shoot water deriving from the 0 0 6 m soil depth during the experimental period we put forward two possible explanations 1 trees absorbed a significant amount of water in the deeper soil layer 0 6 0 8 m depth that had not been significantly enriched by labeled water 2 a significant fraction of the cryogenically extracted shoot water was already present before the starting of the experiment pre event water and it mixed at very low rates with the recently absorbed labeled water the first explanation would be plausible if a large part of the root system developed below 0 6 m depth as it happens when vigorous apple rootstocks are used song et al 2018 in our experiment however trees were grafted on the dwarfing m9 rootstock and most of the roots were located in the 0 0 6 m soil layer as reported for this apple orchard by penna et al 2021 measuring the water stable isotopic composition these authors showed that the tree isotopic composition partially overlapped with the isotopic composition of the topsoil 0 25 m depth which was significantly different from that of groundwater suggesting a negligible contribution of the latter the results of experiment 2 shed additional light on the low likelihood of the first possible explanation experiment 2 was designed to create a simplified model under pot conditions where the sources of tree water were only two namely the water already present in the shoots before starting the experiment and the soil water as the contribution of soil water uptake to total water in both the shoot axes and leaves was similar in the two experiments we speculate that the water uptake from the deepest soil layers 0 6 m depth did not account for a significant fraction of shoot water that was not derived from the 0 0 6 m soil layer we cannot however rule out the possibility that the capillary rise contributed to the transport of some water from the water table to the deepest part of the 0 0 6 m soil layer to be able to quantify this process groundwater should be labeled which is challenging under field conditions a major flux of water due to capillary rise however would have caused a decrease in the shoot isotopic composition over time which was not observed figs 3 and 5 according to the second possible explanation our results could be explained considering that a significant fraction of the cryogenically extracted shoot water was not ascribable to recently root absorbed water this explanation is plausible if it is assumed that to a certain extent water is compartmentalized within tree organs cernusak et al 2016 zwieniecki et al 2007 to support this explanation the mechanisms of water transport and distribution within plants need to be examined it is reasonable to assume that water moves inside the tree mainly through an apoplastic pathway even though transcellular and symplastic movements are also plausible and the extent of each mechanism may vary according to several factors including plant species sack and holbrook 2006 in experiment 1 the shoot axes collected at 9 am contained an amount of water similar to its dry weight 56 7 fw part of that water might have been contained in the xylem vessels while it is reasonable to assume that another water fraction was present in the other secondary xylem tissues namely the fibers the fiber tracheids and the ray parenchyma as well as in the cambium the secondary phloem and the bark pratt 1990 in the leaves the main xylem vessels split into progressively smaller veins embedded in leaf mesophyll water movements along pathways outside the veins are rather complicated and still partially unknown barbour et al 2017 similarly a precise identification of the position of evaporation sites is difficult although most of the evaporation processes occur at the intercellular spaces with the resulting water vapor diffusing to the atmosphere through the stomata cronquist 1971 in experiment 1 the leaf collected at 9 am water content was 65 of the leaf fresh weight and it is likely that most of the water was present in the veins the palisade cells and the spongy mesophyll with the latter two tissues accounting for most of the apple leaf volume pratt 1990 if an equilibrium process existed in the soil between pre event and recently absorbed water considering the potential evapotranspiration during the experimental period of the field experiment in the range of ca 7 l day 1 tree 1 we would have observed a gradual increase in the isotopic composition of shoots from day 1 to day 7 with a final isotopic composition close to that of soil water at 0 0 6 m depth since this was not observed we speculate that in the short period apple trees featuring no water stress dis did not significantly exchange and mix pre event and recently absorbed water neither in the shoot axes nor in the leaves in light of this explanation the fact that the total water content of leaves was around 9 higher than that of shoot axes could explain the lower δ 2h values found in the leaves as compared to the shoot axes to which extent water mixing processes within tree organs depends on the fact that trees did not suffer limitations in water supply and were not exposed to a high evaporative demand deserves further investigation this study represents a first attempt to trace irrigation water in an apple orchard and to quantify the contribution of irrigation water to tree water during the summer season we are aware that factors such as the local soil texture climate as well the type of irrigation system make our results site specific and thus further studies in different settings are needed before our conclusions can be generalized to other apple orchards 5 conclusions the two labeling experiments with 2h enriched water under field and pot conditions shed light on the fate of the irrigation water in the soil and the apple tree in an alpine orchard as expected most of the irrigation water was present in the 0 0 2 m soil layers but the labeled water also infiltrated until 0 6 m depth the uptake of irrigation water by apple trees in the field was rather rapid as indicated by the presence of labeled water in the shoots at 1 5 2 5 m height already after 2 4 h after the water supply the presence of a superficial root system might explain the rapid uptake of labeled water the contribution of irrigation water to shoot water increased during the first day after the irrigation but then leveled off reaching a maximum of 7 8 and 3 3 in shoot axes and leaves respectively such low values are not surprising considering the large water pool in the soil and the fact that irrigation water mixed with pre event soil water considering that the labeled water was localized in the 0 0 6 m soil layer where also around 90 of the fine roots were present we estimated that at the end of the experiment shoot axes and leaves contained on average 48 3 and 26 2 of labeled water taken up from such a layer respectively as indicated by the ancillary pot experiment a significant fraction of the cryogenically extracted shoot water was already present before the starting of the experiment and it mixed at very low rates with the recently absorbed labeled water probably due to the combination of low transpiration rates and the presence of highly available soil water it is unlikely that the water fraction unaccounted by the water uptake from the 0 0 6 m soil layer largely derived from unlabeled water taken up by the roots in the deepest soil layer 0 6 m although the capillary rise from the shallow water table could have contributed to the soil moisture at the bottom of the 0 0 6 m soil layer in light of our results it is evident that water mixing processes at the soil and tree level are still not fully understood this knowledge gap affects the ability to elaborate appropriate eco hydrological models useful both for environmental studies and a sustainable irrigation management funding this work was supported by the department of innovation research and

9547,the objective of this study was to investigate and unravel the mechanisms for the impact of soil water regimes and n application rates on growth physiological responses phytohormone signaling water use efficiency wue and nitrogen recovery efficiency nre of crassulacean acid metabolism cam plant pineapple the experimental treatments included three soil water regimes 90 70 and 50 of soil water holding capacity representing well watered mildly and moderately water stressed conditions and n application rates 109 218 and 473 mg kg 1 soil results showed that the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the shoot dry biomass by 70 7 110 9 and the plant water use by 25 7 30 4 consequently the plant wue was significantly improved compared to the moderately water stressed treatment the specific leaf n content was significantly and positively correlated with plant carbon c accumulation that was increased by 66 9 89 9 implying that the enhanced specific leaf n content in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments could have facilitated the carbon fixation thus increased the shoot biomass accumulation moreover the well watered and mildly water stress treatments significantly increased leaf δ18o indicating the significantly higher transpiration in line with the markedly increased plant water use due to both the large leaf water concentration and the characteristic diel pattern of stomatal conductance associated with cam the enhanced leaf δ13c and plant wue in the well watered and mildly water stress treatments were ascribed to the enhanced specific leaf n content and the improved leaf relative water content the moderately water stressed treatment decreased leaf and root water potential while significantly intensified root endogenous aba due to water deficit the zr iaa and ga3 in the leaves and roots interacted complicatedly with water and n rates the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments enhanced ability of the roots to absorb water and nutrients from the soil resulting in the significantly higher n and 15n accumulation conclusively in the production of ananas comosus maintaining high soil water supply

pineapple ananas comosus l merril is by far the world s most valuable commercial tropical fruit crop with an annual world production of 28 3 million metric tons of fruits grown in many tropical and subtropical countries food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2018 yet pineapple production is constrained by several factors including the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall variations under rain fed conditions particularly during the vegetative and yield formation stages which considerably reduces fruit productivity azevedo et al 2007 carr 2012 williams et al 2017 though the crops are able to cope with seasonal variations in weather such as rainfall due to their ability to assimilate carbon dioxide co2 via the crassulacean acid metabolism pathway cam josé et al 2007 previous studies have shown that supplemental irrigation is essential to ensure continued optimal pineapple production and quality under the future climate variability carr 2012 williams et al 2017 a significant increase in fruit and or biomass yield of cam species such as kalanchoe daigremontiana opuntia spp agave americana and ananas comosus can be achieved through improved irrigation management widmann et al 1990 davis et al 2017 fox 2019 neupane et al 2021 a better soil water condition can increase leaf conductance co2 assimilation and titratable acidity of cam plants widmann et al 1990 in contrast gomes et al 2019 observed that the fresh and dry biomass of aechmea fasciata was not significant affected by different water regimes therefore a better understanding of soil water impact on pineapple growth and nutrient uptake is still needed for sustainable production of pineapple nitrogen n is one of the most demanded macronutrients by cam plants and plays an important role in determining fruit weight and productivity rodrigues et al 2014 darnaudery et al 2018 maia et al 2020 previous studies reported that the fruit production of pineapple increased significantly with elevated n levels under both irrigated and unirrigated conditions rao et al 1977 widmann et al 1990 found that the biomass of cam plant species kalanchoe daigremontiana and k tubiflora increased more than 70 in high n treatment compared with low n treatment under sufficient water supply moreover in cam of ananas comosus the net dark co2 uptake and photosynthetic capacity were higher under sufficient n treatment borland and griffiths 1989 however fox 2019 reported that for cam of a americana the n application rates didn t affect biomass accumulation in the first year of growth therefore a large deficit in the impact of n levels on the growth and physiology of cam plant pineapple in interaction with soil water regimes still exists abscisic acid aba cytokinin auxin iaa and gibberellic acid ga3 have been reported to be involved in mediating plant defense response of cam plants against abiotic stress dai et al 1994 taybi et al 1995 2002 taybi and cushman 2002 freschi and mercier 2012 it is well known that soil water deficit triggers endogenous aba synthesis that acts as a stimulatory signal for cam expression taybi et al 2002 in young pineapple the aba concentration of leaves increased significantly under peg stressed condition which preceded the upregulation of cam expression freschi et al 2010 moreover in cam plants m crystallinum and k blossfeldiana exogenous aba triggered increases in cam activity either when applied to intact plants chu et al 1990 dai et al 1994 taybi et al 1995 or directly supplied to detached leaves taybi et al 1995 taybi and cushman 2002 however there are only limited studies on the variations of other phytohormones under drought stress of cam plants freschi et al 2010 found that the zr and iaa concentrations of young pineapple leaves significantly decreased under water deficit differently thomas et al 1992 reported that the cytokinin levels in leaves of m crystallinum were not changed under water stress the foliar applied ga3 to m crystallinum plants induced only a small increase in pepc activity and cam expression guralnick et al 2001 while there showed no observable cam induction when ga3 fed through the roots dai et al 1994 in addition to drought stress n nutrition can also affect phytohormones in cam plants tamaki and mercier 2007 observed that iaa content in the leaf increased in the n deficient pineapple plants while the zr content accumulated in the n sufficient treatment the impact of soil water and n coupling on phytohormonal responses of cam expression in pineapple remains unknown leaf carbon isotope composition δ13c is an indicator of long term intercellular co2 concentration which could provide a time integrated measurement of plant wue lerman et al 1974 farquhar and richards 1984 farquhar et al 1989 widmann and ziegler 1993 for cam plants δ13c can also be used to estimate both wue and the proportion of co2 gained during the light and the dark integrated over the lifetime of the tissues o leary 1988 griffiths 1992 winter and holtum 2002 winter et al 2005 previous studies have shown that the δ13c value of cam plants was less negative under drought condition bender et al 1973 widmann and ziegler 1993 in addition oxygen isotopic composition δ18o of cam plants is influenced by changes in transpiration rate and stomatal conductance as there is no further discrimination for the element during photosynthesis cernusak et al 2008 therefore the analysis of δ18o in the tissues of cam plants could provide an additional tool for studying water stress of cam sternberg et al 1986 helliker and griffiths 2007 reyes garcía et al 2008 coupled application of water and n has a great potential for efficient utilization of water and fertilizers yet the underlying physiological mechanisms for plant productivity and wue under water and n coupling in cam plant pineapple are still largely elusive therefore the objective of the present study was to investigate the physiological responses and plant hormone modulation of pineapple in response to soil water and n supplies and to explore the mechanisms regulating plant growth and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup the pot

mixed thoroughly with the soil before filling the pots soil water regimes were controlled by weighing method plant water use evapotranspiration et was computed by the water balance method et i θ h where i is the total amount of irrigation water liters during the treatment period θ h is the amount of soil water stored in the pots at harvest there was no leakage during the experiment period and air dried soil was used at the beginning of the experiment the evapotranspiration rate was calculated by the daily plant water use the pineapple plants were well watered in the first 80 days after planting in order to start the vegetative growth stage and then the treatments were initiated the pots were weighed by using a high precision electronic balance ocs f shanghai yousheng weighing apparatus co ltd china the pots were irrigated to predefined pot weights every second or third day to replenish the transpirational water loss in the previous days during the treatment period the water used for the irrigation was tap water with negligible concentrations of nutrients the treatments lasted 230 days 2 3 sampling measurements and analyses plants were harvested on 230 days after onset of the fertigation treatment dat plant samples were divided into leaves aerial stem underground stem and roots the leaf area was measured with a laser area meter model ci 203 cid bio science wa

to determine the relationships between the measured parameters 3 results 3 1 soil water and crop evapotranspiration dynamics daily average soil water content differed significantly among the water treatments fig 1a in the well watered treatment soil water contents remained around 35 during the treatment period soil water contents were kept around 27 and 19 in the mildly and moderately water stressed treatments respectively during the treatment period the average daily crop evapotranspiration rate reduced continuously with the decreasing soil water levels fig 1b the daily evapotranspiration rate ranged from 0 96 to 4 23 mm day 1 from 0 85 to 3 80 mm day 1 and from 0 46 to 2 80 mm day 1 under the well watered mildly water stressed and moderately water stressed treatments respectively 3 2 leaf relative water content leaf and root water potential the lrwc increased with the elevated soil water contents across the n treatments while it decreased with the increase of n rates across the water treatments fig 2a the leaf water potential lwp was significantly decreased under the moderately water stressed treatment w50 fig 2b root water potential rwp was significantly decreased by reduced soil water content across the n treatments however it increased under the n4 and n8 treatments compared with the n2 treatment fig 2c 3 3 plant hormone concentrations across the n treatments iaa leaf zr leaf and ga3 leaf increased significantly with the increase of soil water regimes however aba leaf was similar under different soil water treatments table 1 the analysis across the soil water regimes showed that aba leaf and iaa leaf in the n8 treatment were significantly higher than those in the n2 treatment while the zr leaf and ga3 leaf were not affected by n treatments across the n treatments aba root was highest in the moderately water stressed treatment intermediate in the mildly water stressed treatment and lowest in the well watered treatment table 1 ga3 root and iaa root were higher in the moderately water stressed treatment compared with the well watered treatment while zr root was significantly higher in the well watered and moderately water stressed treatments than in the mildly water stressed treatment analysis across the soil water regimes showed that aba root and zr root were highest in the n4 treatment intermediate in the n2 treatment and lowest in n8 treatment while the ga3 root showed the opposite tendency iaa root was not affected by the n dose aba root was negatively and significantly correlated with the rwp fig 3 3 4 leaf area shoot dry biomass plant water use water use efficiency leaf δ13c and δ18o analysis across the n rates showed that the leaf area shoot dry biomass plant water use and wue increased with the elevated soil water regimes table 2 the wue in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments were significantly increased by 61 6 and 35 9 than that under the moderately water stressed treatment the well watered and mildly water stressed treatment produced 110 9 and 70 7 more shoot dry biomass compared to the moderately water stressed treatment across the water treatments plant water use was highest in the n8 treatment intermediate in the n4 treatment and lowest in the n2 treatment table 2 however the leaf area shoot dry biomass and wue were not affected by n treatments as well as the interaction between soil water and n levels table 2 when analyzed across the water treatments the leaf δ13c was highest in the n2 treatment intermediate in the n4 treatment and lowest in the n8 treatment the leaf δ18o was similar among the n treatments there was a significant positive liner relationship between leaf δ13c and wue fig 4a no relationship existed between leaf δ13c and δ18o fig 4b 3 5 plant n concentration n and 15n accumulation across the n treatments the n concentration in the leaf and aerial stem of pineapple were higher under the high soil water and mildly water stressed treatments than those under the moderately water stressed treatment table 3 however the n concentration in the roots increased under the moderately water stressed treatment compared with other soil water treatments analysis across the water treatments showed that n concentration in the leaf aerial stem rhizome and root of pineapple were highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment table 3 across the n treatments n and 15n accumulation in the leaf aerial stem root and whole plant were highest in the well watered treatment followed by the mildly water stress treatment and lowest in the moderately water stressed treatment compared with the moderately water stressed treatment the n and 15n accumulation of total plant under the mildly water stress and well watered treatments were significantly increased by 100 0 148 1 213 3 and 313 8 respectively analysis across the water treatments showed that n and 15n accumulation in the leaf aerial stem rhizome and whole plant were highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment the n accumulation of total plant under the n8 and n4 treatments increased by 63 6 and 30 0 than did n2 plants similarly the 15n accumulation in the total plant was significantly increased with increasing n application rates by 190 6 and 83 3 in the n8 and n4 treatments compared with the n2 treatment table 3 3 6 sources of plant n uptake and fate of 15n in the pineapple soil system across the n treatments the plant n derived from 15n labelled fertilizer ndff in different organs of pineapple were significantly increased with the improved soil water levels table 4 approximately 30 1 50 2 of plant n accumulation was derived from 15n labelled fertilizer analysis across the water treatments showed that the percentage of plant n derived from 15n labelled fertilizer in different organs of pineapple was highest in the n8 treatment intermediate in the n4 treatment and lowest in the n2 treatment across the n treatments the percentage of plant n derived from soil in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments were lower than that in the moderately water stressed treatment table 4 however the quantity of n taken up from the soil was significantly elevated with the increased soil water regimes across the water treatments the percentage of plant n derived from soil decreased significantly with the increased n dose while the quantity of plant n derived from soil was similar among the n treatments the 15n recovery in pineapple increased significantly with the increased water regimes across the n treatments whereas it decreased significantly with the increased n dose across the water treatments table 5 the 15n residual in the soil was only significantly affected by the n treatments across the water treatments the potential loss of 15n fertilizer was higher in the moderately water stressed treatment than other two water treatments across the n treatments 3 7 plant c accumulation and specific leaf n content when analyzed across the n treatments the plant c accumulation was highest in the well watered treatment intermediate in the mildly water stressed treatment and lowest in the moderately water stressed treatment across the water treatments the plant c accumulation was higher under the n4 and n8 treatments than the n2 treatment fig 5a across the n treatments the mildly and moderately water stressed treatments had similar specific leaf n content which was lower than that under the high soil water treatment analysis across the water treatments showed that the specific leaf n content was higher in the high and medium n treatments than that in the low n treatment fig 5b there was a significant positive linear correlation between plant c accumulation and specific leaf n content fig 6 4 discussion previous studies mainly focused on the impact of water deficiency on cam activity the mechanisms underlying the impact of soil water and n regimes on cam plant pineapple are still unknown therefore the plant biomass accumulation plant water relations phytohormone signaling wue and n uptake as well as leaf δ13c and δ18o as affected by soil water and n regimes were investigated in order to unravel how water and n modulated pineapple wue and nutrient uptake in the present study across the n treatments the larger increase in dry biomass relative to plant water use resulted in the significantly enhanced wue by 61 6 and 35 9 in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments compared to the moderately water stressed treatment table 2 leaf δ13c was measured to indicate the long term time integrated wue it was found that the leaf δ13c of pineapple was significantly and positively correlated with the wue fig 4a and this was in good agreement with previous studies on cam plant species winter et al 2005 the significantly higher leaf δ13c and wue of pineapple grown under well watered and mildly water stressed conditions compared to the moderately water stressed treatment were observed table 2 previous studies have shown that drought or high n supply increased δ13c of cam plants as the activity of pepcase was essentially higher at night in comparison with the activity of rubisco at day bender et al 1973 widmann and ziegler 1993 in the current study the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments enhanced the specific leaf n content which could enhance the activity of pepcase at night thus increased the leaf δ13c of pineapple in these treatments the improvement of leaf δ13c along with increased specific leaf n content has also been observed by wang et al 2010 2018 moreover the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the lrwc and this could improve the vacuolar malate storage capacity in the pineapple leaf and the proportions of co2 derived during the dark töpfer et al 2020 for cam plants δ13c value varies depending on the long time ratio of co2 fixed at night via c4 pathway by phosphoenolpyruvate pep carboxylase and co2 fixed at day directly via c3 pathway by ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase rubisco during each phase of cam bender et al 1973 osmond 1978 the enzyme pep carboxylase discriminates against 13c to a lesser extent than rubisco therefore the improved proportions of co2 derived during the dark in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments could have improved the δ13c value of cam plants winter and holtum 2002 winter et al 2005 the analysis of δ18o in the tissues of cam plants could provide an additional tool for studying environmental regulation on cam sternberg et al 1986 helliker and griffiths 2007 reyes garcía et al 2008 the variations of leaf δ18o could indicate the environmental constraints on transpiration and stomatal conductance of plants during the experimental period craig and gordon 1965 helliker and griffiths 2007 cernusak et al 2008 previous studies have reported the positive relationship between transpiration and δ18o of leaf organic materials gan et al 2002 sheshshayee et al 2005 cernusak et al 2007 2008 in the present study the leaf δ18o was significantly higher under the well watered and mildly water stress treatments than the moderately water stress treatment indicating that the improved soil water regime significantly enhanced the transpirational water loss as verified by the markedly increased plant water use table 2 the leaf δ18o enrichment of the well watered and mildly water stress treatments could be due to the combination of large leaf water concentration and the characteristic diel pattern of stomatal conductance associated with cam cernusak et al 2008 the higher relative leaf water content under the well watered and mildly water stress treatments than that under the moderately water stressed treatment could result in longer leaf water residence time thus increasing the leaf δ18o enrichment in addition the higher relative leaf water content of the pineapple plant can also indicate the increased ratio of plant conductance stomatal and boundary layer conductance to water loss helliker 2011 which could also increase the leaf δ18o enrichment phytohormone signaling events underlying the conversion of environmental signals such as water and n availability into changes in the expression and operation of the cam have already been identified taybi et al 2002 freschi et al 2012 previous studies have shown that drought stress could trigger endogenous aba accumulation in leaf tissues of cam plants such as young pineapple ananas comosus freschi et al 2010 kalanchoë blossfeldiana taybi et al 1995 and m crystallinum thomas et al 1992 in the current study the decreased rwp lwp and lrwc fig 2 as well as the significantly intensified root endogenous aba were observed due to the reduced soil and root water status table 1 fig 3 the severe soil water deficit under the moderately water stressed treatment for pineapple could have decreased the transport of root sourced aba to the above ground plants due to reduced water transport causing the similar aba concentration in the shoot of the moderately water stressed treatment table 1 cytokinins cks are also known to participate in the water stress induced upregulation of cam in young pineapple plants freschi et al 2010 studies on several cam plants including m crystallinum and a comosus have demonstrated that endogenous cks in the leaf decreased considerably during the water stress induced upregulation of cam peters et al 1997 freschi et al 2010 in the present study the zr type cks concentration of pineapple leaves decreased under drought stress treatments table 1 indicating that endogenous cks probably act as negative signals responsible for regulating cam expression in leaves of pineapple plants previous studies have shown that foliar applied ga3 to m crystallinum plants induced only a small increase in pepc activity and cam expression guralnick et al 2001 while there showed no observable cam induction when ga3 fed through the roots dai et al 1994 for cam plant pineapple significantly higher ga3 leaf and iaa leaf were observed in pineapple leaves under the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments table 1 while the iaa root and ga3 root were significant lower in the well watered treatment in contrast freschi et al 2010 observed that pineapple plants challenged with changes in water availability showed no marked oscillations in iaa leaf during either the upregulation or the attenuation of cam expression therefore the interactions between phytohormonal signaling water and n stress and cam plant growth still merit further studies it is widely accepted that a higher leaf n content is usually associated with higher photosynthetic capacity in the present study the specific leaf n content was significantly decreased by the moderately water stressed treatment fig 5b indicating the notably reduced photosynthetic capacity of leaves in the treatment even though the shoot dry biomass and leaf area was significantly higher in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments than the moderately water stressed treatment table 2 the specific leaf n content and n concentration were not reduced by the dilution effect and this implied that the sufficient soil water supply enhanced the ability of the roots to uptake water and fertilizer n from the soil table 4 resulting in the significantly higher n and 15n accumulation and fertilizer n use efficiency tables 3 and 5 the specific leaf n content was significantly and positively correlated with plant c accumulation fig 6 implying that the enhanced specific leaf n content could have facilitated the carbon fixation in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments fig 5a in consequence the improved n nutrition in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the shoot biomass accumulation compared with the moderately water stressed treatment table 2 5 conclusions the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the shoot dry biomass more pronouncedly than the plant water use resulting in the significantly improved plant water use efficiency wue in these treatments compared to the moderately water stressed treatment the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments improved the specific leaf n content that facilitated the carbon fixation thus increased the shoot biomass accumulation the enhanced leaf δ13c and plant wue in these treatments were ascribed to the enhanced specific leaf n content that could enhance the activity of pepcase at night and the improved leaf relative water content lrwc which could improve the vacuolar malate storage capacity in the pineapple leaf and the proportions of co2 derived during the dark moreover the well watered and mildly water stress treatments significantly increased leaf δ18o than the moderately water stress treatment indicating the significantly higher transpiration in line with the markedly increased plant water use in these treatments due to the combination of large leaf water concentration and the characteristic diel pattern of stomatal conductance associated with cam the n concentration was not reduced by the dilution effect implying the enhanced ability of the roots to uptake water and nutrients from the soil for pineapple resulting in the significantly higher n and 15n accumulation in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments compared with moderately water stressed treatment conclusively in the production of the cam plant ananas comosus maintaining high soil water content is recommended to achieve improved growth water and fertilizer n utilization the results

water use efficiency wue and nitrogen recovery efficiency nre of crassulacean acid metabolism cam plant pineapple the experimental treatments included three soil water regimes 90 70 and 50 of soil water holding capacity representing well watered mildly and moderately water stressed conditions and n application rates 109 218 and 473 mg kg 1 soil results showed that the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the shoot dry biomass by 70 7 110 9 and the plant water use by 25 7 30 4 consequently the plant wue was significantly improved compared to the moderately water stressed treatment the specific leaf n content was significantly and positively correlated with plant carbon c accumulation that was increased by 66 9 89 9 implying that the enhanced specific leaf n content in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments could have facilitated the carbon fixation thus increased the shoot biomass accumulation moreover the well watered and mildly water stress treatments significantly increased leaf δ18o indicating the significantly higher transpiration in line with the markedly increased plant water use due to both the large leaf water concentration and the characteristic diel pattern of stomatal conductance associated with cam the enhanced leaf δ13c and plant wue in the well watered and mildly water stress treatments were ascribed to the enhanced specific leaf n content and the improved leaf relative water content the moderately water stressed treatment decreased leaf and root water potential while significantly intensified root endogenous aba due to water deficit the zr iaa and ga3 in the leaves and roots interacted complicatedly with water and n rates the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments enhanced ability of the roots to absorb water and nutrients from the soil resulting in the significantly higher n and 15n accumulation conclusively in the production of ananas comosus maintaining high soil water supply

pineapple ananas comosus l merril is by far the world s most valuable commercial tropical fruit crop with an annual world production of 28 3 million metric tons of fruits grown in many tropical and subtropical countries food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2018 yet pineapple production is constrained by several factors including the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall variations under rain fed conditions particularly during the vegetative and yield formation stages which considerably reduces fruit productivity azevedo et al 2007 carr 2012 williams et al 2017 though the crops are able to cope with seasonal variations in weather such as rainfall due to their ability to assimilate carbon dioxide co2 via the crassulacean acid metabolism pathway cam josé et al 2007 previous studies have shown that supplemental irrigation is essential to ensure continued optimal pineapple production and quality under the future climate variability carr 2012 williams et al 2017 a significant increase in fruit and or biomass yield of cam species such as kalanchoe daigremontiana opuntia spp agave americana and ananas comosus can be achieved through improved irrigation management widmann et al 1990 davis et al 2017 fox 2019 neupane et al 2021 a better soil water condition can increase leaf conductance co2 assimilation and titratable acidity of cam plants widmann et al 1990 in contrast gomes et al 2019 observed that the fresh and dry biomass of aechmea fasciata was not significant affected by different water regimes therefore a better understanding of soil water impact on pineapple growth and nutrient uptake is still needed for sustainable production of pineapple nitrogen n is one of the most demanded macronutrients by cam plants and plays an important role in determining fruit weight and productivity rodrigues et al 2014 darnaudery et al 2018 maia et al 2020 previous studies reported that the fruit production of pineapple increased significantly with elevated n levels under both irrigated and unirrigated conditions rao et al 1977 widmann et al 1990 found that the biomass of cam plant species kalanchoe daigremontiana and k tubiflora increased more than 70 in high n treatment compared with low n treatment under sufficient water supply moreover in cam of ananas comosus the net dark co2 uptake and photosynthetic capacity were higher under sufficient n treatment borland and griffiths 1989 however fox 2019 reported that for cam of a americana the n application rates didn t affect biomass accumulation in the first year of growth therefore a large deficit in the impact of n levels on the growth and physiology of cam plant pineapple in interaction with soil water regimes still exists abscisic acid aba cytokinin auxin iaa and gibberellic acid ga3 have been reported to be involved in mediating plant defense response of cam plants against abiotic stress dai et al 1994 taybi et al 1995 2002 taybi and cushman 2002 freschi and mercier 2012 it is well known that soil water deficit triggers endogenous aba synthesis that acts as a stimulatory signal for cam expression taybi et al 2002 in young pineapple the aba concentration of leaves increased significantly under peg stressed condition which preceded the upregulation of cam expression freschi et al 2010 moreover in cam plants m crystallinum and k blossfeldiana exogenous aba triggered increases in cam activity either when applied to intact plants chu et al 1990 dai et al 1994 taybi et al 1995 or directly supplied to detached leaves taybi et al 1995 taybi and cushman 2002 however there are only limited studies on the variations of other phytohormones under drought stress of cam plants freschi et al 2010 found that the zr and iaa concentrations of young pineapple leaves significantly decreased under water deficit differently thomas et al 1992 reported that the cytokinin levels in leaves of m crystallinum were not changed under water stress the foliar applied ga3 to m crystallinum plants induced only a small increase in pepc activity and cam expression guralnick et al 2001 while there showed no observable cam induction when ga3 fed through the roots dai et al 1994 in addition to drought stress n nutrition can also affect phytohormones in cam plants tamaki and mercier 2007 observed that iaa content in the leaf increased in the n deficient pineapple plants while the zr content accumulated in the n sufficient treatment the impact of soil water and n coupling on phytohormonal responses of cam expression in pineapple remains unknown leaf carbon isotope composition δ13c is an indicator of long term intercellular co2 concentration which could provide a time integrated measurement of plant wue lerman et al 1974 farquhar and richards 1984 farquhar et al 1989 widmann and ziegler 1993 for cam plants δ13c can also be used to estimate both wue and the proportion of co2 gained during the light and the dark integrated over the lifetime of the tissues o leary 1988 griffiths 1992 winter and holtum 2002 winter et al 2005 previous studies have shown that the δ13c value of cam plants was less negative under drought condition bender et al 1973 widmann and ziegler 1993 in addition oxygen isotopic composition δ18o of cam plants is influenced by changes in transpiration rate and stomatal conductance as there is no further discrimination for the element during photosynthesis cernusak et al 2008 therefore the analysis of δ18o in the tissues of cam plants could provide an additional tool for studying water stress of cam sternberg et al 1986 helliker and griffiths 2007 reyes garcía et al 2008 coupled application of water and n has a great potential for efficient utilization of water and fertilizers yet the underlying physiological mechanisms for plant productivity and wue under water and n coupling in cam plant pineapple are still largely elusive therefore the objective of the present study was to investigate the physiological responses and plant hormone modulation of pineapple in response to soil water and n supplies and to explore the mechanisms regulating plant growth and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup the pot

mixed thoroughly with the soil before filling the pots soil water regimes were controlled by weighing method plant water use evapotranspiration et was computed by the water balance method et i θ h where i is the total amount of irrigation water liters during the treatment period θ h is the amount of soil water stored in the pots at harvest there was no leakage during the experiment period and air dried soil was used at the beginning of the experiment the evapotranspiration rate was calculated by the daily plant water use the pineapple plants were well watered in the first 80 days after planting in order to start the vegetative growth stage and then the treatments were initiated the pots were weighed by using a high precision electronic balance ocs f shanghai yousheng weighing apparatus co ltd china the pots were irrigated to predefined pot weights every second or third day to replenish the transpirational water loss in the previous days during the treatment period the water used for the irrigation was tap water with negligible concentrations of nutrients the treatments lasted 230 days 2 3 sampling measurements and analyses plants were harvested on 230 days after onset of the fertigation treatment dat plant samples were divided into leaves aerial stem underground stem and roots the leaf area was measured with a laser area meter model ci 203 cid bio science wa

to determine the relationships between the measured parameters 3 results 3 1 soil water and crop evapotranspiration dynamics daily average soil water content differed significantly among the water treatments fig 1a in the well watered treatment soil water contents remained around 35 during the treatment period soil water contents were kept around 27 and 19 in the mildly and moderately water stressed treatments respectively during the treatment period the average daily crop evapotranspiration rate reduced continuously with the decreasing soil water levels fig 1b the daily evapotranspiration rate ranged from 0 96 to 4 23 mm day 1 from 0 85 to 3 80 mm day 1 and from 0 46 to 2 80 mm day 1 under the well watered mildly water stressed and moderately water stressed treatments respectively 3 2 leaf relative water content leaf and root water potential the lrwc increased with the elevated soil water contents across the n treatments while it decreased with the increase of n rates across the water treatments fig 2a the leaf water potential lwp was significantly decreased under the moderately water stressed treatment w50 fig 2b root water potential rwp was significantly decreased by reduced soil water content across the n treatments however it increased under the n4 and n8 treatments compared with the n2 treatment fig 2c 3 3 plant hormone concentrations across the n treatments iaa leaf zr leaf and ga3 leaf increased significantly with the increase of soil water regimes however aba leaf was similar under different soil water treatments table 1 the analysis across the soil water regimes showed that aba leaf and iaa leaf in the n8 treatment were significantly higher than those in the n2 treatment while the zr leaf and ga3 leaf were not affected by n treatments across the n treatments aba root was highest in the moderately water stressed treatment intermediate in the mildly water stressed treatment and lowest in the well watered treatment table 1 ga3 root and iaa root were higher in the moderately water stressed treatment compared with the well watered treatment while zr root was significantly higher in the well watered and moderately water stressed treatments than in the mildly water stressed treatment analysis across the soil water regimes showed that aba root and zr root were highest in the n4 treatment intermediate in the n2 treatment and lowest in n8 treatment while the ga3 root showed the opposite tendency iaa root was not affected by the n dose aba root was negatively and significantly correlated with the rwp fig 3 3 4 leaf area shoot dry biomass plant water use water use efficiency leaf δ13c and δ18o analysis across the n rates showed that the leaf area shoot dry biomass plant water use and wue increased with the elevated soil water regimes table 2 the wue in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments were significantly increased by 61 6 and 35 9 than that under the moderately water stressed treatment the well watered and mildly water stressed treatment produced 110 9 and 70 7 more shoot dry biomass compared to the moderately water stressed treatment across the water treatments plant water use was highest in the n8 treatment intermediate in the n4 treatment and lowest in the n2 treatment table 2 however the leaf area shoot dry biomass and wue were not affected by n treatments as well as the interaction between soil water and n levels table 2 when analyzed across the water treatments the leaf δ13c was highest in the n2 treatment intermediate in the n4 treatment and lowest in the n8 treatment the leaf δ18o was similar among the n treatments there was a significant positive liner relationship between leaf δ13c and wue fig 4a no relationship existed between leaf δ13c and δ18o fig 4b 3 5 plant n concentration n and 15n accumulation across the n treatments the n concentration in the leaf and aerial stem of pineapple were higher under the high soil water and mildly water stressed treatments than those under the moderately water stressed treatment table 3 however the n concentration in the roots increased under the moderately water stressed treatment compared with other soil water treatments analysis across the water treatments showed that n concentration in the leaf aerial stem rhizome and root of pineapple were highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment table 3 across the n treatments n and 15n accumulation in the leaf aerial stem root and whole plant were highest in the well watered treatment followed by the mildly water stress treatment and lowest in the moderately water stressed treatment compared with the moderately water stressed treatment the n and 15n accumulation of total plant under the mildly water stress and well watered treatments were significantly increased by 100 0 148 1 213 3 and 313 8 respectively analysis across the water treatments showed that n and 15n accumulation in the leaf aerial stem rhizome and whole plant were highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment the n accumulation of total plant under the n8 and n4 treatments increased by 63 6 and 30 0 than did n2 plants similarly the 15n accumulation in the total plant was significantly increased with increasing n application rates by 190 6 and 83 3 in the n8 and n4 treatments compared with the n2 treatment table 3 3 6 sources of plant n uptake and fate of 15n in the pineapple soil system across the n treatments the plant n derived from 15n labelled fertilizer ndff in different organs of pineapple were significantly increased with the improved soil water levels table 4 approximately 30 1 50 2 of plant n accumulation was derived from 15n labelled fertilizer analysis across the water treatments showed that the percentage of plant n derived from 15n labelled fertilizer in different organs of pineapple was highest in the n8 treatment intermediate in the n4 treatment and lowest in the n2 treatment across the n treatments the percentage of plant n derived from soil in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments were lower than that in the moderately water stressed treatment table 4 however the quantity of n taken up from the soil was significantly elevated with the increased soil water regimes across the water treatments the percentage of plant n derived from soil decreased significantly with the increased n dose while the quantity of plant n derived from soil was similar among the n treatments the 15n recovery in pineapple increased significantly with the increased water regimes across the n treatments whereas it decreased significantly with the increased n dose across the water treatments table 5 the 15n residual in the soil was only significantly affected by the n treatments across the water treatments the potential loss of 15n fertilizer was higher in the moderately water stressed treatment than other two water treatments across the n treatments 3 7 plant c accumulation and specific leaf n content when analyzed across the n treatments the plant c accumulation was highest in the well watered treatment intermediate in the mildly water stressed treatment and lowest in the moderately water stressed treatment across the water treatments the plant c accumulation was higher under the n4 and n8 treatments than the n2 treatment fig 5a across the n treatments the mildly and moderately water stressed treatments had similar specific leaf n content which was lower than that under the high soil water treatment analysis across the water treatments showed that the specific leaf n content was higher in the high and medium n treatments than that in the low n treatment fig 5b there was a significant positive linear correlation between plant c accumulation and specific leaf n content fig 6 4 discussion previous studies mainly focused on the impact of water deficiency on cam activity the mechanisms underlying the impact of soil water and n regimes on cam plant pineapple are still unknown therefore the plant biomass accumulation plant water relations phytohormone signaling wue and n uptake as well as leaf δ13c and δ18o as affected by soil water and n regimes were investigated in order to unravel how water and n modulated pineapple wue and nutrient uptake in the present study across the n treatments the larger increase in dry biomass relative to plant water use resulted in the significantly enhanced wue by 61 6 and 35 9 in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments compared to the moderately water stressed treatment table 2 leaf δ13c was measured to indicate the long term time integrated wue it was found that the leaf δ13c of pineapple was significantly and positively correlated with the wue fig 4a and this was in good agreement with previous studies on cam plant species winter et al 2005 the significantly higher leaf δ13c and wue of pineapple grown under well watered and mildly water stressed conditions compared to the moderately water stressed treatment were observed table 2 previous studies have shown that drought or high n supply increased δ13c of cam plants as the activity of pepcase was essentially higher at night in comparison with the activity of rubisco at day bender et al 1973 widmann and ziegler 1993 in the current study the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments enhanced the specific leaf n content which could enhance the activity of pepcase at night thus increased the leaf δ13c of pineapple in these treatments the improvement of leaf δ13c along with increased specific leaf n content has also been observed by wang et al 2010 2018 moreover the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the lrwc and this could improve the vacuolar malate storage capacity in the pineapple leaf and the proportions of co2 derived during the dark töpfer et al 2020 for cam plants δ13c value varies depending on the long time ratio of co2 fixed at night via c4 pathway by phosphoenolpyruvate pep carboxylase and co2 fixed at day directly via c3 pathway by ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase rubisco during each phase of cam bender et al 1973 osmond 1978 the enzyme pep carboxylase discriminates against 13c to a lesser extent than rubisco therefore the improved proportions of co2 derived during the dark in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments could have improved the δ13c value of cam plants winter and holtum 2002 winter et al 2005 the analysis of δ18o in the tissues of cam plants could provide an additional tool for studying environmental regulation on cam sternberg et al 1986 helliker and griffiths 2007 reyes garcía et al 2008 the variations of leaf δ18o could indicate the environmental constraints on transpiration and stomatal conductance of plants during the experimental period craig and gordon 1965 helliker and griffiths 2007 cernusak et al 2008 previous studies have reported the positive relationship between transpiration and δ18o of leaf organic materials gan et al 2002 sheshshayee et al 2005 cernusak et al 2007 2008 in the present study the leaf δ18o was significantly higher under the well watered and mildly water stress treatments than the moderately water stress treatment indicating that the improved soil water regime significantly enhanced the transpirational water loss as verified by the markedly increased plant water use table 2 the leaf δ18o enrichment of the well watered and mildly water stress treatments could be due to the combination of large leaf water concentration and the characteristic diel pattern of stomatal conductance associated with cam cernusak et al 2008 the higher relative leaf water content under the well watered and mildly water stress treatments than that under the moderately water stressed treatment could result in longer leaf water residence time thus increasing the leaf δ18o enrichment in addition the higher relative leaf water content of the pineapple plant can also indicate the increased ratio of plant conductance stomatal and boundary layer conductance to water loss helliker 2011 which could also increase the leaf δ18o enrichment phytohormone signaling events underlying the conversion of environmental signals such as water and n availability into changes in the expression and operation of the cam have already been identified taybi et al 2002 freschi et al 2012 previous studies have shown that drought stress could trigger endogenous aba accumulation in leaf tissues of cam plants such as young pineapple ananas comosus freschi et al 2010 kalanchoë blossfeldiana taybi et al 1995 and m crystallinum thomas et al 1992 in the current study the decreased rwp lwp and lrwc fig 2 as well as the significantly intensified root endogenous aba were observed due to the reduced soil and root water status table 1 fig 3 the severe soil water deficit under the moderately water stressed treatment for pineapple could have decreased the transport of root sourced aba to the above ground plants due to reduced water transport causing the similar aba concentration in the shoot of the moderately water stressed treatment table 1 cytokinins cks are also known to participate in the water stress induced upregulation of cam in young pineapple plants freschi et al 2010 studies on several cam plants including m crystallinum and a comosus have demonstrated that endogenous cks in the leaf decreased considerably during the water stress induced upregulation of cam peters et al 1997 freschi et al 2010 in the present study the zr type cks concentration of pineapple leaves decreased under drought stress treatments table 1 indicating that endogenous cks probably act as negative signals responsible for regulating cam expression in leaves of pineapple plants previous studies have shown that foliar applied ga3 to m crystallinum plants induced only a small increase in pepc activity and cam expression guralnick et al 2001 while there showed no observable cam induction when ga3 fed through the roots dai et al 1994 for cam plant pineapple significantly higher ga3 leaf and iaa leaf were observed in pineapple leaves under the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments table 1 while the iaa root and ga3 root were significant lower in the well watered treatment in contrast freschi et al 2010 observed that pineapple plants challenged with changes in water availability showed no marked oscillations in iaa leaf during either the upregulation or the attenuation of cam expression therefore the interactions between phytohormonal signaling water and n stress and cam plant growth still merit further studies it is widely accepted that a higher leaf n content is usually associated with higher photosynthetic capacity in the present study the specific leaf n content was significantly decreased by the moderately water stressed treatment fig 5b indicating the notably reduced photosynthetic capacity of leaves in the treatment even though the shoot dry biomass and leaf area was significantly higher in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments than the moderately water stressed treatment table 2 the specific leaf n content and n concentration were not reduced by the dilution effect and this implied that the sufficient soil water supply enhanced the ability of the roots to uptake water and fertilizer n from the soil table 4 resulting in the significantly higher n and 15n accumulation and fertilizer n use efficiency tables 3 and 5 the specific leaf n content was significantly and positively correlated with plant c accumulation fig 6 implying that the enhanced specific leaf n content could have facilitated the carbon fixation in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments fig 5a in consequence the improved n nutrition in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the shoot biomass accumulation compared with the moderately water stressed treatment table 2 5 conclusions the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the shoot dry biomass more pronouncedly than the plant water use resulting in the significantly improved plant water use efficiency wue in these treatments compared to the moderately water stressed treatment the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments improved the specific leaf n content that facilitated the carbon fixation thus increased the shoot biomass accumulation the enhanced leaf δ13c and plant wue in these treatments were ascribed to the enhanced specific leaf n content that could enhance the activity of pepcase at night and the improved leaf relative water content lrwc which could improve the vacuolar malate storage capacity in the pineapple leaf and the proportions of co2 derived during the dark moreover the well watered and mildly water stress treatments significantly increased leaf δ18o than the moderately water stress treatment indicating the significantly higher transpiration in line with the markedly increased plant water use in these treatments due to the combination of large leaf water concentration and the characteristic diel pattern of stomatal conductance associated with cam the n concentration was not reduced by the dilution effect implying the enhanced ability of the roots to uptake water and nutrients from the soil for pineapple resulting in the significantly higher n and 15n accumulation in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments compared with moderately water stressed treatment conclusively in the production of the cam plant ananas comosus maintaining high soil water content is recommended to achieve improved growth water and fertilizer n utilization the results can also be used for process oriented modeling to optimize water and nutrient management for tropical crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

international water management institute iwmi sri lanka international water management institute iwmi sri lanka international water management institute iwmi sri lanka corresponding author handling editor j e fernández uav based multispectral vegetation indices are often used to assess crop performance and water consumptive use however their ability to assess the interaction between water especially deficit irrigation and nitrogen application rates in irrigated agriculture has been less explored understanding the effect of water nitrogen interactions on vegetation indices could further support optimal water and n management therefore this study used a split plot design with water being the main factor and n being the sub factor african eggplants were drip irrigated at 100 i100 80 i80 or 60 i60 of the crop water requirements and received 100 f100 75 f75 50 f50 or 0 f0 of the crop n requirements results showed that the transformed difference vegetation index tdvi was best in distinguishing differences in leaf moisture content lmc during the vegetative stage irrespective of the n treatment the green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi worked well to distinguish leaf n during vegetative and full vegetative stages however the detection of the interactive effect of water and n on crop performance required a combination of gndvi ndvi and osavi across both stages as each of these 3 vi showed an ability to detect some but not all treatments the fact that a certain amount of irrigation water can optimize the efficiency of n uptake by the plant is an important criterion to consider in developing crop specific vi based decision trees for crop performance assessments and yield prediction keywords water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency uav irrigation water stress vegetation indices 1 introduction assessing the interactive effect of water and nitrogen for agriculture has been on top of the world agenda this is because there is a large gap between currently observed crop yields and the attainable yields when water and nitrogen are supplied in adequate amounts in different areas especially in less developed countries qin 2015 water and nitrogen n deficiency are frequently limiting factors for crop production and they often occur together klem et al 2018 to minimize risk of yield reductions due to n limitations farmers often apply excessive fertilizer however the translation of n application into vegetable crop production is strongly dependent on adequate and timely water management zotarelli et al 2009 hence effective and efficient translation of water and nitrogen into agricultural productions requires studies to look at the interactive effects of water and nitrogen influencing plant growth and therefore biomass accumulation higher level of biomass accumulation has been linked with an increase in crop yield cambui et al 2011 chen et al 2018 this is more evident in horticultural crops production where higher seasonal yields are associated with the level of biomass accumulation liu et al 2014 moncada et al 2020 most farmers in sub saharan africa use traditional practices to manage water and nitrogen el nahry et al 2011 traditional methods of decision making use visual observation of plant canopy responses to manage water and nitrogen inputs studies have shown that visual signs of nutrient deficiency occur while the plant is already experiencing significant levels of stress mee et al 2017 park et al 2015 at that point often yield reductions will already be inevitable furthermore the methods are not capable of estimating the amount of inputs to apply resulting into under or over application of water and or nitrogen tripathi et al 2017 over irrigation on its turn results into low fertilizer use efficiency reduced productivity and increased production costs yuan and peng 2017 higher water application may also result into nitrogen leaching leading to pollution of water bodies and wider environmental pollution to improve water and n use efficiencies it requires effective management of both resources in tandem several methods to determine water stress have been used in irrigation scheduling over years the methods have been categorized into soil based and plant based techniques mwinuka et al 2021b some of the soil based methods are soil moisture monitoring using soil moisture sensors such as time domain reflectometry tdr tension meters and neutron probes benor et al 2013 restuccia 2021 however the use of soil moisture sensors provides point based soil moisture values and might fail to capture field heterogeneity resulting in spatial variation of plant water stress and therefore crop performance mwinuka et al 2021b on the other hand plant canopy based methods have been used in crop water status monitoring as signs of canopy stress occur earlier than soil based signs poblete echeverría et al 2017 petrie et al 2019 these methods are characterized into contact and non contact examples of contact methods are leaf diffusion porometers and pressure chamber for measuring stomatal conductance and water potential berni et al 2009 poblete echeverría et al 2017 non contact methods include infrared thermometers mobile phone based thermal imaging and remote sensing among others çolak et al 2015 stone et al 2016 petrie et al 2019 field nitrogen assessment has predominantly focused on plant canopy based indicators due to the complexity of measuring soil parameters even with the latest advances in rapid in situ soil diagnostics plant canopy nitrogen management has been possible due to physiological and biochemical changes occurring within the plant under certain conditions fang et al 2017 klem et al 2018 these changes within the plant canopy result into differences in solar radiation reflectance of the electromagnetic spectrum the analysis of these differences in reflectance results into identification of the level of n composition within the plant canopy and hence enhances management decisions canopy reflectance and derived plant n status can be captured by portable spectroradiometers hand held plant chlorophyll meters and remote sensing techniques julitta et al 2016 irfan et al 2018 so far mainly canopy based methods are used to look at the interactive effect of water and nitrogen these include isotopic techniques as well as low altitude remote sensing methods bronson et al 2017 klem et al 2018 low altitude remote sensing techniques have been effectively conducted using multispectral and hyperspectral sensors with the earlier being more affordable and capable in collecting detailed plant information badzmierowski et al 2019 bhandari et al 2018 this technology uses different spectral bands such as visible spectral red green and blue near infrared ir and short wave infrared ranges multispectral range contains 3 10 bands while hyperspectral comprise hundreds of narrow bands corti et al 2017 within the multispectral region high reflectance from the leaf mesophyll in healthy plant canopy falls within the near infrared region reyes gonzalez 2017 several vegetation indices have been used to assess water and nitrogen in different crops such as wheat corn tomatoes lettuce and spinach under different climatic conditions bronson et al 2017 cabrera bosquet et al 2011 elvanidi et al 2018 ge et al 2019 klem et al 2018 shiratsuchi et al 2011 bhandari et al 2018 most of these studies have shown variation of various vegetation indices in assessing water and n separately few studies have assessed the ability of the vegetation indices in assessing the interactive effects of water and n despite the fact that deficiencies frequently occur together klem et al 2018 likewise spectral behavior of crops differs with climatic conditions and crop type bellvert et al 2015 studies of spectral responses of horticultural crops to different combinations of water and nitrogen stress in tropical sub humid regions are less studied therefore this study aimed to assess the efficacy of vegetation indices in evaluating different levels of crop water and n management this study is aimed at enhancing service delivery by public or private sector extension services for small medium and large scale farming to enhance yields and water use and n use efficiencies mwinuka et al 2021b the study investigated the use of uav derived multispectral vegetation indices in assessing the effect of different water and nitrogen management strategies in horticultural crops the specific objectives were to 1 assess the variation of vegetation indices to nitrogen treatments at different irrigation depths 2 investigate vegetation indices response to water n and their interaction 3 assess the effectiveness of vegetation indices maps to distinguish different water and n strategies and 4 assess the relationship of potential vegetation indices with fruit yield as a result of water and n management 2 materials and methods 2 1

ranges between 1000 mm and 1400 mm irrigated agriculture is commonly practiced during the dry period june to november and the short rainy period december to february the major source of irrigation water is the wami river which flows from the mamiwa forest reserve throughout the year soils are predominantly sand clayey loamy soils with a medium level of organic carbon the clay silt and sand content range between 23 and 26 10 14 and 58 65 respectively within the top 40 cm the average soils bulk density within the study sites was 1 3 1 5 g cm3 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid out in a 3 4 arrangement of treatments under a split plot design fig 2 with irrigation water being the main plot and n the subplot kadiyala 2012 there were 3 irrigation treatments each with 4 levels of n application irrigation water treatments were 100 i100 80 i80 and 60 i60 of crop water requirements for eggplant under drip irrigation n fertilizer treatments were 100 f100 75 f75 50 f50 and 0 f0 of crop n requirements respectively each treatment was repeated three times the plot size for each replicate was 35 m2 with plant and row spacing of 60 cm and 90 cm respectively transplanting was conducted on the top of the ridges where driplines were installed the experiment was conducted during the dry seasons june to october 2017 and 2018 2 3 irrigation water requirements and nitrogen application crop water requirements were estimated using cropwat 8 0 software as recommended by fao using 15 years of climatic data from ilonga meteorological station mwinuka et al 2021a the crop coefficient kc and the reference evapotranspiration eto were used to estimate the crop actual evapotranspiration etc table 1 the etc was used to calculate the daily net irrigation water requirements iwrn and ultimately the gross irrigation requirements giwr as shown in table 1 microclimate data from an automatic weather station installed 500 m away from the field site were used to adjust daily irrigation water requirement fig 3 the crop evapotranspiration etc at any time was adjusted using the crop coefficient kc and crop reference evapotranspiration eto using data recorded by an automatic weather station the effective rainfall was estimated using usda scs method as described by patwardhan et al 1990 the water requirement was further adjusted using the soil water balance method and moisture data from the dsmm500 moisture meter the amount of irrigation water to be applied in each irrigation cycle was finally reduced depending on the treatment i e 100 80 or 60 of the crop water requirement the total amount of water applied throughout the season was 1035 mm 828 mm and 621 mm for i100 i80 and i60 respectively nitrogen was applied through urea 46 0 0 at 7 30 60 and 90 days after transplanting distributed as 16 34 34 and 16 of n respectively the seasonal n applied was 250 kg ha 187 kg ha 125 kg ha and 0 kg ha for f100 f75 f50 and f0 respectively fertilizer recommendations for f100 were based on other crops within the solanaceae family such as eggplant and tomatoes rsa 2012 fondio et al 2016 grown under different climatic conditions in absence of local fertilizer recommendations 2 4 assessment of vegetation indices response to water n and their interaction 2 4 1 leaf nitrogen and water content assessment plant leaves from each plot were collected 3 times during early vegetative and full vegetative stages leaf n content was determined using the kjeldahl procedure on the third youngest fully developed leaf omer et al 2017 the plant leaf water content was measured destructively by oven drying of the leaf samples at 70 c until constant weight was attained ge et al 2016 leaves were harvested between 08 00 10 00 h to minimize solar radiation errors through evaporation soon after harvesting fresh leaves were weighted using class b digital weighing balance complying with canadian ices 003 the leaf water content lwc was estimated using the fresh wl and dry dl sample weights as shown in eq 1 1 lwc wl dl wl 100 2 4 2 uav based images acquisition and processing images were acquired using a multispec4c sensor attached to the fixed wing uav ebeetm drone a sensefly sa cheseaux lausanne switzerland mwinuka et al 2021b the multispec4c sensor had green red red edge and near infrared spectral bands with wavelengths of 550 nm 660 nm 735 nm and 790 nm respectively the sensor had a ground sampling distance gsd of 12 cm pixel and was set at a lateral and longitudinal overlap of 70 and 65 the images were acquired within two hours between 12 00 13 30 to minimize shadow effects using a uav flown at an average altitude of 115 m above elevation data aed production of orthomosaic maps from multispectral images was conducted using the pix4d software pix4d sa lausanne switzerland the details of the methodology is described by mwinuka et al 2021b the choice of vegetation indices vi was based on their capability to estimate leaf water content leaf n and their interaction as reported by different scholars the indices were limited to four spectral bands green red near infrared and red edge within multispec4c sensor considering these 2 factors the following indices were explored table 2 2 4 3 capability of vegetation indices to assess water n and their interaction the derived leaf water and n content were used to assess the suitability of the vis in assessing water and n and their interaction at different crop stages the analysis of variance anova was used to assess whether the vis differed significantly in function of the water and nitrogen treatment the capability of vi to distinguish leaf water n contents and the interactive effect of water and n was performed using the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 and radar charts 2 5 effectiveness of vegetation indices maps to distinguish different water and n combinations vegetation indices maps were developed to spatially differentiate areas with different water and n combinations in the field mwinuka et al 2021b the image mosaic was processed in rstudio software version 3 6 1 handled in respective bands using raster and rgdal packages team 2018 the plot function was further applied to generate vegetation indices maps 2 6 the relationship between vegetation indices and fruit yield the correlation between vegetation indices and fruit yield was assessed using the regression model the software used was ggplot2 package under rstudio version 3 6 1 the software was used to evaluate a linear relationship of fruit yield against the vegetation indices only results were considered where the coefficient of correlation r2 was at least 0 5 3 results 3 1 variation of vegetation indices to nitrogen treatments at different irrigation depths vegetation indices have shown to respond differently to n at different cropping stages the indices gndvi ndvi and osavi responded best to different n application rates at different irrigation treatments due to soil background reflectance the early crop development stage had no significant difference found among n treatments for any of the irrigation treatments at 100 i100 irrigation depth the gndvi increased significantly with increased n application at vegetative and full vegetative stages fig 4 in the vegetative and full vegetative stages for i80 two groups could be distinguished f100 and f75 vs f50 and f0 fig 5 however between f100 and f75 as well as between f50 and f0 no significant differences were found within the i60 treatment the calculated vis differed in function of n application between f100 f75 and f50 but not between f50 and f0 fig 6 similarly ndvi and osavi increased significantly when more n was applied at vegetative and full vegetative stages figure not shown during the vegetative stage the ndvi at i100 did not differ significantly between f100 and f75 figure not shown similar trends were observed for i80 and i60 irrigation treatments figure not shown in all irrigation treatments the ndvi for f0 was significantly lower compared to the rest the osavi also showed a good response to n application at all irrigation regimes figure not shown this is due to significant differences in the reflectance from the crop canopy as a result of water and nitrogen variation within the plant other vegetation indices such as grvi ndre evi2 savi and tdvi also increased when higher amounts of n were applied under different irrigation regimes figure not shown however these indices were unable to differentiate between specific n treatments 3 2 the response of vegetation indices to the interactive effect of water and n 3 2 1 the response of vegetation indices to leaf moisture content at different irrigation levels vegetation indices had different responses to varying leaf moisture content table 3 at the vegetative stage the tdvi had best performance in distinguishing the levels of canopy water stress at all levels of water application i100 i80 and i60 the gndvi ndvi and osavi were not capable of distinguishing between i100 and i80 while they distinguished i60 savi distinguished the plant canopy under i100 from other treatments during vegetative and full vegetative stages the evi2 grvi and ndre did not pick up on canopy differences caused by water stress in the vegetative stage at the full vegetative stage the evi2 gndvi grvi ndvi osavi and savi were all able to distinguish the high water stressed canopies under i60 from the other two treatments table 3 the tdvi and ndre failed to differentiate treatments at full vegetative stage 3 2 2 the response of vegetation indices to leaf n content at different n rates the variation of leaf n content differed in function of the n applied resulting in differences in vi table 4 at the vegetative stage gndvi performed well in differentiating between f100 f75 f50 and f0 the grvi ndvi and osavi were capable of discriminating f0 from the rest of the treatments savi tdvi and ndre had a weak capability to distinguish the plant n content irrespective of the irrigation treatment at the full vegetative stages gndvi performed best in differentiating between f100 f75 f50 and f0 table 4 the ndvi and osavi were capable of distinguishing f50 and f0 from the rest of the treatments the rest of the vegetation indices evi2 grvi savi tdvi and ndre had a weak performance in differentiating the variation of leaf n among treatments 3 2 3 the response of vegetation indices to the interaction between water and n different vegetation indices performed differently in distinguishing the interactive effect of water and n table 4 the gndvi ndvi and osavi showed a stronger capability in distinguishing between the different water and n treatments at vegetative and full vegetative stages the evi2 grvi savi tdvi and ndre showed weak responses to the different treatments in all crop development stages table 5 fig 7 during the vegetative stage gndvi showed the strongest capability in distinguishing between the various water and nitrogen treatments table 5 and fig 7 it was the only vi which was able to indicate a difference in canopy reflectance for i100f100 compared to the other treatments furthermore gndvi detected significant differences between the following 5 groups 1 100f100 2 i100f75 i80f100 and i80f75 3 i100f50 and i60f100 4 i80f50 and i60f75 and 5 i100f0 and i60f0 only i60f50 fell in both group 4 and group 5 ndvi performed reasonably well and was also able to detect 5 groups 1 i100f100 and i100f75 2 i80f100 and i80f75 3 i80f50 4 i80f0 5 i100f0 and i60f0 however ndvi was not able to detect differences among i60f100 i60f75 i60f50 and i100f75 osavi was also able to detect a few groups but overall performed less well compared to gndvi and ndvi in the vegetative stage osavi detected differences between groups 1 i100f100 and i10075 2 i100f50 and i80f50 3 i60f0 but was unable to significantly detect differences in canopy reflectance for the other treatments at full vegetative stage gndvi performed less compared to the vegetative stage in detecting water and nitrogen treatment effects gndvi was able to only detect significant differences between i100f100 i100f50 i80f0 and i60f100 ndvi detected significant differences between 5 groups 1 i100f100 and i100f75 2 i60f75 3 i100f50 and 4 i80f0 and i60f100 and 5 i60f0 however these groups differed with those compared in the vegetative stage osavi detected the same three groups as in the vegetative stage which were 1 i100f100 and i100f75 2 i100f50 and 3 i60f0 3 3 vegetation indices maps to assess the interactive effect of water and n based on the ability of the vi to detect differences in water and nutrient management gndvi and ndvi were used to develop the vi maps the vegetation indices maps depicted well the spatial variability of water and n treatments in the field at the full vegetative stage gndvi values ranged from 0 29 0 52 with values between 0 29 0 09 reflecting bare soils and canopy reflectance under the various treatments between 0 1 and 0 52 fig 8 the water and n combination which resulted in high yielding healthy plants showed a gndvi in the range 0 35 5 2 moderate yielding plants between 0 25 and 0 35 and in stressed low yielding between 0 1 and 0 25 likewise the ndvi showed spatial variability in function of the water and n treatment values during the full vegetative stage were in the range of 0 3 0 76 fig 8 with the canopy covered areas between 0 15 and 0 76 ndvi for the highest yielding treatments fell between 0 6 and 0 75 moderate yielding from 0 45 to 0 6 and low yielding treatments in the 0 1 0 3 range the maps therefore can be used to assess differences in canopy reflectance as a result of varying water and n conditions in the fields 3 4 the correlation of the vegetation indices to the end of the season fruit yield the correlation between the end of season yields and vegetation indices varied significantly during the early development stage there was a weak correlation of vegetation indices to the end of the season yields table 6 at the vegetative stage the ndvi r2 0 46 p 4 7 x 10 11 and osavi r2 0 47 p 4 1 x 10 11 showed a moderate correlation with the end of season yields during the full vegetative stage gndvi showed a better correlation with the end of season yields r2 0 47 p 2 3 x 10 11 compared to those in the vegetative stage table 6 the ndvi r2 0 53 p 5 9 x10 13 and osavi r2 0 52 p 2 8 x 10 9 also showed a better correlation with the end of season yields at the full vegetative stage however the ability to use vi in yield predictions remains limited as they are able to predict around 50 of the obtained yields 4 discussion 4 1 the variation of vegetation indices to nitrogen treatments at different irrigation depths vegetation indices showed a varying capability to distinguish n at different irrigation depths during the early cropping stages none of the vegetation indices were capable of differentiating n at varying levels of irrigation this is because most of the reflectance recorded was from the soil surface prudnikova et al 2019 the gndvi ndvi and osavi could distinguish differences in canopy reflectance in function of n application at vegetative and full vegetative stages across irrigation treatments this is related to the response of these vis to the chlorophyll and xanthophyll content which are related to crop water status zhang et al 2019 these findings are similar to earlier studies which assessed plant water status at varying n levels in different crops zhang et al 2019 recommended the use of ndvi in irrigation water management of maize crops due to its response to water stress bhandari et al 2018 got weak correlation of all ndvi and gndvi on their response to water n and their interaction in lettuce weak correlation of these vegetation indices in the lettuce crop might be caused by differences in chemical characteristics and leaf morphology of the canopy surface resulting in different responses to the incoming solar radiation shiratsuchi et al 2011 selected the red edge ndvi and the red band ndvi as they were capable at distinguishing the crop performance variation due to different irrigation levels and showed average capability to distinguish between n rates in corn production canopy n content was distinguished by different vegetation indices within the vegetative and full vegetative stages the study observed the capability of gndvi ndvi and osavi in distinguishing leaf n at different water regimes during the vegetative and full vegetative stages furthermore in the full vegetative gndvi performed slightly better than ndvi and osavi in its ability to detect differences in n application rates in the i100 and i60 treatments less so in the i80 treatment this is evidence that the spectral reflectance of african eggplant canopy in the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum responds accordingly to n variation prudnikova et al 2019 additionally elvanidi et al 2018 recommended the need for more research on the use of spectral based indices to detect n status for improving tomato growth under deficit irrigation contradicting results across different types of crops confirm that plants respond differently to incoming light spectra hence there is a need for plant specific calibrations 4 2 the response of vegetation indices to detect the interactive effect of water and n and predict eggplant yield in general the findings of this study indicated that water and nitrogen causes plant tissues in horticultural crops to reflect more in the nir and green spectral bands this has been reported for other crops such as wheat lint and pinto bean ballester et al 2019 kyratzis et al 2017 ranjan et al 2019 the interaction of water and n combination significantly affects the internal leaf structure causing a significant difference in the reflectance of the nir band of the electromagnetic radiation the reflectance within the green band was also significantly different in various treatments thus increasing the response of the gndvi the response of these bands in numerous water and n combinations was thus capable to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plants among the vegetation indices tested the gndvi ndvi and osavi were moderately sensitive to the interaction of water and n at vegetative and full vegetative stages at the vegetative cropping stage the gndvi and ndvi performed slightly better compared to osavi in detecting differences in canopy reflectance across treatments gndvi was able to detect both the high and low n application levels the gndvi therefore can be used to show areas with water and n stress within the field candiago et al 2015 furthermore gndvi performed better in detecting the response of african eggplant to different n levels under i100 whilst ndvi seemed to perform stronger in detecting differences of plant response to n levels under i80 the results are in agreement with candiago et al 2015 who found that gndvi was capable in detecting changes in plant chlorophyll and those of bhandari et al 2018 for ndvi osavi was also sensitive in distinguishing treatments with highest levels of inputs water and n from the rest the index was sensitive to showing a decline in water and n as most treatments with 60 water have low values of indices as compared to those with 80 and 100 water furthermore gndvi in the vegetative stage allowed for a clearer distinction between groups in function of the water and n treatment gndvi was able to classify 11 out of 12 treatments into 5 groups treatments in these groups resembled similarities in canopy reflectance for example whilst i100f100 was clearly differentiated from all other treatments the reflectance between 75 application of n under i100 and i80 was found to be similar to 100 of n application under i80 similarly 50 of n application under i100 showed a similar average reflectance to 100 n application under i60 this further confirms the partial ability of plants to compensate for either water or nitrogen deficiency if one of these two inputs is available in higher amounts mwinuka et al 2021a the fact that a certain amount of irrigation water can optimize the efficiency of nutrients uptake by the plant is an important criterion to consider in agricultural water management xiang et al 2019 at the full vegetative stage gndvi performed less well than ndvi as the latter was able to classify 7 treatments out of 12 into 5 groups these groups resembled mainly the combinations of high water and nitrogen inputs and those with higher deficiencies in water or nitrogen the complexity of n and water interaction on plant performance resulted in gndvi ndvi and osavi showing a moderate potential to predict end of the season fruit yield these results are similar to sultana et al 2014 and tuvdendorj et al 2019 who found that the ndvi could predict wheat yield except for ndvi and osavi at full vegetative stages correlation was below 50 results in this study showed a lower correlation compared to the earlier findings of mwinuka et al 2021b for predicting african eggplant based on irrigation treatment alone the variability in capability of gndvi ndvi and osavi to detect differences in canopy performance and the moderate correlation suggest the need for a combined vi approach developing a decision tree using a combination of all three vi and both stages could support better treatment identification as individual threshold detection is difficult given the interactive effect of water and nitrogen on plant development 4 3 vegetation indices maps vegetation indices maps were able to identify different water and nitrogen treatments during the vegetative and full vegetative stages of crop development these findings are similar to wang et al 2016 omer et al 2017 among others the differences in canopy reflectance are due to different plant chemical and physiological properties caused by the variation of water and n within the field the healthier plants are identified by a higher value of vi i e green color on the map whilst unhealthy plants showed lower values i e yellow color on the map the vi was significantly higher p 0 01 when they were calculated using the nir and red spectral bands such as ndvi and osavi in agreement with these findings ge et al 2019 found that the highest reflectance of nir was observed in healthy plants due to multiple reflections of the turgid cell structure this concludes that identification of spatial variation in water and n management for horticultural crops under tropical sub humid conditions can be carried out using vegetation indices maps 5 conclusions this study aimed to assess the ability of uav based multispectral vegetation indices in detecting the interactive effect of water and nitrogen management in irrigated horticultural crop production under tropical sub humid climate vegetation indices showed a varying capability of distinguishing between crop responses following different water and n treatments and their combination for instance the tdvi performed best in detecting leaf moisture changes as a function of irrigation treatment irrespective of the n treatment at the vegetative stage nitrogen variation within the plant canopy was best distinguished by gndvi during vegetative and full vegetative stages irrespective of irrigation treatment the ndvi and osavi worked well to differentiate canopy n at full vegetative stage when it came to water and nitrogen interaction gndvi ndvi and osavi potential in detecting significant differences between treatments varied this is related to the spectral bands used and ability to detect changes in the plant tissue as well as the plants ability to moderately compensate for water or nitrogen limitations the study revealed that if one of the inputs are less limiting the effect on canopy reduction is less pronounced challenging the differentiation using a vi and therefore ability to predict season yields generally the study observed that vegetation indices are most effective when they are used to assess water and n separately the interactive effect of water and n on african eggplant would require crop specific multi vi calibration given the advantages that all three vi showed for specific treatments the fact that a certain amount of irrigation water can optimize the efficiency of nutrients uptake by the plant is an important criterion to consider in developing crop specific vi based

editor j e fernández uav based multispectral vegetation indices are often used to assess crop performance and water consumptive use however their ability to assess the interaction between water especially deficit irrigation and nitrogen application rates in irrigated agriculture has been less explored understanding the effect of water nitrogen interactions on vegetation indices could further support optimal water and n management therefore this study used a split plot design with water being the main factor and n being the sub factor african eggplants were drip irrigated at 100 i100 80 i80 or 60 i60 of the crop water requirements and received 100 f100 75 f75 50 f50 or 0 f0 of the crop n requirements results showed that the transformed difference vegetation index tdvi was best in distinguishing differences in leaf moisture content lmc during the vegetative stage irrespective of the n treatment the green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi worked well to distinguish leaf n during vegetative and full vegetative stages however the detection of the interactive effect of water and n on crop performance required a combination of gndvi ndvi and osavi across both stages as each of these 3 vi showed an ability to detect some but not all treatments the fact that a certain amount of irrigation water can optimize the efficiency of n uptake by the plant is an important criterion to consider in developing crop specific vi based decision trees for crop performance assessments and yield prediction keywords water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency uav irrigation water stress vegetation indices 1 introduction assessing the interactive effect of water and nitrogen for agriculture has been on top of the world agenda this is because there is a large gap between currently observed crop yields and the attainable yields when water and nitrogen are supplied in adequate amounts in different areas especially in less developed countries qin 2015 water and nitrogen n deficiency are frequently limiting factors for crop production and they often occur together klem et al 2018 to minimize risk of yield reductions due to n limitations farmers often apply excessive fertilizer however the translation of n application into vegetable crop production is strongly dependent on adequate and timely water management zotarelli et al 2009 hence effective and efficient translation of water and nitrogen into agricultural productions requires studies to look at the interactive effects of water and nitrogen influencing plant growth and therefore biomass accumulation higher level of biomass accumulation has been linked with an increase in crop yield cambui et al 2011 chen et al 2018 this is more evident in horticultural crops production where higher seasonal yields are associated with the level of biomass accumulation liu et al 2014 moncada et al 2020 most farmers in sub saharan africa use traditional practices to manage water and nitrogen el nahry et al 2011 traditional methods of decision making use visual observation of plant canopy responses to manage water and nitrogen inputs studies have shown that visual signs of nutrient deficiency occur while the plant is already experiencing significant levels of stress mee et al 2017 park et al 2015 at that point often yield reductions will already be inevitable furthermore the methods are not capable of estimating the amount of inputs to apply resulting into under or over application of water and or nitrogen tripathi et al 2017 over irrigation on its turn results into low fertilizer use efficiency reduced productivity and increased production costs yuan and peng 2017 higher water application may also result into nitrogen leaching leading to pollution of water bodies and wider environmental pollution to improve water and n use efficiencies it requires effective management of both resources in tandem several methods to determine water stress have been used in irrigation scheduling over years the methods have been categorized into soil based and plant based techniques mwinuka et al 2021b some of the soil based methods are soil moisture monitoring using soil moisture sensors such as time domain reflectometry tdr tension meters and neutron probes benor et al 2013 restuccia 2021 however the use of soil moisture sensors provides point based soil moisture values and might fail to capture field heterogeneity resulting in spatial variation of plant water stress and therefore crop performance mwinuka et al 2021b on the other hand plant canopy based methods have been used in crop water status monitoring as signs of canopy stress occur earlier than soil based signs poblete echeverría et al 2017 petrie et al 2019 these methods are characterized into contact and non contact examples of contact methods are leaf diffusion porometers and pressure chamber for measuring stomatal conductance and water potential berni et al 2009 poblete echeverría et al 2017 non contact methods include infrared thermometers mobile phone based thermal imaging and remote sensing among others çolak et al 2015 stone et al 2016 petrie et al 2019 field nitrogen assessment has predominantly focused on plant canopy based indicators due to the complexity of measuring soil parameters even with the latest advances in rapid in situ soil diagnostics plant canopy nitrogen management has been possible due to physiological and biochemical changes occurring within the plant under certain conditions fang et al 2017 klem et al 2018 these changes within the plant canopy result into differences in solar radiation reflectance of the electromagnetic spectrum the analysis of these differences in reflectance results into identification of the level of n composition within the plant canopy and hence enhances management decisions canopy reflectance and derived plant n status can be captured by portable spectroradiometers hand held plant chlorophyll meters and remote sensing techniques julitta et al 2016 irfan et al 2018 so far mainly canopy based methods are used to look at the interactive effect of water and nitrogen these include isotopic techniques as well as low altitude remote sensing methods bronson et al 2017 klem et al 2018 low altitude remote sensing techniques have been effectively conducted using multispectral and hyperspectral sensors with the earlier being more affordable and capable in collecting detailed plant information badzmierowski et al 2019 bhandari et al 2018 this technology uses different spectral bands such as visible spectral red green and blue near infrared ir and short wave infrared ranges multispectral range contains 3 10 bands while hyperspectral comprise hundreds of narrow bands corti et al 2017 within the multispectral region high reflectance from the leaf mesophyll in healthy plant canopy falls within the near infrared region reyes gonzalez 2017 several vegetation indices have been used to assess water and nitrogen in different crops such as wheat corn tomatoes lettuce and spinach under different climatic conditions bronson et al 2017 cabrera bosquet et al 2011 elvanidi et al 2018 ge et al 2019 klem et al 2018 shiratsuchi et al 2011 bhandari et al 2018 most of these studies have shown variation of various vegetation indices in assessing water and n separately few studies have assessed the ability of the vegetation indices in assessing the interactive effects of water and n despite the fact that deficiencies frequently occur together klem et al 2018 likewise spectral behavior of crops differs with climatic conditions and crop type bellvert et al 2015 studies of spectral responses of horticultural crops to different combinations of water and nitrogen stress in tropical sub humid regions are less studied therefore this study aimed to assess the efficacy of vegetation indices in evaluating different levels of crop water and n management this study is aimed at enhancing service delivery by public or private sector extension services for small medium and large scale farming to enhance yields and water use and n use efficiencies mwinuka et al 2021b the study investigated the use of uav derived multispectral vegetation indices in assessing the effect of different water and nitrogen management strategies in horticultural crops the specific objectives were to 1 assess the variation of vegetation indices to nitrogen treatments at different irrigation depths 2 investigate vegetation indices response to water n and their interaction 3 assess the effectiveness of vegetation indices maps to distinguish different water and n strategies and 4 assess the relationship of potential vegetation indices with fruit yield as a result of water and n management 2 materials and methods 2 1

water is the wami river which flows from the mamiwa forest reserve throughout the year soils are predominantly sand clayey loamy soils with a medium level of organic carbon the clay silt and sand content range between 23 and 26 10 14 and 58 65 respectively within the top 40 cm the average soils bulk density within the study sites was 1 3 1 5 g cm3 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid out in a 3 4 arrangement of treatments under a split plot design fig 2 with irrigation water being the main plot and n the subplot kadiyala 2012 there were 3 irrigation treatments each with 4

was conducted on the top of the ridges where driplines were installed the experiment was conducted during the dry seasons june to october 2017 and 2018 2 3 irrigation water requirements and nitrogen application crop water requirements were estimated using cropwat 8 0 software as recommended by fao using 15 years of climatic data from ilonga meteorological station mwinuka et al 2021a the crop coefficient kc and the reference evapotranspiration eto were used to estimate the crop actual evapotranspiration etc table 1 the etc was used to calculate the daily net irrigation water requirements iwrn and ultimately the gross irrigation requirements giwr as shown in table 1 microclimate data from an automatic weather station installed 500 m away from the field site were used to adjust daily irrigation water requirement fig 3 the crop evapotranspiration etc at any time was adjusted using the crop coefficient kc and crop reference evapotranspiration eto using data recorded by an automatic weather station the effective rainfall was estimated using usda scs method as described by patwardhan et al 1990 the water requirement was further adjusted using the soil water balance method and moisture data from the dsmm500 moisture meter the amount of irrigation water to be applied in each irrigation cycle was finally reduced depending on the treatment i e 100 80 or 60 of the crop water requirement the total amount of water applied throughout the season was 1035 mm 828 mm and 621 mm for i100 i80 and i60 respectively nitrogen was applied through urea 46 0 0 at 7 30 60 and 90 days after transplanting distributed as 16 34 34 and 16 of n respectively the seasonal n applied was 250 kg ha 187 kg ha 125 kg ha and 0 kg ha for f100 f75 f50 and f0 respectively fertilizer recommendations for f100 were based on other crops within the solanaceae family such as eggplant and tomatoes rsa 2012 fondio et al 2016 grown under different climatic conditions in absence of local fertilizer recommendations 2 4 assessment of vegetation indices response to water n and their interaction 2 4 1 leaf nitrogen and water content assessment plant leaves from each plot were collected 3 times during early vegetative and full vegetative stages leaf n content was determined using the kjeldahl procedure on the third youngest fully developed leaf omer et al 2017 the plant leaf water content was measured destructively by oven drying of the leaf samples at 70 c until constant weight was attained ge et al 2016 leaves were harvested between 08 00 10 00 h to minimize solar radiation errors through evaporation soon after harvesting fresh leaves were weighted using class b digital weighing balance complying with canadian ices 003 the leaf water content lwc was estimated using the fresh wl and dry dl sample weights as shown in eq 1 1 lwc wl dl wl 100 2 4 2 uav based images acquisition and processing images were acquired using a multispec4c sensor attached to the fixed wing uav ebeetm drone a sensefly sa cheseaux lausanne switzerland mwinuka et al 2021b the multispec4c sensor had green red red edge and near infrared spectral bands with wavelengths of 550 nm 660 nm 735 nm and 790 nm respectively the sensor had a ground sampling distance gsd of 12 cm pixel and was set at a lateral and longitudinal overlap of 70 and 65 the images were acquired within two hours between 12 00 13 30 to minimize shadow effects using a uav flown at an average altitude of 115 m above elevation data aed production of orthomosaic maps from multispectral images was conducted using the pix4d software pix4d sa lausanne switzerland the details of the methodology is described by mwinuka et al 2021b the choice of vegetation indices vi was based on their capability to estimate leaf water content leaf n and their interaction as reported by different scholars the indices were limited to four spectral bands green red near infrared and red edge within multispec4c sensor considering these 2 factors the following indices were explored table 2 2 4 3 capability of vegetation indices to assess water n and their interaction the derived leaf water and n content were used to assess the suitability of the vis in assessing water and n and their interaction at different crop stages the analysis of variance anova was used to assess whether the vis differed significantly in function of the water and nitrogen treatment the capability of vi to distinguish leaf water n contents and the interactive effect of water and n was performed using the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 and radar charts 2 5 effectiveness of vegetation indices maps to distinguish different water and n combinations vegetation indices maps were developed to spatially differentiate areas with different water and n combinations in the field mwinuka et al 2021b the image mosaic was processed in rstudio software version 3 6 1 handled in respective bands using raster and rgdal packages team 2018 the plot function was further applied to generate vegetation indices maps 2 6 the relationship between vegetation indices and fruit yield the correlation between vegetation indices and fruit yield was assessed using the regression model the software used was ggplot2 package under rstudio version 3 6 1 the software was used to evaluate a linear relationship of fruit yield against the vegetation indices only results were considered where the coefficient of correlation r2 was at least 0 5 3 results 3 1 variation of vegetation indices to nitrogen treatments at different irrigation depths vegetation indices have shown to respond differently to n at different cropping stages the indices gndvi ndvi and osavi responded best to different n application rates at different irrigation treatments due to soil background reflectance the early crop development stage had no significant difference found among n treatments for any of the irrigation treatments at 100 i100 irrigation depth the gndvi increased significantly with increased n application at vegetative and full vegetative stages fig 4 in the vegetative and full vegetative stages for i80 two groups could be distinguished f100 and f75 vs f50 and f0 fig 5 however between f100 and f75 as well as between f50 and f0 no significant differences were found within the i60 treatment the calculated vis differed in function of n application between f100 f75 and f50 but not between f50 and f0 fig 6 similarly ndvi and osavi increased significantly when more n was applied at vegetative and full vegetative stages figure not shown during the vegetative stage the ndvi at i100 did not differ significantly between f100 and f75 figure not shown similar trends were observed for i80 and i60 irrigation treatments figure not shown in all irrigation treatments the ndvi for f0 was significantly lower compared to the rest the osavi also showed a good response to n application at all irrigation regimes figure not shown this is due to significant differences in the reflectance from the crop canopy as a result of water and nitrogen variation within the plant other vegetation indices such as grvi ndre evi2 savi and tdvi also increased when higher amounts of n were applied under different irrigation regimes figure not shown however these indices were unable to differentiate between specific n treatments 3 2 the response of vegetation indices to the interactive effect of water and n 3 2 1 the response of vegetation indices to leaf moisture content at different irrigation levels vegetation indices had different responses to varying leaf moisture content table 3 at the vegetative stage the tdvi had best performance in distinguishing the levels of canopy water stress at all levels of water application i100 i80 and i60 the gndvi ndvi and osavi were not capable of distinguishing between i100 and i80 while they distinguished i60 savi distinguished the plant canopy under i100 from other treatments during vegetative and full vegetative stages the evi2 grvi and ndre did not pick up on canopy differences caused by water stress in the vegetative stage at the full vegetative stage the evi2 gndvi grvi ndvi osavi and savi were all able to distinguish the high water stressed canopies under i60 from the other two treatments table 3 the tdvi and ndre failed to differentiate treatments at full vegetative stage 3 2 2 the response of vegetation indices to leaf n content at different n rates the variation of leaf n content differed in function of the n applied resulting in differences in vi table 4 at the vegetative stage gndvi performed well in differentiating between f100 f75 f50 and f0 the grvi ndvi and osavi were capable of discriminating f0 from the rest of the treatments savi tdvi and ndre had a weak capability to distinguish the plant n content irrespective of the irrigation treatment at the full vegetative stages gndvi performed best in differentiating between f100 f75 f50 and f0 table 4 the ndvi and osavi were capable of distinguishing f50 and f0 from the rest of the treatments the rest of the vegetation indices evi2 grvi savi tdvi and ndre had a weak performance in differentiating the variation of leaf n among treatments 3 2 3 the response of vegetation indices to the interaction between water and n different vegetation indices performed differently in distinguishing the interactive effect of water and n table 4 the gndvi ndvi and osavi showed a stronger capability in distinguishing between the different water and n treatments at vegetative and full vegetative stages the evi2 grvi savi tdvi and ndre showed weak responses to the different treatments in all crop development stages table 5 fig 7 during the vegetative stage gndvi showed the strongest capability in distinguishing between the various water and nitrogen treatments table 5 and fig 7 it was the only vi which was able to indicate a difference in canopy reflectance for i100f100 compared to the other treatments furthermore gndvi detected significant differences between the following 5 groups 1 100f100 2 i100f75 i80f100 and i80f75 3 i100f50 and i60f100 4 i80f50 and i60f75 and 5 i100f0 and i60f0 only i60f50 fell in both group 4 and group 5 ndvi performed reasonably well and was also able to detect 5 groups 1 i100f100 and i100f75 2 i80f100 and i80f75 3 i80f50 4 i80f0 5 i100f0 and i60f0 however ndvi was not able to detect differences among i60f100 i60f75 i60f50 and i100f75 osavi was also able to detect a few groups but overall performed less well compared to gndvi and ndvi in the vegetative stage osavi detected differences between groups 1 i100f100 and i10075 2 i100f50 and i80f50 3 i60f0 but was unable to significantly detect differences in canopy reflectance for the other treatments at full vegetative stage gndvi performed less compared to the vegetative stage in detecting water and nitrogen treatment effects gndvi was able to only detect significant differences between i100f100 i100f50 i80f0 and i60f100 ndvi detected significant differences between 5 groups 1 i100f100 and i100f75 2 i60f75 3 i100f50 and 4 i80f0 and i60f100 and 5 i60f0 however these groups differed with those compared in the vegetative stage osavi detected the same three groups as in the vegetative stage which were 1 i100f100 and i100f75 2 i100f50 and 3 i60f0 3 3 vegetation indices maps to assess the interactive effect of water and n based on the ability of the vi to detect differences in water and nutrient management gndvi and ndvi were used to develop the vi maps the vegetation indices maps depicted well the spatial variability of water and n treatments in the field at the full vegetative stage gndvi values ranged from 0 29 0 52 with values between 0 29 0 09 reflecting bare soils and canopy reflectance under the various treatments between 0 1 and 0 52 fig 8 the water and n combination which resulted in high yielding healthy plants showed a gndvi in the range 0 35 5 2 moderate yielding plants between 0 25 and 0 35 and in stressed low yielding between 0 1 and 0 25 likewise the ndvi showed spatial variability in function of the water and n treatment values during the full vegetative stage were in the range of 0 3 0 76 fig 8 with the canopy covered areas between 0 15 and 0 76 ndvi for the highest yielding treatments fell between 0 6 and 0 75 moderate yielding from 0 45 to 0 6 and low yielding treatments in the 0 1 0 3 range the maps therefore can be used to assess differences in canopy reflectance as a result of varying water and n conditions in the fields 3 4 the correlation of the vegetation indices to the end of the season fruit yield the correlation between the end of season yields and vegetation indices varied significantly during the early development stage there was a weak correlation of vegetation indices to the end of the season yields table 6 at the vegetative stage the ndvi r2 0 46 p 4 7 x 10 11 and osavi r2 0 47 p 4 1 x 10 11 showed a moderate correlation with the end of season yields during the full vegetative stage gndvi showed a better correlation with the end of season yields r2 0 47 p 2 3 x 10 11 compared to those in the vegetative stage table 6 the ndvi r2 0 53 p 5 9 x10 13 and osavi r2 0 52 p 2 8 x 10 9 also showed a better correlation with the end of season yields at the full vegetative stage however the ability to use vi in yield predictions remains limited as they are able to predict around 50 of the obtained yields 4 discussion 4 1 the variation of vegetation indices to nitrogen treatments at different irrigation depths vegetation indices showed a varying capability to distinguish n at different irrigation depths during the early cropping stages none of the vegetation indices were capable of differentiating n at varying levels of irrigation this is because most of the reflectance recorded was from the soil surface prudnikova et al 2019 the gndvi ndvi and osavi could distinguish differences in canopy reflectance in function of n application at vegetative and full vegetative stages across irrigation treatments this is related to the response of these vis to the chlorophyll and xanthophyll content which are related to crop water status zhang et al 2019 these findings are similar to earlier studies which assessed plant water status at varying n levels in different crops zhang et al 2019 recommended the use of ndvi in irrigation water management of maize crops due to its response to water stress bhandari et al 2018 got weak correlation of all ndvi and gndvi on their response to water n and their interaction in lettuce weak correlation of these vegetation indices in the lettuce crop might be caused by differences in chemical characteristics and leaf morphology of the canopy surface resulting in different responses to the incoming solar radiation shiratsuchi et al 2011 selected the red edge ndvi and the red band ndvi as they were capable at distinguishing the crop performance variation due to different irrigation levels and showed average capability to distinguish between n rates in corn production canopy n content was distinguished by different vegetation indices within the vegetative and full vegetative stages the study observed the capability of gndvi ndvi and osavi in distinguishing leaf n at different water regimes during the vegetative and full vegetative stages furthermore in the full vegetative gndvi performed slightly better than ndvi and osavi in its ability to detect differences in n application rates in the i100 and i60 treatments less so in the i80 treatment this is evidence that the spectral reflectance of african eggplant canopy in the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum responds accordingly to n variation prudnikova et al 2019 additionally elvanidi et al 2018 recommended the need for more research on the use of spectral based indices to detect n status for improving tomato growth under deficit irrigation contradicting results across different types of crops confirm that plants respond differently to incoming light spectra hence there is a need for plant specific calibrations 4 2 the response of vegetation indices to detect the interactive effect of water and n and predict eggplant yield in general the findings of this study indicated that water and nitrogen causes plant tissues in horticultural crops to reflect more in the nir and green spectral bands this has been reported for other crops such as wheat lint and pinto bean ballester et al 2019 kyratzis et al 2017 ranjan et al 2019 the interaction of water and n combination significantly affects the internal leaf structure causing a significant difference in the reflectance of the nir band of the electromagnetic radiation the reflectance within the green band was also significantly different in various treatments thus increasing the response of the gndvi the response of these bands in numerous water and n combinations was thus capable to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plants among the vegetation indices tested the gndvi ndvi and osavi were moderately sensitive to the interaction of water and n at vegetative and full vegetative stages at the vegetative cropping stage the gndvi and ndvi performed slightly better compared to osavi in detecting differences in canopy reflectance across treatments gndvi was able to detect both the high and low n application levels the gndvi therefore can be used to show areas with water and n stress within the field candiago et al 2015 furthermore gndvi performed better in detecting the response of african eggplant to different n levels under i100 whilst ndvi seemed to perform stronger in detecting differences of plant response to n levels under i80 the results are in agreement with candiago et al 2015 who found that gndvi was capable in detecting changes in plant chlorophyll and those of bhandari et al 2018 for ndvi osavi was also sensitive in distinguishing treatments with highest levels of inputs water and n from the rest the index was sensitive to showing a decline in water and n as most treatments with 60 water have low values of indices as compared to those with 80 and 100 water furthermore gndvi in the vegetative stage allowed for a clearer distinction between groups in function of the water and n treatment gndvi was able to classify 11 out of 12 treatments into 5 groups treatments in these groups resembled similarities in canopy reflectance for example whilst i100f100 was clearly differentiated from all other treatments the reflectance between 75 application of n under i100 and i80 was found to be similar to 100 of n application under i80 similarly 50 of n application under i100 showed a similar average reflectance to 100 n application under i60 this further confirms the partial ability of plants to compensate for either water or nitrogen deficiency if one of these two inputs is available in higher amounts mwinuka et al 2021a the fact that a certain amount of irrigation water can optimize the efficiency of nutrients uptake by the plant is an important criterion to consider in agricultural water management xiang et al 2019 at the full vegetative stage gndvi performed less well than ndvi as the latter was able to classify 7 treatments out of 12 into 5 groups these groups resembled mainly the combinations of high water and nitrogen inputs and those with higher deficiencies in water or nitrogen the complexity of n and water interaction on plant performance resulted in gndvi ndvi and osavi showing a moderate potential to predict end of the season fruit yield these results are similar to sultana et al 2014 and tuvdendorj et al 2019 who found that the ndvi could predict wheat yield except for ndvi and osavi at full vegetative stages correlation was below 50 results in this study showed a lower correlation compared to the earlier findings of mwinuka et al 2021b for predicting african eggplant based on irrigation treatment alone the variability in capability of gndvi ndvi and osavi to detect differences in canopy performance and the moderate correlation suggest the need for a combined vi approach developing a decision tree using a combination of all three vi and both stages could support better treatment identification as individual threshold detection is difficult given the interactive effect of water and nitrogen on plant development 4 3 vegetation indices maps vegetation indices maps were able to identify different water and nitrogen treatments during the vegetative and full vegetative stages of crop development these findings are similar to wang et al 2016 omer et al 2017 among others the differences in canopy reflectance are due to different plant chemical and physiological properties caused by the variation of water and n within the field the healthier plants are identified by a higher value of vi i e green color on the map whilst unhealthy plants showed lower values i e yellow color on the map the vi was significantly higher p 0 01 when they were calculated using the nir and red spectral bands such as ndvi and osavi in agreement with these findings ge et al 2019 found that the highest reflectance of nir was observed in healthy plants due to multiple reflections of the turgid cell structure this concludes that identification of spatial variation in water and n management for horticultural crops under tropical sub humid conditions can be carried out using vegetation indices maps 5 conclusions this study aimed to assess the ability of uav based multispectral vegetation indices in detecting the interactive effect of water and nitrogen management in irrigated horticultural crop production under tropical sub humid climate vegetation indices showed a varying capability of distinguishing between crop responses following different water and n treatments and their combination for instance the tdvi performed best in detecting leaf moisture changes as a function of irrigation treatment irrespective of the n treatment at the vegetative stage nitrogen variation within the plant canopy was best distinguished by gndvi during vegetative and full vegetative stages irrespective of irrigation treatment the ndvi and osavi worked well to differentiate canopy n at full vegetative stage when it came to water and nitrogen interaction gndvi ndvi and osavi potential in detecting significant differences between treatments varied this is related to the spectral bands used and ability to detect changes in the plant tissue as well as the plants ability to moderately compensate for water or nitrogen limitations the study revealed that if one of the inputs are less limiting the effect on canopy reduction is less pronounced challenging the differentiation using a vi and therefore ability to predict season yields generally the study observed that vegetation indices are most effective when they are used to assess water and n separately the interactive effect of water and n on african eggplant would require crop specific multi vi calibration given the advantages that all three vi showed for specific treatments the fact that a certain amount of irrigation water can optimize the efficiency of nutrients uptake by the plant is an important criterion to consider in developing crop specific vi based

9549,water shortage is the main constraint resulting in low crop yields in arid and semiarid areas where irrigation is essential to sustain agricultural production unreasonable irrigation will not effectively improve crop yield but will cause a waste of water resources and a decrease in water productivity the objectives of this study were intended to investigate the variability of yield and water productivity wp as a function of irrigation amount time and frequency and to explore optimal irrigation of winter wheat for improving grain yield and water productivity over a 60 year of long term meteorological data 1961 2020 a water driven model aquacrop model was used to reproduce crop growth and yield responses to changes in water supply with a total of 625 irrigation scenarios of irrigation amount and time the results showed that there has been no significant change in seasonal et0 reference evapotranspiration of winter wheat over the last 60 years instead seasonal precipitation during the winter wheat growing cycle displayed a decreasing trend potentially increasing the risk of meteorological drought despite the crop et has remained stable at around 370 mm for the past 60 seasons the grain yield and wp have steadily increased as the cumulative temperature increased in all three typical meteorological years crop average yield and et were considerably improved under irrigation conditions compared with that in non irrigated rainfed the total irrigation amounts of 90 120 and 150 mm with two irrigation times in the wet normal and dry years respectively could achieve higher yields as well as the wp and iwp consequently the optimal irrigation schedules in the wet normal and dry years were determined to be first irrigation in the wintering stage with 90 mm and second irrigation in the jointing stage with 0 30 60 mm respectively this work demonstrates that the aquacrop model has a reliable accuracy for revealing crop growth and production under water deficit conditions and provides a technical means of application for formulating optimal irrigation schedules keywords aquacrop irrigation schedule yield water productivity winter wheat 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is a major crop grown in the guanzhong plain an important cereal production area in shaanxi province the guanzhong plain accounts for approximately 9 of the total area and 47 of the total cultivated land of the province but produces about 89 of the total wheat grain production in the province nbsc 2020 in this semiarid or sub humid area the source of water supply for the winter wheat growth and yield is primarily dependent on available precipitation and or irrigation although annual precipitation is around 650 mm the unevenly spatial and temporal distributed precipitation results in only 230 mm half of the required water amount during the winter wheat growing season october may meanwhile irrigation in this area is inadequate as only half of the arable land can be irrigated in 2019 the unit yield of winter wheat in this region was only 3 9 t ha 1 well below the average level of the county 5 6 t ha 1 nbsc 2020 therefore there is an urgent to improve water productivity wp and productivity in response to growing pressures on water resource shortage since the last century how to allocate limited irrigation water for wheat during the growing cycle to achieve maximize yield water productivity or profits was a tough problem due to the variability in soil and environment zhang et al 2017 in general a high yield was often matched with a high irrigation amount and low water productivity deficit irrigation one of the water saving irrigation strategies widely used in water scarce areas rationally supplies irrigation during the sensitive or critical crop growth stage to achieve high yield or prevent a major no significant decline in yield production kang et al 2000 since the 2000s extensive field experiments have been carried out all around the world to investigate wheat growth and yield response to deficit irrigation kang et al 2002 li et al 2005 chen et al 2010 tari 2016 thapa et al 2019 other studies also proposed empirical production functions of water supply or water consumption and crop yield such as linear dar et al 2017 quadratic li et al 2005 wang et al 2013a negative exponential cooper et al 2020 functions however a common issue in these experiential studies was that the results were usually site and season specific making extrapolation beyond the location and climate unreliable different crop responses could result from the same irrigation schedule in diverse regions soil types and climates seasons based on the advance of crop water requirements mechanisms the simulation models were developed to elucidate how crop growth and production responded to the various soil water environments some studies integrated optimization methods into a simply coupling system of crop water production functions and soil water balance for example shang and mao 2006 developed a simulation optimization model for optimal irrigation timing and proposed different irrigation scenarios for three initial soil water storage layers of 0 1 m wen et al 2017 proposed a simulation based optimization model for optimizing spring wheat irrigation scheduling under mulching conditions although the global optimum solution could be obtained in the simulation optimization model by some optimization algorithms e g genetic algorithms simulated annealing algorithms the pure crop water production functions were simplified and empirical that unlikely to be sufficiently generic li et al 2018 and some of the scheduling may difficult to implement in irrigation management in practical application for instance shang and mao 2006 proposed total of five times irrigation during the winter wheat growing season of march to may in north china which was arduous by the border irrigation crop growth models also known as agroecosystem models have been developed over the last few decades from single physiological growth process simulation to the whole growth process and have been updated and refined to simulate the dynamic of variables of interest under various water fertilizer conditions and field management practices in the recent studies most of well known models have been calibrated evaluated and validated the performances to simulate crop growth and yield production under various soil water conditions and irrigation scenarios e g dssat ceres wheat attia et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 swap eitzinger et al 2004 wang et al 2021 aquacrop iqbal et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 apsim chen et al 2010 ahmed et al 2016 and rzwqm2 saseendran et al 2015 xu et al 2020 in addition to the evaluation of the model by experimental data other researchers focused on the model application for long term simulation chen et al 2010 attia et al 2016 xu et al 2020 different crop models have essential differences in crop response to water stress for instance the dssat and rzwqm2 model interpreted water stress by two stress factors that linear related to potential transpiration and potential root water uptake jones et al 2003 the swap model described the deterioration inducing by the water stress for crop canopy assimilation and senescence based on soil water potential van dam et al 1997 compared with other models the aquacrop model is a water driven model which accounted for the effects of soil water deficit on various growth processes i e canopy expansion canopy senescence stomatal conductance and harvest index moreover multiple stress functions e g linear convex and logistic could be selected to reproduce the response of different crops to soil water variations since the release of the model in 2009 hundreds of studies have been published to test validate and apply for a variety of purposes e g characterizing the crop response to water stress developing deficit irrigation schedules improving farm irrigation management and assessing the potential increase in production vanuytrecht et al 2014 numerous studies have been conducted over the last few decades to evaluate and validate the performance of the aquacrop for simulating crop growth and production soil moisture variability around the world andarzian et al 2011 validated the aquacrop model to simulate wheat under deficit water conditions in a hot dry environment and suggested applying four irrigations 200 mm for wet and normal years and six irrigations 300 mm for dry years wang et al 2013b evaluated the aquacrop model for simulating winter wheat under five irrigation treatments on china s loess plateau who reported two irrigations on over wintering and turning green stags could save water without reducing yields iqbal et al 2014 tested and validated the ability of aquacrop model to simulate wheat growth and production by both field experiments and long term measured and demonstrated the model has a reliable accuracy furthermore toumi et al 2016 not only evaluated the performance of aquacrop modelling for different irrigations but proposed the threshold of the root zone water depletion of 0 6 could improve the wheat irrigation management however most of the studies only investigated the performances of a few pre specified alternative irrigation scenarios and one of the best scenario targeting higher yield wp or profits was recommended as the optimal in the previous studies therefore it was unclear if any other irrigation schedule that was not user defined scenarios could achieve better results or if the recommended irrigation schedule could perform consistent performance across the different meteorological seasons therefore to explore optimal irrigation of winter wheat for improving grain yield and water productivity the full permutations of irrigation amount and time with a total of 625 irrigation scenarios were comprehensively analyzed in this study the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 a famous water driven crop simulation model developed by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations was used to reproduce crop growth and yield production furthermore the 60 years of long term meteorological data 1961 2020 covering the study area were also employed the main objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the dynamic of climate i e temperature precipitation reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop production i e grain yield evapotranspiration et and wp characteristics under both rainfed and irrigated conditions over the last 60 years 1961 2020 2 investigate the variability of yield and wp as a function of irrigation amount and frequency and 3 explore the optimal irrigation strategies considering crop yields wp and iwp in three typical meteorological years 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study focused on the guanzhong plain a conventional grain based area with an area of about 5 5 million hectares located in northwest china 34 00 n 35 30 n 106 30 e 110 30 e fig 1 the climate is a semiarid warm temperature and continental monsoon with an average annual temperature of approximately 12 13 c and water surface evaporation of 800 1000 mm the elevation ranges from 325 to 900 m with an average of 500 m the average annual precipitation in this region is 650 mm while the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven with about 70 of precipitation falling in the summer season june to september soil texture is a moderately well drained loamy classified as the loam and silt loam according to the harmonized world soil database http www fao org land water databases and software hwsd en containing approximately 20 clay 45 silt and 35 sand the average field capacity wilting point bulk density and ph are 33 cm3 cm 3 10 cm3 cm 3 1 41 g cm 3 and 7 8 respectively zhang et al 2018 in terms of agriculture the wheat summer maize rotation cropping system is commonly conducted in this area typically winter wheat is planted from mid october to early june of the following year and summer maize is sown as soon as when wheat is harvested from june to october normally irrigation is not required during the maize growing season except for extreme drought events however during the winter wheat growing season effective precipitation is less than 200 mm less than half of the crop water demand restricting wheat production moreover more than 50 of farmland relies on rainfed mainly located in the east and most irrigated farming is distributed in the west and middle zhou et al 2020 2 2 field experiment a deficit irrigation experiment was conducted for two consecutive years 2013 2015 different irrigation quotas and timings were designed to respond to various water stress degrees two irrigation levels of 80 mm and 40 mm were planned according to the winter wheat water demands chen et al 2006 three irrigation timings during winter wheat growth stages were applied hence a total of eight deficit irrigation treatments were implemented with each of three replicates table 1 winter wheat was planted on 15 october 2013 and 2014 and the final harvests were on 7 june 2014 and 2 june 2015 respectively the plot size was 4 m 2 m with 0 4 m adjacent space and all treatments were randomly assigned a 1 5 m deep waterproof layer was placed between each plot to prevent soil water exchange besides a mobile shelter was equipped to exclude rainfall from getting in the plots in each plot the leaf area index lai was measured weekly when after reviving stage using the sunscan canopy analysis system delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the measurements were taken from the average of three readings across the plot the canopy cover was calculated from the lai using an empirical equation provided by nielsen et al 2012 the aboveground biomass was measured after lai measurements and the dry matter was determined by drying about 15 plants at 75 c for 72 h grain was harvest at full maturity stage within 1 m2 area and the yield was taken by threshing and air drying to constant weight 2 3 model description the aquacrop model was mainly focused on simulating the crop aboveground biomass and grain yield production as a function of water productivity wp based on the previous water production function proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 the aquacrop evolved this approach and separated the et into crop transpiration tr and soil evaporation e to avoid the confounding effect of nonproductive consumptive water use e eq 1 steduto et al 2009 1 b wp tr where b is cumulative aboveground biomass production kg m 2 wp is the water productivity kg m 2 mm and tr is the daily crop transpiration mm day 1 similar to other crop models the aquacrop model assembled a soil plant atmosphere continuum spac for water interaction in daily steps by coupling three basic modules of soil water budget crop growth and atmosphere components araya et al 2010 additionally some management practices such as irrigation fertility and weeds that impact on crop development and grain production were also referred the main processes of crop development and grain production were as follow 1 crop development aquacrop used canopy cover cc to describe crop development rather than leaf area index and to calculate crop transpiration during leaf expansion aging and senescence 2 crop transpiration aquacrop determined crop transpiration by multiplying the et0 by a crop coefficient the et0 could be calculated by the fao penman monteith equation using several weather variables the crop coefficient was proportional to cc and adjusted with crop canopy development 3 aboveground biomass the biomass was accumulated as a function of crop transpiration and water productivity eq 1 the normalized water productivity wp related to atmospheric evaporative demand and air co2 concentrations was used to make the model valid for different climates including future climate scenarios e g special report on emissions scenarios sres and representative concentration pathways rcp hsiao et al 2009 in aquacrop the wp was set to a constant of 15 20 g m 2 for c3 crops like cereal wheat raes et al 2009c 4 grain yield formation the yield was partitioned from biomass by means of the harvest index hi the hi in aquacrop is not a constant but gradually linear increase to the reference harvest index hio cultivar specific starting from flowering to maturity as mentioned above aquacrop is a water driven model that specifically describes the effects of soil water changes on crop growth with the exception of temperature fertility and salinity stresses five water stress coefficients were incorporated into the model to update transpiration canopy expansion harvest index and root expansion etc further detailed descriptions of model mechanism and application were reported by hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009b steduto et al 2009 2 4 input data and parameters determination the input data of the aquacrop model version 6 1 could be divided into two groups driving variables and parameters including meteorological data crop data management data and soil data the descriptions and definitions were as follows 2 4 1 weather data the meteorological data was used to drive the model interacting with crop and soil five kinds of variables of air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind speed rainfall and sunshine hours radiation were minimum inputs into the aquacrop model the daily et0 was calculated from these factors by et0 calculation an integrated module based on the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 a long term historical meteorological data 1961 2020 covering the study area was gained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn different climatic conditions have significant effects on crop growth as a result three typical meteorological years hydrological year precipitation year of the wet normal and dry years were considered in this study the method of drought index di guo et al 2012 was used as eq 2 to evaluate variations of precipitation among different years 2 di p m σ where p is the precipitation mm m is the average precipitation of years 1961 2020 mm and σ is the standard error for precipitation di differentiated typical meteorological years as the wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 years to eliminate the influence of the precipitation data outside the winter wheat growth stage the precipitation data during the winter wheat growth season from october to may of the following year was used in calculating di finally 19 wet years 19 normal years and 21 dry years were achieved with the average values of 305 mm 235 mm and 177 mm respectively the monthly precipitation and corresponding mean air temperature in three typical meteorological years during winter wheat growing seasons were depicted in fig 2 2 4 2 crop characteristics crop parameters in the aquacrop model were classified as conservative cultivar specific and non conservative crop parameters raes et al 2009a conservative crop parameters such as the temperature or stress threshold and normalized biomass water productivity did not change substantially with time management practices geographic location or climate whereas the cultivar specific and non conservative parameters may need to be adjusted depending on cultivars environmental conditions and planting methods during the decade numerous studies have been worked to calibrate and validate aquacrop model in the guanzhong plain region under various application conditions such as irrigation teng et al 2015 silvestro et al 2017b remote sensing jin et al 2017 silvestro et al 2017a and mulching liu et al 2017 given that prior knowledge were achieved in most studies covering this study region and corroborated reliability of model parameterization related parameters were referenced directly and the calibration process would not be repeated winter wheat parameters determination and sources were presented in table 2 2 4 3 management practices the management data was an essential part in simulating field practices and events which mainly included field management and irrigation management in respect of the field management the events of fertilizer film mulching weed infestation and field runoff were involved in this study the soil fertility was treated as adequate that non limiting for crop canopy water productivity and biomass production moreover no film mulch was applied for winter wheat planting the surface runoff was prevented effectively by soil bunds of 0 3 m height and excess water from irrigation and rainfall was assumed to be stored in soil layers weed was inevitable on farmland and applying herbicides to control weed was common practice hence the level of weed management was put at very good ranked second after perfect and corresponding parameters e g relative cover and weed stress degree followed default irrigation management includes irrigation methods and irrigation events border irrigation one of the surface irrigation techniques widely applied in this area was employed in this study two important variables of application time and amount need to be determined in each irrigation event to develop a schedule lots of studies have been conducted in wheat physiology and ecology to investigate critical water requirement growth stage and reveal the growth response to water stress and reported controversial results for different critical water requirement stages e g seeding stage yao et al 2015 jointing stage zheng et al 2016 anthesis stage li et al 2005 and filling stage attia et al 2016 therefore the critical water demand period of the entire winter wheat growing seasons was attributed to four phenological stages as over wintering nov feb reviving green feb mar stem jointing mar apr and grain filling may based on the precipitation data during winter wheat growing in 60 years the maximum and minimum precipitation were about 450 mm and 140 mm respectively the seasonal water demand of winter wheat was approximately 400 450 mm chen et al 2006 which meant additional irrigation was unnecessary when precipitation was abundant but much more water needed to be supplemented with a rainfall scarcity condition therefore various irrigation amount gradients of 0 mm 30 mm 60 mm 90 mm and 120 mm were designed and arranged finally a total of 625 irrigation scenarios have been produced to different soil water status table 3 2 4 4 soil characteristics the two parts of groundwater and soil profile in the soil module should be filled in the depth of groundwater in the study area was up to 20 m which difficult to supply groundwater to crop growth by soil capillary pressure thus groundwater was negated in this study for soil profile several soil characteristics such as soil texture thickness and retention properties were determined according to the harmonized world soil database hwsd two soil types of loam and silt loam were distributed in guanzhong plain in the hwsd soil was divided into topsoil layer with 0 30 cm depth and subsoil layer with 30 100 cm depth consequently the same soil layers were arranged in aquacrop model the soil properties for inputting in the model were shown in table 4 2 5 model application following the preparation of all input variables and parameters a packaged project file was created to simulate winter wheat growth and grain production using historical meteorological data spanning the years 1961 2020 the aquacrop plug in program was used for iterative runs of 625 irrigation scenarios other indicators in addition to the crop grain yield such as the wp and irrigation water productivity iwp describing the ratio of water use of crop metabolism to water lost were considered and evaluated to explore and determine the reasonable irrigation schedule in crop production the wp is defined as crop grain yield per unit water consumption as eq 3 the iwp is defined as the quantity of yield produced by one cubic meter of water supplied which is also called irrigation water productivity reported by molden 1997 eq 4 furthermore the maximum profits of crop production under different irrigation schedules were discussed in the study area a policy of tiered pricing mechanism for water use was implied strictly indicating that the more water irrigation the higher unit price paid eq 5 3 wp g y 10 et kg m 3 4 iwp g y i kg m 3 5 profits g y g p i i p 1 i quota g y g p i i p 2 i quota yuan ha 1 where gy et and i refer to winter wheat grain yield kg ha 1 crop evapotranspiration mm and total irrigation amount mm respectively gp is grain price yuan kg 1 i p 1 and i p 2 are basic water price and progressive water pricing respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance evaluation fig 3 shows the simulated and measured canopy cover under eight deficit irrigation treatments during two winter wheat growing seasons results indicated that the simulated canopy cover had good agreement with the measured value in most cases in both growing seasons with rmse ranging from 4 9 to 10 4 and from 1 9 to 4 8 respectively wheat canopy covers during the second year average rmse 7 7 rrmse 10 7 were better simulated than that of the first year average rmse 4 1 rrmse 5 1 besides the simulation accuracy for all 80 mm irrigation quota treatments 2013 2014 average rmse 7 4 rrmse 9 9 2014 2015 average rmse 3 6 rrmse 4 4 was slightly higher than that of 40 mm irrigation quota treatments 2013 2014 average rmse 8 0 rrmse 11 5 2014 2015 average rmse 4 5 rrmse 5 7 in two growing seasons this expression was consistent with other studies reports that the performance of models would be decreased with the aggravation of water stress fang et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a the large discrepancies were mainly presented before around 180 dap and well followed in the late stages overall the global simulated accuracy by aquacrop model referencing from previous studies in this region presented acceptable compared with the reports by others wang et al 2013b toumi et al 2016 ran et al 2017 fig 4 depicts the comparison between the simulated and measured grain yield for different deficit irrigation treatments in both growing seasons although an apparent underestimation was observed when yield exceeded 5 5 t ha 1 overall simulated results were in good agreement with measures with r2 rmse and mre of 0 84 0 52 t ha 1 and 8 5 respectively in general the aquacrop model provided the dependable capability for revealing the variability of yield to water deficit and could be extrapolated to more irrigation scenarios 3 2 dynamic of climate characteristics and water demand climatic conditions are the determinant for crop development resulting in diverse growing status the temporal dynamics of climate characteristics and water demand over nearly 60 years in the study area was shown in fig 5 the annual and seasonal during the winter wheat cycle oct to may of the following year were separated the et0 an index of water demand intensity displayed a significant downward trend p 0 01 in annual value whereas the seasonal et0 of winter wheat showed no significant change in the past 60 years according to both the pearson correlation r and mann kendall trend test z thus the decrease in water demand was mainly concentrated on summer crops e g maize and soybeans on the contrary although the precipitation fluctuated noticeably in inter annual no significant declining was depicted the explicit decrease in precipitation during the winter wheat growing cycle was observed revealing that the risk of crops suffering from water stress in the future would be aggravated particularly in a rainfed agricultural area the inner annual variation of precipitation took on a parabolic shape from oct to may with the trough appearing in dec and jan fig 2 significant differences in precipitation were observed in the three precipitation years of the wet normal and dry years subtle change was only during the winter season when winter wheat was dormant the cumulative temperatures for both annual and seasonal showed consistent that consecutively increased over years with an average annual growth rate of 8 3 and 7 1 c per year respectively the temperature variation of inner annual was consistent with rainfall with the average minimum temperature of 0 5 c in january fig 2 no significant differences in precipitation characteristics were observed among the three typical meteorological years of wet normal and dry years 3 3 variability in simulated crop grain yield and wp rainfed agriculture is highly dependent on different weather conditions precipitation is the only source of crop water supply as shown in fig 6 the dynamic of yield presented a significant increasing trend during these years despite the large volatility similar result was observed in the global trend turner and asseng 2005 in natural growth conditions although the variation of yield is governed by many factors such as temperature precipitation and radiation it is nearly in conformity with precipitation with high values in wet years and lows in dry years however crop et variation remained stable at around 290 mm with no significant downward these changes resulted in a substantial improvement in wp from 1961 to 2020 with an average value of 1 3 kg m 3 results of the simulated et and wp under all produced irritation practice indicated that although different precipitation years were scattered during these years the average yield of winter wheat was significantly increased from around 4 0 6 0 t ha 1 with an average of 5 0 t ha 1 vs 3 7 t ha 1 of rainfed meanwhile the annual et was also considerably raised under irrigation conditions remaining stable at 370 mm the maximum annual et of about 450 mm was observed in a normal year the wp was derived from crop yield and potential evapotranspiration and therefore presented similar variation characteristics the average wp has increased steadily from 1 0 kg m 3 in 1961 1 6 kg m 3 at present the change in wp was not noticeable after irrigation in most seasons and the prominent improvements were only observed in a few dry years such as 1978 2000 2005 and 2008 as a result the effects of different precipitation years for yield and wp were nearly eliminated in the irrigation scenarios the increase of simulated wheat yield and wp during these decades could be attributed to the variations of atmospheric co2 concentrations and cumulative temperature the main effect of air co2 value was to adjust water productivity wp related to biomass accumulation eq 1 presenting negative or positive effects when co2 concentrations were below and above the reference value 369 41 ppm respectively raes et al 2009b on the other hand the results also agreed with the points of fang et al 2017 chen et al 2019 that grain yield was continuously improved with a higher accumulated temperature with respect to crop et in the crop physiology mechanism christy et al 2018 and guo et al 2010 found that crop et decreased as co2 concentrations enhanced due to crop stromal closure reducing transpiration on the contrary rising temperatures could increase both soil evaporation and crop transpiration by driving vapor pressure hatfield and dold 2019 eventually the stable et over the decades in the study was in agreement with suggestions from mo et al 2009 and broberg et al 2019 who suggested that the change of crop et was subtle with climate warming due to the counterpoise provided by the elevated co2 concentrations and cumulated temperature 3 4 comparison of crop yield et and wp for different typical meteorological years fig 7 showed the comparison of yield water demand and wp under rainfed and irrigation conditions in different precipitation years the predictable results of high production in wet years and low yield in dry years were confirmed for rainfed the variability of yield in wet years was dramatic as compared with that in normal and dry years similarly crop et presented a significant difference in three typical years dropping an average 320 260 mm as seasonal precipitation decreased the average and median wp was 1 3 kg m 3 for all wet normal and dry years under rainfed condition higher wp values were found in wet and normal years but lower values were existed probably in both wet and dry years compared to the non irrigation condition crop average grain yield and water demand have improved considerably after irrigation rising 11 6 28 9 and 57 6 of yield and 12 8 24 9 and 43 5 of et in wet normal and dry years respectively fig 7 the higher yield and et of 624 irrigation scenarios were acquired in the dry year but showed more variability than that in the other two precipitation years under the irrigation conditions the performance of precipitation for dominating crop yield was diminished and more precipitation usually induced a decrease in solar global radiation and sunshine hours affecting crop photosynthate production chen et al 2013 resulting in average yield in dry years being higher than the wet and normal year however there was only a slight enhancement in the wp when after irrigation keeping the level at 1 3 kg m 3 moreover no differentiation of wp among three precipitation years was presented 3 5 effects of irrigation management scenarios the changes in yield wp and iwp under different irrigation scenarios were shown in fig 8 the increase in crop yield as a function of irrigation amount was displayed in three typical meteorological years with dry years being the most pronounced similar results were also reported in xu et al 2020 in the dry year the variation of yield ranged from about 3 3 t ha 1 non irrigation to a maximum 5 35 t ha 1 with the wp varying between 1 25 and 1 40 kg m 3 the iwp was dropped from 13 to 1 kg m 3 as the increased irrigation amount considering the potential uncertainty and accuracy of the model an assumption from shang and mao 2006 that differences within 5 of maximum yield were ignored was still followed in this study comparable results were also observed for both normal and wet years but the variation range of 5 of maximum yield was widened reasonable irrigation should factor in both final yield and water productivity less irrigation not produced high yield and wp despite obtained a large iwp and more irrigation could acquire higher yield but wasted water for soil storage and deep percolation since the water input exceeded crop demand besides other studies have confirmed that deep percolation and nitrate leaching would be raised with the increase of irrigation amount li et al 2015 xu et al 2020 results presented that almost maximum yield 5 difference could be achieved when total irrigation amount only needed around 90 120 and 150 mm for wet normal and dry years respectively these irrigation amounts were consistent with the recommended values of 75 120 and 150 mm from norm of water intake for industries of shannxi province db61 t 943 2014 in this study irrigation management scenarios were created based on four critical periods of water demand thus the same irrigation amount was applied at different irrigation times and quotas resulting different yield and wp responses under the same irrigation amount frequent irrigation would increase the labor burden once the yield and wp were not be effectively improved fig 9 showed the variations in crop yield wp and iwp as a function of irrigation amount and frequency in three typical meteorological years in the dry year the yield has been improved with the increase of irrigation times when the total irrigation amount was less than about 200 mm fig 9 a same performances were observed in the normal and wet years but the increase rates were slower fig 9 b c results from the black column the 5 difference from maximum yield indicated that almost maximum yields of 5 1 4 8 and 4 6 t ha 1 respectively in dry normal and wet years could be achieved with only 2 3 times irrigation the variation trends of wp with irrigation amount and times were consistent in different precipitation years fig 9 d f the wp remained stable with rainfed condition at all of the irrigation times when irrigation amount was less than about 120 mm and then was improved to the maximum with both increases in irrigation amount and times but the wp would be reduced to the minimum with continuous applying of irrigation results of the wp also revealed crop et variability with a trend that was similar to changes in grain yield when total irrigation amount was less than 120 mm the increase rate of et was consistent with that of the yield resulting in a stable level for all irrigation times in three precipitation years then the crop et continued to increase with more irrigation amount but the yield changed slightly leading to a significant decrease of wp the variations of the iwp in three precipitation years were consistent as shown in fig 9 h g with the more irrigation the lower iwp the maximum value up to 14 kg m 3 was presented in minimum irrigation of 30 mm theoretically using the single iwp to determine the optimal irrigation schedule was unreasonable as the yield effects were not taken into account which was impractical for agricultural production 3 6 optimizing the irrigation scheduling previous section has displayed the variations of the yield wp and iwp under different irrigation scenarios in three precipitation years hence it is important to figure out which irrigation schedule is the optimal before determining the optimal irrigation schedule several criteria must be considered and assumed 1 the yield wp and iwp were important indicators but not the only factor a hypothesis in the last section that differences within 5 of maximum yield be treated as the same value was to be followed to conserve water resources 2 another problem in terms of irrigation times or frequency should be considered unlike the large scale agricultural production in other countries field planting in the study area is still done by families characterizing by the less arable land per capita low agricultural mechanization and a shortage of effective labor therefore the reduction of irrigation frequency can effectively save labor and improve irrigation efficiency 3 the irrigation quote for field practice should also be regarded in general border irrigation was the most common irrigation method in winter wheat planting and the shape of fields of the owner was usually elongated with about 5 10 m width and 80 200 m length which hardly guaranteed irrigation uniformity under a lower irrigation quota xu et al 2019 table 5 displayed the results of the simulated yield and wp of the top five irrigation scenarios in three typical meteorological years in the wet year all of the top five irrigation scenarios had nearly the same response to yield 4 7 t ha 1 and wp 1 3 kg m 3 with a total of 90 mm irrigation in different irrigation periods irrigation was applied in the over wintering stage for all scenarios but it was inconsistent in other stages only the irrigation scenario of is 622 has one irrigation implementation with 90 mm in the over wintering stage that was chosen as the ideal irrigation scheme in wet year in the normal year the irrigation scenario of is 573 irrigating 60 mm in wintering and 60 mm in jointing and is 597 irrigating 90 mm in wintering and 30 mm in jointing produced comparable winter wheat yield with a minimum water demand of 120 mm to obtain an adequate yield in the dry year the total irrigation amount was increased by at least 150 mm and the majority of these scenarios occurred in wintering and jointing stages only two irrigations were required for the is 572 and is 548 one in 90 mm of wintering and 60 mm of jointing and another in a reversed arrangement consequently two irrigation schedules with comparable capability for winter wheat production were proposed table 6 irrigation of both plans 1 and 2 was implemented in the wintering and jointing stages of winter wheat growing seasons with the same water amount in addition to the slight difference in irrigation quota the plan 1 had advantage of reducing one time irrigation in wet years practically the second irrigation amount was usually not certain due to the unknown precipitation years prior the growth cycle as a result the most effective wheat production would be achieved with a conservative irrigation scenario of 90 60 mm in wintering and 60 90 mm in the jointing stage similar studies have been complied to investigate optimal irrigation schedule based on different models ma et al 2015 proposed the optimal irrigation times were specified at winter dormancy and heading stages for winter wheat in ncp by evaluating several irrigation scenarios using the swap model zhou et al 2018 used the ceres wheat model to evaluate eight irrigation scenarios for winter wheat growth and reported that irrigation of 75 mm at both jointing and anthesis stages was the most suitable strategy for getting the highest yield and wp xu et al 2020 investigated the irrigation and fertilization in wheat maize rotation system by rzwqm2 model and pointed out that the best irrigation strategies for wheat were two three and four irrigations in wet normal and dry years respectively wang et al 2021 considered possible future climate change for winter wheat based on the swap model and suggested that one irrigation at the jointing stage and two irrigations at the jointing and heading stages could ensure high yield and water productivity 3 7 maximum benefit potential for the planter the primary goal of farming is to maximize profits fig 10 displayed the maximum profits from crop production under different irrigation levels with the increase in irrigation amount the total profit increased first and then dropped once the maximum income was reached the profits in the wet and normal years were more stable than those in the dry year the maximum profits were achieved with irrigation amounts of 240 180 and 150 mm for dry normal and wet years respectively these total amounts were roughly 1 6 times more than the schedule proposed in the previous section but the profit increment was only 4 on average compared with optimal irrigation scenarios overall the yield was decisive for profit variation despite some fluctuation by tiered pricing the main reason can be attributed to the sublet difference in water price with average water prices of 0 30 and 0 33 yuan m 3 for tier 1 and tier 2 respectively the insignificant price difference rendered the tiered pricing policy ineffective 4 conclusions irrigation time and irrigation quota determining the irrigation schedule should also be identified reliably for agricultural sustainable development this study explored the optimal irrigation schedule of winter wheat by the aquacrop model for improving grain yield and water productivity in different precipitation years from 1961 2020 results showed that higher irrigation could produce a higher yield but the incremental yield would be significantly decreased with more irrigation results revealed that the total irrigation amounts of 90 120 and 150 mm for the wet normal and dry years could achieve excellent yields respectively and more irrigation consumption only improved yield by less than 5 the over wintering stage and jointing stage were the most sensitive water requirement stages and irrigation at these growth stages achieved high yield as well as wp and iwp therefore optimal irrigation recommendations were only two irrigations with the first irrigation in the wintering stage of 90 mm and the second irrigation in the jointing stage of 0 30 60 mm in the wet normal and dry years respectively beyond the previous studies that proposing the optimal irrigation based on several irrigation validations this work comprehensively explored the variability of yield wp and iwp under different irrigation amounts timings and precipitation years in a semiarid area of china these methods and results provide scientific means and basis for guiding agricultural irrigation management it is noticing that the irrigation quota proposed in this study is the net irrigation requirement without including potential losses caused by irrigation projects the gross water intake for irrigation should be updated by the effective

9549,water shortage is the main constraint resulting in low crop yields in arid and semiarid areas where irrigation is essential to sustain agricultural production unreasonable irrigation will not effectively improve crop yield but will cause a waste of water resources and a decrease in water productivity the objectives of this study were intended to investigate the variability of yield and water productivity wp as a function of irrigation amount time and frequency and to explore optimal irrigation of winter wheat for improving grain yield and water productivity over a 60 year of long term meteorological data 1961 2020 a water driven model aquacrop model was used to reproduce crop growth and yield responses to changes in water supply with a total of 625 irrigation scenarios of irrigation amount and time the results showed that there has been no significant change in seasonal et0 reference evapotranspiration of winter wheat over the last 60 years instead seasonal precipitation during the winter wheat growing cycle displayed a decreasing trend potentially increasing the risk of meteorological drought despite the crop et has remained stable at around 370 mm for the past 60 seasons the grain yield and wp have steadily increased as the cumulative temperature increased in all three typical meteorological years crop average yield and et were considerably improved under irrigation conditions compared with that in non irrigated rainfed the total irrigation amounts of 90 120 and 150 mm with two irrigation times in the wet normal and dry years respectively could achieve higher yields as well as the wp and iwp consequently the optimal irrigation schedules in the wet normal and dry years were determined to be first irrigation in the wintering stage with 90 mm and second irrigation in the jointing stage with 0 30 60 mm respectively this work demonstrates that the aquacrop model has a reliable accuracy for revealing crop growth and production under water deficit conditions and provides a technical means of application for formulating optimal irrigation schedules keywords aquacrop irrigation schedule yield water productivity winter wheat 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is a major crop grown in the guanzhong plain an important cereal production area in shaanxi province the guanzhong plain accounts for approximately 9 of the total area and 47 of the total cultivated land of the province but produces about 89 of the total wheat grain production in the province nbsc 2020 in this semiarid or sub humid area the source of water supply for the winter wheat growth and yield is primarily dependent on available precipitation and or irrigation although annual precipitation is around 650 mm the unevenly spatial and temporal distributed precipitation results in only 230 mm half of the required water amount during the winter wheat growing season october may meanwhile irrigation in this area is inadequate as only half of the arable land can be irrigated in 2019 the unit yield of winter wheat in this region was only 3 9 t ha 1 well below the average level of the county 5 6 t ha 1 nbsc 2020 therefore there is an urgent to improve water productivity wp and productivity in response to growing pressures on water resource shortage since the last century how to allocate limited irrigation water for wheat during the growing cycle to achieve maximize yield water productivity or profits was a tough problem due to the variability in soil and environment zhang et al 2017 in general a high yield was often matched with a high irrigation amount and low water productivity deficit irrigation one of the water saving irrigation strategies widely used in water scarce areas rationally supplies irrigation during the sensitive or critical crop growth stage to achieve high yield or prevent a major no significant decline in yield production kang et al 2000 since the 2000s extensive field experiments have been carried out all around the world to investigate wheat growth and yield response to deficit irrigation kang et al 2002 li et al 2005 chen et al 2010 tari 2016 thapa et al 2019 other studies also proposed empirical production functions of water supply or water consumption and crop yield such as linear dar et al 2017 quadratic li et al 2005 wang et al 2013a negative exponential cooper et al 2020 functions however a common issue in these experiential studies was that the results were usually site and season specific making extrapolation beyond the location and climate unreliable different crop responses could result from the same irrigation schedule in diverse regions soil types and climates seasons based on the advance of crop water requirements mechanisms the simulation models were developed to elucidate how crop growth and production responded to the various soil water environments some studies integrated optimization methods into a simply coupling system of crop water production functions and soil water balance for example shang and mao 2006 developed a simulation optimization model for optimal irrigation timing and proposed different irrigation scenarios for three initial soil water storage layers of 0 1 m wen et al 2017 proposed a simulation based optimization model for optimizing spring wheat irrigation scheduling under mulching conditions although the global optimum solution could be obtained in the simulation optimization model by some optimization algorithms e g genetic algorithms simulated annealing algorithms the pure crop water production functions were simplified and empirical that unlikely to be sufficiently generic li et al 2018 and some of the scheduling may difficult to implement in irrigation management in practical application for instance shang and mao 2006 proposed total of five times irrigation during the winter wheat growing season of march to may in north china which was arduous by the border irrigation crop growth models also known as agroecosystem models have been developed over the last few decades from single physiological growth process simulation to the whole growth process and have been updated and refined to simulate the dynamic of variables of interest under various water fertilizer conditions and field management practices in the recent studies most of well known models have been calibrated evaluated and validated the performances to simulate crop growth and yield production under various soil water conditions and irrigation scenarios e g dssat ceres wheat attia et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 swap eitzinger et al 2004 wang et al 2021 aquacrop iqbal et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 apsim chen et al 2010 ahmed et al 2016 and rzwqm2 saseendran et al 2015 xu et al 2020 in addition to the evaluation of the model by experimental data other researchers focused on the model application for long term simulation chen et al 2010 attia et al 2016 xu et al 2020 different crop models have essential differences in crop response to water stress for instance the dssat and rzwqm2 model interpreted water stress by two stress factors that linear related to potential transpiration and potential root water uptake jones et al 2003 the swap model described the deterioration inducing by the water stress for crop canopy assimilation and senescence based on soil water potential van dam et al 1997 compared with other models the aquacrop model is a water driven model which accounted for the effects of soil water deficit on various growth processes i e canopy expansion canopy senescence stomatal conductance and harvest index moreover multiple stress functions e g linear convex and logistic could be selected to reproduce the response of different crops to soil water variations since the release of the model in 2009 hundreds of studies have been published to test validate and apply for a variety of purposes e g characterizing the crop response to water stress developing deficit irrigation schedules improving farm irrigation management and assessing the potential increase in production vanuytrecht et al 2014 numerous studies have been conducted over the last few decades to evaluate and validate the performance of the aquacrop for simulating crop growth and production soil moisture variability around the world andarzian et al 2011 validated the aquacrop model to simulate wheat under deficit water conditions in a hot dry environment and suggested applying four irrigations 200 mm for wet and normal years and six irrigations 300 mm for dry years wang et al 2013b evaluated the aquacrop model for simulating winter wheat under five irrigation treatments on china s loess plateau who reported two irrigations on over wintering and turning green stags could save water without reducing yields iqbal et al 2014 tested and validated the ability of aquacrop model to simulate wheat growth and production by both field experiments and long term measured and demonstrated the model has a reliable accuracy furthermore toumi et al 2016 not only evaluated the performance of aquacrop modelling for different irrigations but proposed the threshold of the root zone water depletion of 0 6 could improve the wheat irrigation management however most of the studies only investigated the performances of a few pre specified alternative irrigation scenarios and one of the best scenario targeting higher yield wp or profits was recommended as the optimal in the previous studies therefore it was unclear if any other irrigation schedule that was not user defined scenarios could achieve better results or if the recommended irrigation schedule could perform consistent performance across the different meteorological seasons therefore to explore optimal irrigation of winter wheat for improving grain yield and water productivity the full permutations of irrigation amount and time with a total of 625 irrigation scenarios were comprehensively analyzed in this study the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 a famous water driven crop simulation model developed by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations was used to reproduce crop growth and yield production furthermore the 60 years of long term meteorological data 1961 2020 covering the study area were also employed the main objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the dynamic of climate i e temperature precipitation reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop production i e grain yield evapotranspiration et and wp characteristics under both rainfed and irrigated conditions over the last 60 years 1961 2020 2 investigate the variability of yield and wp as a function of irrigation amount and frequency and 3 explore the optimal irrigation strategies considering crop yields wp and iwp in three typical meteorological years 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study focused on the guanzhong plain a conventional grain based area with an area of about 5 5 million hectares located in northwest china 34 00 n 35 30 n 106 30 e 110 30 e fig 1 the climate is a semiarid warm temperature and continental monsoon with an average annual temperature of approximately 12 13 c and water surface evaporation of 800 1000 mm the elevation ranges from 325 to 900 m with an average of 500 m the average annual precipitation in this region is 650 mm while the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven with about 70 of precipitation falling in the summer season june to september soil texture is a moderately well drained loamy classified as the loam and silt loam according to the harmonized world soil database http www fao org land water databases and software hwsd en containing approximately 20 clay 45 silt and 35 sand the average field capacity wilting point bulk density and ph are 33 cm3 cm 3 10 cm3 cm 3 1 41 g cm 3 and 7 8 respectively zhang et al 2018 in terms of agriculture the wheat summer maize rotation cropping system is commonly conducted in this area typically winter wheat is planted from mid october to early june of the following year and summer maize is sown as soon as when wheat is harvested from june to october normally irrigation is not required during the maize growing season except for extreme drought events however during the winter wheat growing season effective precipitation is less than 200 mm less than half of the crop water demand restricting wheat production moreover more than 50 of farmland relies on rainfed mainly located in the east and most irrigated farming is distributed in the west and middle zhou et al 2020 2 2 field experiment a deficit irrigation experiment was conducted for two consecutive years 2013 2015 different irrigation quotas and timings were designed to respond to various water stress degrees two irrigation levels of 80 mm and 40 mm were planned according to the winter wheat water demands chen et al 2006 three irrigation timings during winter wheat growth stages were applied hence a total of eight deficit irrigation treatments were implemented with each of three replicates table 1 winter wheat was planted on 15 october 2013 and 2014 and the final harvests were on 7 june 2014 and 2 june 2015 respectively the plot size was 4 m 2 m with 0 4 m adjacent space and all treatments were randomly assigned a 1 5 m deep waterproof layer was placed between each plot to prevent soil water exchange besides a mobile shelter was equipped to exclude rainfall from getting in the plots in each plot the leaf area index lai was measured weekly when after reviving stage using the sunscan canopy analysis system delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the measurements were taken from the average of three readings across the plot the canopy cover was calculated from the lai using an empirical equation provided by nielsen et al 2012 the aboveground biomass was measured after lai measurements and the dry matter was determined by drying about 15 plants at 75 c for 72 h grain was harvest at full maturity stage within 1 m2 area and the yield was taken by threshing and air drying to constant weight 2 3 model description the aquacrop model was mainly focused on simulating the crop aboveground biomass and grain yield production as a function of water productivity wp based on the previous water production function proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 the aquacrop evolved this approach and separated the et into crop transpiration tr and soil evaporation e to avoid the confounding effect of nonproductive consumptive water use e eq 1 steduto et al 2009 1 b wp tr where b is cumulative aboveground biomass production kg m 2 wp is the water productivity kg m 2 mm and tr is the daily crop transpiration mm day 1 similar to other crop models the aquacrop model assembled a soil plant atmosphere continuum spac for water interaction in daily steps by coupling three basic modules of soil water budget crop growth and atmosphere components araya et al 2010 additionally some management practices such as irrigation fertility and weeds that impact on crop development and grain production were also referred the main processes of crop development and grain production were as follow 1 crop development aquacrop used canopy cover cc to describe crop development rather than leaf area index and to calculate crop transpiration during leaf expansion aging and senescence 2 crop transpiration aquacrop determined crop transpiration by multiplying the et0 by a crop coefficient the et0 could be calculated by the fao penman monteith equation using several weather variables the crop coefficient was proportional to cc and adjusted with crop canopy development 3 aboveground biomass the biomass was accumulated as a function of crop transpiration and water productivity eq 1 the normalized water productivity wp related to atmospheric evaporative demand and air co2 concentrations was used to make the model valid for different climates including future climate scenarios e g special report on emissions scenarios sres and representative concentration pathways rcp hsiao et al 2009 in aquacrop the wp was set to a constant of 15 20 g m 2 for c3 crops like cereal wheat raes et al 2009c 4 grain yield formation the yield was partitioned from biomass by means of the harvest index hi the hi in aquacrop is not a constant but gradually linear increase to the reference harvest index hio cultivar specific starting from flowering to maturity as mentioned above aquacrop is a water driven model that specifically describes the effects of soil water changes on crop growth with the exception of temperature fertility and salinity stresses five water stress coefficients were incorporated into the model to update transpiration canopy expansion harvest index and root expansion etc further detailed descriptions of model mechanism and application were reported by hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009b steduto et al 2009 2 4 input data and parameters determination the input data of the aquacrop model version 6 1 could be divided into two groups driving variables and parameters including meteorological data crop data management data and soil data the descriptions and definitions were as follows 2 4 1 weather data the meteorological data was used to drive the model interacting with crop and soil five kinds of variables of air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind speed rainfall and sunshine hours radiation were minimum inputs into the aquacrop model the daily et0 was calculated from these factors by et0 calculation an integrated module based on the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 a long term historical meteorological data 1961 2020 covering the study area was gained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn different climatic conditions have significant effects on crop growth as a result three typical meteorological years hydrological year precipitation year of the wet normal and dry years were considered in this study the method of drought index di guo et al 2012 was used as eq 2 to evaluate variations of precipitation among different years 2 di p m σ where p is the precipitation mm m is the average precipitation of years 1961 2020 mm and σ is the standard error for precipitation di differentiated typical meteorological years as the wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 years to eliminate the influence of the precipitation data outside the winter wheat growth stage the precipitation data during the winter wheat growth season from october to may of the following year was used in calculating di finally 19 wet years 19 normal years and 21 dry years were achieved with the average values of 305 mm 235 mm and 177 mm respectively the monthly precipitation and corresponding mean air temperature in three typical meteorological years during winter wheat growing seasons were depicted in fig 2 2 4 2 crop characteristics crop parameters in the aquacrop model were classified as conservative cultivar specific and non conservative crop parameters raes et al 2009a conservative crop parameters such as the temperature or stress threshold and normalized biomass water productivity did not change substantially with time management practices geographic location or climate whereas the cultivar specific and non conservative parameters may need to be adjusted depending on cultivars environmental conditions and planting methods during the decade numerous studies have been worked to calibrate and validate aquacrop model in the guanzhong plain region under various application conditions such as irrigation teng et al 2015 silvestro et al 2017b remote sensing jin et al 2017 silvestro et al 2017a and mulching liu et al 2017 given that prior knowledge were achieved in most studies covering this study region and corroborated reliability of model parameterization related parameters were referenced directly and the calibration process would not be repeated winter wheat parameters determination and sources were presented in table 2 2 4 3 management practices the management data was an essential part in simulating field practices and events which mainly included field management and irrigation management in respect of the field management the events of fertilizer film mulching weed infestation and field runoff were involved in this study the soil fertility was treated as adequate that non limiting for crop canopy water productivity and biomass production moreover no film mulch was applied for winter wheat planting the surface runoff was prevented effectively by soil bunds of 0 3 m height and excess water from irrigation and rainfall was assumed to be stored in soil layers weed was inevitable on farmland and applying herbicides to control weed was common practice hence the level of weed management was put at very good ranked second after perfect and corresponding parameters e g relative cover and weed stress degree followed default irrigation management includes irrigation methods and irrigation events border irrigation one of the surface irrigation techniques widely applied in this area was employed in this study two important variables of application time and amount need to be determined in each irrigation event to develop a schedule lots of studies have been conducted in wheat physiology and ecology to investigate critical water requirement growth stage and reveal the growth response to water stress and reported controversial results for different critical water requirement stages e g seeding stage yao et al 2015 jointing stage zheng et al 2016 anthesis stage li et al 2005 and filling stage attia et al 2016 therefore the critical water demand period of the entire winter wheat growing seasons was attributed to four phenological stages as over wintering nov feb reviving green feb mar stem jointing mar apr and grain filling may based on the precipitation data during winter wheat growing in 60 years the maximum and minimum precipitation were about 450 mm and 140 mm respectively the seasonal water demand of winter wheat was approximately 400 450 mm chen et al 2006 which meant additional irrigation was unnecessary when precipitation was abundant but much more water needed to be supplemented with a rainfall scarcity condition therefore various irrigation amount gradients of 0 mm 30 mm 60 mm 90 mm and 120 mm were designed and arranged finally a total of 625 irrigation scenarios have been produced to different soil water status table 3 2 4 4 soil characteristics the two parts of groundwater and soil profile in the soil module should be filled in the depth of groundwater in the study area was up to 20 m which difficult to supply groundwater to crop growth by soil capillary pressure thus groundwater was negated in this study for soil profile several soil characteristics such as soil texture thickness and retention properties were determined according to the harmonized world soil database hwsd two soil types of loam and silt loam were distributed in guanzhong plain in the hwsd soil was divided into topsoil layer with 0 30 cm depth and subsoil layer with 30 100 cm depth consequently the same soil layers were arranged in aquacrop model the soil properties for inputting in the model were shown in table 4 2 5 model application following the preparation of all input variables and parameters a packaged project file was created to simulate winter wheat growth and grain production using historical meteorological data spanning the years 1961 2020 the aquacrop plug in program was used for iterative runs of 625 irrigation scenarios other indicators in addition to the crop grain yield such as the wp and irrigation water productivity iwp describing the ratio of water use of crop metabolism to water lost were considered and evaluated to explore and determine the reasonable irrigation schedule in crop production the wp is defined as crop grain yield per unit water consumption as eq 3 the iwp is defined as the quantity of yield produced by one cubic meter of water supplied which is also called irrigation water productivity reported by molden 1997 eq 4 furthermore the maximum profits of crop production under different irrigation schedules were discussed in the study area a policy of tiered pricing mechanism for water use was implied strictly indicating that the more water irrigation the higher unit price paid eq 5 3 wp g y 10 et kg m 3 4 iwp g y i kg m 3 5 profits g y g p i i p 1 i quota g y g p i i p 2 i quota yuan ha 1 where gy et and i refer to winter wheat grain yield kg ha 1 crop evapotranspiration mm and total irrigation amount mm respectively gp is grain price yuan kg 1 i p 1 and i p 2 are basic water price and progressive water pricing respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance evaluation fig 3 shows the simulated and measured canopy cover under eight deficit irrigation treatments during two winter wheat growing seasons results indicated that the simulated canopy cover had good agreement with the measured value in most cases in both growing seasons with rmse ranging from 4 9 to 10 4 and from 1 9 to 4 8 respectively wheat canopy covers during the second year average rmse 7 7 rrmse 10 7 were better simulated than that of the first year average rmse 4 1 rrmse 5 1 besides the simulation accuracy for all 80 mm irrigation quota treatments 2013 2014 average rmse 7 4 rrmse 9 9 2014 2015 average rmse 3 6 rrmse 4 4 was slightly higher than that of 40 mm irrigation quota treatments 2013 2014 average rmse 8 0 rrmse 11 5 2014 2015 average rmse 4 5 rrmse 5 7 in two growing seasons this expression was consistent with other studies reports that the performance of models would be decreased with the aggravation of water stress fang et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a the large discrepancies were mainly presented before around 180 dap and well followed in the late stages overall the global simulated accuracy by aquacrop model referencing from previous studies in this region presented acceptable compared with the reports by others wang et al 2013b toumi et al 2016 ran et al 2017 fig 4 depicts the comparison between the simulated and measured grain yield for different deficit irrigation treatments in both growing seasons although an apparent underestimation was observed when yield exceeded 5 5 t ha 1 overall simulated results were in good agreement with measures with r2 rmse and mre of 0 84 0 52 t ha 1 and 8 5 respectively in general the aquacrop model provided the dependable capability for revealing the variability of yield to water deficit and could be extrapolated to more irrigation scenarios 3 2 dynamic of climate characteristics and water demand climatic conditions are the determinant for crop development resulting in diverse growing status the temporal dynamics of climate characteristics and water demand over nearly 60 years in the study area was shown in fig 5 the annual and seasonal during the winter wheat cycle oct to may of the following year were separated the et0 an index of water demand intensity displayed a significant downward trend p 0 01 in annual value whereas the seasonal et0 of winter wheat showed no significant change in the past 60 years according to both the pearson correlation r and mann kendall trend test z thus the decrease in water demand was mainly concentrated on summer crops e g maize and soybeans on the contrary although the precipitation fluctuated noticeably in inter annual no significant declining was depicted the explicit decrease in precipitation during the winter wheat growing cycle was observed revealing that the risk of crops suffering from water stress in the future would be aggravated particularly in a rainfed agricultural area the inner annual variation of precipitation took on a parabolic shape from oct to may with the trough appearing in dec and jan fig 2 significant differences in precipitation were observed in the three precipitation years of the wet normal and dry years subtle change was only during the winter season when winter wheat was dormant the cumulative temperatures for both annual and seasonal showed consistent that consecutively increased over years with an average annual growth rate of 8 3 and 7 1 c per year respectively the temperature variation of inner annual was consistent with rainfall with the average minimum temperature of 0 5 c in january fig 2 no significant differences in precipitation characteristics were observed among the three typical meteorological years of wet normal and dry years 3 3 variability in simulated crop grain yield and wp rainfed agriculture is highly dependent on different weather conditions precipitation is the only source of crop water supply as shown in fig 6 the dynamic of yield presented a significant increasing trend during these years despite the large volatility similar result was observed in the global trend turner and asseng 2005 in natural growth conditions although the variation of yield is governed by many factors such as temperature precipitation and radiation it is nearly in conformity with precipitation with high values in wet years and lows in dry years however crop et variation remained stable at around 290 mm with no significant downward these changes resulted in a substantial improvement in wp from 1961 to 2020 with an average value of 1 3 kg m 3 results of the simulated et and wp under all produced irritation practice indicated that although different precipitation years were scattered during these years the average yield of winter wheat was significantly increased from around 4 0 6 0 t ha 1 with an average of 5 0 t ha 1 vs 3 7 t ha 1 of rainfed meanwhile the annual et was also considerably raised under irrigation conditions remaining stable at 370 mm the maximum annual et of about 450 mm was observed in a normal year the wp was derived from crop yield and potential evapotranspiration and therefore presented similar variation characteristics the average wp has increased steadily from 1 0 kg m 3 in 1961 1 6 kg m 3 at present the change in wp was not noticeable after irrigation in most seasons and the prominent improvements were only observed in a few dry years such as 1978 2000 2005 and 2008 as a result the effects of different precipitation years for yield and wp were nearly eliminated in the irrigation scenarios the increase of simulated wheat yield and wp during these decades could be attributed to the variations of atmospheric co2 concentrations and cumulative temperature the main effect of air co2 value was to adjust water productivity wp related to biomass accumulation eq 1 presenting negative or positive effects when co2 concentrations were below and above the reference value 369 41 ppm respectively raes et al 2009b on the other hand the results also agreed with the points of fang et al 2017 chen et al 2019 that grain yield was continuously improved with a higher accumulated temperature with respect to crop et in the crop physiology mechanism christy et al 2018 and guo et al 2010 found that crop et decreased as co2 concentrations enhanced due to crop stromal closure reducing transpiration on the contrary rising temperatures could increase both soil evaporation and crop transpiration by driving vapor pressure hatfield and dold 2019 eventually the stable et over the decades in the study was in agreement with suggestions from mo et al 2009 and broberg et al 2019 who suggested that the change of crop et was subtle with climate warming due to the counterpoise provided by the elevated co2 concentrations and cumulated temperature 3 4 comparison of crop yield et and wp for different typical meteorological years fig 7 showed the comparison of yield water demand and wp under rainfed and irrigation conditions in different precipitation years the predictable results of high production in wet years and low yield in dry years were confirmed for rainfed the variability of yield in wet years was dramatic as compared with that in normal and dry years similarly crop et presented a significant difference in three typical years dropping an average 320 260 mm as seasonal precipitation decreased the average and median wp was 1 3 kg m 3 for all wet normal and dry years under rainfed condition higher wp values were found in wet and normal years but lower values were existed probably in both wet and dry years compared to the non irrigation condition crop average grain yield and water demand have improved considerably after irrigation rising 11 6 28 9 and 57 6 of yield and 12 8 24 9 and 43 5 of et in wet normal and dry years respectively fig 7 the higher yield and et of 624 irrigation scenarios were acquired in the dry year but showed more variability than that in the other two precipitation years under the irrigation conditions the performance of precipitation for dominating crop yield was diminished and more precipitation usually induced a decrease in solar global radiation and sunshine hours affecting crop photosynthate production chen et al 2013 resulting in average yield in dry years being higher than the wet and normal year however there was only a slight enhancement in the wp when after irrigation keeping the level at 1 3 kg m 3 moreover no differentiation of wp among three precipitation years was presented 3 5 effects of irrigation management scenarios the changes in yield wp and iwp under different irrigation scenarios were shown in fig 8 the increase in crop yield as a function of irrigation amount was displayed in three typical meteorological years with dry years being the most pronounced similar results were also reported in xu et al 2020 in the dry year the variation of yield ranged from about 3 3 t ha 1 non irrigation to a maximum 5 35 t ha 1 with the wp varying between 1 25 and 1 40 kg m 3 the iwp was dropped from 13 to 1 kg m 3 as the increased irrigation amount considering the potential uncertainty and accuracy of the model an assumption from shang and mao 2006 that differences within 5 of maximum yield were ignored was still followed in this study comparable results were also observed for both normal and wet years but the variation range of 5 of maximum yield was widened reasonable irrigation should factor in both final yield and water productivity less irrigation not produced high yield and wp despite obtained a large iwp and more irrigation could acquire higher yield but wasted water for soil storage and deep percolation since the water input exceeded crop demand besides other studies have confirmed that deep percolation and nitrate leaching would be raised with the increase of irrigation amount li et al 2015 xu et al 2020 results presented that almost maximum yield 5 difference could be achieved when total irrigation amount only needed around 90 120 and 150 mm for wet normal and dry years respectively these irrigation amounts were consistent with the recommended values of 75 120 and 150 mm from norm of water intake for industries of shannxi province db61 t 943 2014 in this study irrigation management scenarios were created based on four critical periods of water demand thus the same irrigation amount was applied at different irrigation times and quotas resulting different yield and wp responses under the same irrigation amount frequent irrigation would increase the labor burden once the yield and wp were not be effectively improved fig 9 showed the variations in crop yield wp and iwp as a function of irrigation amount and frequency in three typical meteorological years in the dry year the yield has been improved with the increase of irrigation times when the total irrigation amount was less than about 200 mm fig 9 a same performances were observed in the normal and wet years but the increase rates were slower fig 9 b c results from the black column the 5 difference from maximum yield indicated that almost maximum yields of 5 1 4 8 and 4 6 t ha 1 respectively in dry normal and wet years could be achieved with only 2 3 times irrigation the variation trends of wp with irrigation amount and times were consistent in different precipitation years fig 9 d f the wp remained stable with rainfed condition at all of the irrigation times when irrigation amount was less than about 120 mm and then was improved to the maximum with both increases in irrigation amount and times but the wp would be reduced to the minimum with continuous applying of irrigation results of the wp also revealed crop et variability with a trend that was similar to changes in grain yield when total irrigation amount was less than 120 mm the increase rate of et was consistent with that of the yield resulting in a stable level for all irrigation times in three precipitation years then the crop et continued to increase with more irrigation amount but the yield changed slightly leading to a significant decrease of wp the variations of the iwp in three precipitation years were consistent as shown in fig 9 h g with the more irrigation the lower iwp the maximum value up to 14 kg m 3 was presented in minimum irrigation of 30 mm theoretically using the single iwp to determine the optimal irrigation schedule was unreasonable as the yield effects were not taken into account which was impractical for agricultural production 3 6 optimizing the irrigation scheduling previous section has displayed the variations of the yield wp and iwp under different irrigation scenarios in three precipitation years hence it is important to figure out which irrigation schedule is the optimal before determining the optimal irrigation schedule several criteria must be considered and assumed 1 the yield wp and iwp were important indicators but not the only factor a hypothesis in the last section that differences within 5 of maximum yield be treated as the same value was to be followed to conserve water resources 2 another problem in terms of irrigation times or frequency should be considered unlike the large scale agricultural production in other countries field planting in the study area is still done by families characterizing by the less arable land per capita low agricultural mechanization and a shortage of effective labor therefore the reduction of irrigation frequency can effectively save labor and improve irrigation efficiency 3 the irrigation quote for field practice should also be regarded in general border irrigation was the most common irrigation method in winter wheat planting and the shape of fields of the owner was usually elongated with about 5 10 m width and 80 200 m length which hardly guaranteed irrigation uniformity under a lower irrigation quota xu et al 2019 table 5 displayed the results of the simulated yield and wp of the top five irrigation scenarios in three typical meteorological years in the wet year all of the top five irrigation scenarios had nearly the same response to yield 4 7 t ha 1 and wp 1 3 kg m 3 with a total of 90 mm irrigation in different irrigation periods irrigation was applied in the over wintering stage for all scenarios but it was inconsistent in other stages only the irrigation scenario of is 622 has one irrigation implementation with 90 mm in the over wintering stage that was chosen as the ideal irrigation scheme in wet year in the normal year the irrigation scenario of is 573 irrigating 60 mm in wintering and 60 mm in jointing and is 597 irrigating 90 mm in wintering and 30 mm in jointing produced comparable winter wheat yield with a minimum water demand of 120 mm to obtain an adequate yield in the dry year the total irrigation amount was increased by at least 150 mm and the majority of these scenarios occurred in wintering and jointing stages only two irrigations were required for the is 572 and is 548 one in 90 mm of wintering and 60 mm of jointing and another in a reversed arrangement consequently two irrigation schedules with comparable capability for winter wheat production were proposed table 6 irrigation of both plans 1 and 2 was implemented in the wintering and jointing stages of winter wheat growing seasons with the same water amount in addition to the slight difference in irrigation quota the plan 1 had advantage of reducing one time irrigation in wet years practically the second irrigation amount was usually not certain due to the unknown precipitation years prior the growth cycle as a result the most effective wheat production would be achieved with a conservative irrigation scenario of 90 60 mm in wintering and 60 90 mm in the jointing stage similar studies have been complied to investigate optimal irrigation schedule based on different models ma et al 2015 proposed the optimal irrigation times were specified at winter dormancy and heading stages for winter wheat in ncp by evaluating several irrigation scenarios using the swap model zhou et al 2018 used the ceres wheat model to evaluate eight irrigation scenarios for winter wheat growth and reported that irrigation of 75 mm at both jointing and anthesis stages was the most suitable strategy for getting the highest yield and wp xu et al 2020 investigated the irrigation and fertilization in wheat maize rotation system by rzwqm2 model and pointed out that the best irrigation strategies for wheat were two three and four irrigations in wet normal and dry years respectively wang et al 2021 considered possible future climate change for winter wheat based on the swap model and suggested that one irrigation at the jointing stage and two irrigations at the jointing and heading stages could ensure high yield and water productivity 3 7 maximum benefit potential for the planter the primary goal of farming is to maximize profits fig 10 displayed the maximum profits from crop production under different irrigation levels with the increase in irrigation amount the total profit increased first and then dropped once the maximum income was reached the profits in the wet and normal years were more stable than those in the dry year the maximum profits were achieved with irrigation amounts of 240 180 and 150 mm for dry normal and wet years respectively these total amounts were roughly 1 6 times more than the schedule proposed in the previous section but the profit increment was only 4 on average compared with optimal irrigation scenarios overall the yield was decisive for profit variation despite some fluctuation by tiered pricing the main reason can be attributed to the sublet difference in water price with average water prices of 0 30 and 0 33 yuan m 3 for tier 1 and tier 2 respectively the insignificant price difference rendered the tiered pricing policy ineffective 4 conclusions irrigation time and irrigation quota determining the irrigation schedule should also be identified reliably for agricultural sustainable development this study explored the optimal irrigation schedule of winter wheat by the aquacrop model for improving grain yield and water productivity in different precipitation years from 1961 2020 results showed that higher irrigation could produce a higher yield but the incremental yield would be significantly decreased with more irrigation results revealed that the total irrigation amounts of 90 120 and 150 mm for the wet normal and dry years could achieve excellent yields respectively and more irrigation consumption only improved yield by less than 5 the over wintering stage and jointing stage were the most sensitive water requirement stages and irrigation at these growth stages achieved high yield as well as wp and iwp therefore optimal irrigation recommendations were only two irrigations with the first irrigation in the wintering stage of 90 mm and the second irrigation in the jointing stage of 0 30 60 mm in the wet normal and dry years respectively beyond the previous studies that proposing the optimal irrigation based on several irrigation validations this work comprehensively explored the variability of yield wp and iwp under different irrigation amounts timings and precipitation years in a semiarid area of china these methods and results provide scientific means and basis for guiding agricultural irrigation management it is noticing that the irrigation quota proposed in this study is the net irrigation requirement without including potential losses caused by irrigation projects the gross water intake for irrigation should be updated by the effective
