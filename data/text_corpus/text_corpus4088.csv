20440,pitting corrosion threatens the safety of steel structures by degrading material properties in this paper the effect of pitting damage on tensile behavior of q345 and q235 steels is studied experimentally and numerically material tensile tests were carried out on small steel specimens with artificially introduced corrosion pits of a cylindrical semi ellipsoidal or conical shape and used to validate their numerical models numerous numerical analyses were carried out to study the tensile properties and behavior of different steels due to varying pitting features in the pit shape and degree of volume loss dov of corroded material results showed that pit shape influences the tensile properties of corroded steel significantly depending on the ratio of pit diameter to pit depth in the worst case variation of pit shape could result in a difference of 7 58 in strength deterioration and it could become worse if combined with the random nature of pit size pit depth and pitting distribution an equivalent material model was proposed to correlate the reduction ratios of tensile properties with the dov and pit shape the ultimate strength of pitted plates can be predicted properly using the equivalent material model instead of modelling the detailed corrosion pits keywords pitted plates tensile behavior artificial corrosion pits pit shape equivalent material model 1 introduction marine and offshore structures made of steel are subject to corrosion damage bhandari et al 2015 which leads to fatigue cracks brittle fracture and unpredictable failure guedes soares et al 2008 it was reported that corrosion causes an annual loss of 2 4 trillion united states dollars equal to 3 of world s gross domestic product vel√°zquez et al 2014 pitting corrosion among all types of corrosion is the most common and dangerous as it is difficult to detect and can cause an insidious reduction in the strength of steel eldeen et al 2012 the initiation and growth of pitting corrosion in marine environments are affected by many complex factors such as seawater temperature concentration of dissolved oxygen water ph and salinity guedes soares et al 2011 this results in a significant randomness in pitting features such as the sizes depths and shapes of corrosion pits valor et al 2007 with an irregular morphology and a random distribution paik et al 2004b these pitting features vary over time depending on the service environments melchers and jeffrey 2008 melchers 2005 in particular the size and depth of corrosion pits in actual hull structures have been observed to be related to their shape nakai et al 2004 but so far this has not been considered in ultimate strength assessments the strength degradation of pitted structures and small specimens has aroused widespread attention wang et al 2014 earlier experimental and numerical studies were carried out on plates with corrosion pits that were introduced as a regular pitting distribution paik et al 2003 2004a it was reported that the ultimate strength of pitted plates under axial compression was governed by the area of the smallest cross section nakai et al 2006 for experiments on plates with artificial corrosion pits introduced by artificial marine environments the results showed that the reductions of the fatigue and ultimate strength were mainly determined by the degree of volume loss dov of the corroded material garbatov et al 2014a 2014b saad eldeen et al 2011 for structures subjected to random corrosion pits it was indicated that the reduction of the ultimate strength was closely related to the dov wang et al 2018a 2020 wang and shenoi 2019 as for the degradation in material properties the reductions of strength and deformability of corroded plates under uniaxial tension were thought to depend on the minimum cross sectional area the maximum depth of pits and the pitting pattern simultaneously ahmmad and sumi 2010 however in recent tests on small tensile specimens with artificial pits it was alleged that the shape depth and distribution of the pits had little impact on the ultimate loads of the tensile samples and the tensile strength was correlated with the maximum cross sectional area sheng and xia 2017 in addition the reductions of the yield and tensile strength were claimed to be linked strongly to the degree of pitting intensity dop yao et al 2018 or the dov and the pit depth zhao et al 2020 in spite of the obscure relationship between the strength degradation and pitting damage the existing studies seemingly reached a consensus that the pit shape had no effect on the strength reductions of both small scale tensile specimens yao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 and large scale pitted structures zhang et al 2017a 2017b it is however worth noting that such a conclusion on the effect of pit shape came out under the lower levels of pitting damage furthermore the relationship between the strength degradation and the dop or dov in those studies yao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 has not been calibrated to actual pitted structures however if higher levels of pitting damage are involved the effect of pit shape on the tensile strength and behavior of pitted plates remains unclear in this paper the effect of pit shape on the tensile behavior of pitted plates is studied experimentally and numerically material tensile tests were conducted on small plate specimens made of steels of different strengths with without artificial corrosion pits which were utilized to verify the numerical models for nonlinear analyses a series of numerical analyses were then carried out to explore the effects of various pitting features especially the pit shape on the tensile behavior of pitted plates based on the numerical results equivalent material models to correlate the tensile properties with pitting features were developed for different types of steels and then they were calibrated by performing ultimate strength assessments of actual pitted plates 2 methodology the random natures in the size depth and distribution of corrosion pits affect the ultimate strength of pitted structures significantly wang et al 2018b in order to separate the effect of pit shape from those of other pitting features the pits in all the specimens herein were introduced in a regular pattern corrosion pits were artificially fabricated on the surfaces of tensile test specimens made of q345 and q235 steel the pit shape was designed to be diverse to study the influence of the pitting features on the tensile properties tensile tests were carried out to obtain the stress strain curves of all the pitted steel specimens and numerical analyses were performed using ansys 15 0 upon the tensile tests to validate numerical simulations geometric and material nonlinearities were all taken into account in the numerical analyses and the newton rapson method was adopted to solve the nonlinear problem 2 1 material tensile tests a total of 16 small plate specimens were tested under uniaxial tension including twelve of q345 steel and four of q235 steel the dimensions of the tensile test specimens were selected according to the gb t 228 1 2010 chinese standard as shown in fig 1 each of the pitted specimen was divided into three parts a pitting area part a clamping area part b and transition area the rest fig 2 shows all the pitted test specimens of two types of steels in regard to the 12 test specimens of q345 steel two of them were intact and ten had artificial pits while four specimens of q235 steel including two intact and two pitted ones were used to examine the degradation of material properties for different materials to fabricate the corroded specimens identical artificial pits were regularly distributed on one side of the surface in the pitting area which were introduced by computer numerical control cnc machining to simulate asymmetric corrosion the pit shape in each test specimen was identical being cylindrical denoted as c semi ellipsoidal denoted as s or conical denoted as t as shown in table 1 the diameter d and depth h of a pit were utilized to characterize the pit size and to define the volume loss caused by corrosion and the ratio of diameter to depth of a pit ranged from 2 to 8 being similar to that observed in real ship structures nakai et al 2004 the damage parameter dov of each corroded specimen was obtained by dividing the volume loss by the virgin volume within the pitting area 1 d o v v c v 0 100 where v 0 is the volume of pitting area of the intact plates v c denotes the volume loss caused by pitting corrosion respectively there were two types of pit distributions aligned rows denoted as a and staggered rows denoted as s for q345 steel the effect of pit shape was studied under three levels of pitting damage and the test specimens were grouped based on their corrosion damage as follows dov 6 79 dov 10 18 and dov 13 85 for q235 steel since it was designed to investigate the effect of pitting damage in different steels only cylindrical pits were introduced in the test specimens made of such steel under two levels of pitting damage dov 8 72 and dov 11 30 table 2 shows all the test specimens each of which was named in terms of its pitting distribution pit shape pit diameter and pit depth for example in group dov 6 79 ac9 1 33 has an aligned pattern of cylindrical pits with a diameter of 9 mm and a depth of 1 33 mm while as9 2 and at9 4 had the same pitting distribution and pit diameter as those of ac9 1 33 but with different pit depth corresponding to the semi ellipsoidal and conical pit shape respectively the pitted specimens were utilized to study the influence of pitting features such as the dov pitting distribution and pit shape on the tensile properties the measured dimensions of all test specimens are shown in table 2 owing to the high accuracy of the cnc machining it caused only a tiny size error in the final size of each fabricated specimen in contrast to the nominal size for the specimens of q345 steel the mean values of the width and thickness of the pitting area were 29 88 and 5 06 mm respectively for the specimens of q235 steel the mean values of the width and thickness of the pitting area were 29 92 and 4 54 mm respectively before performing a tensile test the clamping area of a specimen was clamped in the universal testing machine whose system kept a record for the loads and displacements in the entire loading process an extensometer was mounted on both lateral sides of the specimen to record total stretching deformation in the pitting area the stress strain curves from all the tests of two types of steels are shown in fig 3 a and the major tensile properties are outlined in table 2 the tensile properties herein included the elastic modulus e yield strength œÉ y ultimate tensile strength œÉ u and tensile strain Œµ u the elastic modulus was obtained by fitting the initial linear portion of a stress strain curve as shown in fig 4 the yield strength was determined based on the intersection of the stress strain curve and the linear segment offset of 0 2 strain the 0 2 proof stress method for the pitted specimen due to that its yield plateau vanished gradually as the increase of the pitting intensity the ultimate tensile strength and strain were determined upon the point of the maximum stress as shown in fig 4 2 2 numerical analyses numerical models of two typical tensile specimens containing the pitting and transition areas are shown in fig 5 one with aligned pits and another with staggered pits the width and thickness of the pitting area in a numerical model were consistent with their measured mean values the sizes of the pits also took the measured values shown in table 2 the fixed end constraint was applied on one end of the numerical model and the displacement loading was applied on the other end the engineering stress strain curves of the intact ii and intact iv specimens were converted into the true stress strain curves using eq 2 respectively applied for the material constitutive models of q345 and q235 steels in the fe analyses shown in fig 6 2 œÉ t œÉ 1 Œµ Œµ t ln 1 Œµ where œÉ and Œµ are the engineering stress and strain respectively and œÉ t and Œµ t are the true stress and strain respectively the element type was solid187 of ansys software as it can benefit the accurate modelling of 3d pit shapes the element size in the transition area was coarse to be 5 mm due to its intact feature without pits while the element size in the pitting area was set to 2 5 2 or 1 mm to explore the effect of mesh density fig 7 shows the obtained stress strain curves from numerical analyses including the intact and ac7 86 2 62 specimens with the different element sizes these curves from the three types of element sizes were close to each other and all the curves agreed well with the experimental results despite a sharp decrease in the fe results at the necking stage that differed from the slow descent in the tests therefore the differences in the element sizes had little effect on the fe results however the small element size greatly increased computing time thus the element size in the pitting area was set to the medium size of 2 mm in the following analyses fig 3b shows stress strain curves derived from numerical analyses of all the tensile tests the stress strain curves of the numerical and experimental results showed good agreements where the yield plateaus gradually decreased and even disappeared with the increase of the dov table 3 shows the material properties of the numerical analyses compared to those of the tensile tests where the values in brackets are the relative errors for the yield strength the relative errors between the numerical and test results were mostly less than 5 and for the ultimate tensile strength the errors were mostly less than 3 for the elastic modulus the errors were mostly around 5 except for specimen ac9 1 33 for the ac9 1 33 specimen the relatively larger error may come from the material inhomogeneity in the parent plate subjected to rolling for the ultimate tensile strain there were scattered relative errors ranging from 0 31 to 25 16 the variabilities of the young s modulus and the total elongations were attributed to the variation of the statistical features of corrosion damage in the test specimens woloszyk and garbatov 2020a b fig 8 shows the failure models of the specimens obtained from the fe analyses and the experiments illustrating high consistencies for the specimens with aligned pits the failure path was formed between a pair of aligned pits but it occurred between a pair of staggered pits for the specimens with staggered pits in addition for the numerical and experimental models there were some differences in the specific locations of the pit pairs where failure occurred this was due to the errors of pit depths caused by the cnc machining which resulted in some pits having relatively larger depths and then forming the weakest cross sections of the test specimens 3 pitting effects on tensile behavior the abovementioned validation against the tensile tests indicates that numerical simulations can reproduce the tests accurately the pitting effect on tensile behavior was thus comprehensively studied upon the numerical models of the test specimens of q345 steel since there was only a tiny error between the average measured size and nominal size of a test specimen the latter was adopted throughout the following nonlinear analyses to make the numerical modelling simplified so as to provide the same basis for comparisons on the effects of diverse pitting features the constitutive material model and the meshing scheme were in compliance with those in section 2 2 3 1 pitting distribution specimens ac9 1 33 and sc9 1 33 had the same level of pitting damage but with different pitting distribution the pits in the ac9 1 33 were distributed in an aligned pattern while those in the sc9 1 33 were scattered in a staggered pattern as shown in fig 5 fig 9 shows the stress strain curves of the two specimens evidently they were very similar in the elastic stage yielding stage and hardening stage with tiny differences however there were marked differences in the stage after necking the stress decreased monotonously with the increase of the strain at the necking stage for ac9 1 33 while the stress strain relationship fluctuated for sc9 1 33 hence the pit distribution had little effect on the elastic modulus yield strength and tensile strength but had a significant influence on the strain after the necking point fig 10 shows the stress contours at typical loading stages including the yielding stage the necking stage the pitting distribution was seen to influence the stress contour significantly for the specimen with aligned pits ac9 1 33 higher stresses arose inside and around the pits in the yielding stage but they intensively developed inside the pits and the linked areas of several pairs of aligned pits in the necking stage the failure path resulted from one pair of aligned pits with the highest level of stress in the necking stage for the specimen with staggered pits sc9 1 33 the development of the stress was similar to that in the specimen with aligned pits however a shear failure path appeared in the necking stage and a stress redistribution arose concurrently with a fluctuating stress strain curve as shown in fig 9 3 2 degree of volume loss fig 11 shows the relationships between the yield and tensile strength with the dovs of the corroded specimens the resulting dovs in the test specimens were 6 72 10 15 and 13 79 the regressed lines red lines indicate that all the tensile properties showed decreasing trends with the increases of the dovs the reductions of the yield and tensile strength were about 21 32 and 23 15 respectively if the dov increased to 13 79 from 6 72 thus the dov was a crucial factor for the degradation of the tensile strength however it will result in pronounced dispersions in the predicted results if only depending on the parameter dov as shown in fig 11 for the dov 6 72 in spite of the same degree of volume loss it leaded to a relative error of 5 47 in the minimax values for the yield strength and 5 64 for the tensile strength while for the dov 10 15 they decreased to 1 17 and 1 09 however for the dov 13 79 they increased to 7 45 and 8 2 again therefore the relations derived only upon the dov of the pitted specimens cannot accurately predict the reduction of tensile strength and more influential factors needed to be involved 3 3 pit shape fig 12 shows the influence of pit shape on the tensile strength in three groups of specimens subject to different dovs each group contained three specimens each of which were built with identical pits of a cylindrical semi ellipsoidal or conical shape for the group of specimens of dov 6 72 the pits of the cylindrical semi ellipsoidal or conical shape had the same diameter but with three types of pit depths such differences further resulted in three ratios of pit diameter to pit depth d h being 6 77 4 5 and 2 25 respectively in the three simulated specimens for the dov 10 15 the pits of different shapes had the same d h of 3 for the dov 13 79 these pits had the same depth but with different diameters corresponding to d h 2 86 3 5 and 4 95 respectively fig 12 shows that the yield strength and tensile strength of the pitted specimens decreased as the dov increased however under the same level of pitting damage the differences in the pit shape caused a significant disparity in the strength reduction for instance for three specimens of dov 6 72 the pits in three specimens had the same diameter but different depths as shown in table 1 to yield the same volume loss the cylindrical pits needed a smaller pit depth compared with the semi ellipsoidal and conical ones this resulted in a higher yield strength and tensile strength in the specimen with cylindrical pits in contrast for three specimens of dov 13 79 their pits had the same depth but different diameters in this case the cylindrical pits required a smaller pit diameter to produce the same volume loss this resulted in a smaller yield strength and tensile strength therefore both the pit diameter and pit depth played important roles in influencing the tensile strength of the pitted specimens notably the variation in eithor the pit diameter or pit depth due to the different pit shapes essentially corresponded to the changes of the key parameter of d h seen from fig 12 the larger the d h the higher the tensile strength interestingly for the three specimens of dov 10 15 their pits had the same d h almost yielding the same tensile strength despite their different pit shapes therefore the pit shape of corrosion pits had a significant influence on the tensile strength of pitted specimens which were closely correlated to the ratio of the diameter to the depth of corrosion pits moreover the pit shape significantly impacted the stress distribution in the pitted specimens as shown in fig 13 a higher level of stress occurred first at the yielding state only on the edges of the cylindrical pits but it arose simultaneously on the bottoms and edges of the semi ellipsoidal and conical pits however the stress contours of the specimens with different pit shapes tended to be similar with the increase of axial tensile displacement the difference in the onset location of the yield stress in the pitted areas was ascribed to the difference in the thickness distribution within the pits of different shapes compared with the semi ellipsoidal and conical pits of gradually decreasing thickness the thickness inside the cylindrical pits decreased dramatically forming a cliff at its edge and causing a higher stress concentration 4 degradation of tensile properties of different steels the degradation of tensile properties was studied on two types of steels subject to five levels of pitting damage a total of 150 specimens were designed to cover a wider range of data for each type of steel thirty specimens corresponded to each of five levels of pitting damage the 30 specimens were divided into three groups in terms of pit shapes including 10 with cylindrical pits 10 with semi ellipsoidal pits and 10 with conical pits the pits of each of ten specimens in a group had a constant ratio of pit diameter to pit depth but the ratios for the ten specimens in such a group were different and varied randomly between 2 and 8 fig 14 displays the information of the 150 specimens including the dov d h and pit shape all the numerical models of the 150 specimens were built up in terms of the nominal size in the aforementioned test specimens 4 1 q345 steel the residual strength of a pitted specimen was represented by a ratio r s of the strength in contrast to the intact one which was defined as œÉ y œÉ y0 for the yield strength and œÉ u œÉ u0 for the tensile strength herein œÉ y0 and œÉ u0 are the yield strength and tensile strength of the intact specimen respectively fig 15 and fig 16 show the variations of the residual strength with the changes of the key corrosion parameters d h and dov meanwhile regression analyses were performed to deduce the relationship between the residual strength and these corrosion parameters a function with two parameters Œ± and Œ≤ can be used to indicate the relationship between the residual strength and d h under a certain level of pitting damage 3 r s f d h d o v Œ± ln d h Œ≤ where the parameters Œ± and Œ≤ were relevant to the dov by performing regression analyses on the yield strength and tensile strength the parameters Œ± and Œ≤ were found to linearly vary with the dov as shown in figs 15b and 16b the following correlations were then formed 4 Œ± a d o v Œ≤ b d o v c substituting eq 4 into 3 yields an equivalent model of the residual strength as a function of d h and dov as follows 5 œÉ y œÉ y 0 0 6021 d o v l n d h 2 7201 d o v 1 œÉ u œÉ u 0 0 6519 d o v l n d h 2 7673 d o v 1 the equivalent model was validated against the test results as shown in fig 17 the relative errors between the test results and the predicted results based on eq 5 were mostly less than 3 for both the yield and tensile strength indicating a good precision of the equivalent model in addition to the strength more regression analyses were also performed on the numerical results of the 150 pitted specimens to acquire the relationships for the young s modulus and tensile strain with the key corrosion parameters as follows 6 e e 0 0 3914 d o v l n d h 2 1285 d o v 1 Œµ u Œµ u 0 1 1405 d o v l n d h 4 5398 d o v 1 based on the obtained relations for the tensile properties of the pitted specimens a bilinear stress strain curve was proposed for the material constitutive model of q345 steel as shown in fig 18 a whose hardening stage was simplified to be linear 4 2 q235 steel similar to the q345 steel numerical analyses were also carried out on 150 pitted specimens made of q235 steel the following equivalent models of the tensile properties were deduced 7 œÉ y œÉ y 0 0 5992 d o v l n d h 2 6938 d o v 1 œÉ u œÉ u 0 0 6528 d o v l n d h 2 7314 d o v 1 8 e e 0 0 4966 d o v l n d h 2 4361 d o v 1 Œµ u Œµ u 0 1 2255 d o v l n d h 5 2257 d o v 1 the equivalent models were also validated using the test results of specimens ac8 2 and ac8 2 5 as shown in fig 17 the relative errors between the analytical and experimental results were less than 4 for both the yield and tensile strength showing good agreements the equivalent models of the young s modulus and ultimate tensile strain given by eq 8 were used for the q235 steel as shown in fig 18b 5 discussion 5 1 deterioration of tensile properties the above analyses clearly demonstrated the effect of pitting damage on the tensile properties of different steels however differences in the equivalent material models for the different steels need further attentions for in service aged structures the pitting damage in the interests of iacs requirements may lead a limiting value of dov to about 10 wang et al 2018a hence a further verification on the material constitutive models were performed for the different steels under three levels of pitting damage such as dovs of 5 10 and 15 under each level of dov twenty five values of d h which varied from 2 to 8 at an equal interval of 0 25 were involved in determining the yield and tensile strength in terms of eqs 5 and 7 respectively for each type of steel fig 19 indicates the results of the different equivalent material models there were no significant differences in the predicted values for both the yield and tensile strength of the q345 and q235 steels the type of steel thus does not impact the degradation of tensile properties caused by pitting corrosion damage furthermore the equivalent material model proposed herein was verified with previously reported experiments sheng and xia 2017 yao et al 2018 as shown in table 4 the material in yao s work was high strength nv d36 steel which had tensile properties similar to those of q345 steel each test specimen had four rows of staggered pits of a hemispherical or conical shape and the d h values of the hemispherical and conical pits were 6 and 4 respectively table 4 shows the predicted results of the equivalent model in this paper agreed well with those reported test results in most cases the relative errors of the yield strength were less than 2 while those of the tensile strength were less than 3 with respect to the tests in sheng s work the narrow and deep conical pits with d h values less than one were mechanically formed in the test specimens of q235 steel claimed to simulate the corrosion in normal atmospheric environment the equivalent material model in this paper tended to slightly over predict the tensile strength of the test specimens in sheng s tests the relative errors of the yield strength were mostly less than 5 but the errors of the tensile strength were relatively larger and mostly in the range of 5 10 obviously a worse prediction accuracy occurred when the equivalent model in this paper was applied to the sheng s tests compared with the yao s tests this was closely related to the d h ratios of the artificially introduced pits in the sheng s tests a larger size error may arise in the fabricated specimens due to the very narrow shapes of the pits of a diameter of 2 5 mm that had the measurements of the pit depths inaccurate in addition the conical pits in those test specimens were induced with the d h values less than 1 0 differing from those in this paper that were used to simulate the corrosion in natural marine environments it was reported that the ultimate tensile or compressive strength of plate may be governed by the largest pit depth as it caused the maximum reduction of a cross sectional area paik et al 2003 however the comparison of predicted results in table 5 indicates that the formula derived from the largest pit depth cannot always yield rational predictions on the tensile tests in both this paper and yao s work especially for the test specimens with the staggered pits shown in fig 5b large relative errors arose in the results from the paik s formula in the worst case the maximum relative error reached to 15 49 if used for the prediction on the yao s tests in fact the pit with the largest depth does not always result in the maximum reduction in a cross sectional area garbatov et al 2014b by contrast the formula described by dov and d h can predict the tensile strength more accurately as for the steel with real irregular corrosion pits it may be rational to define the d h as the ratio of the average diameter and the average depth of all the measured pits 5 2 application of equivalent material model to assess ultimate strength of intact steel plates a material constitutive model consisting of an elastic modulus yield strength and tensile strength is required whether by numerical or analytical method in this paper the equivalent material model was proposed to assess the ultimate strength of a steel plate with regular corrosion pits it can be achieved by treating the corroded steel plate as an intact one made of a deteriorated material dependent on the volume loss ratio and the ratio of pit diameter to pit depth such an application of the equivalent material model was illustrated upon the following available experiments collapse tests of box type plated structures with varying pitting corrosion damage have been performed under axial compression paik et al 2003 each of plates in the box type structure had dimensions of 580 mm 500 mm 4 4 mm and was artificially introduced with perforated pits regularly scattered on its surface the test structures were made of q235 steel they were utilized to calibrate the equivalent material model of corroded steel for numerical analyses one sheet of the test plates was taken because of symmetric conditions in the box type structures paik et al 2003 four edges of the test plate were thought to be simply supported one of which as the loading edge was inflicted with an axial displacement to simulate axial compressive load in numerical analyses two test plates with dops of 4 87 and 10 24 were studied respectively the pits on the plate had an identical diameter of 30 mm fig 20 shows the equivalent material models of corroded steels with diverse levels of pitting damage and the stress strain curve of the intact plate hereon each model was dependent on its dov and d h of the corresponding plate based on such a model an intact plate made of a new type of steel was used to replace the pitted plate and to represent the ultimate strength of the pitted plate without needing to model the detailed corrosion pits of course intuitively a pitted plate with the details of corrosion pits referred to as a real pitted model was also built up whose results served a reference to calibrate the proposed equivalent model of the pitted steel the element type same as that used for the tensile coupon tests solid187 was adopted and the plate thickness 4 4 mm was used as the control size for freely generating the meshes in all the numerical models fig 21 shows the results from the experiments and from the two types of numerical models real pitted model and equivalent material model fig 21a and b display two types of numerical models yielded stress strain behavior similar to those from the tests with similar ultimate strength fig 21c illustrates the differences in two types of numerical results compared with the test results the maximum relative errors from two types of numerical models were about 8 most likely due to the inaccurate residual stress adopted in the numerical models that was not measured in the original tests paik et al 2003 from the view of practical application the equivalent model can be used to predict the ultimate strength of test plates averting modelling the complex corrosion pits however it may lead to a striking difference in the stress strain behavior especially in the post collapse stages if comparing fig 21a with fig 21b in addition the corrosion pits played a detrimental role in decreasing the compressive behavior of the pitted plate as shown in fig 21d besides causing a sharp decrease in the structural stiffness shown in fig 21a recently an equivalent material model has also been proposed for the correlation of tensile properties with pitting damage based on tensile coupon tests yao et al 2018 fig 22 a shows the equivalent material models from yao s work and fig 22b shows the predicted results using the yao s model concurrent with the results of paik s tests obviously the yao s model always over predicted the ultimate strength of the test plates with larger relative errors of 13 78 for the dop 4 87 and 25 74 for the dop 10 24 this was attributed to that the yao s model did not take into account the dov and pit shape simultaneously but only the dop interestingly a recent study showed that corrosion did not change the chemical properties of the corroded steel and seemed to have no effect on the mechanical properties of steel itself rajput and paik 2021 a larger number of experiments however shows that the rough surface of steel due to corrosion suffers from a stress concentration and degrades the mechanical properties of the corroded steel to follow the mainstream this paper aims to derive an equivalent constitutive model to tackle the degradation of mechanical properties of corroded steel an alternative steel depicted by the equivalent material model can be used to represent the corroded steel for ultimate strength assessments of pitted structures as for an actual aged structure the statistical characteristics of pitting corrosion can be obtained by performing a normal corrosion inspection daidola et al 1997 the equivalent material model corresponding to the specific structure can be determined in terms of measured data by inputting its dov and d h into eq 5 8 the ultimate strength of the pitted structure can be represented by treating it as the intact structure made of the alternative steel 6 conclusion this paper presents comprehensive experimental and numerical studies on tensile properties of q345 and q235 steels subject to artificial corrosion pits pitting features experimental procedures tensile properties stress strain curves and failure modes of the test specimens were fully reported numerical analyses were performed on all the tests to validate numerical models of pitted plates a series of numerical analyses were then conducted to study the effects of diverse pitting features on tensile properties of pitted specimens of different steels results showed that pit shape significantly affects the tensile properties of pitted plates by impacting stress distribution in locally pitted areas especially the effect of pit shape on tensile properties is mainly dependent on the ratio d h of pit diameter to pit depth for two types of corroded steels deterioration of the material properties can be represented by a universal equivalent material model that was derived by correlating the degree of volume loss dov and d h with tensile properties upon this the ultimate strength of a pitted plate with regular corrosion pits can be assessed by treating it as an intact one made of the equivalent material in lieu of

20440,pitting corrosion threatens the safety of steel structures by degrading material properties in this paper the effect of pitting damage on tensile behavior of q345 and q235 steels is studied

al 2008 it was reported that corrosion causes an annual loss of 2 4 trillion united states dollars equal to 3 of world s gross domestic product vel√°zquez et al 2014 pitting corrosion among all types of corrosion is the most common and dangerous as it is difficult to detect and can cause an insidious reduction in the strength of steel eldeen et al 2012 the initiation and growth of pitting corrosion in marine environments are affected by many complex factors such as seawater temperature concentration of dissolved oxygen water ph and salinity guedes soares et al 2011 this results in a significant randomness in pitting features such as the sizes depths and shapes of corrosion pits valor et al 2007 with an irregular morphology and a random distribution paik et al 2004b these pitting features vary over time depending on the service environments melchers and jeffrey 2008 melchers 2005 in particular the size and depth of corrosion pits in actual hull structures have been observed to be related to their shape nakai et al 2004 but so far this has not been considered in ultimate strength assessments the strength degradation of pitted structures and small specimens has aroused widespread attention wang et al 2014 earlier experimental and numerical studies were carried out on plates with corrosion pits that were introduced as a regular pitting distribution paik et al 2003 2004a it was reported that the ultimate strength of pitted plates under axial compression was governed by the area of the smallest cross section nakai et al 2006 for experiments on plates with artificial corrosion pits introduced by artificial marine environments the results showed that the reductions of the fatigue and ultimate strength were mainly determined by the degree of volume loss dov of the corroded material garbatov et al 2014a 2014b saad eldeen et al 2011 for structures subjected to random corrosion pits it was indicated that the reduction of the ultimate strength was closely related to the dov wang et al 2018a 2020 wang and shenoi 2019 as for the degradation in material properties the reductions of strength and deformability of corroded plates under uniaxial tension were thought to depend on the minimum cross sectional area the maximum depth of pits and the pitting pattern simultaneously ahmmad and sumi 2010 however in recent tests on small tensile specimens with artificial pits it was alleged that the shape depth and distribution of the pits had little impact on the ultimate loads of the tensile samples and the tensile strength was correlated with the maximum cross sectional area sheng and xia 2017 in addition the reductions of the yield and tensile strength were claimed to be linked strongly to the degree of pitting intensity dop yao et al 2018 or the dov and the pit depth zhao et al 2020 in spite of the obscure relationship between the strength degradation and pitting damage the existing studies seemingly reached a consensus that the pit shape had no effect on the strength reductions of both small scale tensile specimens yao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 and large scale pitted structures zhang et al 2017a 2017b it is however worth noting that such a conclusion on the effect of pit shape came out under the lower levels of pitting damage furthermore the relationship between the strength degradation and the dop or dov in those studies yao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 has not been calibrated to actual pitted structures however if higher levels of pitting damage are involved the effect of pit shape on the tensile strength and behavior of pitted plates remains unclear in this paper the effect of pit shape on the tensile behavior of pitted plates is studied experimentally and numerically material tensile tests were conducted on small plate specimens made of steels of different strengths with without artificial corrosion pits which were utilized to verify the numerical models for nonlinear analyses a series of numerical analyses were then carried out to explore the effects of various pitting features especially the pit shape on the tensile behavior of pitted plates based on the numerical results equivalent material models to correlate the tensile properties with pitting features were developed for different types of steels and then they were calibrated by performing ultimate strength assessments of actual pitted plates 2 methodology the random natures in the size depth and distribution of corrosion pits affect the ultimate strength of pitted structures significantly wang et al 2018b in order to separate the effect of pit shape from those of other pitting features the pits in all the specimens herein were introduced in a regular pattern corrosion pits were artificially fabricated on the surfaces of tensile test specimens made of q345 and q235 steel the pit shape was designed to be diverse to study the influence of the pitting features on the tensile properties tensile tests were carried out to obtain the stress strain curves of all the pitted steel specimens and numerical analyses were performed using ansys 15 0 upon the tensile tests to validate numerical simulations geometric and material nonlinearities were all taken into account in the numerical analyses and the newton rapson method was adopted to solve the nonlinear problem 2 1 material tensile tests a total of 16 small plate specimens were tested under uniaxial tension including twelve of q345 steel and four of q235 steel the dimensions of the tensile test specimens were selected according to the gb t 228 1 2010 chinese standard as shown in fig 1 each of the pitted specimen was divided into three parts a pitting area part a clamping area part b and transition area the rest fig 2 shows all the pitted test specimens of two types of steels in regard to the 12 test specimens of q345 steel two of them were intact and ten had artificial pits while four specimens of q235 steel including two intact and two pitted ones were used to examine the degradation of material properties for different materials to fabricate the corroded specimens identical artificial pits were regularly distributed on one side of the surface in the pitting area which were introduced by computer numerical control cnc machining to simulate asymmetric corrosion the pit shape in each test specimen was identical being cylindrical denoted as c semi ellipsoidal denoted as s or conical denoted as t as shown in table 1 the diameter d and depth h of a pit were utilized to characterize the pit size and to define the volume loss caused by corrosion and the ratio of diameter to depth of a pit ranged from 2 to 8 being similar to that observed in real ship structures nakai et al 2004 the damage parameter dov of each corroded specimen was obtained by dividing the volume loss by the virgin volume within the pitting area 1 d o v v c v 0 100 where v 0 is the volume of pitting area of the intact plates v c denotes the volume loss caused by pitting corrosion respectively there were two types of pit distributions aligned rows denoted as a and staggered rows denoted as s for q345 steel the effect of pit shape was studied under three levels of pitting damage and the test specimens were grouped based on their corrosion damage as follows dov 6 79 dov 10 18 and dov 13 85 for q235 steel since it was designed to investigate the effect of pitting damage in different steels only cylindrical pits were introduced in the test specimens made of such steel under two levels of pitting damage dov 8 72 and dov 11 30 table 2 shows all the test specimens each of which was named in terms of its pitting distribution pit shape pit diameter and pit depth for example in group dov 6 79 ac9 1 33 has an aligned pattern of cylindrical pits with a diameter of 9 mm and a depth of 1 33 mm while as9 2 and at9 4 had the same pitting distribution and pit diameter as those of ac9 1 33 but with different pit depth corresponding to the semi ellipsoidal and conical pit shape respectively the pitted specimens were utilized to study the influence of pitting features such as the dov pitting distribution and pit shape on the tensile properties the measured dimensions of all test specimens are shown in table 2 owing to the high accuracy of the cnc machining it caused only a tiny size error in the final size of each fabricated specimen in contrast to the nominal size for the specimens of q345 steel the mean values of the width and thickness of the pitting area were 29 88 and 5 06 mm respectively for the specimens of q235 steel the mean values of the width and thickness of the pitting area were 29 92 and 4 54 mm respectively before performing a tensile test the clamping area of a specimen was clamped in the universal testing machine whose system kept a record for the loads and displacements in the entire loading process an extensometer was mounted on both lateral sides of the specimen to record total stretching deformation in the pitting area the stress strain curves from all the tests of two types of steels are shown in fig 3 a and the major tensile properties are outlined in table 2 the tensile properties herein included the elastic modulus e yield strength œÉ y ultimate tensile strength œÉ u and tensile strain Œµ u the elastic modulus was obtained by fitting the initial linear portion of a stress strain curve as shown in fig 4 the yield strength was determined based on the intersection of the stress strain curve and the linear segment offset of 0 2 strain the 0 2 proof stress method for the pitted specimen due to that its yield plateau vanished gradually as the increase of the pitting intensity the ultimate tensile strength and strain were determined upon the point of the maximum stress as shown in fig 4 2 2 numerical analyses numerical models of two typical tensile specimens containing the pitting and transition areas are shown in fig 5 one with aligned pits and another with staggered pits the width and thickness of the pitting area in a numerical model were consistent with their measured mean values the sizes of the pits also took the measured values shown in table 2 the fixed end constraint was applied on one end of the numerical model and the displacement loading was applied on the other end the engineering stress strain curves of the intact ii and intact iv specimens were converted into the true stress strain curves using eq 2 respectively applied for the material constitutive models of q345 and q235 steels in the fe analyses shown in fig 6 2 œÉ t œÉ 1 Œµ Œµ t ln 1 Œµ where œÉ and Œµ are the engineering stress and strain respectively and œÉ t and Œµ t are the true stress and strain respectively the element type was solid187 of ansys software as it can benefit the accurate modelling of 3d pit shapes the element size in the transition area was coarse to be 5 mm due to its intact feature without pits while the element size in the pitting area was set to 2 5 2 or 1 mm to explore the effect of mesh density fig 7 shows the obtained stress strain curves from numerical analyses including the intact and ac7 86 2 62 specimens with the different element sizes these curves from the three types of element sizes were close to each other and all the curves agreed well with the experimental results despite a sharp decrease in the fe results at the necking stage that differed from the slow descent in the tests therefore the differences in the element sizes had little effect on the fe results however the small element size greatly increased computing time thus the element size in the pitting area was set to the medium size of 2 mm in the following analyses fig 3b shows stress strain curves derived from numerical analyses of all the tensile tests the stress strain curves of the numerical and experimental results showed good agreements where the yield plateaus gradually decreased and even disappeared with the increase of the dov table 3 shows the material properties of the numerical analyses compared to those of the tensile tests where the values in brackets are the relative errors for the yield strength the relative errors between the numerical and test results were mostly less than 5 and for the ultimate tensile strength the errors were mostly less than 3 for the elastic modulus the errors were mostly around 5 except for specimen ac9 1 33 for the ac9 1 33 specimen the relatively larger error may come from the material inhomogeneity in the parent plate subjected to rolling for the ultimate tensile strain there were scattered relative errors ranging from 0 31 to 25 16 the variabilities of the young s modulus and the total elongations were attributed to the variation of the statistical features of corrosion damage in the test specimens woloszyk and garbatov 2020a b fig 8 shows the failure models of the specimens obtained from the fe analyses and the experiments illustrating high consistencies for the specimens with aligned pits the failure path was formed between a pair of aligned pits but it occurred between a pair of staggered pits for the specimens with staggered pits in addition for the numerical and experimental models there were some differences in the specific locations of the pit pairs where failure occurred this was due to the errors of pit depths caused by the cnc machining which resulted in some pits having relatively larger depths and then forming the weakest cross sections of the test specimens 3 pitting effects on tensile behavior the abovementioned validation against the tensile tests indicates that numerical simulations can reproduce the tests accurately the pitting effect on tensile behavior was thus comprehensively studied upon the numerical models of the test specimens of q345 steel since there was only a tiny error between the average measured size and nominal size of a test specimen the latter was adopted throughout the following nonlinear analyses to make the numerical modelling simplified so as to provide the same basis for comparisons on the effects of diverse pitting features the constitutive material model and the meshing scheme were in compliance with those in section 2 2 3 1 pitting distribution specimens ac9 1 33 and sc9 1 33 had the same level of pitting damage but with different pitting distribution the pits in the ac9 1 33 were distributed in an aligned pattern while those in the sc9 1 33 were scattered in a staggered pattern as shown in fig 5 fig 9 shows the stress strain curves of the two specimens evidently they were very similar in the elastic stage yielding stage and hardening stage with tiny differences however there were marked differences in the stage after necking the stress decreased monotonously with the increase of the strain at the necking stage for ac9 1 33 while the stress strain relationship fluctuated for sc9 1 33 hence the pit distribution had little effect on the elastic modulus yield strength and tensile strength but had a significant influence on the strain after the necking point fig 10 shows the stress contours at typical loading stages including the yielding stage the necking stage the pitting distribution was seen to influence the stress contour significantly for the specimen with aligned pits ac9 1 33 higher stresses arose inside and around the pits in the yielding stage but they intensively developed inside the pits and the linked areas of several pairs of aligned pits in the necking stage the failure path resulted from one pair of aligned pits with the highest level of stress in the necking stage for the specimen with staggered pits sc9 1 33 the development of the stress was similar to that in the specimen with aligned pits however a shear failure path appeared in the necking stage and a stress redistribution arose concurrently with a fluctuating stress strain curve as shown in fig 9 3 2 degree of volume loss fig 11 shows the relationships between the yield and tensile strength with the dovs of the corroded specimens the resulting dovs in the test specimens were 6 72 10 15 and 13 79 the regressed lines red lines indicate that all the tensile properties showed decreasing trends with the increases of the dovs the reductions of the yield and tensile strength were about 21 32 and 23 15 respectively if the dov increased to 13 79 from 6 72 thus the dov was a crucial factor for the degradation of the tensile strength however it will result in pronounced dispersions in the predicted results if only depending on the parameter dov as shown in fig 11 for the dov 6 72 in spite of the same degree of volume loss it leaded to a relative error of 5 47 in the minimax values for the yield strength and 5 64 for the tensile strength while for the dov 10 15 they decreased to 1 17 and 1 09 however for the dov 13 79 they increased to 7 45 and 8 2 again therefore the relations derived only upon the dov of the pitted specimens cannot accurately predict the reduction of tensile strength and more influential factors needed to be involved 3 3 pit shape fig 12 shows the influence of pit shape on the tensile strength in three groups of specimens subject to different dovs each group contained three specimens each of which were built with identical pits of a cylindrical semi ellipsoidal or conical shape for the group of specimens of dov 6 72 the pits of the cylindrical semi ellipsoidal or conical shape had the same diameter but with three types of pit depths such differences further resulted in three ratios of pit diameter to pit depth d h being 6 77 4 5 and 2 25 respectively in the three simulated specimens for the dov 10 15 the pits of different shapes had the same d h of 3 for the dov 13 79 these pits had the same depth but with different diameters corresponding to d h 2 86 3 5 and 4 95 respectively fig 12 shows that the yield strength and tensile strength of the pitted specimens decreased as the dov increased however under the same level of pitting damage the differences in the pit shape caused a significant disparity in the strength reduction for instance for three specimens of dov 6 72 the pits in three specimens had the same diameter but different depths as shown in table 1 to yield the same volume loss the cylindrical pits needed a smaller pit depth compared with the semi ellipsoidal and conical ones this resulted in a higher yield strength and tensile strength in the specimen with cylindrical pits in contrast for three specimens of dov 13 79 their pits had the same depth but different diameters in this case the cylindrical pits required a smaller pit diameter to produce the same volume loss this resulted in a smaller yield strength and tensile strength therefore both the pit diameter and pit depth played important roles in influencing the tensile strength of the pitted specimens notably the variation in eithor the pit diameter or pit depth due to the different pit shapes essentially corresponded to the changes of the key parameter of d h seen from fig 12 the larger the d h the higher the tensile strength interestingly for the three specimens of dov 10 15 their pits had the same d h almost yielding the same tensile strength despite their different pit shapes therefore the pit shape of corrosion pits had a significant influence on the tensile strength of pitted specimens which were closely correlated to the ratio of the diameter to the depth of corrosion pits moreover the pit shape significantly impacted the stress distribution in the pitted specimens as shown in fig 13 a higher level of stress occurred first at the yielding state only on the edges of the cylindrical pits but it arose simultaneously on the bottoms and edges of the semi ellipsoidal and conical pits however the stress contours of the specimens with different pit shapes tended to be similar with the increase of axial tensile displacement the difference in the onset location of the yield stress in the pitted areas was ascribed to the difference in the thickness distribution within the pits of different shapes compared with the semi ellipsoidal and conical pits of gradually decreasing thickness the thickness inside the cylindrical pits decreased dramatically forming a cliff at its edge and causing a higher stress concentration 4 degradation of tensile properties of different steels the degradation of tensile properties was studied on two types of steels subject to five levels of pitting damage a total of 150 specimens were designed to cover a wider range of data for each type of steel thirty specimens corresponded to each of five levels of pitting damage the 30 specimens were divided into three groups in terms of pit shapes including 10 with cylindrical pits 10 with semi ellipsoidal pits and 10 with conical pits the pits of each of ten specimens in a group had a constant ratio of pit diameter to pit depth but the ratios for the ten specimens in such a group were different and varied randomly between 2 and 8 fig 14 displays the information of the 150 specimens including the dov d h and pit shape all the numerical models of the 150 specimens were built up in terms of the nominal size in the aforementioned test specimens 4 1 q345 steel the residual strength of a pitted specimen was represented by a ratio r s of the strength in contrast to the intact one which was defined as œÉ y œÉ y0 for the yield strength and œÉ u œÉ u0 for the tensile strength herein œÉ y0 and œÉ u0 are the yield strength and tensile strength of the intact specimen respectively fig 15 and fig 16 show the variations of the residual strength with the changes of the key corrosion parameters d h and dov meanwhile regression analyses were performed to deduce the relationship between the residual strength and these corrosion parameters a function with two parameters Œ± and Œ≤ can be used to indicate the relationship between the residual strength and d h under a certain level of pitting damage 3 r s f d h d o v Œ± ln d h Œ≤ where the parameters Œ± and Œ≤ were relevant to the dov by performing regression analyses on the yield strength and tensile strength the parameters Œ± and Œ≤ were found to linearly vary with the dov as shown in figs 15b and 16b the following correlations were then formed 4 Œ± a d o v Œ≤ b d o v c substituting eq 4 into 3 yields an equivalent model of the residual strength as a function of d h and dov as follows 5 œÉ y œÉ y 0 0 6021 d o v l n d h 2 7201 d o v 1 œÉ u œÉ u 0 0 6519 d o v l n d h 2 7673 d o v 1 the equivalent model was validated against the test results as shown in fig 17 the relative errors between the test results and the predicted results based on eq 5 were mostly less than 3 for both the yield and tensile strength indicating a good precision of the equivalent model in addition to the strength more regression analyses were also performed on the numerical results of the 150 pitted specimens to acquire the relationships for the young s modulus and tensile strain with the key corrosion parameters as follows 6 e e 0 0 3914 d o v l n d h 2 1285 d o v 1 Œµ u Œµ u 0 1 1405 d o v l n d h 4 5398 d o v 1 based on the obtained relations for the tensile properties of the pitted specimens a bilinear stress strain curve was proposed for the material constitutive model of q345 steel as shown in fig 18 a whose hardening stage was simplified to be linear 4 2 q235 steel similar to the q345 steel numerical analyses were also carried out on 150 pitted specimens made of q235 steel the following equivalent models of the tensile properties were deduced 7 œÉ y œÉ y 0 0 5992 d o v l n d h 2 6938 d o v 1 œÉ u œÉ u 0 0 6528 d o v l n d h 2 7314 d o v 1 8 e e 0 0 4966 d o v l n d h 2 4361 d o v 1 Œµ u Œµ u 0 1 2255 d o v l n d h 5 2257 d o v 1 the equivalent models were also validated using the test results of specimens ac8 2 and ac8 2 5 as shown in fig 17 the relative errors between the analytical and experimental results were less than 4 for both the yield and tensile strength showing good agreements the equivalent models of the young s modulus and ultimate tensile strain given by eq 8 were used for the q235 steel as shown in fig 18b 5 discussion 5 1 deterioration of tensile properties the above analyses clearly demonstrated the effect of pitting damage on the tensile properties of different steels however differences in the equivalent material models for the different steels need further attentions for in service aged structures the pitting damage in the interests of iacs requirements may lead a limiting value of dov to about 10 wang et al 2018a hence a further verification on the material constitutive models were performed for the different steels under three levels of pitting damage such as dovs of 5 10 and 15 under each level of dov twenty five values of d h which varied from 2 to 8 at an equal interval of 0 25 were involved in determining the yield and tensile strength in terms of eqs 5 and 7 respectively for each type of steel fig 19 indicates the results of the different equivalent material models there were no significant differences in the predicted values for both the yield and tensile strength of the q345 and q235 steels the type of steel thus does not impact the degradation of tensile properties caused by pitting corrosion damage furthermore the equivalent material model proposed herein was verified with previously reported experiments sheng and xia 2017 yao et al 2018 as shown in table 4 the material in yao s work was high strength nv d36 steel which had tensile properties similar to those of q345 steel each test specimen had four rows of staggered pits of a hemispherical or conical shape and the d h values of the hemispherical and conical pits were 6 and 4 respectively table 4 shows the predicted results of the equivalent model in this paper agreed well with those reported test results in most cases the relative errors of the yield strength were less than 2 while those of the tensile strength were less than 3 with respect to the tests in sheng s work the narrow and deep conical pits with d h values less than one were mechanically formed in the test specimens of q235 steel claimed to simulate the corrosion in normal atmospheric environment the equivalent material model in this paper tended to slightly over predict the tensile strength of the test specimens in sheng s tests the relative errors of the yield strength were mostly less than 5 but the errors of the tensile strength were relatively larger and mostly in the range of 5 10 obviously a worse prediction accuracy occurred when the equivalent model in this paper was applied to the sheng s tests compared with the yao s tests this was closely related to the d h ratios of the artificially introduced pits in the sheng s tests a larger size error may arise in the fabricated specimens due to the very narrow shapes of the pits of a diameter of 2 5 mm that had the measurements of the pit depths inaccurate in addition the conical pits in those test specimens were induced with the d h values less than 1 0 differing from those in this paper that were used to simulate the corrosion in natural marine environments it was reported that the ultimate tensile or compressive strength of plate may be governed by the largest pit depth as it caused the maximum reduction of a cross sectional area paik et al 2003 however the comparison of predicted results in table 5 indicates that the formula derived from the largest pit depth cannot always yield rational predictions on the tensile tests in both this paper and yao s work especially for the test specimens with the staggered pits shown in fig 5b large relative errors arose in the results from the paik s formula in the worst case the maximum relative error reached to 15 49 if used for the prediction on the yao s tests in fact the pit with the largest depth does not always result in the maximum reduction in a cross sectional area garbatov et al 2014b by contrast the formula described by dov and d h can predict the tensile strength more accurately as for the steel with real irregular corrosion pits it may be rational to define the d h as the ratio of the average diameter and the average depth of all the measured pits 5 2 application of equivalent material model to assess ultimate strength of intact steel plates a material constitutive model consisting of an elastic modulus yield strength and tensile strength is required whether by numerical or analytical method in this paper the equivalent material model was proposed to assess the ultimate strength of a steel plate with regular corrosion pits it can be achieved by treating the corroded steel plate as an intact one made of a deteriorated material dependent on the volume loss ratio and the ratio of pit diameter to pit depth such an application of the equivalent material model was illustrated upon the following available experiments collapse tests of box type plated structures with varying pitting corrosion damage have been performed under axial compression paik et al 2003 each of plates in the box type structure had dimensions of 580 mm 500 mm 4 4 mm and was artificially introduced with perforated pits regularly scattered on its surface the test structures were made of q235 steel they were utilized to calibrate the equivalent material model of corroded steel for numerical analyses one sheet of the test plates was taken because of symmetric conditions in the box type structures paik et al 2003 four edges of the test plate were thought to be simply supported one of which as the loading edge was inflicted with an axial displacement to simulate axial compressive load in numerical analyses two test plates with dops of 4 87 and 10 24 were studied respectively the pits on the plate had an identical diameter of 30 mm fig 20 shows the equivalent material models of corroded steels with diverse levels of pitting damage and the stress strain curve of the intact plate hereon each model was dependent on its dov and d h of the corresponding plate based on such a model an intact plate made of a new type of steel was used to replace the pitted plate and to represent the ultimate strength of the pitted plate without needing to model the detailed corrosion pits of course intuitively a pitted plate with the details of corrosion pits referred to as a real pitted model was also built up whose results served a reference to calibrate the proposed equivalent model of the pitted steel the element type same as that used for the tensile coupon tests solid187 was adopted and the plate thickness 4 4 mm was used as the control size for freely generating the meshes in all the numerical models fig 21 shows the results from the experiments and from the two types of numerical models real pitted model and equivalent material model fig 21a and b display two types of numerical models yielded stress strain behavior similar to those from the tests with similar ultimate strength fig 21c illustrates the differences in two types of numerical results compared with the test results the maximum relative errors from two types of numerical models were about 8 most likely due to the inaccurate residual stress adopted in the numerical models that was not measured in the original tests paik et al 2003 from the view of practical application the equivalent model can be used to predict the ultimate strength of test plates averting modelling the complex corrosion pits however it may lead to a striking difference in the stress strain behavior especially in the post collapse stages if comparing fig 21a with fig 21b in addition the corrosion pits played a detrimental role in decreasing the compressive behavior of the pitted plate as shown in fig 21d besides causing a sharp decrease in the structural stiffness shown in fig 21a recently an equivalent material model has also been proposed for the correlation of tensile properties with pitting damage based on tensile coupon tests yao et al 2018 fig 22 a shows the equivalent material models from yao s work and fig 22b shows the predicted results using the yao s model concurrent with the results of paik s tests obviously the yao s model always over predicted the ultimate strength of the test plates with larger relative errors of 13 78 for the dop 4 87 and 25 74 for the dop 10 24 this was attributed to that the yao s model did not take into account the dov and pit shape simultaneously but only the dop interestingly a recent study showed that corrosion did not change the chemical properties of the corroded steel and seemed to have no effect on the mechanical properties of steel itself rajput and paik 2021 a larger number of experiments however shows that the rough surface of steel due to corrosion suffers from a stress concentration and degrades the mechanical properties of the corroded steel to follow the mainstream this paper aims to derive an equivalent constitutive model to tackle the degradation of mechanical properties of corroded steel an alternative steel depicted by the equivalent material model can be used to represent the corroded steel for ultimate strength assessments of pitted structures as for an actual aged structure the statistical characteristics of pitting corrosion can be obtained by performing a normal corrosion inspection daidola et al 1997 the equivalent material model corresponding to the specific structure can be determined in terms of measured data by inputting its dov and d h into eq 5 8 the ultimate strength of the pitted structure can be represented by treating it as the intact structure made of the alternative steel 6 conclusion this paper presents comprehensive experimental and numerical studies on tensile properties of q345 and q235 steels subject to artificial corrosion pits pitting features experimental procedures tensile properties stress strain curves and failure modes of the test specimens were fully reported numerical analyses were performed on all the tests to validate numerical models of pitted plates a series of numerical analyses were then conducted to study the effects of diverse pitting features on tensile properties of pitted specimens of different steels results showed that pit shape significantly affects the tensile properties of pitted plates by impacting stress distribution in locally pitted areas especially the effect of pit shape on tensile properties is mainly dependent on the ratio d h of pit diameter to pit depth for two types of corroded steels deterioration of the material properties can be represented by a universal equivalent material model that was derived by correlating the degree of volume loss dov and d h with tensile properties upon this the ultimate strength of a pitted plate with regular corrosion pits can be assessed by treating it as an intact one made of the equivalent material in lieu of

20441,initiation and growth of pitting corrosion results from electro chemical reactions closely related to environmental factors causing great uncertainties in the pit depth pit size pit shape and pitting distribution a cellular automaton ca approach was adopted to address the electro chemical process of pitting corrosion in marine environments yielding a geometric morphology of corrosion damage the simulated corrosion pits in the ca based model treated as the cylinders semi ellipsoids cones or cavities of hybrid shapes were introduced into structural analysis models the effect of pit shape on compressive behavior and ultimate strength of pitted plates was studied which was linked with the stress interaction between pits a modelling method based on stochastic simulation was proposed to generate random pitting damage based on limited statistical corrosion data which could reflect all aspects of the random natures of actual pitting corrosion numerical results showed high consistencies with available tests of ultimate strength of pitted plates the pit shape significantly affects the ultimate strength of pitted structures likely causing a strength variation more than 20 in a naturally pitted hull plate this is essentially due to the stress interaction between pits of diverse shapes affecting the onset and development of plasticity in pitted areas keywords pitted structure random pitting damage cellular automaton pit shape ultimate strength stochastic simulation 1 introduction ship and marine structures made of steel serve in harsh corrosive marine environments over their lifecycle they are prone to general uniform or local corrosion due to corrosive materials such as chloride hypochlorite and bromide pitting corrosion as a type of typical local corrosion causes local dissolution of metal leading to insidious structural damage covered by corrosion products it can result in the degradation of material strength and ductility and even a sudden failure of a component without any prior warnings garbatov et al 2016 it is a premise for adopting proper manners to mitigate and maintain in service damaged structures to understand the compressive behavior of pitted plates subject to random pitting corrosion damage corrosion pits in ship and marine structures have great uncertainties in the pit size pit depth pit shape and distribution location of the pits due to the influences from environments and characteristics of material it is recognized that the distribution of the maximum pit depth and its time dependent relation can be described using probabilistic models bhandari et al 2015 melchers 2008 the pit shapes are observed to be cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical in actual ship structures nakai et al 2004b owing to the shortage of effective modelling methods to describe pitting corrosion these random natures of pitting damage were rarely taken into account in the strength assessment of pitted structures wang et al 2014 for example the iacs regulations recommend that corrosion pits are simplified as an uniformly reduced wall thickness with an equivalent thickness iacs 2016a however it is difficult to decide the equivalent thickness rationally whether on the whole or at the minimum cross section of an actual corroded plate as it has unevenly corroded surface and the thickness loss of the plate varies from position to position nakai et al 2006b a large number of experimental and numerical studies have been carried out to explore the effect of pitting damage on ultimate strength of pitted structures with artificial corrosion pits in most cases the random corrosion pits were simplified as regularly distributed identical cavities of a single shape such as rectangular cylindrical semi ellipsoidal or conical shapes and with a constant depth and size diameter as outlined in table 1 the rectangular pits were applied in relatively few numerical studies due to their obvious difference with actual corrosion pits despite the simplicity in numerical modelling paik and thayamballi 2002 rahbar ranji et al 2015 by contrast the conical pits have been widely applied in the earlier experimental and numerical studies due to their good capacity to approximate the real pit shapes ahmmad and sumi 2010 nakai et al 2004a the cylindrical pits were applied more widely for they were easy to be fabricated in the test samples and modeled in the virtual samples jiang and guedes soares 2013 paik et al 2003 wang et al 2018 however there are relatively fewer application reports on the semi ellipsoidal pits due to their great complicity for the sample preparation and numerical modelling although they are a good approximation to the real pit shapes huang et al 2010 silva et al 2013 yao et al 2018 obviously a gap remains in the simulation of natural corrosion no matter by artificial corrosion tests or by numerical modelling as a result the tests on the naturally pitted specimens and structural components were more preferred nakai et al 2004b zhang et al 2017c the scanning electron microscope sem was often utilized to capture the corrosion morphology of actual corroded specimens which will be imported to cad system for constructing the finite element meshes pidaparti and rao 2008 however it is costly to prepare naturally corroded specimens as it inevitably causes a destruction in the in service structures in addition the sem is only applicable for modelling the small samples due to needing enormous amount of finite element meshes to describe a rough surface this hinders the possibility to carry out a sufficient number of specimen component tests of naturally pitted structures to clarify the effect of pitting corrosion in this context the stochastic simulation was thought efficient to produce corrosion damage approximate to the specimen tests by introducing several pseudo random variables to reflect the random natures in the size depth and distribution of corrosion pits silva et al 2013 wang et al 2018 in the stochastic simulations random pitting corrosion has proven to result in more serious strength reduction than general corrosion at the same level of pitting intensity with a distinct variation of strength however there are no studies on the effect of pit shape on structural behavior and ultimate strength of pitted structures accounting for the random nature of pit shape varying to be cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical the initiation and growth of pitting corrosion are closely related to the environments of in service structures nakai et al 2004b these processes of micrometer level pits of small scale steel samples in short term corrosion tests can be reproduced by using 3d cellular automata ca cui et al 2019 van der wee√´n et al 2014 for ship and marine structures in harsh marine environments corrosion causes uneven surfaces in the large scale structural components with extremely irregular pits whose diameters were observed to range from 25 to 80 mm rahmdel et al 2015 for the large scale structural components with millimeter level pits widely spreading over their surfaces there are no reports on corrosion simulation via 3d ca in addition for the ultimate strength assessment solid elements can be used to describe the pit details in the models of small scale samples ahmmad and sumi 2010 pidaparti and rao 2008 but it requires a huge amount of fine millimeter level meshes likely causing an unacceptable consumption of computing recourse all of these aspects present a challenge in modelling the actual pitting damage for the ultimate strength assessment of damaged structures in terms of limited statistical data from normal corrosion survey according to iacs regulations iacs 2016b an experimental and numerical study on the tensile properties of small scale pitted coupons has been carried out in part i of the series of studies wang and lin the tensile strength was associated with the shape together with the volume loss of corroded material an equivalent material model was proposed to predict the residual strength of pitted structures instead of modelling detailed pits in this paper an improved 3d ca is adopted to produce a wide range of macro corrosion pits in the large scale plates considering the electrochemical process of pitting corrosion in marine environments it is then used to produce several virtual plates subject to different levels of pitting damage in lieu of natural corrosion tests the ca based models are translated into structural analysis models by modelling corrosion pits as cylinders semi ellipsoids cones or hybrid shapes of cavities a modelling method based on the stochastic simulation is then proposed to involve all aspects of random natures of pitting corrosion the effect of pit shape on the compressive behavior and ultimate strength of pitted plates is illustrated the stress interaction between pits is studied to display the mechanism of the pitting effect on the onset and development of plasticity in the pitted areas the applicability of the proposed modelling method is validated on available experiments and is verified with the existing empirical formulas 2 modelling of pitting damage in this section the uneven morphology of pitting corrosion is reflected through performing the electrochemical simulation on the initiation growth and propagation of a cluster of corrosion pits via cellular automata ca the ca model is improved and adapted to simulate widespread macro pits in order to replace costly corrosion tests a stochastic simulation method is proposed to describe the random nature of pitting damage in the numerical models of pitted structures applied for ultimate strength assessment in the models the random natures relevant to pitting features including the size depth shape and distribution location of the corrosion pits are considered simultaneously but not separately some of typical pit shapes and pitting features considered here are shown in fig 1 2 1 ca based simulation on corrosion morphology a homogenous 3d ca was designed to simulate pitting corrosion of steel structures in a marine environment the ca system c can be represented as c œÇ s s n œï van der wee√´n et al 2014 where œÇ was a 3d grid of cells c the cells c contained three types of cells including corrosive cells chloride non corrosive cells seawater and metal cells steel although the corrosive solution contained components more than merely water and chloride all the non reactive components were seen as water since they were irrelevant to the current modelling purpose van der wee√´n et al 2014 in the 3d grid of cells the rows columns and layers were represented by i j and k respectively in which i and j formed a layer in a certain thickness denoted by the k the s was a finite set of states composed of the state of each of cells c the neighborhood function n determined the neighboring cells of every cell c including the cell c itself the moore neighborhood of a cell c i j k comprising 27 neighbors in total that shared at least one vertex with c i j k was utilized to define the neighboring cells of each cell the output function yielded the state s c t of each cell at the tth time step in the initial state the state of each cell was s c 0 the transition function œï yielded the state s c t 1 of each cell c at the next time step t 1 depending on the state of the cell c and its neighboring cells at the current time step the solution submerging the metal electrode was represented by a single topside layer of cells in the ca system where the chloride can diffuse in such a solution the initial number of corrosive cells was determined in terms of the concentration of chloride ions in the simulated seawater the diffusion of the chloride ion was simulated by switching the state of the central cell c i j k or the state of the cell in its neighborhood it moved towards nevertheless once pits appeared on the surface and then grew a concentration and potential gradient emerged and the chloride ions will move deeper inside to the pits complying with a suction probability lŒµ 0 1 after completing the diffusion the chloride ion attacked steel cells in their neighborhood to initiate corrosion pits the attacked cell will be changed into water or chloride state by a probability p p Œµ 0 1 however unlike the pit initiation the candidate steel cells for attack during pit propagation were the cells that were a part of an already existing pit such steel cells were dissolved with a probability p d dependent on an indubitable ir control of the current pit growth laws van der wee√´n et al 2014 defined as 1 p d p d 0 1 d d m Œæ here p d0 is the dissolution probability at the metal surface and Œæ is the ir factor and d is the layer number where an attacked steel cell is located and d m is the total number of layers of all the cells usually the ca simulation ceases in line with the predetermined time of an electric chemical reaction however the termination condition of the ca simulation herein was replaced by the degree of pitting intensity dop or the volume loss of corroded material dov wang et al 2018 this can lead to corrosion damage matching with the targeted level of pitting corrosion the flowchart to simulate the pitting corrosion using ca technique is shown in the left part of fig 2 fig 3 shows a typical sample of pitted plates from the ca simulation obviously the shapes of simulated corrosion pits were extremely irregular and coalescence of pits occurred during the pit propagation the simulated pitting corrosion was in close proximity to the real corrosion morphology as the electrochemical reactions related to pitting behavior was properly involved in the ca model since each cell to discretize the plate in this model had a determinate size and location the size and location of each corrosion pit described by such cells were also deterministic therefore uncertainty in pitting distribution of the resulting plates derived from the ca based model did not exist after the cease of the simulation but totally embodied in the simulation of electrochemical reactions however there is a great uncertainty in the pitting corrosion from corrosion tests or naturally corroded structures since it is usually determined by means of corrosion inspection to be statistical and incomplete daidola et al 1997 of course the simulated pitting corrosion could be statistical as that in the actual pitted plate if not considering the specific information stored in these cells it is worth noting that the corrosion damage from the ca based model was still geometric for ultimate strength assessment it is necessary to transform geometric models into finite element fe models the pitting features in the ca based model including the pit depths pit sizes and pitting distribution can be imported directly into the fe models as shown in the grey rectangle shown in fig 2 2 2 stochastic simulation on structural damage this section presents a framework to establish finite element models of pitted structures in terms of statistical data of pitting corrosion from a ca based simulation or normal corrosion survey the right part of fig 2 outlines the key steps to translate the corrosion morphology into a structural analysis model for the corrosion derived from a normal inspection a set of pseudo random corrosion pits were generated in the light of the statistical features of corrosion data which can be implemented using software with inbuilt random number method these pits were then stored in a two dimensional array pitdata n 5 that recorded the specific information of all the random pits the first index n of the array was the number of a certain pit in a pitted structure the second index 5 denoted five key pitting features including the locations of x and y axes radius depth and shape of a pit cavity in such step the radii and depths of all the n pits were determined and stored in the corresponding unit of the array pitdata for instance two units pitdata i 3 and pitdata i 4 recorded the radius and depth of the ith pit i n respectively with respect to random nature in pitting distribution it was also decided by the random number method the probability of pitting distribution followed a uniform distribution complying with actual corrosion characteristics observed in ship structures paik et al 2003 the location of each pit was denoted by the random coordinates in x and y axes and stored in two units pitdata i 1 and pitdata i 2 the pits may randomly occur in a local region or scatter over the entire surface of a pitted member respectively referred to as the localized corrosion wang et al 2020 or widespread corrosion wang and shenoi 2019 as can be seen from both the real pits in fig 1 and pseudo random pits in fig 3 the pit shape varied to be cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical with great randomness as for a pit of a certain shape there were various sets of pit radii and pit depths under a certain level of volume loss however in view of the fact that the pit depth is critical to the strength degradation of a pitted member the pit depth determined at first step remained unchanged but the pit size radius was changed for simulating the random nature of the pit shape specifically the radius of a pit was finally determined depending on its random shape in terms of 2 v 1 3 œÄ r c 2 h œÄ r 2 h 2 3 œÄ r s 2 h r c 3 r r s 6 2 r where v is the volume loss in a single pit r r c and r s are the equivalent radius of the cylindrical pit conical pit and semi ellipsoidal pit respectively and h is the pit depth meanwhile the unit value of pitdata i 3 for the ith pit was correspondingly modified to the new radius while the pit shape was recorded in pitdata i 5 denoted by 1 for the cylinder 2 for the semi ellipsoid or 3 for the cone after determining these random pitting natures all the pits can be formed by performing boolean operation between 3d solid pits and structural model as shown in fig 4 compared with the model using shell elements wang et al 2018 the solid model had a distinct advantage as it can involve the random nature of pit shape besides the location size and depth of pits moreover the coalescence between pits can be reflected in the solid model while it cannot be achieved in the shell model as for the solid model incorporated with the random pits a free meshing method was applied to address complicated geometry to accomplish a structural analysis model fig 5 displays numerical models with corrosion pits of a single shape being cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical or hybrid shapes fig 6 shows that the pits of hybrid shapes had a significant impact to the stress distribution of the pitted plate leading to a very irregular stress contour 3 the effect of pit shape it is reported that random nature of pitting damage causes a significant strength variation in addition to a strength degradation wang and shenoi 2019 wang et al 2018 however it remains unclear on the pitting effect accounting for random pit shape in this section the effect of pit shape on the ultimate strength was studied under three levels of pitting corrosion derived from the aforesaid ca based model in addition the effect of pit shape on locally distributed stress in pitted areas was studied under various pitting parameters including the distances and angularities between pits which was reflected on the stress concentration factors scf such parameters were seen to represent the change of pitting distribution target structures were square plates of an edge length of 800 mm and a thickness of 15 mm the material of the plates was mild steel with an elastic modulus of 205 8 gpa a possion s ratio of 0 3 and a yield stress of 352 8 mpa two types of structural analyses were performed including non linear analyses to assess the ultimate strength in section 3 2 and linear analyses to acquire the stress concentration factors in section 3 3 for nonlinear analyses elastic perfectly plastic material model was applied simultaneously considering material and geometric nonlinearities without residual stress the initial deformation of the pitted plates was formed as a half wave 0 1 Œ≤ 2 t sin œÄ x a sin œÄ y b where a b t and Œ≤ are the length width thickness and slenderness ratio of the unstiffened plates respectively simply supported boundary was applied at four edges of each plate axial thrust along the x axis was implemented by exerting a displacement in the nonlinear analyses instead of force loading however the linear analyses adopted the elastic material model meanwhile a uniformly distributed stress was applied on one of the plate edges vertical to the x axis solid element solid 187 in ansys was used to construct the structural analysis models by free meshing with the control size of meshes being the thickness of the pitted plates fig 4 displays the computing model of a pitted plate 3 1 corrosion characteristics a 3d ca based model consisting of 800 800 46 cells was constructed to simulate the initiation and growth of corrosion pits the top layer of the cells represented the aqueous solution with chloride concentration of a mass percentage of 3 5 analogous to a marine environment while the other layers represented the steel subjected to corrosion the key parameters for ca simulation were determined in terms of the pitting corrosion test of steel van der wee√´n et al 2014 as listed in table 2 the ca simulation was performed thrice to produce three levels of pitting damage in order to clarify the effects of pitting features on strength degradation in various scenarios in terms of iacs regulations iacs 2016a b corrosion survey needs to be conducted if the dop of a structural member is greater than 15 in addition the upper limit of the dop occurring in in service structures is 25 or else necessary mitigation and restoration measures are required to adopt therefore the ca simulation herein produced pitting corrosion in the interest of iacs specification being dops 10 15 and 25 after completing the ca simulation to a targeted dop irregular pits were statistically analyzed by regarding them as a series of semi ellipsoidal cavities to obtain their statistical characteristics the treatment introduced a small error in the final dop due to the difficulty to approximate the irregular pit shapes precisely the resulting dops were about 9 28 18 75 and 27 6 at three levels of pitting damage for the three ca simulations with dovs 2 88 7 74 and 11 95 respectively corrosion morphology of the simulated pitted plate for dop 18 75 was taken as a sample shown in fig 3 it was reported that in corrosion survey on real ship structures that pit shapes are close to be cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical the ratios of the diameter to depth d h range between 10 1 to 4 1 nakai et al 2004a and the maximum diameter of pits of steel in marine water is about 25 80 mm paik et al 2003 the cutaway views of the pitted plate shown in fig 3 exhibit the pit shapes from the ca simulation being similar to cylinders semi ellipsoids and cones the statistical data of these pits at three levels of pitting damage can be obtained to construct the structural model as shown in fig 2 fig 7 shows the detailed diameters and depths of these pits derived from the statistical analyses the simulated pitting corrosion was approximate to corrosion damage in normal service condition for the pitting corrosion beneath the upper limit dop 25 may introduce a dov of about 10 wang et al 2018 it appears that corrosion developed in the pit depth faster than in the pit size at lower levels of pitting damage resulting in smaller d h ratios while this reversed at higher levels of pitting damage zayed et al 2018 meanwhile the number of corrosion pits decreased with increase of the dov due to the coalescence of some pits during pit growth for this reason some larger pits occurred under serious corrosion of dov 11 95 the ca simulation can reflect the electrochemical process of pitting behavior properly such as initiation growth and propagation of corrosion pits producing the corrosion damage highly close to natural corrosion however it was worth noting that for a specific simulation the locations sizes and depths of all the simulated pits in the ca based model in spite of the irregular pit shapes have been determined after the cease of the simulation this was due to that such information had been stored in the simulation space of the ca based model and can be imported into the structural model directly however it was only geometric but not structural in order to assess the ultimate strength of a pitted plate the ca based model needed to be converted according to the steps shown in the grey rectangle in fig 2 3 2 compressive behavior of simulated pitted plates compressive behavior of pitted plates was studied herein under three levels of pitting damage derived from the ca simulations in previous section since the ca simulation actually yielded pitting damage with a determinate pattern in the depths sizes and distributions of corrosion pits that stored in the ca based model the stochastic simulation herein only involved the shapes of corrosion pits this made it easier to discriminate the effect of pit shape from the compound effect resulting from the complex random natures of pitting corrosion in the pit depth pit size and pitting distribution hereon the pit shapes were described as cylinders semi ellipsoids cones or hybrid shapes composed by three types of shapes nonlinear analyses were carried out upon the numerical models with various shapes of pits to clarify the effect of pit shape on the compressive behavior of pitted plates 3 2 1 ultimate strength ultimate strength of the intact plate without pits was 244 mpa being the reference strength to define the strength reduction of a pitted plate table 3 shows ultimate strength of pitted plates with various shapes of pits and the percentage strength reductions the pitting damage leaded to significant strength reductions moreover the strength reduction of a pitted plate was highly related to pit shapes depending on they were cylindrical semi ellipsoidal conical or hybrid shape for multiple levels of pitting damage the models with cylindrical pits yielded the largest reduction of ultimate strength while those with conical pits produced the smallest reduction by contrast the models with semi ellipsoidal pits and hybrid pits leaded to relatively moderate strength reductions very close to each other in the worst case of dov 11 95 the disparity of strength reduction due to the difference of the pit shape was about 4 5 resulting from the models with cylindrical and conical pits it is worth noting that the random natures in the location size and depth of the pits were identical for the models with various shapes of pits as they were inherited from the same ca based models however obvious distinctions in strength reductions of pitted plates yet emerged even if the pit shape was the only random variable and the disparities became more and more distinct with increase of the level of pitting intensity therefore the pit shape resembled other pitting features such as the pit size pit depth and pitting distribution causing significant strength variation wang et al 2018 it is not hard to come to an inference that the random natures of the pitting features including the pit shape have a more complicated effect on the ultimate strength than those excluding the pit shape 3 2 2 failure behavior fig 8 shows stress strain behavior of pitted plates with different pit shapes under three levels of pitting damage the effect of pit shape on the stress strain behavior was variant in the entire loading process the difference in stress strain behavior of pitted plates due to the difference of the pit shape was indistinct at the stages of elastic deformation and post collapse but it became distinct at the stage approaching to ultimate strength the difference became more remarkable with increase of the degree of pitting damage as shown in fig 8 b and c moreover the models with cylindrical pits always resulted in pessimistic predictions on the stress strain behavior of pitted plates while those with semi ellipsoidal pits or hybrid pits presented pertinent results very close to each other in essence the difference in the stress strain behavior of pitted plates resulted from the difference in the stress distribution and plastic behavior and significantly affected by the pit shape as shown in fig 9 as a typical example the plastic strains of pitted plates with pits of various shapes at the moderate level of pitting damage of dov 7 74 were illustrated evidently the pit shape influenced the plastic behavior significantly due to the stress interaction between the nearby corrosion pits for the cylindrical pits the sharp change of the plate thickness on the edge of a pitting cavity leaded to a higher level of stress on the edge with a relatively lower level of stress away from the edge this resulted in the plasticity initiated on the pit edge firstly and then developed inside toward the center of the pit or outside between the adjacent pits due to the stress interaction as shown in fig 9 a in contrast the semi ellipsoidal and the conical pits had gradually decreasing thickness from the edges to centers of the pits the smallest thickness at the vertexes of the pits induced plasticity more easily and the plasticity developed toward the edges of the pits as shown in fig 9 b concerning the hybrid pits composed by three types of pit shapes the stress interaction also played a vital role to affect the onset and development of plasticity in the pitted plate showing a different interference pattern as shown in fig 9 c 3 3 stress interaction between simulated pits random natures of pitting damage can cause a significant variation of ultimate strength in pitted structures besides serious strength degradation silva et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the random natures were mostly treated as a set of random variables relevant to pit depth pit size and distribution location of pits as for pitting distribution the spacing and angularity of pits are two key factors to describe its uncertainty therefore the effect of pit shape was studied herein under different levels of these factors elastic analyses rather than nonlinear analyses were carried out as the former can display the stress interaction between pits of various shapes more clearly which can be reflected by the stress concentration factor scf two types of pitted plates with the single pit or dual pits were adopted because of its simplicity to illustrate the effect of pit shape the single pit plates contained a pit of a diameter of 30 mm and a depth of 7 5 mm and the dual pit plates included two pits of diameters of 30 and 35 mm respectively and a depth of 7 5 mm 3 3 1 single pit the single pit was centrally situated in the square plate thickness loss caused by the pit cavity resulted in a notable stress concentration around or in the pit under uniform load of the unit pressure it can be measured by the scf that was defined as the ratio of von mises stress to the axially loaded unit pressure fig 10 shows the detailed stress distribution around the single pit of diverse shapes the stress concentration was displayed upon a subarea in the view range of an edge length of 300 mm that was cut from the pitted plate in terms of eq 2 it is clear that under the same degree of volume loss and pit depth the cylindrical pit has a narrower size while the conical pit has a wider size compared with the semi ellipsoidal pit the different shapes leaded to remarkably different stress distribution around these pits with a different scf table 4 lists scfs of the pits of diverse shapes seen from fig 10 for the cylindrical pit a steep stress decline arose on the pit edge especially for that vertical to loading direction as such area had a sharp decrease of plate thickness with scf 1 867 while the semi ellipsoidal pit had a gently decreasing thickness within the pit which leaded to a larger area with high stress of scf 1 833 for the same reason the tapering thickness in the conical pit had the stress around the pit changed by a uniform gradient with a highly stress concentrated vertex of scf 1 927 it followed that the pit shape plays a vital role to influence the stress distribution around in a pit that determines the onset and development of plasticity in pitted areas 3 3 2 dual pits in the case of pitted plates with dual pits the pit of a diameter of 30 mm was fixedly situated at the center of the plate while the pit of a diameter of 35 mm had a varied position that was to produce a changed distance d pit spacing or angularity Œ∏ relative to the smaller pit pit spacing ranged to be d 70 130 195 and 260 mm with a constant Œ∏ 90 while pit angularity varied to be Œ∏ 0 45 or 90 with a constant d 70 mm in consideration of summation of the radii of dual pits being 32 5 mm the pit spacing can be regarded to vary in the range of 2 8 times of the summation fig 11 shows the stress distribution and stress interaction between dual pits due to the change of pit spacing for diverse shapes of pits it is noted that since pit spacing for d 260 mm leaded to the bigger pit beyond the view range of 300 mm 300 mm only the smaller pit was shown obviously the stress interaction between dual pits had stress concentration intensified highly depending on the pit spacing the closer the dual pits the larger the stress concentration as shown in fig 13 a for instance the scf of dual cylindrical pits increased to 2 451 as compared to the single pit with scf 1 867 the serious stress concentration was ascribed to the smallest pit spacing of the dual pits with d 70 mm however the stress interaction almost vanished if the pit spacing increased to d 260 mm in particular compared with the cylindrical and conical pits the stress interaction between the semi ellipsoidal pits was more sensitive to the pit spacing as the relevant relation curve in fig 13 a had the steepest downward trend the pit angularity also had a strong impact to the stress interaction of the dual pits as shown in fig 12 fig 13 b shows that intensity of the stress interaction increased with increase of the pit angularity from 0 to 90 apart from causing the gradually ascended scf its change determined the location at which had the largest scf normally the largest scf arose at adjacent area between the dual pits with a pit angularity larger than zero highly relying on the pit angularity however it tended to be similar to the single pit in the case of the pit angularity equal to zero fig 13 b exhibited the relation of the stress concentration and pit angularity evidently the semi ellipsoidal pits were also more susceptive to the pit angularity in contrast to the cylindrical and conical pits because of a sharp uptrend in the relation curve of the scf and the pit angularity in summary pit shape significantly influences the onset and development of plastic behavior of pitted structures by affecting the stress distribution and stress interaction between the corrosion pits in local pitted areas it is thus necessary to model all the random natures including the pit shape for establishing computing models for ultimate strength assessment of actual pitted structures 4 modelling the compressive behavior of actual pitted plates 4 1 artificial pitting corrosion the collapse tests were performed on box type plated structures made up of four identical steel sheets each of which had a dimension of 580 mm 580 mm 4 4 mm with artificial corrosion pits paik et al 2003 the aim to design the box type plated structures was to provide a simply supported condition for each steel sheet cylindrical corrosion pits were regularly drilled with a through thickness in each sheet two levels of pitting damage were introduced in two tested structures by inflicting different numbers of corrosion pits in each structure respectively leading to dovs of 4 87 and 10 42 small tensile coupon tests were conducted to obtain the material properties of the tested structures axial compression load was applied until and after reaching the ultimate strength the maximum initial deflections in steel sheets were measured being in the range of 1 15 3 38 mm more detailed information on the test structures can be found in paik et al 2003 in order to construct the numerical model for each tested structure one sheet but not four sheets of the entire box was adopted as done in paik et al 2003 by the modelling method in section 2 2 since pit size pit depth pit shape and pitting distribution were all determinate in the tested structures the uncertainties of pitting damage were not involved in the numerical modelling true stress strain curves of material based on the small tensile samples was applied in numerical analyses where material and geometric nonlinearities were simultaneously considered welding induced residual stress was not explicitly considered as it was not measured in the original tests and had little effect on the ultimate strength of pitted structures paik et al 2003 the initial deflection was introduced with a maximum magnitude of 2 265 mm being the median of the measured values the experimental and numerical results from paik s work paik et al 2003 are listed in 2nd and 3rd columns of table 5 respectively so that the numerical results derived from the proposed modelling method in section 2 2 shown in 4th column of table 5 can be validated compared with the test results numerical models always resulted in an overestimated prediction on the ultimate strength of the test structures whether containing corrosion pits or not it was most likely due to that the simply supported condition applied in the numerical analysis of the individual sheet differed from the actual support condition in the steel sheet of the box type structures moreover the residual stress may have some impacts to the tested strength however the assumed model for residual stress distribution used in paik et al 2003 did not always improve the numerical results with a relative error of 9 23 even for the intact tested plate without corrosion by contrast the numerical models using the proposed modelling method resulted in a smaller relative error of about 5 22 similarly the modelling method improved all the numerical results of pitted structures with the maximum relative error of 7 41 as shown in table 5 fig 14 shows strain stress behavior from numerical analyses upon the proposed modelling method and from the test results the numerical modelling method can produce a precise prediction on the stress strain behavior of each pitted sheet before structural collapse a small deviation emerged while approaching to the collapse stage which resulted from the difference between the test and the numerical models in the boundary condition initial deflection and residual stress however such difference decreased gradually as the increase of axial deformation with a minor relative error in the ultimate strength of the test structure 4 2 natural pitting corrosion ultimate strength experiments have been performed on three hull structural plates with corrosion damage zhang et al 2017c the validation on the proposed modelling method was carried out upon a plate with a dimension of 450 mm 450 mm 5 48 mm the dimension of the plate was curtailed to be an effective size of 360 mm 355 mm as the areas clamped to provide simply supported boundary for the test plate was excluded a corrosion survey was conducted on the pitted plate showing that 133 pits leaded to a volume loss of dov 21 13 in the area within the effective size of the plate the mean and maximum pit diameters were 21 84 and 30 91 mm respectively and the mean and the maximum pit depths were 3 04 and 4 896 mm respectively material of the hull plate had a yield strength of 320 mpa an elastic modulus of 205 8 gpa and a possion s ratio of 0 3 since initial deflection was not reported in zhang et al 2017c a half wave form was adopted in the numerical model with a value of amplitude of 0 05 Œ≤ 2 t sin œÄ x a sin œÄ y b the plate length a the plate width b and the thickness t were taken as 360 mm 355 mm and 5 48 mm respectively for the actual pitted plate the pitting corrosion were determined and its statistical features have been reported by zhang et al 2017c in this case the ca simulation used to induce geometric corrosion morphology was not performed and the stochastic simulation based on the measured data was used to generate a set of corrosion pits with random depths and sizes using the random number method the statistical characteristics of pseudo random pits from the stochastic simulation including the pit size diameter and pit depth were shown in fig 15 the number of pits corresponding to value ranges was displayed in the histogram of these statistical features the generated pits were then randomly assigned onto the plate to simulate the random nature in pitting distribution meanwhile the random nature in pit shape was considered using the random number method fig 16 shows failure modes derived from the experiment and the numerical analysis notably although all aspects of random natures in actual pitting corrosion were involved in the numerical analysis the failure mode from the numerical model showed a high consistency with that from the experiment moreover the effect of pit shape was further studied upon the actual pitted plate the studies were performed upon one specific random pitting distribution that resulted from one realization of the stochastic simulation despite various possibility of pitting distribution for the set of pseudo random corrosion pits this aimed to provide the same base for the comparison between different pit shapes so that the effect of pit shape on actual pitted structures can be discriminated clearly for the more pitting distributions the resulting ultimate strength will be probabilistically studied in the following section based on the same set of pseudo random pits the shapes of these pits were modeled to be a single shape or hybrid shapes fig 17 displays numerical results from the models with pits of diverse types of shapes the difference of the pit shape leaded to a striking disparity in the compressive behavior of the actual pitted plate the disparity was more pronounced than that in ca based simulation as the actual pitted plate was subject to a higher level of pitting damage table 6 shows ultimate strength of pitted plates with pits of diverse types of shapes the model with hybrid pits containing three types of pit shapes yielded a prediction very close to the test result with a tiny relative error of 0 12 however the model only with a single shape of pits always overestimated ultimate strength excessively especially for the conical pits that leaded to a relative error of 24 96 therefore the effect of pit shape on the ultimate strength was highly related to the level of pitting damage leading to a great strength variation with increase of the level of pitting damage in addition regular pitting pattern as those in feng et al 2020 shi et al 2018 was also studied in comparison to the random pitting pattern table 6 indicates that the regular pitting pattern always overestimated the ultimate strength of the test plate for numerical models with any types of pit shapes fig 18 shows the stress distribution in pitted plates with regular and random pitting patterns it is evident that the plate with the regular pitting pattern failed by a regular failure mode that was helpful to transmitting the inner force of the pitted plate leading to its higher ultimate strength overall the modelling method proposed is suitable to reflect all aspects of random natures of pitting corrosion damage including the pit size pit depth pit shape and pitting distribution as for the actual pitted structures no special attentions need to be paid on the pit shape during corrosion inspection a probabilistic prediction on the ultimate strength of a pitted structure can be achieved by performing the stochastic simulation involving all the random natures of pitting features statistically obtained from the corrosion inspection 5 discussion the ca simulation can produce the uneven morphology of actual pitting corrosion in place of costly corrosion tests making it possible to carry out sufficient tests on structural components the random natures of pitting features including pit shape significantly affect compressive behavior and ultimate strength of pitted structures in order to verify the validity of the proposed modelling method the above results were further compared with those of empirical formulas herein the well known equation eq 3 was proposed by faulkner for ultimate strength assessment of pinned plates showing excellent agreements with results of collapse tests of plated structures faulkner 1975 it provides a reasonable mean value of compressive strength with certain variation closely related to slenderness ratio of the plates 3 œÉ u œÉ y 2 Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 where œÉ u and œÉ y are ultimate strength of intact plates and yield stress of material respectively the faulkner s equation was adapted to pitted plates by replacing slenderness ratio Œ≤ of the uncorroded plate with an equivalent slenderness ratio Œ≤ eq that refers to the mean thickness of the corroded plate piscopo and scamardella 2018 defined as 4 Œ≤ e q Œ≤ 1 d o v unlike the equivalent method tackling a pitted plate as an intact plate without corrosion pits jiang et al proposed a numerical analysis method by modelling corrosion pits as regularly distributed cylindrical cavities but not considering the random natures jiang and guedes soares 2012a a regression analysis on the numerical results was performed to correlate ultimate strength with volume loss and slenderness ratio of the pitted plate leading to 5 œÉ u œÉ y 0 42 0 56 Œ≤ 1 d o v 0 4 Œ≤ 1 5 in the recent study wang et al 2018 a power function was derived to express residual ultimate strength also based on a regression analysis on numerical results of pitted plates with random pitting damage as 6 œÉ u œÉ y œÉ u œÉ u 0 œÉ u 0 œÉ y 1 0 9298 d o v 0 6459 œÉ u 0 œÉ y fig 19 displays the simulation results from the ca based plates test results of paik paik et al 2003 and zhang zhang et al 2017c and results from eqs 3 6 it was thought to cover a wide range of plates with diverse slenderness ratios including the ca based plates with a slenderness ratio of 2 21 plates in zhang s tests with slenderness ratios in the range of 1 79 2 71 and plates in paik s tests with a slenderness ratio of 4 01 respectively fig 19 a indicates that for the ca based plates with a slenderness ratio of 2 21 eqs 5 and 6 can yield satisfied predictions on the ultimate strength but eq 3 tended to overvalue the ultimate strength for the plates of paik s tests with a slender ratio of 4 01 eqs 3 and 6 produced test results relatively well as compared to eq 5 as shown in fig 19 b in fact eqs 3 and 5 highly depended on the slenderness ratio of the pitted plate especially for eq 3 the equivalent thickness was decided by eq 4 but it was based on the plates with the regularly distributed pits rather than random corrosion pits therefore it follows that eq 6 can be used for prediction on the mean value of ultimate strength of pitted plates with various slenderness ratios as shown in fig 19 c it is because that this equation was developed from the plates with random pitting damage involving all the random natures in pit size pit depth and pitting distribution on the other side the residual strength ratio in eq 6 was defined in view of the original strength of the intact plate which is independent of the slenderness ratios of the plates this makes it suitable for the plates with diverse slenderness ratios it is thereby shown that the proposed modelling method can be applied to predict the ultimate strength of pitted plates yielding a prediction of a high precision against the empirical formula with respect to random pitting damage it is quite necessary for ultimate strength assessment to conduct a larger number of stochastic simulations based on the same set of statistical data of corrosion therefore more stochastic simulations were performed on one of the plates in zhang s tests zhang et al 2017c all the simulations were implemented upon a personal computer with intel r core tm i5 3350 cpu and 4 0 gb ram each run of the non linear analysis for a specific pitting pattern took about 150 min fifties convergent results were utilized to conduct the statistical analysis on the ultimate strength of the actual pitted plate fig 20 demonstrates the statistical features of obtained results of ultimate loads of the pitted plate it is worth noting that all the stochastic simulations herein were based on the same set of pseudo random corrosion pits in line with identical statistical characters shown in fig 15 however a significant strength variation arose with the maximum minimum values of 240 kn and 176 kn respectively the tested load of 205 kn shown in table 6 did not correspond to the worst case for the pitted plate but was slightly lower than the mean value of ultimate strength 213 kn obviously the test result was involved in the results of the stochastic simulations therefore the proposed modelling method can be applied in predicting the ultimate strength of pitted plates with actual pitting corrosion as it can take into account all the aspects of random natures in the pitting corrosion damage for specific aged ship structures the depths and sizes of corrosion pits in a corroded plate are usually measured and obtained as a set of statistical values in terms of normal corrosion inspection as done in ref daidola et al 1997 the previous work suggested that eq 6 can present a primary prediction on the mean value of ultimate strength of the pitted plates wang et al 2018 meanwhile the random number method can be adopted to produce a set of pseudo random corrosion pits as shown in fig 15 based on the measured sizes of corrosion pits a series of pitted plates can be built up using the proposed modelling method in section 2 2 which can produce sufficient numeric results for ascertaining the statistical characteristics of ultimate strength the statistical strength makes it accurate to assess the structural integrity of corroded ship structures 6 conclusion in this paper a cellular automaton ca approach was used to simulate the initiation and growth of natural corrosion pits in steel structures in marine environments the ca based model produced verisimilar corrosion morphology aiming at the effect of pit shape the stochastic simulation method was proposed to model pitting damage in terms of the statistical data of corrosion damage for ultimate strength assessment the effect of pit shape on the compressive behavior of pitted plates and stress interaction between adjacent pits were studied comprehensively the ca simulation is able to produce an irregular corrosion morphology highly close to that observed in the actual pitted structures in lieu of costly corrosion tests the modelling method based on the stochastic simulation showed a good capacity to predict the test result the pit shape significantly influences the onset and development of the plastic behavior of pitted structures by affecting the stress distribution and stress interaction between corrosion pits it also has a critical impact to the ultimate strength likely leading to about 20 strength variation of the actual pitted structures it is thereby necessary to consider the random nature of pit shape besides

20441,initiation and growth of pitting corrosion results from electro chemical reactions closely related to environmental factors causing great uncertainties in the pit depth pit size pit shape and pitting distribution a cellular automaton ca approach was adopted to address the electro chemical process of pitting corrosion in marine environments yielding a geometric morphology of corrosion damage the simulated corrosion pits in the ca based model treated as the cylinders semi ellipsoids cones or cavities of hybrid shapes were introduced into structural analysis models the effect of pit shape on compressive behavior and ultimate strength of pitted plates was studied which was linked with the stress interaction between pits a modelling method based on stochastic simulation was proposed to generate random pitting damage based on limited statistical corrosion data which could reflect all aspects of the random natures of actual pitting corrosion numerical results showed high consistencies with available tests of ultimate strength of pitted plates the pit shape significantly affects the ultimate strength of pitted structures likely causing a strength variation more than 20 in a naturally pitted hull plate this is essentially due to the stress interaction between pits of diverse shapes affecting the onset and development of plasticity in pitted areas keywords pitted structure random pitting damage cellular automaton pit shape ultimate strength stochastic simulation 1 introduction ship and marine structures made of steel serve in harsh corrosive marine environments over their lifecycle they are prone to general uniform or local corrosion due to corrosive materials such as chloride hypochlorite and bromide pitting corrosion as a type of typical local corrosion causes local dissolution of metal leading to insidious structural damage covered by corrosion products it can result in the degradation of material strength and ductility and even a sudden failure of a component without any prior warnings garbatov et al 2016 it is a premise for adopting proper manners to mitigate and maintain in service damaged structures to understand the compressive behavior of pitted plates subject to random pitting corrosion damage corrosion pits in ship and marine structures have great uncertainties in the pit size pit depth pit shape and distribution location of the pits due to the influences from environments and characteristics of material it is recognized that the distribution of the maximum pit depth and its time dependent relation can be described using probabilistic models bhandari et al 2015 melchers 2008 the pit shapes are observed to be cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical in actual ship structures nakai et al 2004b owing to the shortage of effective modelling methods to describe pitting corrosion these random natures of pitting damage were rarely taken into account in the strength assessment of pitted structures wang et al 2014 for example the iacs regulations recommend that corrosion pits are simplified as an uniformly reduced wall thickness with an equivalent thickness iacs 2016a however it is difficult to decide the equivalent thickness rationally whether on the whole or at the minimum cross section of an actual corroded plate as it has unevenly corroded surface and the thickness loss of the plate varies from position to position nakai et al 2006b a large number of experimental and numerical studies have been carried out to explore the effect of pitting damage on ultimate strength of pitted structures with artificial corrosion pits in most cases the random corrosion pits were simplified as regularly distributed identical cavities of a single shape such as rectangular cylindrical semi ellipsoidal or conical shapes and with a constant depth and size diameter as outlined in table 1 the rectangular pits were applied in relatively few numerical studies due to their obvious difference with actual corrosion pits despite the simplicity in numerical modelling paik and thayamballi 2002 rahbar ranji et al 2015 by contrast the conical pits have been widely applied in the earlier experimental and numerical studies due to their good capacity to approximate the real pit shapes ahmmad and sumi 2010 nakai et al 2004a the cylindrical pits were applied more widely for they were easy to be fabricated in the test samples and modeled in the virtual samples jiang and guedes soares 2013 paik et al 2003 wang et al 2018 however there are relatively fewer application reports on the semi ellipsoidal pits due to their great complicity for the sample preparation and numerical modelling although they are a good approximation to the real pit shapes huang et al 2010 silva et al 2013 yao et al 2018 obviously a gap remains in the simulation of natural corrosion no matter by artificial corrosion tests or by numerical modelling as a result the tests on the naturally pitted specimens and structural components were more preferred nakai et al 2004b zhang et al 2017c the scanning electron microscope sem was often utilized to capture the corrosion morphology of actual corroded specimens which will be imported to cad system for constructing the finite element meshes pidaparti and rao 2008 however it is costly to prepare naturally corroded specimens as it inevitably causes a destruction in the in service structures in addition the sem is only applicable for modelling the small samples due to needing enormous amount of finite element meshes to describe a rough surface this hinders the possibility to carry out a sufficient number of specimen component tests of naturally pitted structures to clarify the effect of pitting corrosion in this context the stochastic simulation was thought efficient to produce corrosion damage approximate to the specimen tests by introducing several pseudo random variables to reflect the random natures in the size depth and distribution of corrosion pits silva et al 2013 wang et al 2018 in the stochastic simulations random pitting corrosion has proven to result in more serious strength reduction than general corrosion at the same level of pitting intensity with a distinct variation of strength however there are no studies on the effect of pit shape on structural behavior and ultimate strength of pitted structures accounting for the random nature of pit shape varying to be cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical the initiation and growth of pitting corrosion are closely related to the environments of in service structures nakai et al 2004b these processes of micrometer level pits of small scale steel samples in short term corrosion tests can be reproduced by using 3d cellular automata ca cui et al 2019 van der wee√´n et al 2014 for ship and marine structures in harsh marine environments corrosion causes uneven surfaces in the large scale structural components with extremely irregular pits whose diameters were observed to range from 25 to 80 mm rahmdel et al 2015 for the large scale structural components with millimeter level pits widely spreading over their surfaces there are no reports on corrosion simulation via 3d ca in addition for the ultimate strength assessment solid elements can be used to describe the pit details in the models of small scale samples ahmmad and sumi 2010 pidaparti and rao 2008 but it requires a huge amount of fine millimeter level meshes likely causing an unacceptable consumption of computing recourse all of these aspects present a challenge in modelling the actual pitting damage for the ultimate strength assessment of damaged structures in terms of limited statistical data from normal corrosion survey according to iacs regulations iacs 2016b an experimental and numerical study on the tensile properties of small scale pitted coupons has been carried out in part i of the series of studies wang and lin the tensile strength was associated with the shape together with the volume loss of corroded material an equivalent material model was proposed to predict the residual strength of pitted structures instead of modelling detailed pits in this paper an improved 3d ca is adopted to produce a wide range of macro corrosion pits in the large scale plates considering the electrochemical process of pitting corrosion in marine environments it is then used to produce several virtual plates subject to different levels of pitting damage in lieu of natural corrosion tests the ca based models are translated into structural analysis models by modelling corrosion pits as cylinders semi ellipsoids cones or hybrid shapes of cavities a modelling method based on the stochastic simulation is then proposed to involve all aspects of random natures of pitting corrosion the effect of pit shape on the compressive behavior and ultimate strength of pitted plates is illustrated the stress interaction between pits is studied to display the mechanism of the pitting effect on the onset and development of plasticity in the pitted areas the applicability of the proposed modelling method is validated on available experiments and is verified with the existing empirical formulas 2 modelling of pitting damage in this section the uneven morphology of pitting corrosion is reflected through performing the electrochemical simulation on the initiation growth and propagation of a cluster of corrosion pits via cellular automata ca the ca model is improved and adapted to simulate widespread macro pits in order to replace costly corrosion tests a stochastic simulation method is proposed to describe the random nature of pitting damage in the numerical models of pitted structures applied for ultimate strength assessment in the models the random natures relevant to pitting features including the size depth shape and distribution location of the corrosion pits are considered simultaneously but not separately some of typical pit shapes and pitting features considered here are shown in fig 1 2 1 ca based simulation on corrosion morphology a homogenous 3d ca was designed to simulate pitting corrosion of steel structures in a marine environment the ca system c can be represented as c œÇ s s n œï van der wee√´n et al 2014 where œÇ was a 3d grid of cells c the cells c contained three types of cells including corrosive cells chloride non corrosive cells seawater and metal cells steel although the corrosive solution contained components more than merely water and chloride all the non reactive components were seen as water since they were irrelevant to the current modelling purpose van der wee√´n et al 2014 in the 3d grid of cells the rows columns and layers were represented by i j and k respectively in which i and j formed a layer in a certain thickness denoted by the k the s was a finite set of states composed of the state of each of cells c the neighborhood function n determined the neighboring cells of every cell c including the cell c itself the moore neighborhood of a cell c i j k comprising 27 neighbors in total that shared at least one vertex with c i j k was utilized to define the neighboring cells of each cell the output function yielded the state s c t of each cell at the tth time step in the initial state the state of each cell was s c 0 the transition function œï yielded the state s c t 1 of each cell c at the next time step t 1 depending on the state of the cell c and its neighboring cells at the current time step the solution submerging the metal electrode was represented by a single topside layer of cells in the ca system where the chloride can diffuse in such a solution the initial number of corrosive cells was determined in terms of the concentration of chloride ions in the simulated seawater the diffusion of the chloride ion was simulated by switching the state of the central cell c i j k or the state of the cell in its neighborhood it moved towards nevertheless once pits appeared on the surface and then grew a concentration and potential gradient emerged and the chloride ions will move deeper inside to the pits complying with a suction probability lŒµ 0 1 after completing the diffusion the chloride ion attacked steel cells in their neighborhood to initiate corrosion pits the attacked cell will be changed into water or chloride state by a probability p p Œµ 0 1 however unlike the pit initiation the candidate steel cells for attack during pit propagation were the cells that were a part of an already existing pit such steel cells were dissolved with a probability p d dependent on an indubitable ir control of the current pit growth laws van der wee√´n et al 2014 defined as 1 p d p d 0 1 d d m Œæ here p d0 is the dissolution probability at the metal surface and Œæ is the ir factor and d is the layer number where an attacked steel cell is located and d m is the total number of layers of all the cells usually the ca simulation ceases in line with the predetermined time of an electric chemical reaction however the termination condition of the ca simulation herein was replaced by the degree of pitting intensity dop or the volume loss of corroded material dov wang et al 2018 this can lead to corrosion damage matching with the targeted level of pitting corrosion the flowchart to simulate the pitting corrosion using ca technique is shown in the left part of fig 2 fig 3 shows a typical sample of pitted plates from the ca simulation obviously the shapes of simulated corrosion pits were extremely irregular and coalescence of pits occurred during the pit propagation the simulated pitting corrosion was in close proximity to the real corrosion morphology as the electrochemical reactions related to pitting behavior was properly involved in the ca model since each cell to discretize the plate in this model had a determinate size and location the size and location of each corrosion pit described by such cells were also deterministic therefore uncertainty in pitting distribution of the resulting plates derived from the ca based model did not exist after the cease of the simulation but totally embodied in the simulation of electrochemical reactions however there is a great uncertainty in the pitting corrosion from corrosion tests or naturally corroded structures since it is usually determined by means of corrosion inspection to be statistical and incomplete daidola et al 1997 of course the simulated pitting corrosion could be statistical as that in the actual pitted plate if not considering the specific information stored in these cells it is worth noting that the corrosion damage from the ca based model was still geometric for ultimate strength assessment it is necessary to transform geometric models into finite element fe models the pitting features in the ca based model including the pit depths pit sizes and pitting distribution can be imported directly into the fe models as shown in the grey rectangle shown in fig 2 2 2 stochastic simulation on structural damage this section presents a framework to establish finite element models of pitted structures in terms of statistical data of pitting corrosion from a ca based simulation or normal corrosion survey the right part of fig 2 outlines the key steps to translate the corrosion morphology into a structural analysis model for the corrosion derived from a normal inspection a set of pseudo random corrosion pits were generated in the light of the statistical features of corrosion data which can be implemented using software with inbuilt random number method these pits were then stored in a two dimensional array pitdata n 5 that recorded the specific information of all the random pits the first index n of the array was the number of a certain pit in a pitted structure the second index 5 denoted five key pitting features including the locations of x and y axes radius depth and shape of a pit cavity in such step the radii and depths of all the n pits were determined and stored in the corresponding unit of the array pitdata for instance two units pitdata i 3 and pitdata i 4 recorded the radius and depth of the ith pit i n respectively with respect to random nature in pitting distribution it was also decided by the random number method the probability of pitting distribution followed a uniform distribution complying with actual corrosion characteristics observed in ship structures paik et al 2003 the location of each pit was denoted by the random coordinates in x and y axes and stored in two units pitdata i 1 and pitdata i 2 the pits may randomly occur in a local region or scatter over the entire surface of a pitted member respectively referred to as the localized corrosion wang et al 2020 or widespread corrosion wang and shenoi 2019 as can be seen from both the real pits in fig 1 and pseudo random pits in fig 3 the pit shape varied to be cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical with great randomness as for a pit of a certain shape there were various sets of pit radii and pit depths under a certain level of volume loss however in view of the fact that the pit depth is critical to the strength degradation of a pitted member the pit depth determined at first step remained unchanged but the pit size radius was changed for simulating the random nature of the pit shape specifically the radius of a pit was finally determined depending on its random shape in terms of 2 v 1 3 œÄ r c 2 h œÄ r 2 h 2 3 œÄ r s 2 h r c 3 r r s 6 2 r where v is the volume loss in a single pit r r c and r s are the equivalent radius of the cylindrical pit conical pit and semi ellipsoidal pit respectively and h is the pit depth meanwhile the unit value of pitdata i 3 for the ith pit was correspondingly modified to the new radius while the pit shape was recorded in pitdata i 5 denoted by 1 for the cylinder 2 for the semi ellipsoid or 3 for the cone after determining these random pitting natures all the pits can be formed by performing boolean operation between 3d solid pits and structural model as shown in fig 4 compared with the model using shell elements wang et al 2018 the solid model had a distinct advantage as it can involve the random nature of pit shape besides the location size and depth of pits moreover the coalescence between pits can be reflected in the solid model while it cannot be achieved in the shell model as for the solid model incorporated with the random pits a free meshing method was applied to address complicated geometry to accomplish a structural analysis model fig 5 displays numerical models with corrosion pits of a single shape being cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical or hybrid shapes fig 6 shows that the pits of hybrid shapes had a significant impact to the stress distribution of the pitted plate leading to a very irregular stress contour 3 the effect of pit shape it is reported that random nature of pitting damage causes a significant strength variation in addition to a strength degradation wang and shenoi 2019 wang et al 2018 however it remains unclear on the pitting effect accounting for random pit shape in this section the effect of pit shape on the ultimate strength was studied under three levels of pitting corrosion derived from the aforesaid ca based model in addition the effect of pit shape on locally distributed stress in pitted areas was studied under various pitting parameters including the distances and angularities between pits which was reflected on the stress concentration factors scf such parameters were seen to represent the change of pitting distribution target structures were square plates of an edge length of 800 mm and a thickness of 15 mm the material of the plates was mild steel with an elastic modulus of 205 8 gpa a possion s ratio of 0 3 and a yield stress of 352 8 mpa two types of structural analyses were performed including non linear analyses to assess the ultimate strength in section 3 2 and linear analyses to acquire the stress concentration factors in section 3 3 for nonlinear analyses elastic perfectly plastic material model was applied simultaneously considering material and geometric nonlinearities without residual stress the initial deformation of the pitted plates was formed as a half wave 0 1 Œ≤ 2 t sin œÄ x a sin œÄ y b where a b t and Œ≤ are the length width thickness and slenderness ratio of the unstiffened plates respectively simply supported boundary was applied at four edges of each plate axial thrust along the x axis was implemented by exerting a displacement in the nonlinear analyses instead of force loading however the linear analyses adopted the elastic material model meanwhile a uniformly distributed stress was applied on one of the plate edges vertical to the x axis solid element solid 187 in ansys was used to construct the structural analysis models by free meshing with the control size of meshes being the thickness of the pitted plates fig 4 displays the computing model of a pitted plate 3 1 corrosion characteristics a 3d ca based model consisting of 800 800 46 cells was constructed to simulate the initiation and growth of corrosion pits the top layer of the cells represented the aqueous solution with chloride concentration of a mass percentage of 3 5 analogous to a marine environment while the other layers represented the steel subjected to corrosion the key parameters for ca simulation were determined in terms of the pitting corrosion test of steel van der wee√´n et al 2014 as listed in table 2 the ca simulation was performed thrice to produce three levels of pitting damage in order to clarify the effects of pitting features on strength degradation in various scenarios in terms of iacs regulations iacs 2016a b corrosion survey needs to be conducted if the dop of a structural member is greater than 15 in addition the upper limit of the dop occurring in in service structures is 25 or else necessary mitigation and restoration measures are required to adopt therefore the ca simulation herein produced pitting corrosion in the interest of iacs specification being dops 10 15 and 25 after completing the ca simulation to a targeted dop irregular pits were statistically analyzed by regarding them as a series of semi ellipsoidal cavities to obtain their statistical characteristics the treatment introduced a small error in the final dop due to the difficulty to approximate the irregular pit shapes precisely the resulting dops were about 9 28 18 75 and 27 6 at three levels of pitting damage for the three ca simulations with dovs 2 88 7 74 and 11 95 respectively corrosion morphology of the simulated pitted plate for dop 18 75 was taken as a sample shown in fig 3 it was reported that in corrosion survey on real ship structures that pit shapes are close to be cylindrical semi ellipsoidal and conical the ratios of the diameter to depth d h range between 10 1 to 4 1 nakai et al 2004a and the maximum diameter of pits of steel in marine water is about 25 80 mm paik et al 2003 the cutaway views of the pitted plate shown in fig 3 exhibit the pit shapes from the ca simulation being similar to cylinders semi ellipsoids and cones the statistical data of these pits at three levels of pitting damage can be obtained to construct the structural model as shown in fig 2 fig 7 shows the detailed diameters and depths of these pits derived from the statistical analyses the simulated pitting corrosion was approximate to corrosion damage in normal service condition for the pitting corrosion beneath the upper limit dop 25 may introduce a dov of about 10 wang et al 2018 it appears that corrosion developed in the pit depth faster than in the pit size at lower levels of pitting damage resulting in smaller d h ratios while this reversed at higher levels of pitting damage zayed et al 2018 meanwhile the number of corrosion pits decreased with increase of the dov due to the coalescence of some pits during pit growth for this reason some larger pits occurred under serious corrosion of dov 11 95 the ca simulation can reflect the electrochemical process of pitting behavior properly such as initiation growth and propagation of corrosion pits producing the corrosion damage highly close to natural corrosion however it was worth noting that for a specific simulation the locations sizes and depths of all the simulated pits in the ca based model in spite of the irregular pit shapes have been determined after the cease of the simulation this was due to that such information had been stored in the simulation space of the ca based model and can be imported into the structural model directly however it was only geometric but not structural in order to assess the ultimate strength of a pitted plate the ca based model needed to be converted according to the steps shown in the grey rectangle in fig 2 3 2 compressive behavior of simulated pitted plates compressive behavior of pitted plates was studied herein under three levels of pitting damage derived from the ca simulations in previous section since the ca simulation actually yielded pitting damage with a determinate pattern in the depths sizes and distributions of corrosion pits that stored in the ca based model the stochastic simulation herein only involved the shapes of corrosion pits this made it easier to discriminate the effect of pit shape from the compound effect resulting from the complex random natures of pitting corrosion in the pit depth pit size and pitting distribution hereon the pit shapes were described as cylinders semi ellipsoids cones or hybrid shapes composed by three types of shapes nonlinear analyses were carried out upon the numerical models with various shapes of pits to clarify the effect of pit shape on the compressive behavior of pitted plates 3 2 1 ultimate strength ultimate strength of the intact plate without pits was 244 mpa being the reference strength to define the strength reduction of a pitted plate table 3 shows ultimate strength of pitted plates with various shapes of pits and the percentage strength reductions the pitting damage leaded to significant strength reductions moreover the strength reduction of a pitted plate was highly related to pit shapes depending on they were cylindrical semi ellipsoidal conical or hybrid shape for multiple levels of pitting damage the models with cylindrical pits yielded the largest reduction of ultimate strength while those with conical pits produced the smallest reduction by contrast the models with semi ellipsoidal pits and hybrid pits leaded to relatively moderate strength reductions very close to each other in the worst case of dov 11 95 the disparity of strength reduction due to the difference of the pit shape was about 4 5 resulting from the models with cylindrical and conical pits it is worth noting that the random natures in the location size and depth of the pits were identical for the models with various shapes of pits as they were inherited from the same ca based models however obvious distinctions in strength reductions of pitted plates yet emerged even if the pit shape was the only random variable and the disparities became more and more distinct with increase of the level of pitting intensity therefore the pit shape resembled other pitting features such as the pit size pit depth and pitting distribution causing significant strength variation wang et al 2018 it is not hard to come to an inference that the random natures of the pitting features including the pit shape have a more complicated effect on the ultimate strength than those excluding the pit shape 3 2 2 failure behavior fig 8 shows stress strain behavior of pitted plates with different pit shapes under three levels of pitting damage the effect of pit shape on the stress strain behavior was variant in the entire loading process the difference in stress strain behavior of pitted plates due to the difference of the pit shape was indistinct at the stages of elastic deformation and post collapse but it became distinct at the stage approaching to ultimate strength the difference became more remarkable with increase of the degree of pitting damage as shown in fig 8 b and c moreover the models with cylindrical pits always resulted in pessimistic predictions on the stress strain behavior of pitted plates while those with semi ellipsoidal pits or hybrid pits presented pertinent results very close to each other in essence the difference in the stress strain behavior of pitted plates resulted from the difference in the stress distribution and plastic behavior and significantly affected by the pit shape as shown in fig 9 as a typical example the plastic strains of pitted plates with pits of various shapes at the moderate level of pitting damage of dov 7 74 were illustrated evidently the pit shape influenced the plastic behavior significantly due to the stress interaction between the nearby corrosion pits for the cylindrical pits the sharp change of the plate thickness on the edge of a pitting cavity leaded to a higher level of stress on the edge with a relatively lower level of stress away from the edge this resulted in the plasticity initiated on the pit edge firstly and then developed inside toward the center of the pit or outside between the adjacent pits due to the stress interaction as shown in fig 9 a in contrast the semi ellipsoidal and the conical pits had gradually decreasing thickness from the edges to centers of the pits the smallest thickness at the vertexes of the pits induced plasticity more easily and the plasticity developed toward the edges of the pits as shown in fig 9 b concerning the hybrid pits composed by three types of pit shapes the stress interaction also played a vital role to affect the onset and development of plasticity in the pitted plate showing a different interference pattern as shown in fig 9 c 3 3 stress interaction between simulated pits random natures of pitting damage can cause a significant variation of ultimate strength in pitted structures besides serious strength degradation silva et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the random natures were mostly treated as a set of random variables relevant to pit depth pit size and distribution location of pits as for pitting distribution the spacing and angularity of pits are two key factors to describe its uncertainty therefore the effect of pit shape was studied herein under different levels of these factors elastic analyses rather than nonlinear analyses were carried out as the former can display the stress interaction between pits of various shapes more clearly which can be reflected by the stress concentration factor scf two types of pitted plates with the single pit or dual pits were adopted because of its simplicity to illustrate the effect of pit shape the single pit plates contained a pit of a diameter of 30 mm and a depth of 7 5 mm and the dual pit plates included two pits of diameters of 30 and 35 mm respectively and a depth of 7 5 mm 3 3 1 single pit the single pit was centrally situated in the square plate thickness loss caused by the pit cavity resulted in a notable stress concentration around or in the pit under uniform load of the unit pressure it can be measured by the scf that was defined as the ratio of von mises stress to the axially loaded unit pressure fig 10 shows the detailed stress distribution around the single pit of diverse shapes the stress concentration was displayed upon a subarea in the view range of an edge length of 300 mm that was cut from the pitted plate in terms of eq 2 it is clear that under the same degree of volume loss and pit depth the cylindrical pit has a narrower size while the conical pit has a wider size compared with the semi ellipsoidal pit the different shapes leaded to remarkably different stress distribution around these pits with a different scf table 4 lists scfs of the pits of diverse shapes seen from fig 10 for the cylindrical pit a steep stress decline arose on the pit edge especially for that vertical to loading direction as such area had a sharp decrease of plate thickness with scf 1 867 while the semi ellipsoidal pit had a gently decreasing thickness within the pit which leaded to a larger area with high stress of scf 1 833 for the same reason the tapering thickness in the conical pit had the stress around the pit changed by a uniform gradient with a highly stress concentrated vertex of scf 1 927 it followed that the pit shape plays a vital role to influence the stress distribution around in a pit that determines the onset and development of plasticity in pitted areas 3 3 2 dual pits in the case of pitted plates with dual pits the pit of a diameter of 30 mm was fixedly situated at the center of the plate while the pit of a diameter of 35 mm had a varied position that was to produce a changed distance d pit spacing or angularity Œ∏ relative to the smaller pit pit spacing ranged to be d 70 130 195 and 260 mm with a constant Œ∏ 90 while pit angularity varied to be Œ∏ 0 45 or 90 with a constant d 70 mm in consideration of summation of the radii of dual pits being 32 5 mm the pit spacing can be regarded to vary in the range of 2 8 times of the summation fig 11 shows the stress distribution and stress interaction between dual pits due to the change of pit spacing for diverse shapes of pits it is noted that since pit spacing for d 260 mm leaded to the bigger pit beyond the view range of 300 mm 300 mm only the smaller pit was shown obviously the stress interaction between dual pits had stress concentration intensified highly depending on the pit spacing the closer the dual pits the larger the stress concentration as shown in fig 13 a for instance the scf of dual cylindrical pits increased to 2 451 as compared to the single pit with scf 1 867 the serious stress concentration was ascribed to the smallest pit spacing of the dual pits with d 70 mm however the stress interaction almost vanished if the pit spacing increased to d 260 mm in particular compared with the cylindrical and conical pits the stress interaction between the semi ellipsoidal pits was more sensitive to the pit spacing as the relevant relation curve in fig 13 a had the steepest downward trend the pit angularity also had a strong impact to the stress interaction of the dual pits as shown in fig 12 fig 13 b shows that intensity of the stress interaction increased with increase of the pit angularity from 0 to 90 apart from causing the gradually ascended scf its change determined the location at which had the largest scf normally the largest scf arose at adjacent area between the dual pits with a pit angularity larger than zero highly relying on the pit angularity however it tended to be similar to the single pit in the case of the pit angularity equal to zero fig 13 b exhibited the relation of the stress concentration and pit angularity evidently the semi ellipsoidal pits were also more susceptive to the pit angularity in contrast to the cylindrical and conical pits because of a sharp uptrend in the relation curve of the scf and the pit angularity in summary pit shape significantly influences the onset and development of plastic behavior of pitted structures by affecting the stress distribution and stress interaction between the corrosion pits in local pitted areas it is thus necessary to model all the random natures including the pit shape for establishing computing models for ultimate strength assessment of actual pitted structures 4 modelling the compressive behavior of actual pitted plates 4 1 artificial pitting corrosion the collapse tests were performed on box type plated structures made up of four identical steel sheets each of which had a dimension of 580 mm 580 mm 4 4 mm with artificial corrosion pits paik et al 2003 the aim to design the box type plated structures was to provide a simply supported condition for each steel sheet cylindrical corrosion pits were regularly drilled with a through thickness in each sheet two levels of pitting damage were introduced in two tested structures by inflicting different numbers of corrosion pits in each structure respectively leading to dovs of 4 87 and 10 42 small tensile coupon tests were conducted to obtain the material properties of the tested structures axial compression load was applied until and after reaching the ultimate strength the maximum initial deflections in steel sheets were measured being in the range of 1 15 3 38 mm more detailed information on the test structures can be found in paik et al 2003 in order to construct the numerical model for each tested structure one sheet but not four sheets of the entire box was adopted as done in paik et al 2003 by the modelling method in section 2 2 since pit size pit depth pit shape and pitting distribution were all determinate in the tested structures the uncertainties of pitting damage were not involved in the numerical modelling true stress strain curves of material based on the small tensile samples was applied in numerical analyses where material and geometric nonlinearities were simultaneously considered welding induced residual stress was not explicitly considered as it was not measured in the original tests and had little effect on the ultimate strength of pitted structures paik et al 2003 the initial deflection was introduced with a maximum magnitude of 2 265 mm being the median of the measured values the experimental and numerical results from paik s work paik et al 2003 are listed in 2nd and 3rd columns of table 5 respectively so that the numerical results derived from the proposed modelling method in section 2 2 shown in 4th column of table 5 can be validated compared with the test results numerical models always resulted in an overestimated prediction on the ultimate strength of the test structures whether containing corrosion pits or not it was most likely due to that the simply supported condition applied in the numerical analysis of the individual sheet differed from the actual support condition in the steel sheet of the box type structures moreover the residual stress may have some impacts to the tested strength however the assumed model for residual stress distribution used in paik et al 2003 did not always improve the numerical results with a relative error of 9 23 even for the intact tested plate without corrosion by contrast the numerical models using the proposed modelling method resulted in a smaller relative error of about 5 22 similarly the modelling method improved all the numerical results of pitted structures with the maximum relative error of 7 41 as shown in table 5 fig 14 shows strain stress behavior from numerical analyses upon the proposed modelling method and from the test results the numerical modelling method can produce a precise prediction on the stress strain behavior of each pitted sheet before structural collapse a small deviation emerged while approaching to the collapse stage which resulted from the difference between the test and the numerical models in the boundary condition initial deflection and residual stress however such difference decreased gradually as the increase of axial deformation with a minor relative error in the ultimate strength of the test structure 4 2 natural pitting corrosion ultimate strength experiments have been performed on three hull structural plates with corrosion damage zhang et al 2017c the validation on the proposed modelling method was carried out upon a plate with a dimension of 450 mm 450 mm 5 48 mm the dimension of the plate was curtailed to be an effective size of 360 mm 355 mm as the areas clamped to provide simply supported boundary for the test plate was excluded a corrosion survey was conducted on the pitted plate showing that 133 pits leaded to a volume loss of dov 21 13 in the area within the effective size of the plate the mean and maximum pit diameters were 21 84 and 30 91 mm respectively and the mean and the maximum pit depths were 3 04 and 4 896 mm respectively material of the hull plate had a yield strength of 320 mpa an elastic modulus of 205 8 gpa and a possion s ratio of 0 3 since initial deflection was not reported in zhang et al 2017c a half wave form was adopted in the numerical model with a value of amplitude of 0 05 Œ≤ 2 t sin œÄ x a sin œÄ y b the plate length a the plate width b and the thickness t were taken as 360 mm 355 mm and 5 48 mm respectively for the actual pitted plate the pitting corrosion were determined and its statistical features have been reported by zhang et al 2017c in this case the ca simulation used to induce geometric corrosion morphology was not performed and the stochastic simulation based on the measured data was used to generate a set of corrosion pits with random depths and sizes using the random number method the statistical characteristics of pseudo random pits from the stochastic simulation including the pit size diameter and pit depth were shown in fig 15 the number of pits corresponding to value ranges was displayed in the histogram of these statistical features the generated pits were then randomly assigned onto the plate to simulate the random nature in pitting distribution meanwhile the random nature in pit shape was considered using the random number method fig 16 shows failure modes derived from the experiment and the numerical analysis notably although all aspects of random natures in actual pitting corrosion were involved in the numerical analysis the failure mode from the numerical model showed a high consistency with that from the experiment moreover the effect of pit shape was further studied upon the actual pitted plate the studies were performed upon one specific random pitting distribution that resulted from one realization of the stochastic simulation despite various possibility of pitting distribution for the set of pseudo random corrosion pits this aimed to provide the same base for the comparison between different pit shapes so that the effect of pit shape on actual pitted structures can be discriminated clearly for the more pitting distributions the resulting ultimate strength will be probabilistically studied in the following section based on the same set of pseudo random pits the shapes of these pits were modeled to be a single shape or hybrid shapes fig 17 displays numerical results from the models with pits of diverse types of shapes the difference of the pit shape leaded to a striking disparity in the compressive behavior of the actual pitted plate the disparity was more pronounced than that in ca based simulation as the actual pitted plate was subject to a higher level of pitting damage table 6 shows ultimate strength of pitted plates with pits of diverse types of shapes the model with hybrid pits containing three types of pit shapes yielded a prediction very close to the test result with a tiny relative error of 0 12 however the model only with a single shape of pits always overestimated ultimate strength excessively especially for the conical pits that leaded to a relative error of 24 96 therefore the effect of pit shape on the ultimate strength was highly related to the level of pitting damage leading to a great strength variation with increase of the level of pitting damage in addition regular pitting pattern as those in feng et al 2020 shi et al 2018 was also studied in comparison to the random pitting pattern table 6 indicates that the regular pitting pattern always overestimated the ultimate strength of the test plate for numerical models with any types of pit shapes fig 18 shows the stress distribution in pitted plates with regular and random pitting patterns it is evident that the plate with the regular pitting pattern failed by a regular failure mode that was helpful to transmitting the inner force of the pitted plate leading to its higher ultimate strength overall the modelling method proposed is suitable to reflect all aspects of random natures of pitting corrosion damage including the pit size pit depth pit shape and pitting distribution as for the actual pitted structures no special attentions need to be paid on the pit shape during corrosion inspection a probabilistic prediction on the ultimate strength of a pitted structure can be achieved by performing the stochastic simulation involving all the random natures of pitting features statistically obtained from the corrosion inspection 5 discussion the ca simulation can produce the uneven morphology of actual pitting corrosion in place of costly corrosion tests making it possible to carry out sufficient tests on structural components the random natures of pitting features including pit shape significantly affect compressive behavior and ultimate strength of pitted structures in order to verify the validity of the proposed modelling method the above results were further compared with those of empirical formulas herein the well known equation eq 3 was proposed by faulkner for ultimate strength assessment of pinned plates showing excellent agreements with results of collapse tests of plated structures faulkner 1975 it provides a reasonable mean value of compressive strength with certain variation closely related to slenderness ratio of the plates 3 œÉ u œÉ y 2 Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 where œÉ u and œÉ y are ultimate strength of intact plates and yield stress of material respectively the faulkner s equation was adapted to pitted plates by replacing slenderness ratio Œ≤ of the uncorroded plate with an equivalent slenderness ratio Œ≤ eq that refers to the mean thickness of the corroded plate piscopo and scamardella 2018 defined as 4 Œ≤ e q Œ≤ 1 d o v unlike the equivalent method tackling a pitted plate as an intact plate without corrosion pits jiang et al proposed a numerical analysis method by modelling corrosion pits as regularly distributed cylindrical cavities but not considering the random natures jiang and guedes soares 2012a a regression analysis on the numerical results was performed to correlate ultimate strength with volume loss and slenderness ratio of the pitted plate leading to 5 œÉ u œÉ y 0 42 0 56 Œ≤ 1 d o v 0 4 Œ≤ 1 5 in the recent study wang et al 2018 a power function was derived to express residual ultimate strength also based on a regression analysis on numerical results of pitted plates with random pitting damage as 6 œÉ u œÉ y œÉ u œÉ u 0 œÉ u 0 œÉ y 1 0 9298 d o v 0 6459 œÉ u 0 œÉ y fig 19 displays the simulation results from the ca based plates test results of paik paik et al 2003 and zhang zhang et al 2017c and results from eqs 3 6 it was thought to cover a wide range of plates with diverse slenderness ratios including the ca based plates with a slenderness ratio of 2 21 plates in zhang s tests with slenderness ratios in the range of 1 79 2 71 and plates in paik s tests with a slenderness ratio of 4 01 respectively fig 19 a indicates that for the ca based plates with a slenderness ratio of 2 21 eqs 5 and 6 can yield satisfied predictions on the ultimate strength but eq 3 tended to overvalue the ultimate strength for the plates of paik s tests with a slender ratio of 4 01 eqs 3 and 6 produced test results relatively well as compared to eq 5 as shown in fig 19 b in fact eqs 3 and 5 highly depended on the slenderness ratio of the pitted plate especially for eq 3 the equivalent thickness was decided by eq 4 but it was based on the plates with the regularly distributed pits rather than random corrosion pits therefore it follows that eq 6 can be used for prediction on the mean value of ultimate strength of pitted plates with various slenderness ratios as shown in fig 19 c it is because that this equation was developed from the plates with random pitting damage involving all the random natures in pit size pit depth and pitting distribution on the other side the residual strength ratio in eq 6 was defined in view of the original strength of the intact plate which is independent of the slenderness ratios of the plates this makes it suitable for the plates with diverse slenderness ratios it is thereby shown that the proposed modelling method can be applied to predict the ultimate strength of pitted plates yielding a prediction of a high precision against the empirical formula with respect to random pitting damage it is quite necessary for ultimate strength assessment to conduct a larger number of stochastic simulations based on the same set of statistical data of corrosion therefore more stochastic simulations were performed on one of the plates in zhang s tests zhang et al 2017c all the simulations were implemented upon a personal computer with intel r core tm i5 3350 cpu and 4 0 gb ram each run of the non linear analysis for a specific pitting pattern took about 150 min fifties convergent results were utilized to conduct the statistical analysis on the ultimate strength of the actual pitted plate fig 20 demonstrates the statistical features of obtained results of ultimate loads of the pitted plate it is worth noting that all the stochastic simulations herein were based on the same set of pseudo random corrosion pits in line with identical statistical characters shown in fig 15 however a significant strength variation arose with the maximum minimum values of 240 kn and 176 kn respectively the tested load of 205 kn shown in table 6 did not correspond to the worst case for the pitted plate but was slightly lower than the mean value of ultimate strength 213 kn obviously the test result was involved in the results of the stochastic simulations therefore the proposed modelling method can be applied in predicting the ultimate strength of pitted plates with actual pitting corrosion as it can take into account all the aspects of random natures in the pitting corrosion damage for specific aged ship structures the depths and sizes of corrosion pits in a corroded plate are usually measured and obtained as a set of statistical values in terms of normal corrosion inspection as done in ref daidola et al 1997 the previous work suggested that eq 6 can present a primary prediction on the mean value of ultimate strength of the pitted plates wang et al 2018 meanwhile the random number method can be adopted to produce a set of pseudo random corrosion pits as shown in fig 15 based on the measured sizes of corrosion pits a series of pitted plates can be built up using the proposed modelling method in section 2 2 which can produce sufficient numeric results for ascertaining the statistical characteristics of ultimate strength the statistical strength makes it accurate to assess the structural integrity of corroded ship structures 6 conclusion in this paper a cellular automaton ca approach was used to simulate the initiation and growth of natural corrosion pits in steel structures in marine environments the ca based model produced verisimilar corrosion morphology aiming at the effect of pit shape the stochastic simulation method was proposed to model pitting damage in terms of the statistical data of corrosion damage for ultimate strength assessment the effect of pit shape on the compressive behavior of pitted plates and stress interaction between adjacent pits were studied comprehensively the ca simulation is able to produce an irregular corrosion morphology highly close to that observed in the actual pitted structures in lieu of costly corrosion tests the modelling method based on the stochastic simulation showed a good capacity to predict the test result the pit shape significantly influences the onset and development of the plastic behavior of pitted structures by affecting the stress distribution and stress interaction between corrosion pits it also has a critical impact to the ultimate strength likely leading to about 20 strength variation of the actual pitted structures it is thereby necessary to consider the random nature of pit shape besides those in the pit depth pit size and pitting distribution in the ultimate strength assessment of pitted structures credit authorship contribution statement renhua wang conceptualization methodology

20442,estimation of wave agitation plays a key role in predicting natural disasters path optimization and secure harbor operation the spanish agency puertos del estado pde has several oceanographic measure networks equipped with sensors for different physical variables and manages forecast systems involving numerical models in recent years there is a growing interest in wave parameter estimation by using machine learning models due to the large amount of oceanographic data available for training as well as its proven efficacy in estimating physical variables in this study we propose to use machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the current forecast system of pde we have focused on four physical wave variables spectral significant height mean spectral period peak period and mean direction of origin two different machine learning models have been explored multilayer perceptron and gradient boosting decision trees as well as ensemble methods that combine both models these models reduce the error of the predictions of the numerical model by 36 on average demonstrating the potential gains of combining machine learning and numerical models keywords wave height machine learning neural network lightgbm 1 introduction the state owned spanish port system includes 46 ports of general interest managed by 28 port authorities whose coordination and efficiency control corresponds to the government agency puertos del estado pde that is responsible for implementing the government s port policy accurate estimations of wave parameters height period and direction both in the open sea and in port areas are particularly important for several reasons estimations on high seas allow predicting dangerous phenomena or events caused by natural catastrophes vanem 2011 dixit and londhe 2016 in terms of logistics these estimations make it possible to optimize routes for vessels increasing safety and cost savings zheng and sun 2016 liu et al 2016 the energy sector is another field greatly benefited by achieving more accurate estimations in the last few years the number of wave based energy generation systems wave energy converters has increased considerably l√≥pez et al 2013 bahaj 2011 falc√£o 2010 in order to determine the viability and productive capacity of this type of systems it is essential to know with great precision the wave history in an area in order to predict future trends cuadra et al 2016 speaking purely from the oceanographic and climatic point of view having a reliable wave history makes it possible to carry out valid analysis and detect changes in trends wave parameters estimation in port areas is of vital importance for security reasons allowing the loading and unloading of goods to be carried out in safe conditions and permitting the corresponding port authority to determine if the port should be closed at the entrance of ships causing certain vessels to divert to nearby ports wave parameters estimation has been traditionally carried out by means of numerical models forced with wind fields that reproduce the processes of wave generation and propagation the output of these models are gridded wave spectra from which wave parameters are estimated these models should be validated and calibrated with real measurements that in most cases are provided by wave sensors included in buoys these buoys have been measuring during decades and there is an increasing amount of historical qualified wave dataset however there are some periods when the buoys could not provide information due to malfunctions or drifts generating gaps in the historical dataset the numerical models forced with historical wind fields can provide hindcast datasets without gaps but differing from the real measurements these errors can be due to different sources inaccuracies in the bathymetry errors in the input wind field or errors in the generation or propagation of wave energy from the wave model models based on machine learning can be used to reduce these errors due to their ability to find correlations in the input data learning from data models however complex it may be in this work we have developed machine learning models marsland 2009 g√©ron 2020 that improve accuracy on wave height parameter estimations from numerical models at different locations of the spanish coastline after exploring different machine learning techniques two different models have been selected multilayer perceptron mlp and gradient boosting decision trees gbdt and ensemble methods that combine both have also been analyzed as inputs for our machine learning models we have used the estimations of the numerical model currently used by pde and a set of variables recorded by their buoy network enumerated in table 1 with this information our machine learning models have updated the predictions of the numerical model in order to improve its accuracy the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the related work section 3 outlines the machine learning models selected for this study section 4 describes the data used in the study and the preprocess carried out section 5 presents the experimental results finally section 6 summarizes our conclusions 2 related work the estimation of oceanographic variables through machine learning models has been the target of many research works in the last years hand in hand with the renewed emergence of artificial intelligence models based on learning by data different approaches have been proposed depending on the source data used to build the prediction model a very widespread method is the use of data from adjacent deep water buoys to estimate the measurements of a target buoy l√≥pez et al 2015 alexandre et al 2018 cornejo bueno et al salcedo sanz krishna kumar et al 2017 mahjoobi and mossabeb 2009 etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 this method allows providing wave parameter estimations at the location of the target buoy even when it is out of service one advantage of this method is that it does not require use of numerical models which are usually very computationally demanding its main limitation is its dependence on the instrumentation availability noticeable lower than data coming from numerical models in mahjoobi and mossabeb 2009 and etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 the authors propose to use regressive support vector machines and mlp respectively for wave height predictions in alexandre et al 2018 the authors propose to combine genetic algorithms with machine learning models to locally reconstruct the output of out of operation buoys in the caribbean sea and west atlantic cornejo bueno et al salcedo sanz continues the work of alexandre et al 2018 but includes a bayesian optimization method to select the attributes used by their prediction model in krishna kumar et al 2017 the authors propose to use sequential learning algorithms namely the minimal resource allocation network mran and the growing and pruning radial basis function gap rbf network to predict the daily wave heights in different geographical regions in l√≥pez et al 2015 the authors propose the use of mlps to estimate wave agitation within a port basin based on deep water observations alone specifically this work is based on the estimation of the wave height in the buoy of the port of ferrol la coru√±a spain from data from two adjacent buoys a second approach consists in predicting future wave agitation based on the last measurements recorded by a target buoy yin et al 2013 pashova and popova 2011 yasseri et al 2010 yin et al 2013 presents the application of a sequential learning radial basis function network for real time prediction of tidal level pashova and popova 2011 predicts the daily mean sea levels in the black sea coast using mlps yasseri et al 2010 predicts the significant wave height and mean zero up crossing wave period in the north east pacific using mlps and a finite element method a third approach of posing the problem is to consider partially or fully replacing a previous numerical model for example in puscasu 2014 the authors propose to use an mlp to approximate the result of the resolution of the non linear term snl to reduce the computation time of numerical models other works propose to fully replace the numerical model by a machine learning model malekmohamadi et al 2008 pooja et al 2011 james et al 2018 in malekmohamadi et al 2008 pooja et al 2011 this is done for a specific buoy using an mlp malekmohamadi et al 2008 and a model that combines mlp genetic programming and model tree pooja et al 2011 james et al 2018 pursues a more ambitious goal and recreates the estimations of the swan scientific and techn 2009 numerical model by using mlps for the bay of monterey usa the mlps predictions are 4 000 times faster than the swan model and the root mean square error rmse was less than 5 of the mean value of the swell the authors explain that the bay of monterey has stable conditions that allow reaching these results trying to develop methods to replace numerical models in more exposed areas and with more changing conditions is still a hard challenge another option is to consider machine learning as a complementary tool to improve the estimations of numerical models predictions made by the numerical models are post processed to bring them closer to the real measurements obtained by a buoy at a given point at the expense of minimally increasing the computational cost makarynskyy 2004 makarynskyy 2006 zhang et al 2006 filippo et al 2012 lightgbm examples 2020 makarynskyy 2004 proposes to use mlps to update the prediction of weight height makarynskyy 2006 also propose an mlp model to update the predictions for wave height zero up crossing wave period and peak wave period they use the data of a buoy station coupled with a numerical model to predict the wave conditions in two points close to the buoy station in their experiments they reduce the root mean square error from 2 2 to 3 9 zhang et al 2006 uses mlps to improve the predictions in four points of the northwestern pacific ocean reporting a consistent improvement in the predictions filippo et al 2012 analyzes the case of the canan√©ia coasts brazil reducing the error of the numerical model from 26 to 12 by using mlps finally ellesonet al 2020 is a very recent reference in which the authors use bagged decision trees to detect deviations of the wave height in the predictions of the numerical wave model wavewatch iii using its outputs and wind information from a forecast system when these deviations were applied as corrections error metrics root mean squared error bias percent error and scatter index were reduced in several different experiments moreover they developed a descriptive tool that identifies regions with similar errors our work follows a similar approach to those described in the previous paragraph apply machine learning techniques to improve the results of a numerical model first classical mlps will be used for two reasons because they are universal approximators goodfellow et al 2016 and because they are used with good results in many of the previous works found in the literature as it can be seen in the above paragraph second we will use decision trees as proposed in ellesonet al 2020 nevertheless other modern machine learning techniques have also been explored thus we have identified that gradient boosting decision trees gbdt is a powerful technique that achieves better results than mlps or traditional decision trees for our predictions moreover two additional ensemble techniques have been applied to further improve the results bootstrap aggregating bagging breiman 1996 of several mlp and combining the results of mlp bagging and the gdbt with this combination slightly better results and a more robust model are obtained in order to validate our approach our machine learning models have been evaluated in four locations on the spanish coast that are exposed to very different sea state conditions the benefits of our approach vary from one point to another but even in the most complex cases our machine learning models can improve the predictions of some of the physical wave variables 3 machine learning models for wave height estimation in this section the machine learning ml models used in our work will be described ml models marsland 2009 are data driven techniques that automatically learn patterns and input output relationships from data sets thus they are suitable to tackle the prediction of physical wave variables because they are very efficient in detecting patterns and complex relationships between input data in order to estimate the value of an output variable in addition in our case a large amount of historical data is available for training machine learning models in this work the two stage scheme shown in fig 1 is proposed the spanish agency puertos del estado pde has several measure networks equipped with sensors for different physical variables and forecast systems based on numerical models in our approach the machine learning model receives the output predictions provided from the numerical model and estimates a correction which leads on average to a more accurate prediction of physical wave variables section 5 among the collection of models available in the machine learning ecosystem marsland 2009 goodfellow et al 2016 haykin 1999 neural networks section 3 1 and decision trees section 3 2 have been selected in addition ensemble techniques to further increase accuracy have also been evaluated section 3 3 for all our models a time series cross validation strategy is applied where the corresponding training set consists only of samples that occurred prior to the samples that form the test set thus no future data is used in constructing the forecast system for instance consider a temporally ordered dataset divided in four subsets a b c and d the procedure starts by training with subset a and testing with b fold 1 it continues by training with a and b and testing with c fold 2 and the procedure ends by training with a b c and testing with d fold 3 all these machine learning models are complex and involve powerful mathematical developments thus in next sections we only explain the basic ideas of these algorithms the interested reader can find more algorithmic and mathematical details for instance in references marsland 2009 goodfellow et al 2016 g√©ron 2020 haykin 1999 3 1 multi layer perceptron mlp multi layer perceptrons mlp are one of the most widely used artificial neural network ann architectures haykin 1999 marsland 2009 g√©ron 2020 because they are universal approximators goodfellow et al 2016 haykin 1999 that are able to capture nonlinear input output relationships from a data set specifically the universal approximation theorem developed by cybenko and hornik goodfellow et al 2016 states that a feed forward neural network with at least one hidden layer can approximate any multivariate function provided that the network is given enough hidden units mlps were used in most of the works presented in section 2 an mlp fig 2 consist of an input layer with as many neurons as input features hidden layers whose neurons compute a weighted sum of its inputs and then apply a nonlinear function typically a sigmoid function or a rectified linear unit relu g√©ron 2020 and an output layer that generates the final output by computing the weighted sum of the last hidden layer outputs in an mlp each neuron is connected to every single neuron of the previous layer and each connection is modeled with a weight these weights are iteratively adjusted from the dataset by using an optimization algorithm which minimizes a cost function that compares the current mlp output versus the desired one mlps are often trained following the stochastic gradient descent algorithm where the gradient is usually computed by using the backpropagation technique algorithmic and mathematical details can be found in references marsland 2009 haykin 1999 3 2 decision trees a decision tree marsland 2009 fig 3 is a machine learning model that uses an if then else branching method to represent every possible model output thus it consists of a set of if then else conditions split points about each input feature in turn starting at the root of the tree and progressing down to the leaves where the corresponding final output is assigned marsland 2009 in short decision trees use a tree like model of chained if then else decisions and their possible consequences for achieving the final model output fig 3 shows a scheme of a binary decision tree white nodes represent conditions where an input feature or variable is compared with a threshold split point thus determining the subsequent path depending on the true or false result of the evaluated condition nodes in gray are leaves nodes which are labeled with the corresponding output value thus the tree is traversed top down by comparing at each level one input feature with a threshold adjusted during training until a leaf node which contains the prediction is reached in the worst case it requires depth 1 comparisons but as can be seen in fig 3 the output value can be found at any level the training algorithm determines which feature is used at each level and the numeric value of the thresholds used in every split point in a way that minimizes the mean squared error mse one of the most popular algorithms for this purpose is the classification and regression tree cart algorithm timofeev 2004 3 3 ensemble learning ensemble learning marsland 2009 is a machine learning paradigm where several machine learning models are trained to solve the same problem and combined to get better results when several models are correctly combined a more accurate or robust model can be obtained thus ensemble learning marsland 2009 combines predictions coming from different models in order to improve the final prediction in our experiments we have used three different ensemble methods gradient boosting bagging and averaging models based on decision trees usually rely on the prediction as a result of many single estimators i e decision tree once trained the individual trees are combined by using ensemble methods a typical approach for this are random forest techniques breiman 2001 the final output is achieved by computing the mode for classification or the mean prediction for regression of the individual trees thus by combining several predictions a stronger predictor is obtained however even better results can be obtained by applying an ensemble approach called gradient boosting g√©ron 2020 gradient boosting works sequentially by adding the outputs of several decision trees predictors each one correcting its predecessor in such a way that each tree attempts to improve the results of the previous every predictor is trained sequentially so each new iteration tries to correct the residual error generated in the previous one once the trees are trained they can be used for prediction by simply adding the outputs of all the trees g√©ron 2020 for instance consider an ensemble of three decision trees dt dt number one dt1 is trained normally providing an output h1 with some residual error actual output minus predicted output then dt2 is trained on the residual error of dt1 now residual errors are target values dt2 output h2 a correction to dt1 output is added to that of dt1 for obtaining the ensemble output h h h1 h2 thus reducing the error provided by dt1 finally dt3 is trained on the residual error of dt2 and its output h3 is added for obtaining the final ensemble output h h1 h2 h3 reducing the error even more gradient boosting is used by gradient boosting decision trees gbdt jerome 2002 conventional implementations of gbdt suffer from poor scaling for large datasets or a large number of features lightgbm guolin et al 2017 is a highly efficient open source gbdt based framework that overcomes this drawback by excluding a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients and by bundling mutually exclusive features that rarely take nonzero values simultaneously thus offering up to 20 times higher performance over conventional gbdt for this reason we have selected lightgbm in our work with the support of lightgbm gdbts are currently considered one of the most powerful machine learning models due to its efficiency accuracy and interpretability for example recently they have been used for many winning solutions in several machine learning competitions lightgbm examples 2020 bootstrap aggregating bagging breiman 1996 builds multiple estimators by training each of them with a subset of the training data and then aggregates their predictions these subsets are built by picking random samples with replacement we have applied bagging to improve the results obtained by our mlp models and in addition bagging is also used in the core of the lightgbm algorithm finally averaging is a simple approach to combine different machine learning models for regression each model is trained independently and during inference their outputs are averaged to generate the final results in summary four different approaches have been evaluated 1 single mlp this is our simplest ml model best hyperparameters for each location are found by random search in order to mitigate the effect of model weight initialization results shown in this category are the average error and training time for 50 instances of a single mlp 2 bagging mlp based on the optimal hyperparameters previously found we consider a bagging of n mlps where each one is trained on a random fraction m of the training set hyperparameters n and m are adjusted for each location as shown in table 3 3 lightgbm as indicated in section 3 lightgbm is an efficient implementation of gbdt gradient boosting decision trees it consists of n single estimators decision trees where each tree attempts to reduce the residual error of the previous one each tree is trained on a random fraction m of the training set thus lightgbm algorithm also uses bagging m n and other hyperparameters are tuned for each location by random searching 4 ensemble predictions coming from a bagging of mlps and a lightgbm are averaged 4 methods this section presents the data sets used in our experiments the preprocessing steps needed before using the data the field sites selected to evaluate our model and the description of the experiments carried out 4 1 data sets and preprocessing puertos del estado pde provided us with data sets for each location on the spanish coast each data set includes their numerical models estimations for wave height wind and water current and the measurements recorded by their buoy network the time resolution of these data sets is one sample per hour table 1 enumerates the variables used as inputs for our models which includes the date and time as well as the outputs of three different computational models it also includes the additional information used to evaluate the outputs of our model which are measurements taken at the buoys in order to preprocess data for the machine learning models we applied two standardization methods on raw data depending on the nature of the variable in the case of acyclic variables hm0 tm02 tp velv uo and vo for putting all the variables in the same scale they are standardized according to 1 z x x s where z is the standardized value x is the raw value x is the mean in the training set and s is the standard deviation in the training set as it is well known equation 1 transforms a variable x into another variable z with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 cyclic variables demand a different approach to properly reflect their underlying proximity in time or space in our dataset cyclic variables are timestamps where we considered both the day within a year and the time within a day and directional variables dirm and dirv fig 4 illustrates standardization on the time within a day unprocessed variable hh is first scaled to 0 2 œÄ and then sine and cosine of this scaled value are computed and presented as processed variables the purpose of this method is to force that hours close in time are also close in value for example 01h and 23h 4 2 field sites our machine learning approach has been evaluated in four locations on the spanish coast villano tarragona tarifa and tenerife see fig 5 these locations have been selected as they are exposed to very different sea state conditions for testing our methodology villano is in the atlantic coast tarragona in the mediterranean sea tarifa in the gibraltar strait and tenerife in the canary island in order to make estimations in each buoy location pde selected key points from their wave height and current numerical models for each location the model points have been chosen trying to be the most representative in the grid providing all the possible contributions that can affect the results in every location the closest points to the buoy and the tide gauge and those in strategic positions for oceanographic phenomena for villano position apart from the closest point to the buoy the selected points were three outer points able to represent the wind and wave contributions from the north south and north west directions and four points to represent the iberian poleward current in tarragona the selected points are representative of the north and south contributions for wave and wind and representative of the typical slope current in the catalonian coast from the north in tarifa position the points chosen are representative of the easterlies and westerlies main wind and wave regimes and the eastward surface main current in the gibraltar strait for tenerife the selected points are the most representative of the north and south wind and wave contributions that affect the buoy area and the representative of the main currents in the canary island the physical locations of these points are shown in fig 6 waves and wind model points on the left and physical location of the currents model points on the right buoys are shown as red points specific coordinates for each point are shown in table 2 4 3 experiments we built our regression models as a function of not only the current sample but also the four previous ones therefore a valid sample in our model requires five consecutive raw samples with data for all variables available table 3 characterizes the dataset used on each location all ml models were trained with wave wind and current values provided by the numerical models the whole dataset was split into a training set 80 and a test set 20 the field total input variables is the aggregation of the input variables see table 1 for each model point for the last 5 h for example for villano it includes 1 input for the year 4 inputs for the normalized time and date 240 inputs for the six points of the wave and wind model during the last 5 h 6 5 8 and 50 inputs for the five points of the current model during the last 5 h 5 5 2 for each sample our model generates for different outputs however these outputs are not the absolute values that we want to predict hm0 tm02 tp dirm described in table 1 but following the recommendation of kantardzicdata mining concepts et al 2011 our models generate a correction that must be applied to the initial prediction obtained with the numerical model for acyclic variables measured by the buoy hm0 tm02 and tp the objective of the machine learning model is to estimate the increase Œ¥ that corrects the wave model estimation Œ¥hm0 Œ¥tm02 and Œ¥tp as shown in 2 2 Œ¥output var output var buoy ouput var numerical model for angular output variables i e dirm we decided to estimate the correction of the sine and cosine Œ¥sin and Œ¥cos and then reconstruct the angle by computing the arc tangent 3 angle ml model arctan sine ml model cosine ml model notice that this method yields predictions where the trigonometric relationship sin2 Œ± cos2 Œ± 1 is not guaranteed however it provides the best results as it represents a kind of ensemble by mixing the independent sine and cosine predictions for each model output we compute the original error of the numerical model as 4 output var numerical model error output var buoy ouput var numerical model and the error after including our ml model to correct the initial results as 5 output var ml error output var buoy ouput var numerical model ouput var ml model comparing these two errors we identify the error reductions due to the corrections carried out by our models 5 experimental results fig 7 shows the accuracy improvement over the numerical model achieved by our four approaches for each location and output variable in the test sets the first column presents the results when using a single mlp which is the technique used in most of the previous references section 2 this approach yields error reductions in 14 of the 16 predicted values the second column shows that a bagging of mlps leads to further error reduction in all the locations and output variables gbdts lightgbm which apply bagging and boosting perform slightly better on average than a bagging of mlps although in some cases mlps provide better results hence it is a good idea to combine both approaches the last column depicts the results of an ensemble of lightgbm and a bagging of mlps this solution achieves the highest accuracy for all the locations and variables explored for instance compared to lgbm ensembles further reduce the error ranging from 0 4 tarragona tp to 13 1 tarragona dirm regarding each particular case study predictions for villano yields error reductions ranging from 20 0 for hm0 to 49 0 for tp for tarragona our solution achieves error reductions from 17 8 for hm0 to 32 9 for tm02 tarifa is the location where the numerical model is improved by a larger margin 36 6 for tp 48 0 for hm0 58 2 for dirm and 73 8 for tm02 tenerife is a particular case while it is observed an error reduction in hm02 and dirm 21 7 and 69 2 respectively the periods tm02 and tp do not seem to have relationship with the inputs since none of our models was able to improve the accuracy hence and only in this particular case the best solution is to use the numerical model without any correction for these two variables figs 8 11 include scatter plots for the most relevant variable hm0 each location includes on the left the baseline scatter plot i e predictions from the numerical model and on the right scatter plots from the predictions of our best ml model are shown for each location it can be observed how ml models greatly improve accuracy and reduce data dispersion although we can also observe a remarkable underestimation for extreme wave height values especially in the models developed for tarragona and tarifa this can be explained by the general overestimation of the numerical model in these two locations that forces the ml model to adopt a descending trend table 4 summarizes the accuracy enhancement for each case study both mean absolute error and the correlation coefficient are shown as error metrics for each location and output variable a seasonality study of the results has been performed to check if the behavior of the ensemble model depends on the type of sea state this study aims to observe if there is any pattern in the results that could be associated with relative calms typical situation during the summer months with low values in wave height and periods or heavy storms usually in winter months with the highest heights and periods in fig 12 the results of the study are shown for the four locations and parameters in the first one upper left corresponding to hm0 we can observe that for villano and tarifa the maximum error reduction takes place during summer whereas for tenerife is in spring and autumn and for tarragona is between february and may we should consider that each location is affected by different wave conditions and this can explain the different trends in the curves the only similitude that can be appreciated is a descent in june and low values in december and january for the mean period tm02 upper right no clear trend is observed but again villano and tarifa present similar curves with the minimum values around july while tarragona has the maximum in august it is a very stable parameter and it does not oscillate too much along the year for the other two graphs it is remarkable to highlight a fall in may for villano and a descending trend along the year for tarragona the only conclusion that can be extracted from this study in relation with the results of the ensemble model is that the low values observed in december and january in hm0 when generally the heaviest storms occur could be related with the underestimation observed in the extremes as shown in the scatter plots figs 8 11 6 conclusion wave parameter estimation has been traditionally carried out by means of numerical models in this work several machine learning models have been developed to improve the accuracy of wave parameter estimations made by classical numerical models at four different locations of the spanish coastline to this end they provide a correction to the results of the numerical models we have focused on four physical wave variables spectral significant height mean spectral period peak period and mean direction of origin different machine learning models have been explored multilayer perceptron gradient boosting decision trees and ensemble methods that combine both these machine learning models have been evaluated both in terms of accuracy and computational cost see appendix a it has been found that these machine learning algorithms reduce the error of the predictions of the numerical model by 36 on average demonstrating the potential gains of combining machine learning and numerical models error reductions from 19 7 to 73 6 have been achieved in 14 out of 16 case studies our approach increases the accuracy of numerical model predictions in those points where real measures were available once the models have been trained our solution does not demand any instrumentation as it relies solely on the predictions from the numerical model notice that in our approach the predictions of the numerical models are used as inputs of the machine learning models and machine learning algorithms provide corrections for accuracy improvement a future and more ambitious work would be trying to completely replace the numerical model instead of correcting it we would also like to identify the patterns used by the machine learning models in order to better understand why the results are different from one location to another credit authorship contribution statement s gracia conceptualization methodology software writing original draft j olivito

to the positive outcome appendix a hyperparameters selected and training process table 5 details the hyperparameters selected in each case study we decided to optimize the hyperparameters for each location since each one is very different from the others we also explored the possibility of optimizing the hyperparameters for each variable within each location but in our preliminary experiments we observed that variable level optimization provided very little further improvement and it was very time consuming as it was mentioned in section 3 we applied a time series cross validation strategy to avoid over fitting table 5 hyperparameter selection for each location table 5 location mlp lightgbm layers l2 penalty estimators baggingfraction learningrate baggingfraction min dataleaf estimators

training time for the four approaches results for each approach averages all the locations and all the variables within each location the approach based on a single mlp which is the weaker in terms of accuracy requires a training time of only 12 4 3 9 s the approach based on bagging mlp which yields to more accurate predictions is one order of magnitude more time consuming requiring 189 7 118 7 s on average it is remarkable the fact that lightgbm models third approach which turn out to be slightly more accurate than a bagging of mlps are much faster as they only demand 74 8 61 5 s finally results from the ensemble of both bagging of mlps and lightgbm are just the sum of both training times the time required for averaging is negligible fig 13 average training time of the machine

20442,estimation of wave agitation plays a key role in predicting natural disasters path optimization and secure harbor operation the spanish agency puertos del estado pde has several oceanographic measure networks equipped with sensors for different physical variables and manages forecast systems involving numerical models in recent years there is a growing interest in wave parameter estimation by using machine learning models due to the large amount of oceanographic data available for training as well as its proven efficacy in estimating physical variables in this study we propose to use machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the current forecast system of pde we have focused on four physical wave variables spectral significant height mean spectral period peak period and mean direction of origin two different machine learning models have been explored multilayer perceptron and gradient boosting decision trees as well as ensemble methods that combine both models these models reduce the error of the predictions of the numerical model by 36 on average demonstrating the potential gains of combining machine learning and numerical models keywords wave height machine learning neural network lightgbm 1 introduction the state owned spanish port system includes 46 ports of general interest managed by 28 port authorities whose coordination and efficiency control corresponds to the government agency puertos del estado pde that is responsible for implementing the government s port policy accurate estimations of wave parameters height period and direction both in the open sea and in port areas are particularly important for several reasons estimations on high seas allow predicting dangerous phenomena or events caused by natural catastrophes vanem 2011 dixit and londhe 2016 in terms of logistics these estimations make it possible to optimize routes for vessels increasing safety and cost savings zheng and sun 2016 liu et al 2016 the energy sector is another field greatly benefited by achieving more accurate estimations in the last few years the number of wave based energy generation systems wave energy converters has increased considerably l√≥pez et al 2013 bahaj 2011 falc√£o 2010 in order to determine the viability and productive capacity of this type of systems it is essential to know with great precision the wave history in an area in order to predict future trends cuadra et al 2016 speaking purely from the oceanographic and climatic point of view having a reliable wave history makes it possible to carry out valid analysis and detect changes in trends wave parameters estimation in port areas is of vital importance for security reasons allowing the loading and unloading of goods to be carried out in safe conditions and permitting the corresponding port authority to determine if the port should be closed at the entrance of ships causing certain vessels to divert to nearby ports wave parameters estimation has been traditionally carried out by means of numerical models forced with wind fields that reproduce the processes of wave generation and propagation the output of these models are gridded wave spectra from which wave parameters are estimated these models should be validated and calibrated with real measurements that in most cases are provided by wave sensors included in buoys these buoys have been measuring during decades and there is an increasing amount of historical qualified wave dataset however there are some periods when the buoys could not provide information due to malfunctions or drifts generating gaps in the historical dataset the numerical models forced with historical wind fields can provide hindcast datasets without gaps but differing from the real measurements these errors can be due to different sources inaccuracies in the bathymetry errors in the input wind field or errors in the generation or propagation of wave energy from the wave model models based on machine learning can be used to reduce these errors due to their ability to find correlations in the input data learning from data models however complex it may be in this work we have developed machine learning models marsland 2009 g√©ron 2020 that improve accuracy on wave height parameter estimations from numerical models at different locations of the spanish coastline after exploring different machine learning techniques two different models have been selected multilayer perceptron mlp and gradient boosting decision trees gbdt and ensemble methods that combine both have also been analyzed as inputs for our machine learning models we have used the estimations of the numerical model currently used by pde and a set of variables recorded by their buoy network enumerated in table 1 with this information our machine learning models have updated the predictions of the numerical model in order to improve its accuracy the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the related work section 3 outlines the machine learning models selected for this study section 4 describes the data used in the study and the preprocess carried out section 5 presents the experimental results finally section 6 summarizes our conclusions 2 related work the estimation of oceanographic variables through machine learning models has been the target of many research works in the last years hand in hand with the renewed emergence of artificial intelligence models based on learning by data different approaches have been proposed depending on the source data used to build the prediction model a very widespread method is the use of data from adjacent deep water buoys to estimate the measurements of a target buoy l√≥pez et al 2015 alexandre et al 2018 cornejo bueno et al salcedo sanz krishna kumar et al 2017 mahjoobi and mossabeb 2009 etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 this method allows providing wave parameter estimations at the location of the target buoy even when it is out of service one advantage of this method is that it does not require use of numerical models which are usually very computationally demanding its main limitation is its dependence on the instrumentation availability noticeable lower than data coming from numerical models in mahjoobi and mossabeb 2009 and etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 the authors propose to use regressive support vector machines and mlp respectively for wave height predictions in alexandre et al 2018 the authors propose to combine genetic algorithms with machine learning models to locally reconstruct the output of out of operation buoys in the caribbean sea and west atlantic cornejo bueno et al salcedo sanz continues the work of alexandre et al 2018 but includes a bayesian optimization method to select the attributes used by their prediction model in krishna kumar et al 2017 the authors propose to use sequential learning algorithms namely the minimal resource allocation network mran and the growing and pruning radial basis function gap rbf network to predict the daily wave heights in different geographical regions in l√≥pez et al 2015 the authors propose the use of mlps to estimate wave agitation within a port basin based on deep water observations alone specifically this work is based on the estimation of the wave height in the buoy of the port of ferrol la coru√±a spain from data from two adjacent buoys a second approach consists in predicting future wave agitation based on the last measurements recorded by a target buoy yin et al 2013 pashova and popova 2011 yasseri et al 2010 yin et al 2013 presents the application of a sequential learning radial basis function network for real time prediction of tidal level pashova and popova 2011 predicts the daily mean sea levels in the black sea coast using mlps yasseri et al 2010 predicts the significant wave height and mean zero up crossing wave period in the north east pacific using mlps and a finite element method a third approach of posing the problem is to consider partially or fully replacing a previous numerical model for example in puscasu 2014 the authors propose to use an mlp to approximate the result of the resolution of the non linear term snl to reduce the computation time of numerical models other works propose to fully replace the numerical model by a machine learning model malekmohamadi et al 2008 pooja et al 2011 james et al 2018 in malekmohamadi et al 2008 pooja et al 2011 this is done for a specific buoy using an mlp malekmohamadi et al 2008 and a model that combines mlp genetic programming and model tree pooja et al 2011 james et al 2018 pursues a more ambitious goal and recreates the estimations of the swan scientific and techn 2009 numerical model by using mlps for the bay of monterey usa the mlps predictions are 4 000 times faster than the swan model and the root mean square error rmse was less than 5 of the mean value of the swell the authors explain that the bay of monterey has stable conditions that allow reaching these results trying to develop methods to replace numerical models in more exposed areas and with more changing conditions is still a hard challenge another option is to consider machine learning as a complementary tool to improve the estimations of numerical models predictions made by the numerical models are post processed to bring them closer to the real measurements obtained by a buoy at a given point at the expense of minimally increasing the computational cost makarynskyy 2004 makarynskyy 2006 zhang et al 2006 filippo et al 2012 lightgbm examples 2020 makarynskyy 2004 proposes to use mlps to update the prediction of weight height makarynskyy 2006 also propose an mlp model to update the predictions for wave height zero up crossing wave period and peak wave period they use the data of a buoy station coupled with a numerical model to predict the wave conditions in two points close to the buoy station in their experiments they reduce the root mean square error from 2 2 to 3 9 zhang et al 2006 uses mlps to improve the predictions in four points of the northwestern pacific ocean reporting a consistent improvement in the predictions filippo et al 2012 analyzes the case of the canan√©ia coasts brazil reducing the error of the numerical model from 26 to 12 by using mlps finally ellesonet al 2020 is a very recent reference in which the authors use bagged decision trees to detect deviations of the wave height in the predictions of the numerical wave model wavewatch iii using its outputs and wind information from a forecast system when these deviations were applied as corrections error metrics root mean squared error bias percent error and scatter index were reduced in several different experiments moreover they developed a descriptive tool that identifies regions with similar errors our work follows a similar approach to those described in the previous paragraph apply machine learning techniques to improve the results of a numerical model first classical mlps will be used for two reasons because they are universal approximators goodfellow et al 2016 and because they are used with good results in many of the previous works found in the literature as it can be seen in the above paragraph second we will use decision trees as proposed in ellesonet al 2020 nevertheless other modern machine learning techniques have also been explored thus we have identified that gradient boosting decision trees gbdt is a powerful technique that achieves better results than mlps or traditional decision trees for our predictions moreover two additional ensemble techniques have been applied to further improve the results bootstrap aggregating bagging breiman 1996 of several mlp and combining the results of mlp bagging and the gdbt with this combination slightly better results and a more robust model are obtained in order to validate our approach our machine learning models have been evaluated in four locations on the spanish coast that are exposed to very different sea state conditions the benefits of our approach vary from one point to another but even in the most complex cases our machine learning models can improve the predictions of some of the physical wave variables 3 machine learning models for wave height estimation in this section the machine learning ml models used in our work will be described ml models marsland 2009 are data driven techniques that automatically learn patterns and input output relationships from data sets thus they are suitable to tackle the prediction of physical wave variables because they are very efficient in detecting patterns and complex relationships between input data in order to estimate the value of an output variable in addition in our case a large amount of historical data is available for training machine learning models in this work the two stage scheme shown in fig 1 is proposed the spanish agency puertos del estado pde has several measure networks equipped with sensors for different physical variables and forecast systems based on numerical models in our approach the machine learning model receives the output predictions provided from the numerical model and estimates a correction which leads on average to a more accurate prediction of physical wave variables section 5 among the collection of models available in the machine learning ecosystem marsland 2009 goodfellow et al 2016 haykin 1999 neural networks section 3 1 and decision trees section 3 2 have been selected in addition ensemble techniques to further increase accuracy have also been evaluated section 3 3 for all our models a time series cross validation strategy is applied where the corresponding training set consists only of samples that occurred prior to the samples that form the test set thus no future data is used in constructing the forecast system for instance consider a temporally ordered dataset divided in four subsets a b c and d the procedure starts by training with subset a and testing with b fold 1 it continues by training with a and b and testing with c fold 2 and the procedure ends by training with a b c and testing with d fold 3 all these machine learning models are complex and involve powerful mathematical developments thus in next sections we only explain the basic ideas of these algorithms the interested reader can find more algorithmic and mathematical details for instance in references marsland 2009 goodfellow et al 2016 g√©ron 2020 haykin 1999 3 1 multi layer perceptron mlp multi layer perceptrons mlp are one of the most widely used artificial neural network ann architectures haykin 1999 marsland 2009 g√©ron 2020 because they are universal approximators goodfellow et al 2016 haykin 1999 that are able to capture nonlinear input output relationships from a data set specifically the universal approximation theorem developed by cybenko and hornik goodfellow et al 2016 states that a feed forward neural network with at least one hidden layer can approximate any multivariate function provided that the network is given enough hidden units mlps were used in most of the works presented in section 2 an mlp fig 2 consist of an input layer with as many neurons as input features hidden layers whose neurons compute a weighted sum of its inputs and then apply a nonlinear function typically a sigmoid function or a rectified linear unit relu g√©ron 2020 and an output layer that generates the final output by computing the weighted sum of the last hidden layer outputs in an mlp each neuron is connected to every single neuron of the previous layer and each connection is modeled with a weight these weights are iteratively adjusted from the dataset by using an optimization algorithm which minimizes a cost function that compares the current mlp output versus the desired one mlps are often trained following the stochastic gradient descent algorithm where the gradient is usually computed by using the backpropagation technique algorithmic and mathematical details can be found in references marsland 2009 haykin 1999 3 2 decision trees a decision tree marsland 2009 fig 3 is a machine learning model that uses an if then else branching method to represent every possible model output thus it consists of a set of if then else conditions split points about each input feature in turn starting at the root of the tree and progressing down to the leaves where the corresponding final output is assigned marsland 2009 in short decision trees use a tree like model of chained if then else decisions and their possible consequences for achieving the final model output fig 3 shows a scheme of a binary decision tree white nodes represent conditions where an input feature or variable is compared with a threshold split point thus determining the subsequent path depending on the true or false result of the evaluated condition nodes in gray are leaves nodes which are labeled with the corresponding output value thus the tree is traversed top down by comparing at each level one input feature with a threshold adjusted during training until a leaf node which contains the prediction is reached in the worst case it requires depth 1 comparisons but as can be seen in fig 3 the output value can be found at any level the training algorithm determines which feature is used at each level and the numeric value of the thresholds used in every split point in a way that minimizes the mean squared error mse one of the most popular algorithms for this purpose is the classification and regression tree cart algorithm timofeev 2004 3 3 ensemble learning ensemble learning marsland 2009 is a machine learning paradigm where several machine learning models are trained to solve the same problem and combined to get better results when several models are correctly combined a more accurate or robust model can be obtained thus ensemble learning marsland 2009 combines predictions coming from different models in order to improve the final prediction in our experiments we have used three different ensemble methods gradient boosting bagging and averaging models based on decision trees usually rely on the prediction as a result of many single estimators i e decision tree once trained the individual trees are combined by using ensemble methods a typical approach for this are random forest techniques breiman 2001 the final output is achieved by computing the mode for classification or the mean prediction for regression of the individual trees thus by combining several predictions a stronger predictor is obtained however even better results can be obtained by applying an ensemble approach called gradient boosting g√©ron 2020 gradient boosting works sequentially by adding the outputs of several decision trees predictors each one correcting its predecessor in such a way that each tree attempts to improve the results of the previous every predictor is trained sequentially so each new iteration tries to correct the residual error generated in the previous one once the trees are trained they can be used for prediction by simply adding the outputs of all the trees g√©ron 2020 for instance consider an ensemble of three decision trees dt dt number one dt1 is trained normally providing an output h1 with some residual error actual output minus predicted output then dt2 is trained on the residual error of dt1 now residual errors are target values dt2 output h2 a correction to dt1 output is added to that of dt1 for obtaining the ensemble output h h h1 h2 thus reducing the error provided by dt1 finally dt3 is trained on the residual error of dt2 and its output h3 is added for obtaining the final ensemble output h h1 h2 h3 reducing the error even more gradient boosting is used by gradient boosting decision trees gbdt jerome 2002 conventional implementations of gbdt suffer from poor scaling for large datasets or a large number of features lightgbm guolin et al 2017 is a highly efficient open source gbdt based framework that overcomes this drawback by excluding a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients and by bundling mutually exclusive features that rarely take nonzero values simultaneously thus offering up to 20 times higher performance over conventional gbdt for this reason we have selected lightgbm in our work with the support of lightgbm gdbts are currently considered one of the most powerful machine learning models due to its efficiency accuracy and interpretability for example recently they have been used for many winning solutions in several machine learning competitions lightgbm examples 2020 bootstrap aggregating bagging breiman 1996 builds multiple estimators by training each of them with a subset of the training data and then aggregates their predictions these subsets are built by picking random samples with replacement we have applied bagging to improve the results obtained by our mlp models and in addition bagging is also used in the core of the lightgbm algorithm finally averaging is a simple approach to combine different machine learning models for regression each model is trained independently and during inference their outputs are averaged to generate the final results in summary four different approaches have been evaluated 1 single mlp this is our simplest ml model best hyperparameters for each location are found by random search in order to mitigate the effect of model weight initialization results shown in this category are the average error and training time for 50 instances of a single mlp 2 bagging mlp based on the optimal hyperparameters previously found we consider a bagging of n mlps where each one is trained on a random fraction m of the training set hyperparameters n and m are adjusted for each location as shown in table 3 3 lightgbm as indicated in section 3 lightgbm is an efficient implementation of gbdt gradient boosting decision trees it consists of n single estimators decision trees where each tree attempts to reduce the residual error of the previous one each tree is trained on a random fraction m of the training set thus lightgbm algorithm also uses bagging m n and other hyperparameters are tuned for each location by random searching 4 ensemble predictions coming from a bagging of mlps and a lightgbm are averaged 4 methods this section presents the data sets used in our experiments the preprocessing steps needed before using the data the field sites selected to evaluate our model and the description of the experiments carried out 4 1 data sets and preprocessing puertos del estado pde provided us with data sets for each location on the spanish coast each data set includes their numerical models estimations for wave height wind and water current and the measurements recorded by their buoy network the time resolution of these data sets is one sample per hour table 1 enumerates the variables used as inputs for our models which includes the date and time as well as the outputs of three different computational models it also includes the additional information used to evaluate the outputs of our model which are measurements taken at the buoys in order to preprocess data for the machine learning models we applied two standardization methods on raw data depending on the nature of the variable in the case of acyclic variables hm0 tm02 tp velv uo and vo for putting all the variables in the same scale they are standardized according to 1 z x x s where z is the standardized value x is the raw value x is the mean in the training set and s is the standard deviation in the training set as it is well known equation 1 transforms a variable x into another variable z with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 cyclic variables demand a different approach to properly reflect their underlying proximity in time or space in our dataset cyclic variables are timestamps where we considered both the day within a year and the time within a day and directional variables dirm and dirv fig 4 illustrates standardization on the time within a day unprocessed variable hh is first scaled to 0 2 œÄ and then sine and cosine of this scaled value are computed and presented as processed variables the purpose of this method is to force that hours close in time are also close in value for example 01h and 23h 4 2 field sites our machine learning approach has been evaluated in four locations on the spanish coast villano tarragona tarifa and tenerife see fig 5 these locations have been selected as they are exposed to very different sea state conditions for testing our methodology villano is in the atlantic coast tarragona in the mediterranean sea tarifa in the gibraltar strait and tenerife in the canary island in order to make estimations in each buoy location pde selected key points from their wave height and current numerical models for each location the model points have been chosen trying to be the most representative in the grid providing all the possible contributions that can affect the results in every location the closest points to the buoy and the tide gauge and those in strategic positions for oceanographic phenomena for villano position apart from the closest point to the buoy the selected points were three outer points able to represent the wind and wave contributions from the north south and north west directions and four points to represent the iberian poleward current in tarragona the selected points are representative of the north and south contributions for wave and wind and representative of the typical slope current in the catalonian coast from the north in tarifa position the points chosen are representative of the easterlies and westerlies main wind and wave regimes and the eastward surface main current in the gibraltar strait for tenerife the selected points are the most representative of the north and south wind and wave contributions that affect the buoy area and the representative of the main currents in the canary island the physical locations of these points are shown in fig 6 waves and wind model points on the left and physical location of the currents model points on the right buoys are shown as red points specific coordinates for each point are shown in table 2 4 3 experiments we built our regression models as a function of not only the current sample but also the four previous ones therefore a valid sample in our model requires five consecutive raw samples with data for all variables available table 3 characterizes the dataset used on each location all ml models were trained with wave wind and current values provided by the numerical models the whole dataset was split into a training set 80 and a test set 20 the field total input variables is the aggregation of the input variables see table 1 for each model point for the last 5 h for example for villano it includes 1 input for the year 4 inputs for the normalized time and date 240 inputs for the six points of the wave and wind model during the last 5 h 6 5 8 and 50 inputs for the five points of the current model during the last 5 h 5 5 2 for each sample our model generates for different outputs however these outputs are not the absolute values that we want to predict hm0 tm02 tp dirm described in table 1 but following the recommendation of kantardzicdata mining concepts et al 2011 our models generate a correction that must be applied to the initial prediction obtained with the numerical model for acyclic variables measured by the buoy hm0 tm02 and tp the objective of the machine learning model is to estimate the increase Œ¥ that corrects the wave model estimation Œ¥hm0 Œ¥tm02 and Œ¥tp as shown in 2 2 Œ¥output var output var buoy ouput var numerical model for angular output variables i e dirm we decided to estimate the correction of the sine and cosine Œ¥sin and Œ¥cos and then reconstruct the angle by computing the arc tangent 3 angle ml model arctan sine ml model cosine ml model notice that this method yields predictions where the trigonometric relationship sin2 Œ± cos2 Œ± 1 is not guaranteed however it provides the best results as it represents a kind of ensemble by mixing the independent sine and cosine predictions for each model output we compute the original error of the numerical model as 4 output var numerical model error output var buoy ouput var numerical model and the error after including our ml model to correct the initial results as 5 output var ml error output var buoy ouput var numerical model ouput var ml model comparing these two errors we identify the error reductions due to the corrections carried out by our models 5 experimental results fig 7 shows the accuracy improvement over the numerical model achieved by our four approaches for each location and output variable in the test sets the first column presents the results when using a single mlp which is the technique used in most of the previous references section 2 this approach yields error reductions in 14 of the 16 predicted values the second column shows that a bagging of mlps leads to further error reduction in all the locations and output variables gbdts lightgbm which apply bagging and boosting perform slightly better on average than a bagging of mlps although in some cases mlps provide better results hence it is a good idea to combine both approaches the last column depicts the results of an ensemble of lightgbm and a bagging of mlps this solution achieves the highest accuracy for all the locations and variables explored for instance compared to lgbm ensembles further reduce the error ranging from 0 4 tarragona tp to 13 1 tarragona dirm regarding each particular case study predictions for villano yields error reductions ranging from 20 0 for hm0 to 49 0 for tp for tarragona our solution achieves error reductions from 17 8 for hm0 to 32 9 for tm02 tarifa is the location where the numerical model is improved by a larger margin 36 6 for tp 48 0 for hm0 58 2 for dirm and 73 8 for tm02 tenerife is a particular case while it is observed an error reduction in hm02 and dirm 21 7 and 69 2 respectively the periods tm02 and tp do not seem to have relationship with the inputs since none of our models was able to improve the accuracy hence and only in this particular case the best solution is to use the numerical model without any correction for these two variables figs 8 11 include scatter plots for the most relevant variable hm0 each location includes on the left the baseline scatter plot i e predictions from the numerical model and on the right scatter plots from the predictions of our best ml model are shown for each location it can be observed how ml models greatly improve accuracy and reduce data dispersion although we can also observe a remarkable underestimation for extreme wave height values especially in the models developed for tarragona and tarifa this can be explained by the general overestimation of the numerical model in these two locations that forces the ml model to adopt a descending trend table 4 summarizes the accuracy enhancement for each case study both mean absolute error and the correlation coefficient are shown as error metrics for each location and output variable a seasonality study of the results has been performed to check if the behavior of the ensemble model depends on the type of sea state this study aims to observe if there is any pattern in the results that could be associated with relative calms typical situation during the summer months with low values in wave height and periods or heavy storms usually in winter months with the highest heights and periods in fig 12 the results of the study are shown for the four locations and parameters in the first one upper left corresponding to hm0 we can observe that for villano and tarifa the maximum error reduction takes place during summer whereas for tenerife is in spring and autumn and for tarragona is between february and may we should consider that each location is affected by different wave conditions and this can explain the different trends in the curves the only similitude that can be appreciated is a descent in june and low values in december and january for the mean period tm02 upper right no clear trend is observed but again villano and tarifa present similar curves with the minimum values around july while tarragona has the maximum in august it is a very stable parameter and it does not oscillate too much along the year for the other two graphs it is remarkable to highlight a fall in may for villano and a descending trend along the year for tarragona the only conclusion that can be extracted from this study in relation with the results of the ensemble model is that the low values observed in december and january in hm0 when generally the heaviest storms occur could be related with the underestimation observed in the extremes as shown in the scatter plots figs 8 11 6 conclusion wave parameter estimation has been traditionally carried out by means of numerical models in this work several machine learning models have been developed to improve the accuracy of wave parameter estimations made by classical numerical models at four different locations of the spanish coastline to this end they provide a correction to the results of the numerical models we have focused on four physical wave variables spectral significant height mean spectral period peak period and mean direction of origin different machine learning models have been explored multilayer perceptron gradient boosting decision trees and ensemble methods that combine both these machine learning models have been evaluated both in terms of accuracy and computational cost see appendix a it has been found that these machine learning algorithms reduce the error of the predictions of the numerical model by 36 on average demonstrating the potential gains of combining machine learning and numerical models error reductions from 19 7 to 73 6 have been achieved in 14 out of 16 case studies our approach increases the accuracy of numerical model predictions in those points where real measures were available once the models have been trained our solution does not demand any instrumentation as it relies solely on the predictions from the numerical model notice that in our approach the predictions of the numerical models are used as inputs of the machine learning models and machine learning algorithms provide corrections for accuracy improvement a future and more ambitious work would be trying to completely replace the numerical model instead of correcting it we would also like to identify the patterns used by the machine learning models in order to better understand why the results are different from one location to another credit authorship contribution statement s gracia conceptualization methodology software writing original draft j olivito

to the positive outcome appendix a hyperparameters selected and training process table 5 details the hyperparameters selected in each case study we decided to optimize the hyperparameters for each location since each one is very different from the others we also explored the possibility of optimizing the hyperparameters for each variable within each location but in our preliminary experiments we observed that variable level optimization provided very little further improvement and it was very time consuming as it was mentioned in section 3 we applied a time series cross validation strategy

training time for the four approaches results for each approach averages all the locations and all the variables within each location the approach based on a single mlp which is the weaker in terms of accuracy requires a training time of only 12 4 3 9 s the approach based on bagging mlp which yields to more accurate predictions is one order of magnitude more time consuming requiring 189 7 118 7 s on average it is remarkable the fact that lightgbm models third approach which turn out to be slightly more accurate than a bagging of mlps are much faster as they only demand 74 8 61 5 s finally results from the ensemble of both bagging of mlps and lightgbm are just the sum of both training times the time required for averaging is negligible fig 13 average training time of the machine

20443,the oscillating water column owc responses within forward central and aft located moonpools for a fixed vessel are studied experimentally under regular head wave conditions a potential theory based solver wamit is used to determine the resonant frequencies of the water column which decrease with the increase in draft the free surface elevation of the confined water inside the owc for the piston mode frequencies are studied independently for the forward central and aft owcs showing a strong dependence on location draft and wave frequency for the vessel of 2 m length and owc diameter of 0 19 m maximum amplification factors of 1 71 forward 1 4 central and 1 51 aft are observed around the resonant frequencies for 0 15 m 0 30 m and 0 25 m vessel drafts respectively the relative response is largely magnified for wave frequencies around the resonant range at lower wave steepness where wave induced oscillations are non linear the understanding of location dependent responses can be useful in the context of wave energy harvesting from owc installed in a vessel where the free surface oscillations are used to generate energy keywords oscillating water column owc resonant frequency free surface elevation amplitude ratio scaling factor 1 introduction moonpools are vertical openings through the deck and hull structure typically used to support underwater operations on offshore platforms and marine vessels in general the water inside the moonpool does not affect much and hamper the vessel operations however when incident wave frequency becomes close to the natural frequency of the vertical piston mode or sloshing mode of the water column inside the moonpool cause large amplitude of motions of the water inside the moonpool in such resonating conditions it is possible to get significantly high vertical piston motions and sloshing longitudinal and transverse motions causing structural damage on the other hand moderate amount of energy can be extracted by exploiting this phenomenon the behaviour of water column inside moonpools have been investigated by many researchers using experiments as well as different numerical approaches the majority of published research works are focused on centrally located moonpools which is typically the case for drilling vessels fakuda 1977 performed extensive experiments for the investigation of water column behaviour inside a moonpool and its effect on vessel motions an empirical method was proposed which could be used for calculation of resonant frequency of water motions in piston and sloshing modes aalbers 1984 developed a mathematical model for describing the behaviour of water column inside the moonpool and performed a series of model tests for studying the same experimentally evans 1982 applied linear water wave theory by which general expressions can be derived for the mean power absorbed by an arbitrary system of pressure distributions fung 1996 experimentally computed the added mass and damping co efficient of a circular moonpool by performing a series of forced vertical oscillation experiments molin 2001 proposed the expression of piston and sloshing mode of a central rectangular moonpool in a rectangular barge using linear potential theory the natural modes of oscillation of the inner free surfaces are determined under the assumption of infinite water depth infinite length and beam of the barges that contain the moonpools newman and lee 2002 explained higher order panel method where the submerged surface can be represented by b splines and velocity potential in most cases the higher orxder panel method was found to be more efficient and accurate than the lower order panel method lee et al 2002 described the integration of rgkernel and wamit with three examples truncated circular cylinders two barges and a spar drilling ship with three moonpools maisondieu and ferrant 2003 developed a numerical model based on semi lagrangian formulation using potential theory to study elevation of the water wave inside a large moonpool and validated with experiments faltinsen et al 2007 carried out research on the 2d piston like steady state fluid motions in a moonpool bounded by two parallel rectangular hulls the resonant frequency and phase shift were predicted and validated using model tests torres et al 2008 and malta et al 2006 performed few numerical investigations based on potential theory for monocolumn hull equipped with moonpool a numerical study on concentric cylindrical moonpool case was performed by malta et al 2006 suggested methods of submerged volume representation they are low order and high order panel methods along with three ways of moonpool motion modeling sphaier et al 2007 through experimental study showed that the water column oscillation within the moonpool decreases when the diameter of the opening decreases veer and tholan 2008 experimentally studied the added resistance due to water sloshing and piston oscillation in the moonpool considering various length to breadth ratios they found that the increase of added resistance is a function of the inversed strouhal number and can be significant with a high forward speed reaching up to 100 of the resistance of calm water huang et al 2009 and kuo et al 2009 carried out model tests to study global loads induced by sloshing and their coupling with the ship motion it was found that the influence of sloshing on heave and pitch motions was not prominent but they significantly affect the roll sway surge and yaw motions wei et al 2011 also obtained similar results using numerical and experimental methods kristiansen and faltinsen 2008 developed a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt coupled with an inviscid vortex tracking method to investigate the impacts of fluid viscosity and nonlinear effects associated with the free surface of the water column within moonpools yang and kwon 2013 experimented on the moonpool resonance of a fixed barge and validated the experimental results with the theoretical calculation proposed by molin 2001 wang and falzarano 2013 showed that the geometric parameters of the owc radius and draft determine the natural frequency and the wave height transfer function in which draft has a more significant effect fredriksen et al 2015 found moonpool behaviour has a clear effect on the rigid body motions and the moonpool wave amplification factor is around 2 2 5 times the incoming wave amplitude around resonance frequency bull 2015 investigated the application of moonpools within two different rigid body profiles a duct buoy and an axisymmetric point absorber for wave energy extraction using owc mechanism bingham et al 2015 analysed 40 chamber i beam attenuator type oscillating water column wave energy converter numerically based on linearised potential flow theory and experimentally the model is considered in both fixed and freely floating slack moored conditions nielsen and bingham 2015 carried out experiments in model scale with 20 oscillating water column owc chambers on each side and obtained capture width ratio cwr for regular and irregular waves guo et al 2016 2017 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a deep water drillship and water motions inside the rectangular moonpool using experimental and numerical study the maximum water surface elevation reached up to two times the external encountered wave height under resonant conditions a barge with similar dimensions have been considered by molin 2017 newman 2018 where the behaviour of the water column inside a rectangular moonpool having recess was investigated resonant frequency equations for circular and rectangular moonpool configurations for both finite and infinite water depths were developed by molin et al 2018 shalby et al 2019 have done experimental and cfd investigation on multi chamber owc device and assessed the performance for a range of regular wave heights and periods an increase in incident wave height resulted in the reduction of the device capture width ratio zheng et al 2019 studied the hydrodynamics and wave power extraction performance of the multiple coast integrated owc where the role of the incident wave direction chamber size spacing and number of owcs was investigated it is evident that not many studies apart from bull 2015 have identified the application of moonpool for extracting wave energy however guo et al 2016 2017 and fredriksen et al 2015 showed that at the resonating frequency range the amplitude of the surface elevation of water inside the moonpool can reach up to two times that of the incident wave also most of the reported research works on moonpools consider the water column oscillations within the centrally located moonpool in different vessels or platforms this is justified as the primary reason behind the increase of the operability condition of drill ships by suppressing the resonating behaviour of the water column inside the moonpool however it is also interesting to check the wave condition or other geometric condition which enhance the possibility of increase in the surface elevation inside moonpool for energy extraction purpose therefore it is of interest to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of eccentrically placed moonpools for which no results are available in published literature in view of that the present work aims to establish the characteristics of free surface oscillations in a non central moonpool for a fixed vessel using experiments in regular waves to achieve that firstly a validation study is presented for the numerical model using the case of a barge with rectangular moonpool the same model is then applied for a fixed rectangular vessel alternately fitted with a forward central and aft owc with circular cross section experimental results of the free surface responses are then presented for all draft cases over a series of regular wave frequencies finally the influence of vessel motions on the resonant frequencies is investigated for a the freely floating vessel using the potential flow solver 2 vessel with a circular owc at forward central and aft position the present work aims to investigate the influence of the owc location on the water column responses along the length of the vessel especially the piston modes for different draft conditions this may have potentials for marine applications like passive pitch control or energy extraction the present study considers the moonpool to be located alternately at the central forward and aft locations and aims to understand the behaviour of the respective owcs individually for different regular waves and vessel drafts the resonant frequencies of water column oscillations within the owc are identified numerically using a method based on potential theory experiments are conducted to validate the observations and to study the response amplitudes at the three locations independently for different drafts for a range of wave frequencies an important aspect of the present work is to understand the nature of water column responses within the owc located in the forward and aft section and its draft dependence as compared to the central owc of the vessel the vessel and owc details are selected as per the possibility of obtaining resonant oscillations for the wave frequencies generated by the wave maker in the towing tank facility at iit kharagpur the flap type wave maker can produce maximum wave height of 0 30 m and wave frequency ranging from 1 5707 to 6 2831 rad s the details of the vessel are mentioned in table 1 fig 1 represents the schematic diagram for the vessel with locations of the owcs analysed in this study three different geometries were created as follows and the water column oscillations in each owc are studied individually case 1 vessel with owc at the center case 2 vessel with owc at distance of l 10 from the forward end case 3 vessel with owc at distance of l 10 from aft end numerical analysis is carried out for three draft cases i e 0 2 m 0 25 m and 0 3 m for obtaining the water column resonant frequencies for the three locations separately 2 1 numerical study 2 1 1 boundary value problem the numerical analysis is performed using wamit software the theory is well known and can be found in many sources wamit manual 2013 however for completeness and to highlight some subtle details which are not obvious in the standard wamit solution a brief description of the boundary value problem for the frequency domain panel method is given here under the assumption that the fluid is incompressible inviscid homogeneous and flow is irrotational there exists a velocity potential œÜ p t satisfying the following governing equation 1 2 œÜ p t 0 p œâ in above equation p represents the any point inside the fluid domain œâ if œÜ p t is time harmonic then œÜ p t can be further approximated as 2 œÜ p t œï p e i œâ t under the linear

total harmonic potential œï eq 1 is used together with following boundary conditions the linear free surface condition may be written as 5 œï z œâ 2 g œï 0 o n z 0 and the body boundary condition as 6 œï n d œï n i equations 1 6 are applied for the diffraction problem and since the vessel has moonpool inside it is convenient to treat that wave interaction with the internal pressure surface by adding a set of modes in addition to the six degrees of freedom in absence of body motions the extended modes are defined as sloshing and piston mode in the present paper if n j j 7 8 is denoted as the mode shape of sloshing and piston modes then body boundary condition for sloshing and piston mode may be defined as 7 œï n j i œâ n j f o r j 7 8 the constant panel method in wamit is used to solve for the unknown potential œï once œï is computed the exciting force can be obtained from 8 f i e x e re i œÅ œâ s b œï i œï d n i d s and the elevation of water inside the moonpool is evaluated by 9 Œ∑ 1 g re i œâ œï z 0 2 1 2 numerical setup the numerical analysis is performed using wamit software a detailed validation of the present numerical setup with the results of newman 2018 can be obtained from garad et al 2019 for the analysis surface of vessel and owc are represented by panels the analysis is done by using lower order panel method where the potential in each panel is considered as uniform analysis is done for regular head waves under the deep water condition the free surface elevation is computed along the centre line of the owc in longitudinal direction at different field points to find the point of maximum elevation the distance between consecutive field points is taken as 0 01 m a frequency increment of 0 001 rad s is considered for computations the frequencies at which the free surface elevation inside the owc gets maximised are known as resonant frequencies 2 1 3 results and discussions a basic study is first performed to understand the influence of panel discretization on the resonant frequency which is shown in fig 2 three panel sizes are chosen for which the frequency remains same for medium and higher panel sizes as the convergence is obtained with the medium discretization panel size pn 4069 this panel size has been used for the numerical study fig 3 represents the non dimensional free surface elevation for forward

the floating support c clearance between sea floor and keel eq 10 to eq 14 represent the resonant frequency of water column within the moonpool for a fixed vessel which solely depend on the owc dimensions and the draft this is in line with the study of sphaier et al 2007 wang and falzarano 2013 and liu et al 2017 table 2 shows the resonant frequencies for the present geometry obtained from fakuda 1977 and molin et al 2018 formulation it is observed from fig 3 that with an increase in draft the resonant frequency of the water column within the owc for a fixed vessel decreases irrespective of the owc location which follows fakuda 1977 and molin et al 2018 formulation in comparison with this formulation the resonant frequencies from numerical study are slightly lower however only one resonant frequency piston mode is present within the range of the incident wave frequencies fig 3 also indicates that for 0 20 m draft the resonant frequency of the water column is different for central and forward aft owc locations while for higher drafts 0 25 and 0 30 m it is the similar irrespective of the owc location for 0 20 m vessel draft the resonant frequency of water column within the central owc is 5 834 rad s while that for forward and aft owc is 6 0707 rad s on the other hand for 0 25 m and 0 30 m drafts the water column resonant frequencies are 5 384 rad s and 5 003 rad s respectively for forward central and aft owcs to understand the water column responses in a realistic scenario the influence of wave headings on the water column resonance within the owc is studied the results for forward owc at 0 20 m draft are shown in fig 4 the potential flow investigations shows that there is no effect of wave heading on the resonant frequency which is only a function of owc dimensions and vessel draft as explained by fakuda 1977 and molin et al 2018 however the magnitude of free surface elevation may definitely vary for different wave headings which are not in the scope of the present research work it must be mentioned here that the potential theory based calculations are only used to identify the resonant frequencies for water column motions within the owc as the viscous damping is ignored the free surface elevations obtained in the numerical study are unrealistically high the amplitude of the free surface oscillations within the moonpools are obtained from experiments conducted for a range of input wave frequencies and vessel drafts as discussed in the next section 2 2 experimental study the experiments are performed in the towing tank the 150 m long and 4 m wide at the ship hydrodynamics laboratory at iit kharagpur the vessel with owcs at three locations is manufactured as per details mentioned in table 1 the vessel is manufactured with the help of 0 01 m acrylic sheets to provide extra strength to the model in waves aluminium angles are used throughout the edges in both vertical and horizontal directions the angles have minimal effect on the flow field and practically no influence on the motions of the water column within owcs the owcs can be individually closed by adding a flat plate in the vessel keel at the respective locations silica gel is used to make the joints leak proof and leak tests are performed for each owc keeping the others two closed the experimental set up for the vessel with owcs attached to the carriage is shown in fig 5 the vessel is fixed using vertical struts to the carriage which is stationed in the towing tank at a distance of 30 m from the wavemaker in order to get fully developed incident waves the draft of the vessel is varied by raising or lowering the vertical struts along the fixture through the required distance a wave probe is stationed in the towing tank at a distance of 5 m in front of the vessel at a transverse location for measurement of the generated input wave characteristics the input wave height is kept constant 0 15 m throughout the experiments and only varied for aft owc case to understand effect of wave steepness on the owc response the time period is varied according to the nearby values obtained for the piston mode resonance from potential theory calculations for the entire experimental study a water depth of 1 75 m is maintained in the tank ensuring deep water effect the details of the experiments conducted in the present study are mentioned in table 3 the water column fluctuations within the owc for different input wavelengths are measured using multiple wave probes the wave probes are individually calibrated and zero setting is performed before the experiments wave frequencies are chosen such that the piston mode resonance of the water column is captured along with the response pattern in a range of time periods for each generated wave the free surface elevation data from the wave probe is acquired for a time span of 60 s and the resulting water column response is calculated by averaging over the stable range to understand the nature of water column response three longitudinally spaced wave probes are used to measure the obtained free surface elevation the first one pc at the center pf and pa at distances of 0 075 m forward and aft of the owc centerline respectively as shown in fig 6 fig 7 represents the real time free surface elevation data obtained from the three wave probes in the central owc this figure corresponds to the resonance frequency for the fixed vessel with central owc for 0 20 m draft obtained from numerical analysis from fig 7 it is clearly observed that at particular instant all the three probes record the same free surface elevation as the wave probes are spaced apart in longitudinal direction which indicates pure piston mode motion of the water column without any effect of sloshing this observation is consistent at all the wave frequencies investigated hence the data from the central probe pc is selected for all the comparative results presented in this study the time histories of free surface elevation are similar indicating the absence of any significant sloshing effect within the owc in order to understand the repeatability of the measurements five repeated tests are performed for one specific case of the wave period the precision uncertainty for the free surface elevation within the owc for 95 confidence interval is found to be 4 which is acceptable 2 2 1 central owc fig 8 shows the draft dependence of the water column response for the central owc the amplitude of water column oscillations in the owc is made non dimensional by dividing with the incident wave amplitude which is then plotted as a function of incident wave frequency the resonant frequencies showing maximum oscillations are 5 693 rad s for 0 20 m draft 5 384 rad s for 0 25 m draft and 5 003 rad s for 0 30 m draft cases the occurrence of the highest observed a a 0 are similar to frequencies shown in fig 3 except for a small deviation for the 0 20 m draft the primary observations from the experiments are firstly a shifting decrease of the water column resonant frequency with increasing draft which agrees with the numerical results and secondly an increase of the maximum response with increasing draft for the central owc the response amplitude ratios of the water column are less than 1 in the entire frequency range for 0 2 m draft now considering the prospects of energy conversion the region above dashed line in fig 8 represents the domain of gain denoting the wave frequency range where the free surface amplitude within the owc is more than that of the incident wave for the lower draft i e 0 2 m there is no gain in the free surface amplitude with respect to the wave height the amplitude gains increase at higher drafts and become maximum at the resonance frequency 2 2 2 forward owc for the forward owc the water column response and its draft dependence is shown in fig 9 from section 2 1 3 the resonant frequencies obtained from potential flow investigations are 6 0707 rad sec for 0 20 m draft and 5 384 rad sec for 0 25 m draft these are very similar to the wave frequencies for which maximum free surface oscillations are observed from the experiments however the striking result for the forward owc is net gain in the water column motion amplitude for all the drafts as the maximum response increased with decreasing draft we have investigated a lower draft case to confirm the response pattern hence a lower draft of 0 15 m is chosen as a third case which is contrary to the central owc investigations where the maximum response decreased at lower drafts from fig 9 the highest relative response is obtained for the forward owc water column for a draft of 0 15 m in this case the amplitude ratio is close to 1 7 which decreases sharply with both increase and decrease in input wave periods this can be attributed to the dynamic pressure at the forward owc location which is higher at the resonance frequency this happens especially when the draft of the vessel is equal to the input wave height causing significantly higher response 2 2 3 aft owc fig 10 represents the draft dependency of water column responses for the aft owc from section 2 1 3 the resonant frequencies obtained from potential flow investigations are 6 07 rad s for 0 20 m draft and 5 38 rad s for 0 25 m draft which are similar to forward owc for respective drafts the free surface oscillations obtained from the experiments are also maximum close to the resonance frequency for the respective drafts for aft owc only 0 25 m draft has net gain in water column motion amplitude in the aft owc case water column response increased with increase in draft from fig 10 the highest relative response is obtained for the aft owc water column at 0 25 m draft where the amplitude ratio is close to 1 5 2 2 4 comparison of owc responses for 0 20 m draft a comparison of the water column responses for forward central and aft owcs for 0 20 m draft is shown in fig 11 one of the primary outcomes from the experimental study is a significantly higher water column response for the forward owc for 0 20 m draft as compared to that of the central and aft owc the maximum response amplitude ratio is 1 51 for the forward owc 0 96 for the central owc and 0 99 for aft owc which signifies that response amplification is obtained only at the forward location also a critical observation is that the resonant frequency for both the forward and aft owc is higher as compared to the central owc which is in line with the numerical results presented in fig 3 2 2 5 comparison of owc responses for 0 25 m draft fig 12 represents the comparison of the water column responses for forward central and aft owcs for 0 25 m vessel draft for this case the response amplification is achieved at all the three locations over a wider frequency range the maximum response amplitude ratio is 1 46 for the forward owc 1 22 for the central owc and 1 51 for the aft owc there is a small variation in the resonant frequency with the owc location at 0 25 m draft the values being close to those obtained numerically the maximum amplitude ratios for water column oscillations at the three owc positions from the experiments carried out at all vessel drafts are summarized in table 4 now the instantaneous elevation of the water column at any given time within the owc will depend on the corresponding phase of the wave encountered a higher amplitude of the forward owc indicates that the wave energy is dissipated as it travels along the vessel this results in lower dynamic pressure fluctuations below the central owc and followed by the aft owc when compared with the forward owc the kinetic energy being a quadratic function of velocity reduces due to speed loss caused by friction over a larger length finally results in reduction of the amplitude of the free surface elevation the ratio of the wave height to the vessel draft plays an important role in this interaction and possibly this leads to differences in the resonant frequencies at the three owc locations this is more critical for lower drafts close to or equal to the incident wave height 2 2 6 effect of wave steepness on owc amplitude the influence of incident wave steepness on amplitude ratio is investigated at a resonant and a non resonant frequency in fig 13 the wave slope is changed by altering the input wave amplitude keeping the time period constant for each case for the frequency around resonance 5 384 rad s at 0 25 m draft the response amplitude increases drastically with decreasing wave slope h Œª at the lowest experimented value h Œª 0 015 the amplification factor is 2 8 this non linear behavior for moonpool resonance had been reported in aalbers 1984 and bingham et al 2015 where the effect of wave steepness is more significant at the resonant frequency on the other hand for the non resonant frequency 6 28 rad s at 0 15 m draft the increments in responses are milder and almost linear with the slope of the incident wave a simple estimate of the nonlinearity can be established using the coefficient of determination i e r 2 value which is 0 998 for the resonant case using the third order polynomial trend fitting on the other hand a value of 0 984 with linear fitting is obtained for the non resonant case fig 14 shows the free surface elevation time history within the aft owc for the lowest h Œª close to the resonant frequency showing a significant amplification over the incident wave thus the incident wave height has a strong effect on amplitude ratio especially around the resonant frequency where the non linear behaviour is dominant 2 2 7 relative amplitude and frequency based on owc location to provide an estimate of the relative free surface oscillations of the three owcs a scaling factor œá is defined as below to express the amplitude gains at central and aft owcs taking the forward owc as a reference œá c a a 0 c e n t r a l a a 0 f o r w a r d œá a a a 0 a f t a a 0 f o r w a r d fig 15 shows the scaling factors representing the free surface oscillations in the central and aft owc compared to forward owc for 0 20 m and 0 25 m vessel draft scaling factors œá c and œá a of 1 represent that the free surface oscillation amplitudes in the central and aft owcs are same as that of forward owc the plots clearly show that the scaling factor is less than 1 for most cases at both the drafts this indicates a dissipation of the wave energy along the vessel from forward to aft reducing the available dynamic pressure at the corresponding owc locations for the same reason the scaling factor œá a for the aft owc is generally lower compared to that of the central owc œá c deviations are only observed at the lowest frequency for the central moonpool and at the resonant frequency for the aft moonpool fig 15b where œá a is more than œá c and is also higher than 1 in order to relate the water column oscillation frequency to the given input wave frequency a fast fourier transform fft is done for the wave probe data from forward central and aft owcs the results with fixed vessel at 0 20 m draft are shown in fig 16 at the corresponding resonant frequencies it clearly indicates that the water column oscillation frequency within the owc closely matches with that of the incident wave generated by the wave maker which should naturally be the case for regular waves 3 owc resonant frequencies for a freely floating vessel a numerical study the primary investigations presented in this paper outline the occurrence of resonant frequencies of water column within three owc locations for a fixed vessel it is also of interest to investigate how the motions of the vessel may influence the resonant frequencies this aspect has been explored in this section using potential flow based calculations the details of which have been discussed in section 2 1 now in order to consider a freely floating body the radiation problem needs to be solved along with the diffraction problem in that case the total potential œï may be defined as per eq 3 and the body boundary condition may be given as per eq 15 the rest of the numerical setup is similar to the one explained in section 2 1 15 œï n i i w n i i 1 2 6 the non dimensional free surface elevations within forward central and aft owcs of similar configurations for the freely floating vessel are shown in fig 17 the primary observation is a difference in resonance frequency of the forward and aft owcs as compared to the central one for the water column within the central owc the resonant motions are only due to heave motion however for the forward and aft owcs multiple peaks are observed representing more resonant frequencies i e piston mode and higher sloshing mode frequencies which are due to combined effect of heave and pitch motions applying the similar concept of piston and sloshing modes as defined for a fixed vessel case to the freely floating vessel the piston mode and first sloshing mode should be obtained at the lowest resonating frequency and the second sloshing mode at the next resonating frequency and so on with an increase in draft the resonant frequency decreases for the freely floating vessel condition which is observed to be similar to fixed vessel condition irrespective of owc location following the formulations given in fakuda 1977 and molin et al 2018 it must however be mentioned that the water column oscillation amplitudes for a freely floating vessel cannot be captured using this potential flow based numerical approach and they will strongly depend on the relative phase of water column motions with respect to the vessel motions the vessel motions are found to alter the water column resonant frequencies as compared to the fixed vessel fig 3 the piston mode value is similar for the symmetrically placed forward and aft owcs and occurs at a higher frequency as compared to the central owc 4 conclusions the water column responses within a forward central and aft owc for a vessel are investigated in a range of wave frequencies the resonant wave frequencies obtained using analytical calculations as well as potential flow based calculations were found to compare well with the experiments the free surface oscillations measured using wave probes indicate significantly higher amplitudes in the frequency range where piston mode resonance is observed numerical study also indicates a shift in the resonant frequencies when the vessel is freely floating where additional peaks could result at the forward and aft owc from the pitching motion of the vessel the principal outcome is that the location of the moonpool has a significant influence on the water column resonance characteristics even for a fixed vessel the response amplifications at resonance also vary with the location and are largely magnified at lower wave steepness the location dependent behaviour depends on the draft as well as the wave frequency as these factors also govern the vessel motions it should be of interest to experimentally investigate the water column responses for a freely floating vessel where the coupled effects of vessel heave and pitch motions and owc oscillations for different locations can be understood these oscillating water column responses provide insight into the energy extraction potential from the moonpools at different locations using suitable installed devices credit authorship contribution statement suraj garad experimentation formal analysis validation

20443,the oscillating water column owc responses within forward central and aft located moonpools for a fixed vessel are studied experimentally under regular head wave conditions a potential theory based solver wamit is used to determine the resonant frequencies of the water column which decrease with the increase in draft the free surface elevation of the confined water inside the owc for the piston mode frequencies are studied independently for the forward central and aft owcs showing a strong dependence on location draft and wave frequency for the vessel of 2 m length and owc diameter of 0 19 m maximum amplification factors of 1 71 forward 1 4 central and 1 51 aft are observed around the resonant frequencies for 0 15 m 0 30 m and 0 25 m vessel drafts respectively the relative response is largely magnified for wave frequencies around the resonant range at lower wave steepness where wave induced oscillations are non linear the understanding of location dependent responses can be useful in the context of wave energy harvesting from owc installed in a vessel where the free surface oscillations are used to generate energy keywords oscillating water column owc resonant frequency free surface elevation amplitude ratio scaling factor 1 introduction moonpools are vertical openings through the deck and hull structure typically used to support underwater operations on offshore platforms and marine vessels in general the water inside the moonpool does not affect much and hamper the vessel operations however when incident wave frequency becomes close to the natural frequency of the vertical piston mode or sloshing mode of the water column inside the moonpool cause large amplitude of motions of the water inside the moonpool in such resonating conditions it is possible to get significantly high vertical piston motions and sloshing longitudinal and transverse motions causing structural damage on the other hand moderate amount of energy can be extracted by exploiting this phenomenon the behaviour of water column inside moonpools have been investigated by many researchers using experiments as well as different numerical approaches the majority of published research works are focused on centrally located moonpools which is typically the case for drilling vessels fakuda 1977 performed extensive experiments for the investigation of water column behaviour inside a moonpool and its effect on vessel motions an empirical method was proposed which could be used for calculation of resonant frequency of water motions in piston and sloshing modes aalbers 1984 developed a mathematical model for describing the behaviour of water column inside the moonpool and performed a series of model tests for studying the same experimentally evans 1982 applied linear water wave theory by which general expressions can be derived for the mean power absorbed by an arbitrary system of pressure distributions fung 1996 experimentally computed the added mass and damping co efficient of a circular moonpool by performing a series of forced vertical oscillation experiments molin 2001 proposed the expression of piston and sloshing mode of a central rectangular moonpool in a rectangular barge using linear potential theory the natural modes of oscillation of the inner free surfaces are determined under the assumption of infinite water depth infinite length and beam of the barges that contain the moonpools newman and lee 2002 explained higher order panel method where the submerged surface can be represented by b splines and velocity potential in most cases the higher orxder panel method was found to be more efficient and accurate than the lower order panel method lee et al 2002 described the integration of rgkernel and wamit with three examples truncated circular cylinders two barges and a spar drilling ship with three moonpools maisondieu and ferrant 2003 developed a numerical model based on semi lagrangian formulation using potential theory to study elevation of the water wave inside a large moonpool and validated with experiments faltinsen et al 2007 carried out research on the 2d piston like steady state fluid motions in a moonpool bounded by two parallel rectangular hulls the resonant frequency and phase shift were predicted and validated using model tests torres et al 2008 and malta et al 2006 performed few numerical investigations based on potential theory for monocolumn hull equipped with moonpool a numerical study on concentric cylindrical moonpool case was performed by malta et al 2006 suggested methods of submerged volume representation they are low order and high order panel methods along with three ways of moonpool motion modeling sphaier et al 2007 through experimental study showed that the water column oscillation within the moonpool decreases when the diameter of the opening decreases veer and tholan 2008 experimentally studied the added resistance due to water sloshing and piston oscillation in the moonpool considering various length to breadth ratios they found that the increase of added resistance is a function of the inversed strouhal number and can be significant with a high forward speed reaching up to 100 of the resistance of calm water huang et al 2009 and kuo et al 2009 carried out model tests to study global loads induced by sloshing and their coupling with the ship motion it was found that the influence of sloshing on heave and pitch motions was not prominent but they significantly affect the roll sway surge and yaw motions wei et al 2011 also obtained similar results using numerical and experimental methods kristiansen and faltinsen 2008 developed a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt coupled with an inviscid vortex tracking method to investigate the impacts of fluid viscosity and nonlinear effects associated with the free surface of the water column within moonpools yang and kwon 2013 experimented on the moonpool resonance of a fixed barge and validated the experimental results with the theoretical calculation proposed by molin 2001 wang and falzarano 2013 showed that the geometric parameters of the owc radius and draft determine the natural frequency and the wave height transfer function in which draft has a more significant effect fredriksen et al 2015 found moonpool behaviour has a clear effect on the rigid body motions and the moonpool wave amplification factor is around 2 2 5 times the incoming wave amplitude around resonance frequency bull 2015 investigated the application of moonpools within two different rigid body profiles a duct buoy and an axisymmetric point absorber for wave energy extraction using owc mechanism bingham et al 2015 analysed 40 chamber i beam attenuator type oscillating water column wave energy converter numerically based on linearised potential flow theory and experimentally the model is considered in both fixed and freely floating slack moored conditions nielsen and bingham 2015 carried out experiments in model scale with 20 oscillating water column owc chambers on each side and obtained capture width ratio cwr for regular and irregular waves guo et al 2016 2017 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a deep water drillship and water motions inside the rectangular moonpool using experimental and numerical study the maximum water surface elevation reached up to two times the external encountered wave height under resonant conditions a barge with similar dimensions have been considered by molin 2017 newman 2018 where the behaviour of the water column inside a rectangular moonpool having recess was investigated resonant frequency equations for circular and rectangular moonpool configurations for both finite and infinite water depths were developed by molin et al 2018 shalby et al 2019 have done experimental and cfd investigation on multi chamber owc device and assessed the performance for a range of regular wave heights and periods an increase in incident wave height resulted in the reduction of the device capture width ratio zheng et al 2019 studied the hydrodynamics and wave power extraction performance of the multiple coast integrated owc where the role of the incident wave direction chamber size spacing and number of owcs was investigated it is evident that not many studies apart from bull 2015 have identified the application of moonpool for extracting wave energy however guo et al 2016 2017 and fredriksen et al 2015 showed that at the resonating frequency range the amplitude of the surface elevation of water inside the moonpool can reach up to two times that of the incident wave also most of the reported research works on moonpools consider the water column oscillations within the centrally located moonpool in different vessels or platforms this is justified as the primary reason behind the increase of the operability condition of drill ships by suppressing the resonating behaviour of the water column inside the moonpool however it is also interesting to check the wave condition or other geometric condition which enhance the possibility of increase in the surface elevation inside moonpool for energy extraction purpose therefore it is of interest to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of eccentrically placed moonpools for which no results are available in published literature in view of that the present work aims to establish the characteristics of free surface oscillations in a non central moonpool for a fixed vessel using experiments in regular waves to achieve that firstly a validation study is presented for the numerical model using the case of a barge with rectangular moonpool the same model is then applied for a fixed rectangular vessel alternately fitted with a forward central and aft owc with circular cross section experimental results of the free surface responses are then presented for all draft cases over a series of regular wave frequencies finally the influence of vessel motions on the resonant frequencies is investigated for a the freely floating vessel using the potential flow solver 2 vessel with a circular owc at forward central and aft position the present work aims to investigate the influence of the owc location on the water column responses along the length of the vessel especially the piston modes for different draft conditions this may have potentials for marine applications like passive pitch control or energy extraction the present study considers the moonpool to be located alternately at the central forward and aft locations and aims to understand the behaviour of the respective owcs individually for different regular waves and vessel drafts the resonant frequencies of water column oscillations within the owc are identified numerically using a method based on potential theory experiments are conducted to validate the observations and to study the response amplitudes at the three locations independently for different drafts for a range of wave frequencies an important aspect of the present work is to understand the nature of water column responses within the owc located in the forward and aft section and its draft dependence as compared to the central owc of the vessel the vessel and owc details are selected as per the possibility of obtaining resonant oscillations for the wave frequencies generated by the wave maker in the towing tank facility at iit kharagpur the flap type wave maker can produce maximum wave height of 0 30 m and wave frequency ranging from 1 5707 to 6 2831 rad s the details of the vessel are mentioned in table 1 fig 1 represents the schematic diagram for the vessel with locations of the owcs analysed in this study three different geometries were created as follows and the water column oscillations in each owc are studied individually case 1 vessel with owc at the center case 2 vessel with owc at distance of l 10 from the forward end case 3 vessel with owc at distance of l 10 from aft end numerical analysis is carried out for three draft cases i e 0 2 m 0 25 m and 0 3 m for obtaining the water column resonant frequencies for the three locations separately 2 1 numerical study 2 1 1 boundary value problem the numerical analysis is performed using wamit software the theory is well known and can be found in many sources wamit manual 2013 however for completeness and to highlight some subtle details which are not obvious in the standard wamit solution a brief description of the boundary value problem for the frequency domain panel method is given here under the assumption that the fluid is incompressible inviscid homogeneous and flow is irrotational there exists a velocity potential œÜ p t satisfying the following governing equation 1 2 œÜ p t 0 p œâ in above equation p represents the any point inside the fluid domain œâ if œÜ p t is time harmonic then œÜ p t can be further approximated as 2 œÜ p t œï p e i œâ t under the linear

œï n d œï n i equations 1 6 are applied for the diffraction problem and since the vessel has moonpool inside it is convenient to treat that wave interaction with the internal pressure surface by adding a set of modes in addition to the six degrees of freedom in absence of body motions the extended modes are defined as sloshing and piston mode in the present paper if n j j 7 8 is denoted as the mode shape of sloshing and piston modes then body boundary condition for sloshing and piston mode may be defined as 7 œï n j i œâ n j f o r j 7 8 the constant panel method in wamit is used to

obtained from garad et al 2019 for the analysis surface of vessel and owc are represented by panels the analysis is done by using lower order panel method where the potential in each panel is considered as uniform analysis is done for regular head waves under the deep water condition the free surface elevation is computed along the centre line of the owc in longitudinal direction at different field points to find the point of maximum elevation the distance between consecutive field points is taken as 0 01 m a frequency increment of 0 001 rad s is considered for computations the frequencies at which the free surface elevation inside the owc gets maximised are known as resonant frequencies 2 1 3 results and discussions a basic study is first performed to understand the influence of panel discretization on the resonant frequency which is shown in fig 2 three panel sizes are chosen for which the frequency remains same for medium and higher panel sizes as the convergence is obtained with the medium discretization panel size pn 4069 this panel size has been used for the numerical study fig 3 represents the non dimensional free surface elevation for forward

the floating support c clearance between sea floor and keel eq 10 to eq 14 represent the resonant frequency of water column within the moonpool for a fixed vessel which solely depend on the owc dimensions and the draft this is in line with the study of sphaier et al 2007 wang and falzarano 2013 and liu et al 2017 table 2 shows the resonant frequencies for the present geometry obtained from fakuda 1977 and molin et al 2018 formulation it is observed from fig 3 that with an increase in draft the resonant frequency of the water column within the owc for a fixed vessel decreases irrespective of the owc location which follows fakuda 1977 and molin et al 2018 formulation in comparison with this formulation the resonant frequencies from numerical study are slightly lower however only one resonant frequency piston mode is present within the range of the incident wave frequencies fig 3 also indicates that for 0 20 m draft the resonant frequency of the water column is different for central and forward aft owc locations while for higher drafts 0 25 and 0 30 m it is the similar irrespective of the owc location for 0 20 m vessel draft the resonant frequency of water column within the central owc is 5 834 rad s while that for forward and aft owc is 6 0707 rad s on the other hand for 0 25 m and 0 30 m drafts the water column resonant frequencies are 5 384 rad s and 5 003 rad s respectively for forward central and aft owcs to understand the water column responses in a realistic scenario the influence of wave headings on the water column resonance within the owc is studied the results for forward owc at 0 20 m draft are shown in fig 4 the potential flow investigations shows that there is no effect of wave heading on the resonant frequency which is only a function of owc dimensions and vessel draft as explained by fakuda 1977 and molin et al 2018 however the magnitude of free surface elevation may definitely vary for different wave headings which are not in the scope of the present research work it must be mentioned here that the potential theory based calculations are only used to identify the resonant frequencies for water column motions within the owc as the viscous damping is ignored the free surface elevations obtained in the numerical study are unrealistically high the amplitude of the free surface oscillations within the moonpools are obtained from experiments conducted for a range of input wave frequencies and vessel drafts as discussed in the next section 2 2 experimental study the experiments are performed in the towing tank the 150 m long and 4 m wide at the ship hydrodynamics laboratory at iit kharagpur the vessel with owcs at three locations is manufactured as per details mentioned in table 1 the vessel is manufactured with the help of 0 01 m acrylic sheets to provide extra strength to the model in waves aluminium angles are used throughout the edges in both vertical and horizontal directions the angles have minimal effect on the flow field and practically no influence on the motions of the water column within owcs the owcs can be individually closed by adding a flat plate in the vessel keel at the respective locations silica gel is used to make the joints leak proof and leak tests are performed for each owc keeping the others two closed the experimental set up for the vessel with owcs attached to the carriage is shown in fig 5 the vessel is fixed using vertical struts to the carriage which is stationed in the towing tank at a distance of 30 m from the wavemaker in order to get fully developed incident waves the draft of the vessel is varied by raising or lowering the vertical struts along the fixture through the required distance a wave probe is stationed in the towing tank at a distance of 5 m in front of the vessel at a transverse location for measurement of the generated input wave characteristics the input wave height is kept constant 0 15 m throughout the experiments and only varied for aft owc case to understand effect of wave steepness on the owc response the time period is varied according to the nearby values obtained for the piston mode resonance from potential theory calculations for the entire experimental study a water depth of 1 75 m is maintained in the tank ensuring deep water effect the details of the experiments conducted in the present study are mentioned in table 3 the water column fluctuations within the owc for different input wavelengths are measured using multiple wave probes the wave probes are individually calibrated and zero setting is performed before the experiments wave frequencies are chosen such that the piston mode resonance of the water column is captured along with the response pattern in a range of time periods for each generated wave the free surface elevation data from the wave probe is acquired for a time span of 60 s and the resulting water column response is calculated by averaging over the stable range to understand the nature of water column response three longitudinally spaced wave probes are used to measure the obtained free surface elevation the first one pc at the center pf and pa at distances of 0 075 m forward and aft of the owc centerline respectively as shown in fig 6 fig 7 represents the real time free surface elevation data obtained from the three wave probes in the central owc this figure corresponds to the resonance frequency for the fixed vessel with central owc for 0 20 m draft obtained from numerical analysis from fig 7 it is clearly observed that at particular instant all the three probes record the same free surface elevation as the wave probes are spaced apart in longitudinal direction which indicates pure piston mode motion of the water column without any effect of sloshing this observation is consistent at all the wave frequencies investigated hence the data from the central probe pc is selected for all the comparative results presented in this study the time histories of free surface elevation are similar indicating the absence of any significant sloshing effect within the owc in order to understand the repeatability of the measurements five repeated tests are performed for one specific case of the wave period the precision uncertainty for the free surface elevation within the owc for 95 confidence interval is found to be 4 which is acceptable 2 2 1 central owc fig 8 shows the draft dependence of the water column response for the central owc the amplitude of water column oscillations in the owc is made non dimensional by dividing with the incident wave amplitude which is then plotted as a function of incident wave frequency the resonant frequencies showing maximum oscillations are 5 693 rad s for 0 20 m draft 5 384 rad s for 0 25 m draft and 5 003 rad s for 0 30 m draft cases the occurrence of the highest observed a a 0 are similar to frequencies shown in fig 3 except for a small deviation for the 0 20 m draft the primary observations from the experiments are firstly a shifting decrease of the water column resonant frequency with increasing draft which agrees with the numerical results and secondly an increase of the maximum response with increasing draft for the central owc the response amplitude ratios of the water column are less than 1 in the entire frequency range for 0 2 m draft now considering the prospects of energy conversion the region above dashed line in fig 8 represents the domain of gain denoting the wave frequency range where the free surface amplitude within the owc is more than that of the incident wave for the lower draft i e 0 2 m there is no gain in the free surface amplitude with respect to the wave height the amplitude gains increase at higher drafts and become maximum at the resonance frequency 2 2 2 forward owc for the forward owc the water column response and its draft dependence is shown in fig 9 from section 2 1 3 the resonant frequencies obtained from potential flow investigations are 6 0707 rad sec for 0 20 m draft and 5 384 rad sec for 0 25 m draft these are very similar to the wave frequencies for which maximum free surface oscillations are observed from the experiments however the striking result for the forward owc is net gain in the water column motion amplitude for all the drafts as the maximum response increased with decreasing draft we have investigated a lower draft case to confirm the response pattern hence a lower draft of 0 15 m is chosen as a third case which is contrary to the central owc investigations where the maximum response decreased at lower drafts from fig 9 the highest relative response is obtained for the forward owc water column for a draft of 0 15 m in this case the amplitude ratio is close to 1 7 which decreases sharply with both increase and decrease in input wave periods this can be attributed to the dynamic pressure at the forward owc location which is higher at the resonance frequency this happens especially when the draft of the vessel is equal to the input wave height causing significantly higher response 2 2 3 aft owc fig 10 represents the draft dependency of water column responses for the aft owc from section 2 1 3 the resonant frequencies obtained from potential flow investigations are 6 07 rad s for 0 20 m draft and 5 38 rad s for 0 25 m draft which are similar to forward owc for respective drafts the free surface oscillations obtained from the experiments are also maximum close to the resonance frequency for the respective drafts for aft owc only 0 25 m draft has net gain in water column motion amplitude in the aft owc case water column response increased with increase in draft from fig 10 the highest relative response is obtained for the aft owc water column at 0 25 m draft where the amplitude ratio is close to 1 5 2 2 4 comparison of owc responses for 0 20 m draft a comparison of the water column responses for forward central and aft owcs for 0 20 m draft is shown in fig 11 one of the primary outcomes from the experimental study is a significantly higher water column response for the forward owc for 0 20 m draft as compared to that of the central and aft owc the maximum response amplitude ratio is 1 51 for the forward owc 0 96 for the central owc and 0 99 for aft owc which signifies that response amplification is obtained only at the forward location also a critical observation is that the resonant frequency for both the forward and aft owc is higher as compared to the central owc which is in line with the numerical results presented in fig 3 2 2 5 comparison of owc responses for 0 25 m draft fig 12 represents the comparison of the water column responses for forward central and aft owcs for 0 25 m vessel draft for this case the response amplification is achieved at all the three locations over a wider frequency range the maximum response amplitude ratio is 1 46 for the forward owc 1 22 for the central owc and 1 51 for the aft owc there is a small variation in the resonant frequency with the owc location at 0 25 m draft the values being close to those obtained numerically the maximum amplitude ratios for water column oscillations at the three owc positions from the experiments carried out at all vessel drafts are summarized in table 4 now the instantaneous elevation of the water column at any given time within the owc will depend on the corresponding phase of the wave encountered a higher amplitude of the forward owc indicates that the wave energy is dissipated as it travels along the vessel this results in lower dynamic pressure fluctuations below the central owc and followed by the aft owc when compared with the forward owc the kinetic energy being a quadratic function of velocity reduces due to speed loss caused by friction over a larger length finally results in reduction of the amplitude of the free surface elevation the ratio of the wave height to the vessel draft plays an important role in this interaction and possibly this leads to differences in the resonant frequencies at the three owc locations this is more critical for lower drafts close to or equal to the incident wave height 2 2 6 effect of wave steepness on owc amplitude the influence of incident wave steepness on amplitude ratio is investigated at a resonant and a non resonant frequency in fig 13 the wave slope is changed by altering the input wave amplitude keeping the time period constant for each case for the frequency around resonance 5 384 rad s at 0 25 m draft the response amplitude increases drastically with decreasing wave slope h Œª at the lowest experimented value h Œª 0 015 the amplification factor is 2 8 this non linear behavior for moonpool resonance had been reported in aalbers 1984 and bingham et al 2015 where the effect of wave steepness is more significant at the resonant frequency on the other hand for the non resonant frequency 6 28 rad s at 0 15 m draft the increments in responses are milder and almost linear with the slope of the incident wave a simple estimate of the nonlinearity can be established using the coefficient of determination i e r 2 value which is 0 998 for the resonant case using the third order polynomial trend fitting on the other hand a value of 0 984 with linear fitting is obtained for the non resonant case fig 14 shows the free surface elevation time history within the aft owc for the lowest h Œª close to the resonant frequency showing a significant amplification over the incident wave thus the incident wave height has a strong effect on amplitude ratio especially around the resonant frequency where the non linear behaviour is dominant 2 2 7 relative amplitude and frequency based on owc location to provide an estimate of the relative free surface oscillations of the three owcs a scaling factor œá is defined as below to express the amplitude gains at central and aft owcs taking the forward owc as a reference œá c a a 0 c e n t r a l a a 0 f o r w a r d œá a a a 0 a f t a a 0 f o r w a r d fig 15 shows the scaling factors representing the free surface oscillations in the central and aft owc compared to forward owc for 0 20 m and 0 25 m vessel draft scaling factors œá c and œá a of 1 represent that the free surface oscillation amplitudes in the central and aft owcs are same as that of forward owc the plots clearly show that the scaling factor is less than 1 for most cases at both the drafts this indicates a dissipation of the wave energy along the vessel from forward to aft reducing the available dynamic pressure at the corresponding owc locations for the same reason the scaling factor œá a for the aft owc is generally lower compared to that of the central owc œá c deviations are only observed at the lowest frequency for the central moonpool and at the resonant frequency for the aft moonpool fig 15b where œá a is more than œá c and is also higher than 1 in order to relate the water column oscillation frequency to the given input wave frequency a fast fourier transform fft is done for the wave probe data from forward central and aft owcs the results with fixed vessel at 0 20 m draft are shown in fig 16 at the corresponding resonant frequencies it clearly indicates that the water column oscillation frequency within the owc closely matches with that of the incident wave generated by the wave maker which should naturally be the case for regular waves 3 owc resonant frequencies for a freely floating vessel a numerical study the primary investigations presented in this paper outline the occurrence of resonant frequencies of water column within three owc locations for a fixed vessel it is also of interest to investigate how the motions of the vessel may influence the resonant frequencies this aspect has been explored in this section using potential flow based calculations the details of which have been discussed in section 2 1 now in order to consider a freely floating body the radiation problem needs to be solved along with the diffraction problem in that case the total potential œï may be defined as per eq 3 and the body boundary condition may be given as per eq 15 the rest of the numerical setup is similar to the one explained in section 2 1 15 œï n i i w n i i 1 2 6 the non dimensional free surface elevations within forward central and aft owcs of similar configurations for the freely floating vessel are shown in fig 17 the primary observation is a difference in resonance frequency of the forward and aft owcs as compared to the central one for the water column within the central owc the resonant motions are only due to heave motion however for the forward and aft owcs multiple peaks are observed representing more resonant frequencies i e piston mode and higher sloshing mode frequencies which are due to combined effect of heave and pitch motions applying the similar concept of piston and sloshing modes as defined for a fixed vessel case to the freely floating vessel the piston mode and first sloshing mode should be obtained at the lowest resonating frequency and the second sloshing mode at the next resonating frequency and so on with an increase in draft the resonant frequency decreases for the freely floating vessel condition which is observed to be similar to fixed vessel condition irrespective of owc location following the formulations given in fakuda 1977 and molin et al 2018 it must however be mentioned that the water column oscillation amplitudes for a freely floating vessel cannot be captured using this potential flow based numerical approach and they will strongly depend on the relative phase of water column motions with respect to the vessel motions the vessel motions are found to alter the water column resonant frequencies as compared to the fixed vessel fig 3 the piston mode value is similar for the symmetrically placed forward and aft owcs and occurs at a higher frequency as compared to the central owc 4 conclusions the water column responses within a forward central and aft owc for a vessel are investigated in a range of wave frequencies the resonant wave frequencies obtained using analytical calculations as well as potential flow based calculations were found to compare well with the experiments the free surface oscillations measured using wave probes indicate significantly higher amplitudes in the frequency range where piston mode resonance is observed numerical study also indicates a shift in the resonant frequencies when the vessel is freely floating where additional peaks could result at the forward and aft owc from the pitching motion of the vessel the principal outcome is that the location of the moonpool has a significant influence on the water column resonance characteristics even for a fixed vessel the response amplifications at resonance also vary with the location and are largely magnified at lower wave steepness the location dependent behaviour depends on the draft as well as the wave frequency as these factors also govern the vessel motions it should be of interest to experimentally investigate the water column responses for a freely floating vessel where the coupled effects of vessel heave and pitch motions and owc oscillations for different locations can be understood these oscillating water column responses provide insight into the energy extraction potential from the moonpools at different locations using suitable installed devices credit authorship contribution statement suraj garad experimentation formal analysis validation

camera technique is used to record the ventilated cavitating flow patterns a homogeneous free surface model coupled with filter based turbulence model is used to simulate the time evolution process of the unsteady cavitating flows numerical results show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data the evolution of the ventilated cavity quasi periodic unsteady shedding is well captured and

circumferential positions at the closure region of the cavity moves upstream with different speeds lagrangian coherent structures lcs methods are applied to reveal the influence of re entrant jet on the u type cavity shedding and it shows that there is a close relationship between unsteady behaviors and the re entrant jet flow motion consisting of moving upstream and circumferential in addition the effect of asymmetry on unsteady shedding behaviors of ventilated cavitating flow at different angles of attack have also been investigated combined with lcs methods keywords ventilated cavitating flow unsteady behavior lagrangian coherent structure lcs re entrant jet axisymmetric body 1 introduction ventilated cavitation forms a continuous bubble covering the surface of the object through non condensable gas injection savchenko and savchenko 2012 furness and hutton 1975 stinebring et al 2006 in recent years there is a growing body of literature focus on ventilated cavitation as it can effectively reduce drag and optimize flow fukuda et al 2000 wosnik et al 2003 arndt et al 2009 amromin et al 2006 2011 2011 ceccio 2010 wang et al 2012 yu et al 2015 although wide researches have investigated the ventilation cavitation in the literature for a long time previous studies mainly focused on governing the supercavitation behavior under various conditions kawakami and arndt 2011 karn et al 2016a b shao et al 2017 wu et al 2019 however ventilated partial cavity is frequently observed in the process of achieving supercavitation abraham et al 2003 meanwhile the re entrant jet in the ventilated cavitation wake region would induce the unsteady shedding of cavity which will lead to instability of the transient loads and hydrodynamic instabilities hence it is significance to study the unsteady characteristics of ventilated cavitation and would be a topic worthy of further investigate ausoni et al 2007 zou et al 2013 wang et al 2015 2018a b c liu et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2020 ventilated cavitating flows contain a series of complex flow phenomena such as multiphase flow scales boundary layer separation sudden change in vibration and so on harwood et al 2016 wang et al 2018a b c d therefore there are a series of experimental and numerical studies to improve the understanding of the ventilated cavitating flows containing complex flow structures spurk 2002 conducted an experimental to investigate the cavity shape and gas loss form the results show that there are two different types of gas loss form in the ventilated cavity which is associated with the influence of gravity meanwhile a theory for the gas loss is also put forward in high froude number flows wosnik et al 2003 investigated some aspects of the flow physics about ventilated supercavity in a high speed water tunnel to understand wake ventilation gas interaction they found that the strut shape critically affects air demand through cavity struct wake interaction kawakami and arndt 2011 focused on the various aspects of the flow physics of ventilated supercavity behind a sharp edged disk results regarding that there is a certain relationship between supercavity shape cavity closure ventilation requirements and froude number based on numerical simulation kinzel et al 2009 investigated the boundary layer entrainment model near the closure in details the results show that the volume flow of air entrained by the boundary layer obviously diminishes which is influenced by adverse pressure gradient at the closure region karn et al 2016a applied the experimental technology conducted in a closed wall recirculating water tunnel to investigate the physics of supercavity closure and transition between different closure modes in addition to classical closure modes that have been found several new closure modes that occur under very specific flow conditions also found in the research process recently wang et al 2018c studied ventilated cavitating flow structures via combining large eddy simulation les and piv technique results show that hydrodynamic instability is related to the various kinds of vortices which form develop and interact with each in the wake wu et al 2019 made a detailed analysis of the internal flow of the cavity through piv experimental technology they found that three main features exhibit in the internal flow reverse flow region occurring in the center of the supercavity flow region of high shear extended from the liquid gas interface and ventilation influence region it is found that most studies mainly focused on the pressure distributions the flow velocity the shape of cavity and hydrodynamics coefficients of the stable ventilated cavitation by a brief review of recent works while the researches on the ventilated cavitation unsteady behavior induced by re entrant is rare therefore this paper mainly focuses on the unsteady behaviors of the ventilated cavitation around a three dimensional axisymmetric body the lagrangian coherent structures methods were developed to study the unsteady behavior with flows based on the lagrangian perspective haller 2001 shadden et al 2005 green et al 2007 combined with lcs methods to investigate two different three dimensional flow they found that the lcs can show more visible details and have the ability to define structure boundaries which without relying on a preselected threshold and the need of velocity derivatives tang et al 2012 evaluated the three dimensional unsteady wind field by using lagrangian coherent structures methods the results show that this method can realize the physical objectivity in continuum mechanics hu et al 2015 applied lcs methods to investigate the re entrant jet flow motion of the cavitating flow around an axisymmetric body based on the lagrangian trajectories they found that re entrant flow motions would be the main reason of the u type shedding cavity tseng and liu 2016 separated the dynamically distinct regions by using lagrangian analysis and revealed the underlying flow physics about the mixing process long et al 2018 revealed the influence of u type structures on local flow patterns through lagrangian coherent structures lcss the results show that there is a close relationship between vortex structures and the local flow separation zhang et al 2019 found that the trajectory of lagrangian particles well presents the flow structures of vortex cavitation cavitating vortex street and cloud cavitation there studies shown that the lcs was a powerful method to help identify and add the description of the unsteady behaviors of the multiphase flow the main purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of unsteady behaviors of ventilated cavitating flow around a three dimensional axisymmetric body the main structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 and 3 the experimental setup and the numerical methods are introduced respectively in section 4 the ftle is applied to display the global unsteady flow structures of ventilated cavitation in addition the influence of angle of attack on the transient flow structures is discussed finally the main findings are summarized in section 5 2 experimental setup the experiments were based on the closed loop cavitation tunnel of beijing institute of technology the length of the tunnel is 0 7 m and the cross section is 0 07m 0 19m which with three sides made of plexiglas to observe the flow details in recent years it has used for a serious of ventilated cavitation experiments to provide detailed information of the flow facility wang et al 2015 2018a c liu et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2020 high pressure air is provided by a gas ventilated system that flow rate can up to 800l h in general the upstream pressure and the flow velocity are measured by the vacuometer with 0 25 uncertainty and the electromagnetic flowmeter with 0 5 uncertainty respectively the maximum uncertainty in the gas entrainment coefficient is about 2 the conical axisymmetric body applied in the experiments has the hollow cylindrical structure which is 0 126 m in length i e l and 0 02 m in diameter i e d respectively based on the diameter of the axisymmetric body the blockage ratio is about 19 8 which remains the same at different angles of attack as shown in fig 1 a narrow seam is designed at the nose with the width is 1 mm to inject gas into the flow to systematically investigate the physics of the ventilated cavitation two main flow parameters the froude number fr and the gas entrainment coefficient c q are defined as fr u gd 1 2 and c q q in u d 2 where g is the gravitation acceleration and q in represents the volume flow rate at experimental conditions in order to observe the cavitation patterns the high speed video observation system is applied in the experiments including a high speed camera two light sources and a computer 3 numerical model and method 3 1 numerical method the proposed simulation method is based on a homogeneous free surface model and filter based turbulence model fbm this treatment of numerical model has been validated by a series of previous works wang et al 2015 liu et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the computational model and boundary conditions used in simulations are established according to experimental setup as shown in fig 2 the test body surface and boundaries of the tunnel are treated as a no slip boundary condition a constant turbulent intensity of 2 is set at the inlet boundary of the domain and is equal to the experimentally measured mean turbulent intensity on the inlet

the value of relative error based on richardson extrapolation ji et al 2017 long et al 2019 and experimental results in order to balance calculation accuracy and computation resources the mesh with 1 300 000 elements which the relative errors are less than 1 was chosen eventually 3 2 lagrangian coherent structures lcs the lagrangian coherent structures lcss can be seen as the ridge of the finite time lyapunov exponent ftle which reflect the separation rate of neighborhood trajectories during a finite time haller and yuan 2000 tseng and liu 2016 based on the ftle field the lcss have been proven useful to capture the vortex boundary long et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the lyapunov exponent is defined as 1 œÉ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 1 t ln Œª max Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 where t is the time interval Œª max Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 is the maximum eigenvalue of cauchy green deformation tensor Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 which can be written as 2 Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 œï t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 t œï t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0

ventilated cavitating flow in order to investigate the unsteady behavior of the ventilated cavitating flow fig 3 shows the unsteady cavity shapes with the time evolution in a typical cycle at Œ± 0 for fr 15 66 and c q 0 06 in addition to further illustrate the cavity boundary and the details of flow the isosurface of 10 gas volume fraction and pressure contours on the test body are also given in the simulations it can be seen that the numerical and experimental results are in good agreement as shown in the fig 3 the unsteady cavity shedding process presents quasiperiodic with the time evolution and the reference period is estimated to be about t ref 17 ms in details at the time of t t 0 the cavity is covered by continuous transparent gas region at the front part and by foamy at the tail with the shedding of u type large cloud cavity from t t 0 to t t 0 0 32 t ref the re entrant jet gradually moves upstream to reach the front of the test body it is pushed far away from the test body when meets with the ventilated gas flow resulting to the cavity rolling up with the development of the attached cavity the rolled up cavity moves downstream and sheds at the tail of the attached cavity meanwhile serious of small scale bubble vortices are shedding irregularly at the rear it is noteworthy that from the numerical results of three dimensional view the cavity shapes show obvious asymmetry in the circumferential direction along the test body this is also mentioned by lindau et al 2002 kinzel et al 2007 and hu et al 2015 fig 5 shows the evolution of the predicted pressure coefficient around the axisymmetric body at different locations for the confronted stream surface and the opposing stream surface from the x d 0 75 namely x 0 75d 1 5d 2d 3d 3 25d 3 5d 4d and 4 25d as shown in fig 4 where the pressure coefficient is defined by cp p p 0 5œÅu 2 in general the varying tendency of the pressure coefficient on the test body surface is similar for the sections at x d 0 75 x d 1 5 and x d 2 each section position is always located inside the attached cavity which is less affected by the cavity shedding thus the evolution of pressure coefficients remains the same in addition influenced by the shedding of the small scale cavities at the rear part of the attached cavity the high frequency and small amplitude pressure fluctuations occurred of the section at x d 2 x d 3 x d 3 25 and x d 3 5 while for the section x d 4 and x d 4 25 affected by the periodical shedding of the large scale cloud cavity small frequency and high amplitude variation of the pressure coefficients can be obviously observed in addition it can be seen that the time of the pressure peak for the confronted stream surface and the opposing stream surface because of the shedding of the large scale cloud cavity is different this may relate to three dimensional characteristics in ventilated cavitating flows a more detailed description of the three dimensional characteristics can be found in the section 4 2 with the lagrangian technology in order to further investigate the instability of the ventilated cavitating flow at different angles of attack fig 6 and fig 7 show the process of cavity shedding at Œ± 5 and 8 for fr 15 66 and c q 0 06 respectively due to the quasi periodic of cavity shedding process is not obviously the cavity shedding process with time interval of 5 ms is given here in general the asymmetry of the flow structures would become more obvious between the confronted stream surface and opposing stream surface of the test body with the increasing value of Œ± which have been shown by the experimental observation and numerical results furness and hutton 1975 and chen et al 2015 suggested that the circumferential component of the re entrant flow at the closure region plays an important role in the evolution of cavity shedding due to the asymmetry of the cavity and the three dimensional geometry of the axisymmetric body from the prior studies karn et al 2016a b the pressure inside the cavity stays approximately the same once the continuous transparent cavity is formed thus the adverse pressure gradient remains the same at different angles of attack that is to say the total momentum of the re entrant flow stays the same in addition according to laberteaux and ceccio 2001 it is well known that the re entrant flow caused by the adverse pressure gradient at the closure region semenenko 2001 spurk 2002 savchenko and savchenko 2012 is reflected at the closure line consequently the asymmetry of the cavity strengthens the circumferential momentum but weakens the streamwise momentum finally the re entrant jet moves to gather in opposing stream surface and could not reach the shoulder of the test body as a result the continuous transparent gas region always appears on the shoulder of the body and the opaque region at the rear of the cavity meanwhile the cavity tends to shed in the form of small scale cavity vortex at the rear of the cavity in the opposing stream surface at Œ± 5 as shown in fig 6 this phenomenon would be more obvious when the angle of attack increases to Œ± 8 as shown in fig 7 the continuous transparent gas region is further expanded to cover the whole cavity with only a small opaque region at the tail of the opposing stream surface due to the interaction between the re entrant flow and the cavity serious of small scale cloud cavity are continuously shedding irregularly at the rear end of the cavity fig 8 and fig 9 presents the evolution of the predicted pressure coefficient at Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 respectively as pointed out before with the increasing value of Œ± the continuous transparent gas region always appears in the confronted stream surface consequently the pressure coefficients of the cavity covering positions from x d 0 75 to x d 3 stay relatively stable as shown in fig 8 a while the pressure coefficients corresponding to the bulk flow local pressure at x d 3 25 x d 4 25 present fluctuation this may be due to the shedding of the cavity in the opposing stream surface compared with the pressure coefficient at x d 3 at Œ± 5 in fig 8 a the pressure coefficient at x d 3 at Œ± 8 is consistent with the bulk flow local pressure as shown in fig 9 a this indicates that with the increase of Œ± the length of the cavity in the confronted stream surface continues to reduce to cause the asymmetry of the flow structures becoming more obviously it is worth noted that the pressure coefficients corresponding to the bulk flow local pressure at Œ± 8 remain the same it indicates that the cavitating flow structure in the confronted stream surface is more stable without the effect of the shedding of the cavity in the opposing stream surface while for the opposing stream surface as shown in figs 8 b and fig 9 b it can be clearly seen that small frequency and obviously pressure fluctuation at the rear of the cavity can be observed due to the gather of the re entrant flow and the cavity shedding this also indicates that the flow structure near the rear of the cavity is more complex and more unsteady in addition from the position of the pressure fluctuation as shown x d 3 in fig 8 b and x d 3 5 in fig 9 b the increase of angle of attack makes the re entrant flow to move gradually towards the rear of the cavity to gather in the opposing stream surface moreover the pressure fluctuation amplitude at the rear end of the cavity is lower and the trend of pressure is high frequency pulsation compared with Œ± 5 4 2 detail analysis of the ventilated cavitating flow structures with lagrangian viewpoint in order to investigate the three dimensional characteristics of the transient ventilated cavity shapes fig 11 gives the instantaneous pressure distributions along four different longitudinal lines at Œ± 0 the positions of four lines distributed clockwise are shown in figs 4 and 10 marked with a b c and d separately as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the pressure trends are basically same by comparing the pressure distributions of the different monitoring lines where the main peak p1 is located at the reattachment region and the secondary peak p2 is located inside the attached cavity the axial positions of the main peak p1 are nearly steady though the local cavity is time dependent and that of the secondary peak p2 are moving upstream gradually it is noteworthy that for different longitudinal lines the axial position of p1 is also different at the same time which indicates that the small scale cavity shedding is random at the circumferential position meanwhile the positions of the secondary peak p2 are obviously different in the cavitation region for different monitoring lines with time evolution which may relate to the asymmetric and three dimensional characteristics during the evolution process of the cavity to further explore the flow structures of the unsteady ventilated cavitating flow fig 12 gives the contour of water air volume fraction and ftle contour in a longitudinal section fig 13 gives the schematic view of the re entrant jet movement as pointed out before the period of the cavity shedding for Œ± 0 is estimated to be about 17 ms therefore the integration time t 17 ms is used in the lagrangian coherent structures lcs methods where t represents the period of the cavity shedding it is found that the whole lcs presents elliptical distribution with irregular and complex lcs inside the cavity this indicates that the different flow patterns can be depicted by the lcs besides at the beginning as shown in fig 12 a five groups of particles are axisymmetric in the flow field marked with a b c d and e separately it is noteworthy that during the time of integration the particles gradually move away from their initial positions along different lcs boundaries as shown in fig 12 the particles in group a b and c all move downstream along the water air interface and gradually mixture together at the rear of cavity moreover the distribution of particles gradually changes from a cluster to a band this indicates that the velocity of particles at different radial positions present significant differences the trajectory of the particles in group d and e is more complex moving gradually towards two directions the particles near the surface of body move upstream with the re entrant flow while the particles away from the surface of body move downstream with the main flow due to the obstruction of the particles in group d some particles in group e begin to move away from the surface of body towards the water air interface during the particles moving upstream process this indicates that the re entrant jet is pushed out away from the body to cause the cavity to roll up at t t 0 0 67t ref as shown in fig 12 c the particles in group a b c move to the rear of the cavity and gradually mixture with the particles in group d and e finally at t t 0 0 94t ref as shown in fig 12 d the mixture particles of a b c d and e completely separated from the cavity and completed the large scale cavity shedding process in addition the trajectory of the particles in group e moving downstream indicates that the cavity is shedding in the form of small scale bubble vortices during the cavity evolution process what s more the different trajectories of the particles in top and bottom surface present an asymmetrical flow pattern in the cavitation region to further illustrate the circumferential motion of the ventilated cavitating flow fig 15 shows ftle contours and lagrangian trajectories in three different cross sections which located at x d 1 x d 2 and x d 3 5 respectively as shown in fig 4 at the beginning four groups of monitoring particles a b c and d are arranged as shown in fig 14 and each group of particles is divided into three parts with different colors in the section of x d 1 the lcs identifies two main flow patterns through the shape of a circle as shown in fig 15 a just as the trajectories of particles show a1 b1 c1 and d1 the particles which put inside the lcs have obvious circumferential motion with showing clockwise or counter clockwise rotation while those outside the lcs a3 b3 c3 and d3 follow the main flow it is noteworthy that the particles at the lcs boundary a2 b2 c2 and d2 have both of the above mentioned motions as shown in fig 15 b c for the other sections with the increase of the axial position of the cross section the local lcs becomes more and more fuzzy and disordered which means that more lagrangian trajectories depicting the circumferential motion 4 3 influence of angle of attack on the transient flow structures in order to further investigate the effect of the angle of attack on the three dimensional instability fig 16 and fig 17 show the pressure distributions of different monitoring lines at Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 respectively in general the curves trends of the pressure coefficients at Œ± 5 is similar to those of Œ± 0 as shown in figs 16 and 11 the span of the cavitating region of low pressure for opposing stream surface line a at Œ± 5 remains 4d in length while that of confronted stream surface line c reduces to 3d in length in addition for Œ± 5 the axial positions of the main peak p1 for different monitoring lines are different and that of p2 can t reach the shoulder of body and is closer to the middle of cavity when the angle of attack increases to Œ± 8 as shown in fig 17 the length of the cavity for confronted stream surface reduces further thus the axial positions of the main peak p1 move further forward while the secondary peak p2 is not obviously for the monitoring lines a and b of opposing stream surface the secondary peak p2 can be obviously observed and mainly exists in the rear of the cavity with the time evolution this indicates that the angle of attack changes the motion of the re entrant jet to further analyze the effect of the angle of attack on the re entrant jet figs 18 and 19 show the contour of water air volume fraction and ftle contour in a longitudinal section at Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 respectively fig 20 gives the schematic view of the re entrant jet movement duo to the quasi periodic of cavity shedding process is less than 17 ms for Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 in order to be consistent with the Œ± 0 the integration time t 17 ms is adopted as shown in figs 18 and 20 the particles in group a group b and group c all move toward downstream while for the particles in group d and e at opposing stream surface the particles away from the surface of body still move downstream with the main flow as for the particles near the surface of body move upstream they move upstream away from the body instead of along the surface of body the particles in group d and e at confronted stream surface all move downstream with the main flow this indicates that the re entrant jet moves to gather in the middle position of the opposing stream surface and could not reach the shoulder of the test body with the time evolution some particles in group d and e merge together and separated from the cavity finally which corresponding to small scale cavity shedding process for Œ± 8 as shown in fig 19 the asymmetry of the particles becomes more obvious between the confronted stream surface and opposing stream surface of the body the position of the particles in group d and e which move toward upstream are further near the rear of cavity this indicates that the re entrant jet moves to gather in the rear of the opposing stream surface at Œ± 8 fig 21 and fig 22 show lagrangian trajectories and contours in three different cross sections located at x d 1 x d 2 and x d 3 5 at Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 respectively in the same way in the section of x d 1 the lcs still keeps a circle at Œ± 5 the particles have obvious circumferential motion which put inside the lcs and rotate clockwise or counter clockwise while the others follow the main flow which put outside the lcs meanwhile as the axial position moves towards the rear of the body the local lcs particles becomes more and more fuzzy and disorderly however compared to Œ± 0 as shown in fig 15 the particles in group c and group d show more obviously circumferential motion with the same direction that is to say the particles gradually move to gather towards the opposing stream surface for Œ± 8 as shown in fig 22 the trajectories of particles in group a1 and group b1 show slightly circumferential motion for the section x d 1 while the particles in group c and group d show obviously circumferential motion it is worth noting that the particles gradually move to gather towards the opposing stream surface in the section of x d 2 at Œ± 8 that indicates that the phenomenon of particles gathering towards the opposing stream surface is more significant with the increasing of angle of attack the three dimensional instability of the ventilated cavitating flow become more obvious at the rear of cavity with the increasing of angle of attack 5 conclusions and future work in the present study experimental and numerical studies have been conducted for an axisymmetric body to investigate the three dimensional unsteady behaviors of ventilated cavitating flow at different angles of attack a high speed video camera is used to present the global unsteady flow structures and numerical simulation has been combined with finite time lyapunov exponent ftle and lagrangian coherent structures lcs methods to detail analyze the cavity unsteady mechanism especially the internal flow of ventilated cavity and the movement of the re entrant jet the primary finds include 1 the ventilated cavity unsteady shedding around an axisymmetric body is quasi periodic process including the re entrant jet moving upstream interaction between gas and cavity cavity rolling up and large vortex shedding at the tail of the cavity companied with serious of small scale cavity shedding in addition the re entrant flows move upstream along the circumferential direction at different speeds which may relate to the asymmetric and three dimensional unsteady behaviors in the flows 2 the angle of attack plays an important influence on the ventilated cavitating flow unsteady behaviors with the increase of the angle of attack the length of the cavity in the confronted stream surface continues to reduce to cause the asymmetry of the flow structures becoming more obviously the continuous transparent gas region always appears in the confronted stream surface and water air mixing region gradually gathers towards the opposing stream surface the flow structure near the rear of the cavity becomes more complex and more unsteady resulting in that the quasi periodic unsteady behaviors is not obvious and the three dimensional unsteady behaviors can be obviously observed 3 with lagrangian technology lcss in the ventilated cavitating flow is obtained and utilized to describe the unsteady flow structures and the influence of angle of attack on the re entrant jet the results indicate that the circumferential motion at the closure region of the cavity becomes more obvious than that at the front region because of more complex and more disorderly lcs meanwhile the lagrangian trajectories show that large scale u type shedding cavity is closely related to the re entrant jet flow motion consisting of moving upstream and circumferential with the increase of Œ± the re entrant jet gradually moves upstream towards the opposing stream surface regarding future directions more experimental and numerical researches are required to investigate the flow patterns of the ventilated cavitating over axisymmetric bodies under different c q to further understand the unsteady characteristics in addition further investigation of the blockage effect on the ventilated cavitating flows will be added to improve the understanding of unsteady shedding behaviors of the ventilated cavity credit authorship contribution statement

20444,the objective of this paper is mainly to investigate the ventilated cavitating flow characteristics around an axisymmetric body with a focus on three dimensional unsteady behaviors a high speed camera technique is used to record the ventilated cavitating flow patterns a homogeneous free surface model coupled with filter based turbulence model is used to simulate the time evolution process of the unsteady cavitating flows numerical results show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data the evolution of the ventilated cavity quasi periodic unsteady shedding is well captured and discussed the asymmetric and three dimensional unsteady behaviors are impressive in the ventilated cavitating flow further analysis demonstrates that the re entrant jet which originates from different circumferential positions at the closure region of the cavity moves upstream with different speeds lagrangian coherent structures lcs methods are applied to reveal the influence of re entrant jet on the u type cavity shedding and it shows that there is a close relationship between unsteady behaviors and the re entrant jet flow motion consisting of moving upstream and circumferential in addition the effect of asymmetry on unsteady shedding behaviors of ventilated cavitating flow at different angles of attack have also been investigated combined with lcs methods keywords ventilated cavitating flow unsteady behavior lagrangian coherent structure lcs re entrant jet axisymmetric body 1 introduction ventilated cavitation forms a continuous bubble covering the surface of the object through non condensable gas injection savchenko and savchenko 2012 furness and hutton 1975 stinebring et al 2006 in recent years there is a growing body of literature focus on ventilated cavitation as it can effectively reduce drag and optimize flow fukuda et al 2000 wosnik et al 2003 arndt et al 2009 amromin et al 2006 2011 2011 ceccio 2010 wang et al 2012 yu et al 2015 although wide researches have investigated the ventilation cavitation in the literature for a long time previous studies mainly focused on governing the supercavitation behavior under various conditions kawakami and arndt 2011 karn et al 2016a b shao et al 2017 wu et al 2019 however ventilated partial cavity is frequently observed in the process of achieving supercavitation abraham et al 2003 meanwhile the re entrant jet in the ventilated cavitation wake region would induce the unsteady shedding of cavity which will lead to instability of the transient loads and hydrodynamic instabilities hence it is significance to study the unsteady characteristics of ventilated cavitation and would be a topic worthy of further investigate ausoni et al 2007 zou et al 2013 wang et al 2015 2018a b c liu et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2020 ventilated cavitating flows contain a series of complex flow phenomena such as multiphase flow scales boundary layer separation sudden change in vibration and so on harwood et al 2016 wang et al 2018a b c d therefore there are a series of experimental and numerical studies to improve the understanding of the ventilated cavitating flows containing complex flow structures spurk 2002 conducted an experimental to investigate the cavity shape and gas loss form the results show that there are two different types of gas loss form in the ventilated cavity which is associated with the influence of gravity meanwhile a theory for the gas loss is also put forward in high froude number flows wosnik et al 2003 investigated some aspects of the flow physics about ventilated supercavity in a high speed water tunnel to understand wake ventilation gas interaction they found that the strut shape critically affects air demand through cavity struct wake interaction kawakami and arndt 2011 focused on the various aspects of the flow physics of ventilated supercavity behind a sharp edged disk results regarding that there is a certain relationship between supercavity shape cavity closure ventilation requirements and froude number based on numerical simulation kinzel et al 2009 investigated the boundary layer entrainment model near the closure in details the results show that the volume flow of air entrained by the boundary layer obviously diminishes which is influenced by adverse pressure gradient at the closure region karn et al 2016a applied the experimental technology conducted in a closed wall recirculating water tunnel to investigate the physics of supercavity closure and transition between different closure modes in addition to classical closure modes that have been found several new closure modes that occur under very specific flow conditions also found in the research process recently wang et al 2018c studied ventilated cavitating flow structures via combining large eddy simulation les and piv technique results show that hydrodynamic instability is related to the various kinds of vortices which form develop and interact with each in the wake wu et al 2019 made a detailed analysis of the internal flow of the cavity through piv experimental technology they found that three main features exhibit in the internal flow reverse flow region occurring in the center of the supercavity flow region of high shear extended from the liquid gas interface and ventilation influence region it is found that most studies mainly focused on the pressure distributions the flow velocity the shape of cavity and hydrodynamics coefficients of the stable ventilated cavitation by a brief review of recent works while the researches on the ventilated cavitation unsteady behavior induced by re entrant is rare therefore this paper mainly focuses on the unsteady behaviors of the ventilated cavitation around a three dimensional axisymmetric body the lagrangian coherent structures methods were developed to study the unsteady behavior with flows based on the lagrangian perspective haller 2001 shadden et al 2005 green et al 2007 combined with lcs methods to investigate two different three dimensional flow they found that the lcs can show more visible details and have the ability to define structure boundaries which without relying on a preselected threshold and the need of velocity derivatives tang et al 2012 evaluated the three dimensional unsteady wind field by using lagrangian coherent structures methods the results show that this method can realize the physical objectivity in continuum mechanics hu et al 2015 applied lcs methods to investigate the re entrant jet flow motion of the cavitating flow around an axisymmetric body based on the lagrangian trajectories they found that re entrant flow motions would be the main reason of the u type shedding cavity tseng and liu 2016 separated the dynamically distinct regions by using lagrangian analysis and revealed the underlying flow physics about the mixing process long et al 2018 revealed the influence of u type structures on local flow patterns through lagrangian coherent structures lcss the results show that there is a close relationship between vortex structures and the local flow separation zhang et al 2019 found that the trajectory of lagrangian particles well presents the flow structures of vortex cavitation cavitating vortex street and cloud cavitation there studies shown that the lcs was a powerful method to help identify and add the description of the unsteady behaviors of the multiphase flow the main purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of unsteady behaviors of ventilated cavitating flow around a three dimensional axisymmetric body the main structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 and 3 the experimental setup and the numerical methods are introduced respectively in section 4 the ftle is applied to display the global unsteady flow structures of ventilated cavitation in addition the influence of angle of attack on the transient flow structures is discussed finally the main findings are summarized in section 5 2 experimental setup the experiments were based on the closed loop cavitation tunnel of beijing institute of technology the length of the tunnel is 0 7 m and the cross section is 0 07m 0 19m which with three sides made of plexiglas to observe the flow details in recent years it has used for a serious of ventilated cavitation experiments to provide detailed information of the flow facility wang et al 2015 2018a c liu et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2020 high pressure air is provided by a gas ventilated system that flow rate can up to 800l h in general the upstream pressure and the flow velocity are measured by the vacuometer with 0 25 uncertainty and the electromagnetic flowmeter with 0 5 uncertainty respectively the maximum uncertainty in the gas entrainment coefficient is about 2 the conical axisymmetric body applied in the experiments has the hollow cylindrical structure which is 0 126 m in length i e l and 0 02 m in diameter i e d respectively based on the diameter of the axisymmetric body the blockage ratio is about 19 8 which remains the same at different angles of attack as shown in fig 1 a narrow seam is designed at the nose with the width is 1 mm to inject gas into the flow to systematically investigate the physics of the ventilated cavitation two main flow parameters the froude number fr and the gas entrainment coefficient c q are defined as fr u gd 1 2 and c q q in u d 2 where g is the gravitation acceleration and q in represents the volume flow rate at experimental conditions in order to observe the cavitation patterns the high speed video observation system is applied in the experiments including a high speed camera two light sources and a computer 3 numerical model and method 3 1 numerical method the proposed simulation method is based on a homogeneous free surface model and filter based turbulence model fbm this treatment of numerical model has been validated by a series of previous works wang et al 2015 liu et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the computational model and boundary conditions used in simulations are established according to experimental setup as shown in fig 2 the test body surface and boundaries of the tunnel are treated as a no slip boundary condition a constant turbulent intensity of 2 is set at the inlet boundary of the domain and is equal to the experimentally measured mean turbulent intensity on the inlet boundary of the domain the volume fraction of gas is 0 while the volume fraction of liquid is 1 the inlet boundary of the gas injection is set to bulk mass flow rate on this boundary the volume fraction of gas is 1 while the volume fraction of liquid is 0 the time integration scheme is a second order backward euler algorithm and the spatial derivatives are computed using a second order upwind scheme the time step chosen for the simulation is Œ¥t 5 10 4 s to match the experimental conditions the density of the water at 25 c is œÅ l 998 kg m3 viscosity Œº l œÅ l ŒΩ l 1 139 10 3 pa s and density of the air at 25 c is œÅ g 1 185 kg m3 viscosity Œº g 18 31 10 6 pa s three systematically refined meshed with elements ranged from 650 000 to 1 600 000 which give a constant refinement ratio r n fine n course 1 414 are used where n is the grid nodes number the averaged drag coefficient for the 3d fluid mesh of 650000 920000 1300000 is 0 114 0 125 and 0 127 respectively according to the value of relative error based on richardson extrapolation ji et al 2017 long et al 2019 and experimental results in order to balance calculation accuracy and computation resources the mesh with 1 300 000 elements which the relative errors are less than 1 was chosen eventually 3 2 lagrangian coherent structures lcs the lagrangian coherent structures lcss can be seen as the ridge of the finite time lyapunov exponent ftle which reflect the separation rate of neighborhood trajectories during a finite time haller and yuan 2000 tseng and liu 2016 based on the ftle field the lcss have been proven useful to capture the vortex boundary long et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the lyapunov exponent is defined as 1 œÉ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 1 t ln Œª max Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 where t is the time interval Œª max Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 is the maximum eigenvalue of cauchy green deformation tensor Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 which can be written as 2 Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 œï t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 t œï t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 where Œ¥ t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 is the deformation gradient tensor and œï t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 t means the transpose of œï t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 in a three dimensional flow œï t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 can be written as 3 œï t 0 t x 0 y 0 z 0 d x t d x 0 d x t d y 0 d x t d z 0 d y t d x 0 d y t d y 0 d y t d z 0 d z t d x 0 d z t d y 0 d z t d z 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 global unsteady flow structures of ventilated cavitating flow in order to investigate the unsteady behavior of the ventilated cavitating flow fig 3 shows the unsteady cavity shapes with the time evolution in a typical cycle at Œ± 0 for fr 15 66 and c q 0 06 in addition to further illustrate the cavity boundary and the details of flow the isosurface of 10 gas volume fraction and pressure contours on the test body are also given in the simulations it can be seen that the numerical and experimental results are in good agreement as shown in the fig 3 the unsteady cavity shedding process presents quasiperiodic with the time evolution and the reference period is estimated to be about t ref 17 ms in details at the time of t t 0 the cavity is covered by continuous transparent gas region at the front part and by foamy at the tail with the shedding of u type large cloud cavity from t t 0 to t t 0 0 32 t ref the re entrant jet gradually moves upstream to reach the front of the test body it is pushed far away from the test body when meets with the ventilated gas flow resulting to the cavity rolling up with the development of the attached cavity the rolled up cavity moves downstream and sheds at the tail of the attached cavity meanwhile serious of small scale bubble vortices are shedding irregularly at the rear it is noteworthy that from the numerical results of three dimensional view the cavity shapes show obvious asymmetry in the circumferential direction along the test body this is also mentioned by lindau et al 2002 kinzel et al 2007 and hu et al 2015 fig 5 shows the evolution of the predicted pressure coefficient around the axisymmetric body at different locations for the confronted stream surface and the opposing stream surface from the x d 0 75 namely x 0 75d 1 5d 2d 3d 3 25d 3 5d 4d and 4 25d as shown in fig 4 where the pressure coefficient is defined by cp p p 0 5œÅu 2 in general the varying tendency of the pressure coefficient on the test body surface is similar for the sections at x d 0 75 x d 1 5 and x d 2 each section position is always located inside the attached cavity which is less affected by the cavity shedding thus the evolution of pressure coefficients remains the same in addition influenced by the shedding of the small scale cavities at the rear part of the attached cavity the high frequency and small amplitude pressure fluctuations occurred of the section at x d 2 x d 3 x d 3 25 and x d 3 5 while for the section x d 4 and x d 4 25 affected by the periodical shedding of the large scale cloud cavity small frequency and high amplitude variation of the pressure coefficients can be obviously observed in addition it can be seen that the time of the pressure peak for the confronted stream surface and the opposing stream surface because of the shedding of the large scale cloud cavity is different this may relate to three dimensional characteristics in ventilated cavitating flows a more detailed description of the three dimensional characteristics can be found in the section 4 2 with the lagrangian technology in order to further investigate the instability of the ventilated cavitating flow at different angles of attack fig 6 and fig 7 show the process of cavity shedding at Œ± 5 and 8 for fr 15 66 and c q 0 06 respectively due to the quasi periodic of cavity shedding process is not obviously the cavity shedding process with time interval of 5 ms is given here in general the asymmetry of the flow structures would become more obvious between the confronted stream surface and opposing stream surface of the test body with the increasing value of Œ± which have been shown by the experimental observation and numerical results furness and hutton 1975 and chen et al 2015 suggested that the circumferential component of the re entrant flow at the closure region plays an important role in the evolution of cavity shedding due to the asymmetry of the cavity and the three dimensional geometry of the axisymmetric body from the prior studies karn et al 2016a b the pressure inside the cavity stays approximately the same once the continuous transparent cavity is formed thus the adverse pressure gradient remains the same at different angles of attack that is to say the total momentum of the re entrant flow stays the same in addition according to laberteaux and ceccio 2001 it is well known that the re entrant flow caused by the adverse pressure gradient at the closure region semenenko 2001 spurk 2002 savchenko and savchenko 2012 is reflected at the closure line consequently the asymmetry of the cavity strengthens the circumferential momentum but weakens the streamwise momentum finally the re entrant jet moves to gather in opposing stream surface and could not reach the shoulder of the test body as a result the continuous transparent gas region always appears on the shoulder of the body and the opaque region at the rear of the cavity meanwhile the cavity tends to shed in the form of small scale cavity vortex at the rear of the cavity in the opposing stream surface at Œ± 5 as shown in fig 6 this phenomenon would be more obvious when the angle of attack increases to Œ± 8 as shown in fig 7 the continuous transparent gas region is further expanded to cover the whole cavity with only a small opaque region at the tail of the opposing stream surface due to the interaction between the re entrant flow and the cavity serious of small scale cloud cavity are continuously shedding irregularly at the rear end of the cavity fig 8 and fig 9 presents the evolution of the predicted pressure coefficient at Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 respectively as pointed out before with the increasing value of Œ± the continuous transparent gas region always appears in the confronted stream surface consequently the pressure coefficients of the cavity covering positions from x d 0 75 to x d 3 stay relatively stable as shown in fig 8 a while the pressure coefficients corresponding to the bulk flow local pressure at x d 3 25 x d 4 25 present fluctuation this may be due to the shedding of the cavity in the opposing stream surface compared with the pressure coefficient at x d 3 at Œ± 5 in fig 8 a the pressure coefficient at x d 3 at Œ± 8 is consistent with the bulk flow local pressure as shown in fig 9 a this indicates that with the increase of Œ± the length of the cavity in the confronted stream surface continues to reduce to cause the asymmetry of the flow structures becoming more obviously it is worth noted that the pressure coefficients corresponding to the bulk flow local pressure at Œ± 8 remain the same it indicates that the cavitating flow structure in the confronted stream surface is more stable without the effect of the shedding of the cavity in the opposing stream surface while for the opposing stream surface as shown in figs 8 b and fig 9 b it can be clearly seen that small frequency and obviously pressure fluctuation at the rear of the cavity can be observed due to the gather of the re entrant flow and the cavity shedding this also indicates that the flow structure near the rear of the cavity is more complex and more unsteady in addition from the position of the pressure fluctuation as shown x d 3 in fig 8 b and x d 3 5 in fig 9 b the increase of angle of attack makes the re entrant flow to move gradually towards the rear of the cavity to gather in the opposing stream surface moreover the pressure fluctuation amplitude at the rear end of the cavity is lower and the trend of pressure is high frequency pulsation compared with Œ± 5 4 2 detail analysis of the ventilated cavitating flow structures with lagrangian viewpoint in order to investigate the three dimensional characteristics of the transient ventilated cavity shapes fig 11 gives the instantaneous pressure distributions along four different longitudinal lines at Œ± 0 the positions of four lines distributed clockwise are shown in figs 4 and 10 marked with a b c and d separately as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the pressure trends are basically same by comparing the pressure distributions of the different monitoring lines where the main peak p1 is located at the reattachment region and the secondary peak p2 is located inside the attached cavity the axial positions of the main peak p1 are nearly steady though the local cavity is time dependent and that of the secondary peak p2 are moving upstream gradually it is noteworthy that for different longitudinal lines the axial position of p1 is also different at the same time which indicates that the small scale cavity shedding is random at the circumferential position meanwhile the positions of the secondary peak p2 are obviously different in the cavitation region for different monitoring lines with time evolution which may relate to the asymmetric and three dimensional characteristics during the evolution process of the cavity to further explore the flow structures of the unsteady ventilated cavitating flow fig 12 gives the contour of water air volume fraction and ftle contour in a longitudinal section fig 13 gives the schematic view of the re entrant jet movement as pointed out before the period of the cavity shedding for Œ± 0 is estimated to be about 17 ms therefore the integration time t 17 ms is used in the lagrangian coherent structures lcs methods where t represents the period of the cavity shedding it is found that the whole lcs presents elliptical distribution with irregular and complex lcs inside the cavity this indicates that the different flow patterns can be depicted by the lcs besides at the beginning as shown in fig 12 a five groups of particles are axisymmetric in the flow field marked with a b c d and e separately it is noteworthy that during the time of integration the particles gradually move away from their initial positions along different lcs boundaries as shown in fig 12 the particles in group a b and c all move downstream along the water air interface and gradually mixture together at the rear of cavity moreover the distribution of particles gradually changes from a cluster to a band this indicates that the velocity of particles at different radial positions present significant differences the trajectory of the particles in group d and e is more complex moving gradually towards two directions the particles near the surface of body move upstream with the re entrant flow while the particles away from the surface of body move downstream with the main flow due to the obstruction of the particles in group d some particles in group e begin to move away from the surface of body towards the water air interface during the particles moving upstream process this indicates that the re entrant jet is pushed out away from the body to cause the cavity to roll up at t t 0 0 67t ref as shown in fig 12 c the particles in group a b c move to the rear of the cavity and gradually mixture with the particles in group d and e finally at t t 0 0 94t ref as shown in fig 12 d the mixture particles of a b c d and e completely separated from the cavity and completed the large scale cavity shedding process in addition the trajectory of the particles in group e moving downstream indicates that the cavity is shedding in the form of small scale bubble vortices during the cavity evolution process what s more the different trajectories of the particles in top and bottom surface present an asymmetrical flow pattern in the cavitation region to further illustrate the circumferential motion of the ventilated cavitating flow fig 15 shows ftle contours and lagrangian trajectories in three different cross sections which located at x d 1 x d 2 and x d 3 5 respectively as shown in fig 4 at the beginning four groups of monitoring particles a b c and d are arranged as shown in fig 14 and each group of particles is divided into three parts with different colors in the section of x d 1 the lcs identifies two main flow patterns through the shape of a circle as shown in fig 15 a just as the trajectories of particles show a1 b1 c1 and d1 the particles which put inside the lcs have obvious circumferential motion with showing clockwise or counter clockwise rotation while those outside the lcs a3 b3 c3 and d3 follow the main flow it is noteworthy that the particles at the lcs boundary a2 b2 c2 and d2 have both of the above mentioned motions as shown in fig 15 b c for the other sections with the increase of the axial position of the cross section the local lcs becomes more and more fuzzy and disordered which means that more lagrangian trajectories depicting the circumferential motion 4 3 influence of angle of attack on the transient flow structures in order to further investigate the effect of the angle of attack on the three dimensional instability fig 16 and fig 17 show the pressure distributions of different monitoring lines at Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 respectively in general the curves trends of the pressure coefficients at Œ± 5 is similar to those of Œ± 0 as shown in figs 16 and 11 the span of the cavitating region of low pressure for opposing stream surface line a at Œ± 5 remains 4d in length while that of confronted stream surface line c reduces to 3d in length in addition for Œ± 5 the axial positions of the main peak p1 for different monitoring lines are different and that of p2 can t reach the shoulder of body and is closer to the middle of cavity when the angle of attack increases to Œ± 8 as shown in fig 17 the length of the cavity for confronted stream surface reduces further thus the axial positions of the main peak p1 move further forward while the secondary peak p2 is not obviously for the monitoring lines a and b of opposing stream surface the secondary peak p2 can be obviously observed and mainly exists in the rear of the cavity with the time evolution this indicates that the angle of attack changes the motion of the re entrant jet to further analyze the effect of the angle of attack on the re entrant jet figs 18 and 19 show the contour of water air volume fraction and ftle contour in a longitudinal section at Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 respectively fig 20 gives the schematic view of the re entrant jet movement duo to the quasi periodic of cavity shedding process is less than 17 ms for Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 in order to be consistent with the Œ± 0 the integration time t 17 ms is adopted as shown in figs 18 and 20 the particles in group a group b and group c all move toward downstream while for the particles in group d and e at opposing stream surface the particles away from the surface of body still move downstream with the main flow as for the particles near the surface of body move upstream they move upstream away from the body instead of along the surface of body the particles in group d and e at confronted stream surface all move downstream with the main flow this indicates that the re entrant jet moves to gather in the middle position of the opposing stream surface and could not reach the shoulder of the test body with the time evolution some particles in group d and e merge together and separated from the cavity finally which corresponding to small scale cavity shedding process for Œ± 8 as shown in fig 19 the asymmetry of the particles becomes more obvious between the confronted stream surface and opposing stream surface of the body the position of the particles in group d and e which move toward upstream are further near the rear of cavity this indicates that the re entrant jet moves to gather in the rear of the opposing stream surface at Œ± 8 fig 21 and fig 22 show lagrangian trajectories and contours in three different cross sections located at x d 1 x d 2 and x d 3 5 at Œ± 5 and Œ± 8 respectively in the same way in the section of x d 1 the lcs still keeps a circle at Œ± 5 the particles have obvious circumferential motion which put inside the lcs and rotate clockwise or counter clockwise while the others follow the main flow which put outside the lcs meanwhile as the axial position moves towards the rear of the body the local lcs particles becomes more and more fuzzy and disorderly however compared to Œ± 0 as shown in fig 15 the particles in group c and group d show more obviously circumferential motion with the same direction that is to say the particles gradually move to gather towards the opposing stream surface for Œ± 8 as shown in fig 22 the trajectories of particles in group a1 and group b1 show slightly circumferential motion for the section x d 1 while the particles in group c and group d show obviously circumferential motion it is worth noting that the particles gradually move to gather towards the opposing stream surface in the section of x d 2 at Œ± 8 that indicates that the phenomenon of particles gathering towards the opposing stream surface is more significant with the increasing of angle of attack the three dimensional instability of the ventilated cavitating flow become more obvious at the rear of cavity with the increasing of angle of attack 5 conclusions and future work in the present study experimental and numerical studies have been conducted for an axisymmetric body to investigate the three dimensional unsteady behaviors of ventilated cavitating flow at different angles of attack a high speed video camera is used to present the global unsteady flow structures and numerical simulation has been combined with finite time lyapunov exponent ftle and lagrangian coherent structures lcs methods to detail analyze the cavity unsteady mechanism especially the internal flow of ventilated cavity and the movement of the re entrant jet the primary finds include 1 the ventilated cavity unsteady shedding around an axisymmetric body is quasi periodic process including the re entrant jet moving upstream interaction between gas and cavity cavity rolling up and large vortex shedding at the tail of the cavity companied with serious of small scale cavity shedding in addition the re entrant flows move upstream along the circumferential direction at different speeds which may relate to the asymmetric and three dimensional unsteady behaviors in the flows 2 the angle of attack plays an important influence on the ventilated cavitating flow unsteady behaviors with the increase of the angle of attack the length of the cavity in the confronted stream surface continues to reduce to cause the asymmetry of the flow structures becoming more obviously the continuous transparent gas region always appears in the confronted stream surface and water air mixing region gradually gathers towards the opposing stream surface the flow structure near the rear of the cavity becomes more complex and more unsteady resulting in that the quasi periodic unsteady behaviors is not obvious and the three dimensional unsteady behaviors can be obviously observed 3 with lagrangian technology lcss in the ventilated cavitating flow is obtained and utilized to describe the unsteady flow structures and the influence of angle of attack on the re entrant jet the results indicate that the circumferential motion at the closure region of the cavity becomes more obvious than that at the front region because of more complex and more disorderly lcs meanwhile the lagrangian trajectories show that large scale u type shedding cavity is closely related to the re entrant jet flow motion consisting of moving upstream and circumferential with the increase of Œ± the re entrant jet gradually moves upstream towards the opposing stream surface regarding future directions more experimental and numerical researches are required to investigate the flow patterns of the ventilated cavitating over axisymmetric bodies under different c q to further understand the unsteady characteristics in addition further investigation of the blockage effect on the ventilated cavitating flows will be added to improve the understanding of unsteady shedding behaviors of the ventilated cavity credit authorship contribution statement
