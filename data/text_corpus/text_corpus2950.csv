14750,the development of magnetic adsorbents with high capacity to capture heavy metals has been the subject of intense research but the process usually involves costive synthesis steps here we propose a green approach to obtaining a magnetic biohybrid through in situ grown anaerobic granular sludge ags with the help of magnetite constituting a promising adsorbent for sequestration and immobilization of pb in aqueous solutions and soils the resultant magnetite embedded ags m ags was not only capable of promoting methane production but also conducive to pb adsorption because of the large surface area and abundant function groups the uptake of pb on m ags followed the pseudo second order having a maximum adsorption capacity of 197 8 mg gds 1 at ph 5 0 larger than 159 7 170 3 and 178 1 mg gds 1 in relation to ags f ags ferrihydrite mediated and h ags hematite mediated respectively mechanistic investigations showed that pb binding to m ags proceeds via surface complexation mineral precipitation and lattice replacement which promotes heavy metal capture and stabilization this was evident from the increased proportion of structural pb sequestrated from the aqueous solution and the enhanced percentage of the residual fraction of pb extracted from the contaminated soils graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heavy metal stabilization iron based remediation material anaerobic granular sludge magnetic adsorbent pb pollution field remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metal contamination in aquatic environments and soils is a worldwide concern for ecosystems and human health which has stimulated considerable interest in developing effective and environmentally friendly solutions for removing or separating heavy metals from polluted media barakat 2011 qin et al 2021 owing to its high efficiency simple operation good reproducibility and flexible design adsorption is considered an economical and effective strategy to achieve high adsorption performance plenty of functional materials with high surface area abundant chemical groups and low cost have been exploited as adsorbents in previous reports bhateria et al 2019 bilal et al 2021 dave et al 2014 among them magnetic adsorbents stand out as promising materials for heavy metal uptake thanks to the benefits of rapid separation and recovery by an external magnetic field feng et al 2020 increasing attention has been paid to using magnetite fe3o4 for sequestrating toxic metals because of its super magnetism biocompatibility and existence as natural minerals on earth karami 2013 namdeo 2018 further studies have been conducted to increase the adsorption capacity of magnetite through functionalized modification on the surface for example the hydroxyl amino carboxyl and carbonyl groups were introduced to aid in metal chelation li et al 2022b mahdavian et al 2010 shi et al 2015 despite their advances magnetite organic composites might suffer from the problem of complexity in preparation which involves extensive energy and chemical consumption al khateeb et al 2022 this aroused our interest in synthesizing magnetite based adsorbents in a green and sustainable fashion inspired by the natural phenomenon in which the combination of fe minerals and biological materials in environments results in a biohybrid composite with a high degree affinity for heavy metals cui et al 2022 wang et al 2014 zhang and wang 2020 we intend to prepare magnetite embedded anaerobic granular sludge ags which emerges as a promising solution for heavy metal capture indeed ags was regarded as an excellent biosorbent material due to its superior adsorption efficiency dense and firm microbial structure high biomass concentration good settling capacity and the ability to withstand shock loading hawari and mulligan 2006 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 wang et al 2018a moreover the utilization of conductive magnetite for ags formation and accordingly facilitating anaerobic digestion for wastewater treatment and harnessing methane has been documented recently baek et al 2017 cruz viggi et al 2014 kim et al 2022 direct interspecies electron transfer diet an essential pathway in promoting the anaerobic digestion process represents a syntrophic metabolism among microorganisms in which electrons are transferred from one microbial cell to another via electrically conductive pili cytochromes and conductive materials without the participation of reduced electron carriers such as h2 and other redox mediators gahlot et al 2020 wang et al 2021 it has been demonstrated that magnetite can accelerate diet in ags and thus promote solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and or methanogenesis processes which in turn enriches diverse microorganisms with improved enzymatic activity luo et al 2022 wang et al 2018b the ags is mostly composed of extracellular polymers and microbial cells that inherently contain a variety of functional groups favorable for metal attachment in general the ags is a waste product that must be treated safely and disposed of the comprehensive utilization of ags as a resource conforms to sustainable development principles the creation of magnetite embedded ags m ags is thus not only conducive to methane generation from wastewater but it also represents a desirable alternative among other sludge disposal technologies since it can potentially function as a promising magnetic adsorbent for heavy metals in contaminated aquatic environments and soils taking lead pb one of the most toxic and non biodegradable heavy metals frequently detected in environments as an example our central aim is to demonstrate the efficacy of m ags for the sequestration and immobilization of pb from water and soil the m ags composite was prepared in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with the incorporation of magnetite during the methanogenic degradation of organic matter the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of pb on magnetic ags were evaluated for comparison ferrihydrite and hematite were also used to promote ags growth and anaerobic methane generation and the resultant ags materials for pb adsorption and stabilization were investigated moreover pb binding mechanisms were elucidated through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray diffraction spectra xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray absorption spectroscopy xas techniques the findings acquired have the potential to provide an economically viable strategy for reutilizing ags as a heavy metal stabilizing material including the future operation of anaerobic wastewater treatment in a sustainable manner 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic cultivation of fe oxide embedded agss lab scale uasb reactors 37 cm in height and 14 cm in diameter with a working volume of 2 l were operated to cultivate agss the reactors made of plexiglas were placed in a thermostatic incubator at 30 c under anaerobic conditions the initial 500 ml of ags liboyuan co ltd shandong china was used as the seed sludge added to the four reactors one reactor without the addition of fe minerals as a control and three reactors respectively fed with 500 mg l 1 ferrihydrite hematite and magnetite the initial ags was produced from the anaerobic digestion of fresh waste leachate with an organic loading rate of 7 kg cod m 3 day 3 in a uasb reactor made of stainless steel coated with an anticorrosive material with an internal diameter of 2 m and a height of 8 m working volume 25 m3 all the fe oxides were lab prepared according to the procedures described previously schwertmann et al 1989 the xrd patterns in fig s1 show their typical crystalline structures and confirm successful synthesis the synthetic wastewater was composed of 3000 mg l 1 glucose that was the most extensively substrate for the ags

composition of the trace element solution was mg l 1 cucl2 30 zncl2 50 mnso4 1100 and cocl2 600 after 15 days of inoculation the agss were immediately washed three times using deionized water avoiding the influence of the surface soluble ions on the experiments the agss were then frozen in the refrigerator 18 c for 6 h and dried in the vacuum lyophilizer for 24 h prior to further use in the adsorption tests the dried m ags maintained the granular morphology as shown in fig s2 the aggregate gas samples were collected in a 1 l foil gas bag during the 15 day inoculation period the biogas production was assessed twice a week by determining the gas volume in the gas bag with a 500 ml syringe the methane content was measured using gas chromatography gc shimadzu 2014c japan equipped with a gdx 104 column and a thermal conductivity detector the injector oven and detector temperatures were controlled at 150 100 and 160 c respectively helium gas with a 99 999 purity was used as the carrier gas in the system the wet ags samples collected directly from the uasb reactors were used for genomic dna extraction and microbial community analysis for each sample the integrity of the dna was examined by electrophoresis on 1 0 agarose gels and the pcr products were quantified paired end sequencing was conducted using the high throughput sequencing platform miseq illumina usa sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 similarity level using the uparse method 2 2 batch experiments for pb adsorption onto agss in an aqueous solution the adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mg dry weight of materials and 200 ml of pb solution 120 mg l 1 the initial ph value was set to 5 0 using 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 and 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solutions samples were collected at specified time intervals and passed through a 0 22 Î¼m polycarbonate filter the filtered liquids were subjected to chemical analysis of the aqueous pb concentration which was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas optima 5300 dv san diego usa after reaching adsorption equilibrium the remaining solids were dried in a vacuum lyophilizer for 24 h for subsequent characterizations for the adsorption isotherm experiments agss with a dry weight of 40 mg were added to the 80 ml solution with the initial pb concentrations varying from 20 to 120 mg l 1 the erlenmeyer bottles were placed in a 30 c thermostatic shaker at 150 rpm for 6 h to ensure equilibrium the supernatant of each solution was filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m polycarbonate filter and the residual pb concentration in the solution was determined the effect of the initial ph on the adsorption performance was investigated in the same reactor containing 40 mg ags and 100 mg l 1 pb in a ph range between 2 0 and 5 0 note that the ph value beyond 5 0 easily caused precipitation of pb oh 2 the adsorbed and structural pb concentrations were quantified based on procedures described previously frierdich et al 2015 briefly pb containing agss measuring 200 mg was mixed with 10 ml of 0 4 mol l 1 hcl and the mixture was placed in a centrifuge tube and reacted in a rotary oscillator for 0 5 h the supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min and the content of dissolved pb was measured as the adsorbed pb the difference in the adsorbed pb concentration and the total content of pb in the agss was denoted as the structural one all the above experiments were performed in triplicate and average data values were reported for calculations the removal

the bet surface area total volume of pores and average diameter of pores in the agss the dried materials were also powdered using a mortar pestle and characterized with various instrumental techniques as elaborated below the surface charge of the samples was recorded by measuring the zeta potential using a potential analyzer nanobrook 90 plus zeta brookhaven instrument co ltd usa xrd patterns were

all samples were measured by fluorescence modes and a lyter type fluorescence ionization chamber was used as a detector the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra of fe k edge and pb l edge were collected from the samples the obtained xas data was processed in athena version 0 9 26 for background pre edge line and post edge line calibrations then fourier transformed fitting was carried out in artemis version 0 9 26 ravel et al 2005 the magnetic properties of samples were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm lake shore 7404 columbus oh usa with a magnetic field strength of 20 koe at room temperature 25 c the electrical conductivity data were acquired on an st2722 sd powder resistivity testing instrument suzhou lattice electronics co ltd suzhou china with an st2255 test module the fe mineral powders were pressurized to different heights and then the resistivity of the cylindrical sample was measured using the four point probe method the mÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy was employed to characterize the occupied states of fe in m ags it was performed on a spectrometer wss 10 wissel gmbh germany equipped with a closed loop cryostat shi 850 janis research co usa the sample was collected on a 0 22 Î¼m nitrocellulose filter membrane and sealed between two pieces of kapton tape with copper rings after drying in an anaerobic box the mÃ¶ssbauer spectra of m ags were taken at room temperature in the range of 10 to 10 mm s 1 the experimental data was calibrated with Î± fe0 foil and fitted using mosswinn official software version 4 0 pre 2 4 tests on the utilization of agss for immobilization of pb in contaminated soils more efforts were made to investigate the efficacy of m ags for the sequestration and immobilization of pb from the contaminated soil the soil samples used in this experiment were collected from an electroplating plant n25 12 34 e109 24 3 liuzhou guangxi china all samples were placed in polyethylene bags and brought to the laboratory and then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c after removing the stones and coarse debris the air dried soils were grounded in an 80 mesh nylon sieve for further chemical analysis and experiments the stabilizing experiments were set up in a 100 ml centrifuge tube in which the soil 50 g sample and agss existing at a ratio of 5 w w dry weight of ags to soil were added water was amended to maintain the soil moisture at a 1 1 v v water soil ratio during the whole process all test samples were placed in the shaker at 25 c for 28 days all treatments were replicated three times samples were taken every week to analyze the distribution of pb fractions and the leaching toxicity of soil samples for analysis the soil was digested with an hcl hno3 hclo4 hf mixed solution 10 9 3 1 v v and the total concentrations of heavy metals in the soil were quantified using aas blank controls and standard reference materials gbw07390 gss 34 were included in each batch of digestion a chinese leaching procedure hj 299 ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2007 was conducted to determine the leached metalloid concentrations from soil samples and the sulfuric acid and nitric acid mixture liquid v v ratio of 2 1 was used as the leaching solution diluted in 1 l of water with a ph value of 3 2 table s1 lists the total and acid extracted concentrations of the main heavy metals in the contaminated soils it is evident that pb was the predominant pollutant with a total content of 1744 4 mg kg 1 and a leaching content of 0 68 mg l 1 exceeding the standard of soil environmental quality in china gb 36600 2018 type i site control value and the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 type iv limit value respectively the sequential extraction approach of the european community bureau of reference bcr was applied to distinguish exchangeable f1 reducible f2 oxidizable f3 and residual f4 fractions of pb in soils the sequential extraction procedure was conducted step by step as depicted in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of fe oxide embedded agss regarding methane generation capacity microbial community and physicochemical properties three different fe minerals including ferrihydrite hematite and magnetite were selected as the substrate to support the growth of agss for methane generation and the resultant solid was named f ags h ags and m ags respectively it is notable from fig 1 a that the incorporation of fe oxides in agss had a positive effect on methane production from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in accordance with previous results tang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 ye et al 2018 this finding might be explained by the facts that i the fe oxides introduced into ags function as conducive materials which facilitate cell to cell connection increase the electrical capacitance of extracellular polymeric substance eps and thereby promote diet from acidogens to methanogens li et al 2022a wang et al 2018b ii the fe oxides can establish intercellular connections between microorganisms and organic matter through adsorption netting or bridging then forming a magnetite ags co substrate which can facilitate interspecies material exchange and energy transfer between microorganisms cui et al 2022 and iii the fe oxides are able to act as counter ions binding to the negative charged eps in agss and thus enhancing the metabolic activity of microorganisms for anaerobic digestion zhang et al 2022 among all the investigated cases the m ags exhibited the best capacity for methane generation which should be attributed to its higher electrical conductivity 0 004 3 600 and 113 900 Î¼s cm 1 for ferrihydrite hematite and magnetite respectively the differentiation in methane generation performance was manifested by the distinct change in the microbial community between the four reactors as revealed in fig 1b in particular a sequence assigned to trichococcus belonging to firmicutes was apparently enriched in h ags and m ags but not in f ags more importantly the m ags revealed a profound enhancement in the abundance of trichococcus groups of trichococcus have been reported as fermentative bacteria that can use various organics including acetate formate ethanol glucose and aromatic compounds for anaerobic methane generation ma et al 2021 a previous study tang et al 2021 utilizing methanogenic sludge for the treatment of dairy wastes also demonstrated that fe iii oxides hematite and magnetite could specially cultivate trichococcus species which is considered an electroactive fe reducing bacterium accelerating diet with methanothrix species in syntrophic degradation of complex organic compounds however the ability of trichococcus to achieve extracellular electron transport has not been reported and deserves future exploration which is beyond the scope of the current study chemical analysis of the fe uptake rate and the proportion of fe in the resultant agss was performed fig s3a shows that the fe uptake rate was in the order of m ags h ags f ags ags the m ags achieved a maximum fe load of 124 0 mg gds 1 after 15 days exceeding the values of 33 6 92 1 and 94 9 mg gds 1 in relation to ags f ags and h ags respectively fig s3b this indicates that magnetite was more inclined to be incorporated into ags possibly due to its competitive ability to substitute metallic counter ions e g ca mg and al ajao et al 2020 sudmalis et al 2020 it is further shown that more than 90 of fe was bound with the microbial cells suggesting that the majority of fe minerals were loaded into the inner part rather than the outer part e g eps of ags these findings support the view of the engagement of fe minerals particularly magnetite in promoting cell to cell electron transfer cruz viggi et al 2014 kang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 fig s4 presents the zeta potentials of the agss the values associated with the fe mineral involved agss shifted positively compared to that of the unmodified ags suggesting the enhanced electrostatic interaction between fe oxides and the ags because of stronger binding the m ags processed a higher zeta potential of 2 33 which indicates negatively charged surfaces available for cationic heavy metal adsorption at ph beyond this value comparisons of the magnetic properties between different samples are depicted in fig 1c which depicts the magnetization hysteresis curves of four materials with the field sweeping from 20 000 to 20 000 oe it was found that the m ags exhibited an excellent magnetic feature with a saturation magnetization of 13 3 emu g 1 the reversible hysteresis curve with almost zero retentivity and coercivity confirmed the superparamagnetic nature of m ags fig 1d shows the room temperature mÃ¶ssbauer spectra of m ags and the hyperfine parameters for data fitting are given in table s3 in general the spectra of m ags contained a zeeman sextet with broadened resonance lines characteristic of fe3o4 and a quadrupole doublet characteristic of the superparamagnetic state of fe2 and fe3 zheltova et al 2020 the asymmetric shape and the broadening of the spectral lines are likely induced by the presence of regions of disorder in the structure the mÃ¶ssbauer spectra could be deconvoluted into two sub sextets one corresponding to feiii in the tetrahedral a site 37 90 of magnetite and the other relevant to feii and feiii in the octahedral b site 45 48 of magnetite and one doublet associated with superparamagnetic phase 16 62 the magnitude of the hyperfine magnetic field for the m ags sample was equal to 49 0 0 1 t which validates the magnetic properties of m ags si et al 2004 daou et al 2006 this feature made it a promising magnetic adsorption material beneficial for separating and recovering targeted contaminants in either the aqueous phase or soil outer picture of fig 1d the specific surface area was evaluated using the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the bet tests table s4 shows that the m ags was featured with a larger surface area a higher mesoporous pore volume and a smaller particle size than its counterparts indicating its advantages for metal attachment for example the surface area of m ags h ags f ags and ags was 10 96 6 89 1 11 and 0 25 m2 g 1 respectively the sem observations accorded well with the variations in the specific surface area as illustrated in fig 2 the control ags sample was densely packed and the introduction of fe minerals induced the granule to become loose a more distinct difference was disclosed in the interior of ags in comparison to the stacked structure of ags the fe mineral embedded agss particularly m ags were enriched with filamentous bacteria and had porous structures this morphology should be favorable to the affinity of heavy metals 3 2 m ags for sequestration and stabilization of pb in aqueous solution the kinetics of pb adsorption on agss were performed and compared between different samples by contacting 120 mg l 1 pb at ph 5 0 it should be noted from fig s5 that the maximum adsorption amount was attained at this ph value for all the cases the dosage of m ags was set at 0 5 g l 1 where the capacity of pb adsorption reached a maximum value fig s6 the dry sludge was used for the adsorption tests as the maximum adsorption capacity of dry sludge was about 5 18 higher than that of wet sludge fig s7 this might be because the dry sludge had a larger surface area and provided more surface active sites for adsorption wei et al 2008 the time course aqueous pb concentration for all cases was recorded in fig 3 a which clearly indicated the difference in the percentage of pb removal between different treatments the m ags enabled a removal efficiency of 84 6 after a 1440 min operation which was larger than the removal efficiency of 76 2 72 9 and 68 3 in relation to h ags f ags and ags respectively fig 3b shows that the adsorption capacity for all cases enhanced rapidly during the first 100 min followed by a gradual increase from 100 to 400 min and reaching equilibrium after 400 min this adsorption behavior has been frequently reported with respect to a variety of adsorbents for pb uptake basu et al 2017 ling et al 2017 liu et al 2020 naushad et al 2021 the fast adsorption during the initial stage was due to the presence of abundant adsorption sites on the adsorbent the initial metal concentration gradient provided an important driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance between the aqueous and adsorbent which is also responsible for this phenomenon the m ags outperformed the other materials in terms of higher equilibrium adsorption capacity 197 8 mg gds 1 than ags 159 7 mg gds 1 f ags 170 3 mg gds 1 and h ags 178 1 mg gds 1 moreover the adsorption of pb on agss was fitted with the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle models fig s8 and the kinetic parameters and correlation coefficients are listed in table s5 it is apparent that the pseudo second order kinetic model was more appropriate for predicating the adsorption of pb because of the higher correlation coefficient the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacities based on the pseudo second order model agreed well with the experimental values this suggests that the rate limiting step in this adsorption process could be chemisorption esrafili et al 2021 shi et al 2015 the adsorption isotherms were obtained by varying the initial pb concentrations from 20 to 120 mg l 1 at ph 5 0 fig 3c shows that the adsorption capacities of pb on agss increased with increasing pb content and reached equilibrium at a particular value due to the lack of available sites for adsorbing metal ions the adsorption data were fitted by the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models fig s9 and the fitting parameters are given in table s6 the data were more reasonably fitted with the langmuir model indicating that the monolayer adsorption on agss dominates the process esrafili et al 2021 liu et al 2020 according to the fitting results the m ags exhibited superior capability for pb adsorption evident from its distinctly higher maximum adsorption capacity 200 0 mg gds 1 than the others ags 171 9 mg gds 1 f ags 174 6 mg gds 1 and h ags 180 3 mg gds 1 it is generally accepted that the adsorption of heavy metals by weak bonding e g ion exchange and electrostatic attraction is vulnerable to potential risk of their re release upon changes in environmental factors such as ph value and coexisting ions caporale et al 2015 and that strong bonding via adsorption mineralization coordination complexation and structural embedding allows the adsorbed heavy metals to be less influenced by the environment and have lower mobility ma et al 2022 therefore an analysis of the distribution of adsorbed and structural pb in the solid phases of the different samples was performed according to previous procedures frierdich et al 2015 an interesting observation from fig 3d is that the involvement of fe minerals inside agss appreciably improved the proportion of pb incorporated into the structure of the sorbents in particular the m ags enabled more amounts of pb firmly attached likely because of the formation of insoluble precipitates and the incorporation of pb inside the fe oxide lattice which are more stable in the environment and difficult to extract by weak acids this point will be discussed in later sections it should be noted that the absence of agss contributed to a small proportion of pb removal fig s10a shows that limited amounts of pb were removed from the aqueous phase by pure minerals e g 8 1 for ferrihydrite 13 5 for hematite and 17 6 for magnetite after 1400 min of operation fig s10b and s10c indicate that the maximum adsorption capacities of ferrihydrite hematite and magnetite for pb uptake were 19 1 31 5 and 36 3 mg gds 1 at ph 5 0 respectively which were much lower than the values obtained with the corresponding materials in the presence of ags moreover the majority of adsorbed pb on the minerals was in the loosely attached form as illustrated in fig s10d these findings confirm the importance of the combined effects of agss and fe minerals on the capture of pb 3 3 mechanisms of pb adsorption on m ags and explanations of the enhanced adsorption capacity and strong bonding the adsorption mechanisms were elucidated by conducting a series of physiochemical characterizations to reveal the differences in the relevant signals between the agss before and after pb uptake fig 4 a shows the ftir spectra of m agss in the presence and absence of pb the broad and intense band located at 3373 cm 1 oh stretching vibration li et al 2017 shifted to 3316 cm 1 after the adsorption of pb the absorption peaks centered at 1647 and 1530 cm 1 represent amide i co stretching vibration and amide ii cn and nh bending vibration respectively which are closely related to the extracellular protein in m ags niu et al 2016 the relatively decreased peak intensities reflect the possible interaction between the extracellular protein and pb pagliaccia et al 2022 the peak at 1225 cm 1 assigned to cs stretching vibration was also observable which decreases substantially in intensity after pb adsorption indicating that the sulfur containing groups in m ags actively interacted with pb li et al 2015 additionally the pb engagement provoked a phosphate group relevant peak shifting from 1063 to 1035 cm 1 and attenuation in its intensity note that a new peak attributed to lattice vibration of fe o appeared at 705 cm 1 after pb adsorption likely suggesting the formation of an inner sphere surface complex fe o pb between fe hydroxyl groups and pb yang et al 2009 based on the ftir analysis it can be deduced that surface complexation between pb and the functional groups available in m ags should be a plausible mechanism accounting for the high adsorption capacity this is considered to be the consequence of the firming interaction between the lewis soft acid pb and soft base ligands such as hydroxyl carboxyl thiol phosphoryl and amide groups esrafili et al 2021 yang et al 2019 the ftir spectra of other samples fig s11 also suggested the involvement of multiple functional groups for pb complexation but the intensities of most peaks were lower than those associated with m ags indicative of lower adsorption capacity these observations agree with the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics that suggest a chemisorption process the xps analysis also provided information on the adsorption and chelation of pb with the abundant surface groups in m ags successful pb sequestration was evident from the appearance of its signal in the xps survey spectrum fig 4b as illustrated in fig s12 the deconvolution of c1s n1s o1s and p2p xps spectra indicated that the uptake of pb resulted in changes in the relevant contents of co oco oh nhco nh2 po and po bonds and their binding energies showing their functions as lewis bases to complex with pb esrafili et al 2021 wang et al 2015 the xas studies were performed to gain information on the fe and pb coordination environments in m ags with and without pb this helps to understand the possible incorporation of pb deeply into the inner structure of fe iii oxyhydr oxides the fe k edge signals and the corresponding exafs fits are provided in fig 4c the obtained parameters are listed in table 1 the first two radial structure function rsf peaks of each spectrum are fitted with one feo shell and two subshells of fe atoms with an interatomic distance of 1 98 3 02 and 3 47 Ã¥ respectively there were apparent decreases in the interatomic distance of the feo shell from 1 98 to 1 96 Ã¥ and the first fefe shell from 3 02 to 2 99 Ã¥ this agrees well with the observation that the contraction in the local fe environment possibly occurred in order to accommodate the larger ions e g cd pb and zn in the structure kaur et al 2009 moreover the coordination number cn of the fefe shells significantly increased as a result of pb incorporation for example the cn of the first and second fe fe shells rose from 3 5 0 3 to 4 9 0 5 and 1 7 0 2 to 5 2 0 6 respectively this suggests that the bridge of pb with the scattered feo6 octahedra prompted a transformation from a metastable form to a relatively stable one chen et al 2020 further analysis of the fourier transfer spectrum of pb l edge exafs is revealed in fig 4d which is characterized by an oscillation dominated by backscattering from first shell oxygen atoms around the central pb atom in addition to the pbo contribution at 1 72 Ã¥ chisholm brause et al 1990 the rsf contained pbs bond at 2 49 Ã¥ sharma et al 2004 pb p bond at 3 03 Ã¥ qu et al 2022 and pb fe bond at 3 55 Ã¥ xu et al 2006 again supporting its close interaction with m ags overall the interpretation of xas data was complicated by the adsorbed pb either on the surfaces or within the defects of the bulk areas of magnetite and the uncertainties in the shell fitting due to the data quality and some pbfe distances and shifts may not even be detected in the xas measurements the possible structural incorporation of pb however was consistent with changes based on the acid extraction experimental results since the sole surface adsorption of metals was unable to impose impacts on the structure of the adsorbents lu et al 2020 the xrd characteristics of all samples fig 5 a show the variations in the crystallinity and phase in the agss before and after pb adsorption for all the fe mineral embedded agss no typical crystalline peaks attributed to the planes of hematite and magnetite were displayed indicating that the initial fe oxide particles entered the inner parts of the ags or suffered from phase transformation to some extent in addition to the weak diffraction peaks corresponding to the poorly crystalline sio2 jcpds 49 0629 the peaks assigned to casi2o5 jcpds 51 0092 appeared and were more prominent in m ags this is because magnetite promoted the proliferation of ags ren et al 2018 which in turn yielded more amounts of ca extracted from the aqueous culture after pb sequestration new peaks relevant to pb5sio7 jcpds 35 0274 and pbs jcpds 99 0053 were observed indicating the formation of pb containing crystals via the mechanism of precipitation these compounds were also remarkably manifested in m ags pb the formation of pbs is attributable to the strong affinity of pb with the thiol groups consistent with the aforementioned results ji et al 2019 the generation of pb5sio7 is likely induced by lattice replacement free pb replaced ca in the lattice of m ags ma et al 2022 followed by the hydrolysis pbsi2o5 particles to form pb5sio7 precipitates with low solubility a similar phenomenon was also revealed in the survey xps fig 4b in which the ca corresponding signal was completely diminished along with the appearance of pb relevant signals in m ags pb the observation of these insoluble pb precipitates also evidences the elevated level of structural pb content in m ags and it can be inferred that m ags has the potential to promote the stabilization of pb 3 4 tests on m ags for immobilization of pb in the contaminated soil the capability to induce the structural incorporation of pb makes m ags a potentially passivating material that immobilizes pb available in the soil phase to verify this further experiments were conducted with real pb polluted soils using the agss as the stabilizing materials fig 6 shows the relative abundance of pb species in the soil samples before and after solidification by agss the data were recorded by sequential extraction using the bcr which included four fractions rauret et al 1999 exc refers to an acid soluble exchangeable fraction red is a reducible fraction attached to the femn oxides oxi stands for an oxidizable fraction captured by organic matter and sulfides and res is the remaining residue in the mineral matrix generally the exc and red fractions are considered to be more mobile and inclined to be released from the soil upon environmental changes thus representing great risks to the environment salam et al 2019 it should be noted that the proportion of exc in all tested samples varied in a quite narrow range this can be understood based on the fact that the use of acetic acid solution for extraction led to a ph below 3 0 at which the adsorption of agss to pb declined vulnerably thus masking the contribution of agss to the decrease in the acid soluble fraction li et al 2023 comparisons of the distribution of pb species after the exertion of different agss show that the unmodified ags had limited capability to promote the immobilization of pb by contrast the fe oxide involved agss apparently affected the proportion of pb fractions as the increasing operation time resulted in a gradual decrease in the percentage of red and an increase in the percentage of res a more pronounced effect was achieved for m ags for example the 28 day duration prompted the residual fraction of pb to rise to 41 significantly higher than the 20 increase in the pristine soil the reducible faction substantially decreased from 48 to 33 within the same period the leaching procedure tests were performed with the diluted acid nitric acid and sulfuric acid having a ph value of 3 2 which was added to the soil to extract pb the leached pb concentration not only suggests the passivation efficiency of the material to the heavy metal but also acts as a benchmark that can be compared with the concentration limits in the groundwater quality standards fig s13a shows that the 14 day operation reduced the pb concentration in the leaching extract by 83 4 from 0 68 to 0 11 mg l 1 when the dry weight ratio of ags to soil was 5 further increasing the duration to 28 days caused the leached pb content to approach 0 05 mg l 1 which is far below the limit value 0 10 mg l 1 regulated for the groundwater quality of china general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china 2017 fig s13b shows that the ratio of 3 might be insufficient in passivating pb as 0 12 mg l 1 pb was leached after the 28 day operation increasing the ratio from 5 to 7 only slightly reduced the concentration of pb in the leachate these findings together with the bcr results corroborate the effectiveness of m ags as a material capable of immobilizing pb in contaminated soils thus showing promise in minimizing the toxicity of the active fractions as elaborated above the enhancement of pb stabilization with the aid of m ags should be conducive to firm complexation between the heavy metal and the abundant functional groups in the material the formation of insoluble pb precipitates and more importantly the possible incorporation of pb in the inner structure of the fe matrix 4 conclusion we demonstrated that the utilization of magnetite helped to incorporate greater amounts of fe oxides into the inner structure of agss and the resulting m ags effectively promoted methane production more importantly the m ags achieved an enhanced adsorption capacity for pb which was superior to its ags counterparts without the involvement of fe oxides and those with ferrihydrite and hematite particularly noted is that the m ags significantly promoted the proportion of structural pb that is difficult to extract by weak acids the mechanistic studies have suggested that the formation of pb containing insoluble precipitates and the binding of pb to the fe oxide lattices accounts for this stabilization effect these results have significant environmental implications including i the practical application of conductive magnetite to stimulate the growth of ags that ultimately promotes methane generation from wastewater treatment and ii the recycling of magnetic ags as a promising adsorbent with several advantages such as enhancement of adsorption capacity promotion of heavy metal stabilization and the feasibility of magnetic separation of adsorbed heavy metals from aqueous and soil media declaration

14750,the development of magnetic adsorbents with high capacity to capture heavy metals has been the subject of intense research but the process usually involves costive synthesis steps here we propose a green approach to obtaining a magnetic biohybrid through in situ grown anaerobic granular sludge ags with the help of magnetite constituting a promising adsorbent for sequestration and immobilization of pb in aqueous solutions and soils the resultant magnetite embedded ags m ags was not only capable of promoting methane production but also conducive to pb adsorption because of the large surface area and abundant function groups the uptake of pb on m ags followed the pseudo second order having a maximum adsorption capacity of 197 8 mg gds 1 at ph 5 0 larger than 159 7 170 3 and 178 1 mg gds 1 in relation to ags f ags ferrihydrite mediated and h ags hematite mediated respectively mechanistic investigations showed that pb binding to m ags proceeds via surface complexation mineral precipitation and lattice replacement which promotes heavy metal capture and stabilization this was evident from the increased proportion of structural pb sequestrated from the aqueous solution and the enhanced percentage of the residual fraction of pb extracted from the contaminated soils graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heavy metal stabilization iron based remediation material anaerobic granular sludge magnetic adsorbent pb pollution field remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metal contamination in aquatic environments and soils is a worldwide concern for ecosystems and human health which has stimulated considerable interest in developing effective and environmentally friendly solutions for removing or separating heavy metals from polluted media barakat 2011 qin et al 2021 owing to its high efficiency simple operation good reproducibility and flexible design adsorption is considered an economical and effective strategy to achieve high adsorption performance plenty of functional materials with high surface area abundant chemical groups and low cost have been exploited as adsorbents in previous reports bhateria et al 2019 bilal et al 2021 dave et al 2014 among them magnetic adsorbents stand out as promising materials for heavy metal uptake thanks to the benefits of rapid separation and recovery by an external magnetic field feng et al 2020 increasing attention has been paid to using magnetite fe3o4 for sequestrating toxic metals because of its super magnetism biocompatibility and existence as natural minerals on earth karami 2013 namdeo 2018 further studies have been conducted to increase the adsorption capacity of magnetite through functionalized modification on the surface for example the hydroxyl amino carboxyl and carbonyl groups were introduced to aid in metal chelation li et al 2022b mahdavian et al 2010 shi et al 2015 despite their advances magnetite organic composites might suffer from the problem of complexity in preparation which involves extensive energy and chemical consumption al khateeb et al 2022 this aroused our interest in synthesizing magnetite based adsorbents in a green and sustainable fashion inspired by the natural phenomenon in which the combination of fe minerals and biological materials in environments results in a biohybrid composite with a high degree affinity for heavy metals cui et al 2022 wang et al 2014 zhang and wang 2020 we intend to prepare magnetite embedded anaerobic granular sludge ags which emerges as a promising solution for heavy metal capture indeed ags was regarded as an excellent biosorbent material due to its superior adsorption efficiency dense and firm microbial structure high biomass concentration good settling capacity and the ability to withstand shock loading hawari and mulligan 2006 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 wang et al 2018a moreover the utilization of conductive magnetite for ags formation and accordingly facilitating anaerobic digestion for wastewater treatment and harnessing methane has been documented recently baek et al 2017 cruz viggi et al 2014 kim et al 2022 direct interspecies electron transfer diet an essential pathway in promoting the anaerobic digestion process represents a syntrophic metabolism among microorganisms in which electrons are transferred from one microbial cell to another via electrically conductive pili cytochromes and conductive materials without the participation of reduced electron carriers such as h2 and other redox mediators gahlot et al 2020 wang et al 2021 it has been demonstrated that magnetite can accelerate diet in ags and thus promote solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and or methanogenesis processes which in turn enriches diverse microorganisms with improved enzymatic activity luo et al 2022 wang et al 2018b the ags is mostly composed of extracellular polymers and microbial cells that inherently contain a variety of functional groups favorable for metal attachment in general the ags is a waste product that must be treated safely and disposed of the comprehensive utilization of ags as a resource conforms to sustainable development principles the creation of magnetite embedded ags m ags is thus not only conducive to methane generation from wastewater but it also represents a desirable alternative among other sludge disposal technologies since it can potentially function as a promising magnetic adsorbent for heavy metals in contaminated aquatic environments and soils taking lead pb one of the most toxic and non biodegradable heavy metals frequently detected in environments as an example our central aim is to demonstrate the efficacy of m ags for the sequestration and immobilization of pb from water and soil the m ags composite was prepared in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with the incorporation of magnetite during the methanogenic degradation of organic matter the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of pb on magnetic ags were evaluated for comparison ferrihydrite and hematite were also used to promote ags growth and anaerobic methane generation and the resultant ags materials for pb adsorption and stabilization were investigated moreover pb binding mechanisms were elucidated through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray diffraction spectra xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray absorption spectroscopy xas techniques the findings acquired have the potential to provide an economically viable strategy for reutilizing ags as a heavy metal stabilizing material including the future operation of anaerobic wastewater treatment in a sustainable manner 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic cultivation of fe oxide embedded agss lab scale uasb reactors 37 cm in height and 14 cm in diameter with a working volume of 2 l were operated to cultivate agss the reactors made of plexiglas were placed in a thermostatic incubator at 30 c under anaerobic conditions the initial 500 ml of ags liboyuan co ltd shandong china was used as the seed sludge added to the four reactors one reactor without the addition of fe minerals as a control and three reactors respectively fed with 500 mg l 1 ferrihydrite hematite and magnetite the initial ags was produced from the anaerobic digestion of fresh waste leachate with an organic loading rate of 7 kg cod m 3 day 3 in a uasb reactor made of stainless steel coated with an anticorrosive material with an internal diameter of 2 m and a height of 8 m working volume 25 m3 all the fe oxides were lab prepared according to the procedures described previously schwertmann et al 1989 the xrd patterns in fig s1 show their typical crystalline structures and confirm successful synthesis the synthetic wastewater was composed of 3000 mg l 1 glucose that was the most extensively substrate for the ags

composition of the trace element solution was mg l 1 cucl2 30 zncl2 50 mnso4 1100 and cocl2 600 after 15 days of inoculation the agss were immediately washed three times using deionized water avoiding the influence of the surface soluble ions on the experiments the agss were then frozen in the refrigerator 18 c for 6 h and dried in the vacuum lyophilizer for 24 h prior to further use in the adsorption tests the dried m ags maintained the granular morphology as shown in fig s2 the aggregate gas samples were collected in a 1 l foil gas bag during the 15 day inoculation period the biogas production was assessed twice a week by determining the gas volume in the gas bag with a 500 ml syringe the methane content was measured using gas chromatography gc shimadzu 2014c japan equipped with a gdx 104 column and a thermal conductivity detector the injector oven and detector temperatures were controlled at 150 100 and 160 c respectively helium gas with a 99 999 purity was used as the carrier gas in the system the wet ags samples collected directly from the uasb reactors were used for genomic dna extraction and microbial community analysis for each sample the integrity of the dna

1 mol l 1 naoh solutions samples were collected at specified time intervals and passed through a 0 22 Î¼m polycarbonate filter the filtered liquids were subjected to chemical analysis of the aqueous pb concentration which was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas optima 5300 dv san diego usa after reaching adsorption equilibrium the remaining solids were dried in a vacuum lyophilizer for 24 h for subsequent characterizations for the adsorption isotherm experiments agss with a dry weight of 40 mg were added to the 80 ml solution with the initial pb concentrations varying from 20 to 120 mg l 1 the erlenmeyer bottles were placed in a 30 c thermostatic shaker at 150 rpm for 6 h to ensure equilibrium the supernatant of each solution was filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m polycarbonate filter and the residual pb concentration in the solution was determined the effect of the initial ph on the adsorption performance was investigated in the same reactor containing 40 mg ags and 100 mg l 1 pb in a ph range between 2 0 and 5 0 note that the ph value beyond 5 0 easily caused precipitation of pb oh 2 the adsorbed and structural pb concentrations were quantified based on procedures described previously frierdich et al 2015 briefly pb containing agss measuring 200 mg was mixed with 10 ml of 0 4 mol l 1 hcl and the mixture was placed in a centrifuge tube and reacted in a rotary oscillator for 0 5 h the supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min and the content of dissolved pb was measured as the adsorbed pb the difference in the adsorbed pb concentration and the total content of pb in the agss was denoted as the structural one all the above experiments were performed in triplicate and average data values were reported for calculations the removal

calibrations then fourier transformed fitting was carried out in artemis version 0 9 26 ravel et al 2005 the magnetic properties of samples were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm lake shore 7404 columbus oh usa with a magnetic field strength of 20 koe at room temperature 25 c the electrical conductivity data were acquired on an st2722 sd powder resistivity testing instrument suzhou lattice electronics co ltd suzhou china with an st2255 test module the fe mineral powders were pressurized to different heights and then the resistivity of the cylindrical sample was measured using the four point probe method the mÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy was employed to characterize the occupied states of fe in m ags it was performed on a spectrometer wss 10 wissel gmbh germany equipped with a closed loop cryostat shi 850 janis research co usa the sample was collected on a 0 22 Î¼m nitrocellulose filter membrane and sealed between two pieces of kapton tape with copper rings after drying in an anaerobic box the mÃ¶ssbauer spectra of m ags were taken at room temperature in the range of 10 to 10 mm s 1 the experimental data was calibrated with Î± fe0 foil and fitted using mosswinn official software version 4 0 pre 2 4 tests on the utilization of agss for immobilization of pb in contaminated soils more efforts were made to investigate the efficacy of m ags for the sequestration and immobilization of pb from the contaminated soil the soil samples used in this experiment were collected from an electroplating plant n25 12 34 e109 24 3 liuzhou guangxi china all samples were placed in polyethylene bags and brought to the laboratory and then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c after removing the stones and coarse debris the air dried soils were grounded in an 80 mesh nylon sieve for further chemical analysis and experiments the stabilizing experiments were set up in a 100 ml centrifuge tube in which the soil 50 g sample and agss existing at a ratio of 5 w w dry weight of ags to soil were added water was amended to maintain the soil moisture at a 1 1 v v water soil ratio during the whole process all test samples were placed in the shaker at 25 c for 28 days all treatments were replicated three times samples were taken every week to analyze the distribution of pb fractions and the leaching toxicity of soil samples for analysis the soil was digested with an hcl hno3 hclo4 hf mixed solution 10 9 3 1 v v and the total concentrations of heavy metals in the soil were quantified using aas blank controls and standard reference materials gbw07390 gss 34 were included in each batch of digestion a chinese leaching procedure hj 299 ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2007 was conducted to determine the leached metalloid concentrations from soil samples and the sulfuric acid and nitric acid mixture liquid v v ratio of 2 1 was used as the leaching solution diluted in 1 l of water with a ph value of 3 2 table s1 lists the total and acid extracted concentrations of the main heavy metals in the contaminated soils it is evident that pb was the predominant pollutant with a total content of 1744 4 mg kg 1 and a leaching content of 0 68 mg l 1 exceeding the standard of soil environmental quality in china gb 36600 2018 type i site control value and the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 type iv limit value respectively the sequential extraction approach of the european community bureau of reference bcr was applied to distinguish exchangeable f1 reducible f2 oxidizable f3 and residual f4 fractions of pb in soils the sequential extraction procedure was conducted step by step as depicted in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of fe oxide embedded agss regarding methane generation capacity microbial community and physicochemical properties three different fe minerals including ferrihydrite hematite and magnetite were selected as the substrate to support the growth of agss for methane generation and the resultant solid was named f ags h ags and m ags respectively it is notable from fig 1 a that the incorporation of fe oxides in agss had a positive effect on methane production from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in accordance with previous results tang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 ye et al 2018 this finding might be explained by the facts that i the fe oxides introduced into ags function as conducive materials which facilitate cell to cell connection increase the electrical capacitance of extracellular polymeric substance eps and thereby promote diet from acidogens to methanogens li et al 2022a wang et al 2018b ii the fe oxides can establish intercellular connections between microorganisms and organic matter through adsorption netting or bridging then forming a magnetite ags co substrate which can facilitate interspecies material exchange and energy transfer between microorganisms cui et al 2022 and iii the fe oxides are able to act as counter ions binding to the negative charged eps in agss and thus enhancing the metabolic activity of microorganisms for anaerobic digestion zhang et al 2022 among all the investigated cases the m ags exhibited the best capacity for methane generation which should be attributed to its higher electrical conductivity 0 004 3 600 and 113 900 Î¼s cm 1 for ferrihydrite hematite and magnetite respectively the differentiation in methane generation performance was manifested by the distinct change in the microbial community between the four reactors as revealed in fig 1b in particular a sequence assigned to trichococcus belonging to firmicutes was apparently enriched in h ags and m ags but not in f ags more importantly the m ags revealed a profound enhancement in the abundance of trichococcus groups of trichococcus have been reported as fermentative bacteria that can use various organics including acetate formate ethanol glucose and aromatic compounds for anaerobic methane generation ma et al 2021 a previous study tang et al 2021 utilizing methanogenic sludge for the treatment of dairy wastes also demonstrated that fe iii oxides hematite and magnetite could specially cultivate trichococcus species which is considered an electroactive fe reducing bacterium accelerating diet with methanothrix species in syntrophic degradation of complex organic compounds however the ability of trichococcus to achieve extracellular electron transport has not been reported and deserves future exploration which is beyond the scope of the current study chemical analysis of the fe uptake rate and the proportion of fe in the resultant agss was performed fig s3a shows that the fe uptake rate was in the order of m ags h ags f ags ags the m ags achieved a maximum fe load of 124 0 mg gds 1 after 15 days exceeding the values of 33 6 92 1 and 94 9 mg gds 1 in relation to ags f ags and h ags respectively fig s3b this indicates that magnetite was more inclined to be incorporated into ags possibly due to its competitive ability to substitute metallic counter ions e g ca mg and al ajao et al 2020 sudmalis et al 2020 it is further shown that more than 90 of fe was bound with the microbial cells suggesting that the majority of fe minerals were loaded into the inner part rather than the outer part e g eps of ags these findings support the view of the engagement of fe minerals particularly magnetite in promoting cell to cell electron transfer cruz viggi et al 2014 kang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 fig s4 presents the zeta potentials of the agss the values associated with the fe mineral involved agss shifted positively compared to that of the unmodified ags suggesting the enhanced electrostatic interaction between fe oxides and the ags because of stronger binding the m ags processed a higher zeta potential of 2 33 which indicates negatively charged surfaces available for cationic heavy metal adsorption at ph beyond this value comparisons of the magnetic properties between different samples are depicted in fig 1c which depicts the magnetization hysteresis curves of four materials with the field sweeping from 20 000 to 20 000 oe it was found that the m ags exhibited an excellent magnetic feature with a saturation magnetization of 13 3 emu g 1 the reversible hysteresis curve with almost zero retentivity and coercivity confirmed the superparamagnetic nature of m ags fig 1d shows the room temperature mÃ¶ssbauer spectra of m ags and the hyperfine parameters for data fitting are given in table s3 in general the spectra of m ags contained a zeeman sextet with broadened resonance lines characteristic of fe3o4 and a quadrupole doublet characteristic of the superparamagnetic state of fe2 and fe3 zheltova et al 2020 the asymmetric shape and the broadening of the spectral lines are likely induced by the presence of regions of disorder in the structure the mÃ¶ssbauer spectra could be deconvoluted into two sub sextets one corresponding to feiii in the tetrahedral a site 37 90 of magnetite and the other relevant to feii and feiii in the octahedral b site 45 48 of magnetite and one doublet associated with superparamagnetic phase 16 62 the magnitude of the hyperfine magnetic field for the m ags sample was equal to 49 0 0 1 t which validates the magnetic properties of m ags si et al 2004 daou et al 2006 this feature made it a promising magnetic adsorption material beneficial for separating and recovering targeted contaminants in either the aqueous phase or soil outer picture of fig 1d the specific surface area was evaluated using the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the bet tests table s4 shows that the m ags was featured with a larger surface area a higher mesoporous pore volume and a smaller particle size than its counterparts indicating its advantages for metal attachment for example the surface area of m ags h ags f ags and ags was 10 96 6 89 1 11 and 0 25 m2 g 1 respectively the sem observations accorded well with the variations in the specific surface area as illustrated in fig 2 the control ags sample was densely packed and the introduction of fe minerals induced the granule to become loose a more distinct difference was disclosed in the interior of ags in comparison to the stacked structure of ags the fe mineral embedded agss particularly m ags were enriched with filamentous bacteria and had porous structures this morphology should be favorable to the affinity of heavy metals 3 2 m ags for sequestration and stabilization of pb in aqueous solution the kinetics of pb adsorption on agss were performed and compared between different samples by contacting 120 mg l 1 pb at ph 5 0 it should be noted from fig s5 that the maximum adsorption amount was attained at this ph value for all the cases the dosage of m ags was set at 0 5 g l 1 where the capacity of pb adsorption reached a maximum value fig s6 the dry sludge was used for the adsorption tests as the maximum adsorption capacity of dry sludge was about 5 18 higher than that of wet sludge fig s7 this might be because the dry sludge had a larger surface area and provided more surface active sites for adsorption wei et al 2008 the time course aqueous pb concentration for all cases was recorded in fig 3 a which clearly indicated the difference in the percentage of pb removal between different treatments the m ags enabled a removal efficiency of 84 6 after a 1440 min operation which was larger than the removal efficiency of 76 2 72 9 and 68 3 in relation to h ags f ags and ags respectively fig 3b shows that the adsorption capacity for all cases enhanced rapidly during the first 100 min followed by a gradual increase from 100 to 400 min and reaching equilibrium after 400 min this adsorption behavior has been frequently reported with respect to a variety of adsorbents for pb uptake basu et al 2017 ling et al 2017 liu et al 2020 naushad et al 2021 the fast adsorption during the initial stage was due to the presence of abundant adsorption sites on the adsorbent the initial metal concentration gradient provided an important driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance between the aqueous and adsorbent which is also responsible for this phenomenon the m ags outperformed the other materials in terms of higher equilibrium adsorption capacity 197 8 mg gds 1 than ags 159 7 mg gds 1 f ags 170 3 mg gds 1 and h ags 178 1 mg gds 1 moreover the adsorption of pb on agss was fitted with the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle models fig s8 and the kinetic parameters and correlation coefficients are listed in table s5 it is apparent that the pseudo second order kinetic model was more appropriate for predicating the adsorption of pb because of the higher correlation coefficient the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacities based on the pseudo second order model agreed well with the experimental values this suggests that the rate limiting step in this adsorption process could be chemisorption esrafili et al 2021 shi et al 2015 the adsorption isotherms were obtained by varying the initial pb concentrations from 20 to 120 mg l 1 at ph 5 0 fig 3c shows that the adsorption capacities of pb on agss increased with increasing pb content and reached equilibrium at a particular value due to the lack of available sites for adsorbing metal ions the adsorption data were fitted by the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models fig s9 and the fitting parameters are given in table s6 the data were more reasonably fitted with the langmuir model indicating that the monolayer adsorption on agss dominates the process esrafili et al 2021 liu et al 2020 according to the fitting results the m ags exhibited superior capability for pb adsorption evident from its distinctly higher maximum adsorption capacity 200 0 mg gds 1 than the others ags 171 9 mg gds 1 f ags 174 6 mg gds 1 and h ags 180 3 mg gds 1 it is generally accepted that the adsorption of heavy metals by weak bonding e g ion exchange and electrostatic attraction is vulnerable to potential risk of their re release upon changes in environmental factors such as ph value and coexisting ions caporale et al 2015 and that strong bonding via adsorption mineralization coordination complexation and structural embedding allows the adsorbed heavy metals to be less influenced by the environment and have lower mobility ma et al 2022 therefore an analysis of the distribution of adsorbed and structural pb in the solid phases of the different samples was performed according to previous procedures frierdich et al 2015 an interesting observation from fig 3d is that the involvement of fe minerals inside agss appreciably improved the proportion of pb incorporated into the structure of the sorbents in particular the m ags enabled more amounts of pb firmly attached likely because of the formation of insoluble precipitates and the incorporation of pb inside the fe oxide lattice which are more stable in the environment and difficult to extract by weak acids this point will be discussed in later sections it should be noted that the absence of agss contributed to a small proportion of pb removal fig s10a shows that limited amounts of pb were removed from the aqueous phase by pure minerals e g 8 1 for ferrihydrite 13 5 for hematite and 17 6 for magnetite after 1400 min of operation fig s10b and s10c indicate that the maximum adsorption capacities of ferrihydrite hematite and magnetite for pb uptake were 19 1 31 5 and 36 3 mg gds 1 at ph 5 0 respectively which were much lower than the values obtained with the corresponding materials in the presence of ags moreover the majority of adsorbed pb on the minerals was in the loosely attached form as illustrated in fig s10d these findings confirm the importance of the combined effects of agss and fe minerals on the capture of pb 3 3 mechanisms of pb adsorption on m ags and explanations of the enhanced adsorption capacity and strong bonding the adsorption mechanisms were elucidated by conducting a series of physiochemical characterizations to reveal the differences in the relevant signals between the agss before and after pb uptake fig 4 a shows the ftir spectra of m agss in the presence and absence of pb the broad and intense band located at 3373 cm 1 oh stretching vibration li et al 2017 shifted to 3316 cm 1 after the adsorption of pb the absorption peaks centered at 1647 and 1530 cm 1 represent amide i co stretching vibration and amide ii cn and nh bending vibration respectively which are closely related to the extracellular protein in m ags niu et al 2016 the relatively decreased peak intensities reflect the possible interaction between the extracellular protein and pb pagliaccia et al 2022 the peak at 1225 cm 1 assigned to cs stretching vibration was also observable which decreases substantially in intensity after pb adsorption indicating that the sulfur containing groups in m ags actively interacted with pb li et al 2015 additionally the pb engagement provoked a phosphate group relevant peak shifting from 1063 to 1035 cm 1 and attenuation in its intensity note that a new peak attributed to lattice vibration of fe o appeared at 705 cm 1 after pb adsorption likely suggesting the formation of an inner sphere surface complex fe o pb between fe hydroxyl groups and pb yang et al 2009 based on the ftir analysis it can be deduced that surface complexation between pb and the functional groups available in m ags should be a plausible mechanism accounting for the high adsorption capacity this is considered to be the consequence of the firming interaction between the lewis soft acid pb and soft base ligands such as hydroxyl carboxyl thiol phosphoryl and amide groups esrafili et al 2021 yang et al 2019 the ftir spectra of other samples fig s11 also suggested the involvement of multiple functional groups for pb complexation but the intensities of most peaks were lower than those associated with m ags indicative of lower adsorption capacity these observations agree with the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics that suggest a chemisorption process the xps analysis also provided information on the adsorption and chelation of pb with the abundant surface groups in m ags successful pb sequestration was evident from the appearance of its signal in the xps survey spectrum fig 4b as illustrated in fig s12 the deconvolution of c1s n1s o1s and p2p xps spectra indicated that the uptake of pb resulted in changes in the relevant contents of co oco oh nhco nh2 po and po bonds and their binding energies showing their functions as lewis bases to complex with pb esrafili et al 2021 wang et al 2015 the xas studies were performed to gain information on the fe and pb coordination environments in m ags with and without pb this helps to understand the possible incorporation of pb deeply into the inner structure of fe iii oxyhydr oxides the fe k edge signals and the corresponding exafs fits are provided in fig 4c the obtained parameters are listed in table 1 the first two radial structure function rsf peaks of each spectrum are fitted with one feo shell and two subshells of fe atoms with an interatomic distance of 1 98 3 02 and 3 47 Ã¥ respectively there were apparent decreases in the interatomic distance of the feo shell from 1 98 to 1 96 Ã¥ and the first fefe shell from 3 02 to 2 99 Ã¥ this agrees well with the observation that the contraction in the local fe environment possibly occurred in order to accommodate the larger ions e g cd pb and zn in the structure kaur et al 2009 moreover the coordination number cn of the fefe shells significantly increased as a result of pb incorporation for example the cn of the first and second fe fe shells rose from 3 5 0 3 to 4 9 0 5 and 1 7 0 2 to 5 2 0 6 respectively this suggests that the bridge of pb with the scattered feo6 octahedra prompted a transformation from a metastable form to a relatively stable one chen et al 2020 further analysis of the fourier transfer spectrum of pb l edge exafs is revealed in fig 4d which is characterized by an oscillation dominated by backscattering from first shell oxygen atoms around the central pb atom in addition to the pbo contribution at 1 72 Ã¥ chisholm brause et al 1990 the rsf contained pbs bond at 2 49 Ã¥ sharma et al 2004 pb p bond at 3 03 Ã¥ qu et al 2022 and pb fe bond at 3 55 Ã¥ xu et al 2006 again supporting its close interaction with m ags overall the interpretation of xas data was complicated by the adsorbed pb either on the surfaces or within the defects of the bulk areas of magnetite and the uncertainties in the shell fitting due to the data quality and some pbfe distances and shifts may not even be detected in the xas measurements the possible structural incorporation of pb however was consistent with changes based on the acid extraction experimental results since the sole surface adsorption of metals was unable to impose impacts on the structure of the adsorbents lu et al 2020 the xrd characteristics of all samples fig 5 a show the variations in the crystallinity and phase in the agss before and after pb adsorption for all the fe mineral embedded agss no typical crystalline peaks attributed to the planes of hematite and magnetite were displayed indicating that the initial fe oxide particles entered the inner parts of the ags or suffered from phase transformation to some extent in addition to the weak diffraction peaks corresponding to the poorly crystalline sio2 jcpds 49 0629 the peaks assigned to casi2o5 jcpds 51 0092 appeared and were more prominent in m ags this is because magnetite promoted the proliferation of ags ren et al 2018 which in turn yielded more amounts of ca extracted from the aqueous culture after pb sequestration new peaks relevant to pb5sio7 jcpds 35 0274 and pbs jcpds 99 0053 were observed indicating the formation of pb containing crystals via the mechanism of precipitation these compounds were also remarkably manifested in m ags pb the formation of pbs is attributable to the strong affinity of pb with the thiol groups consistent with the aforementioned results ji et al 2019 the generation of pb5sio7 is likely induced by lattice replacement free pb replaced ca in the lattice of m ags ma et al 2022 followed by the hydrolysis pbsi2o5 particles to form pb5sio7 precipitates with low solubility a similar phenomenon was also revealed in the survey xps fig 4b in which the ca corresponding signal was completely diminished along with the appearance of pb relevant signals in m ags pb the observation of these insoluble pb precipitates also evidences the elevated level of structural pb content in m ags and it can be inferred that m ags has the potential to promote the stabilization of pb 3 4 tests on m ags for immobilization of pb in the contaminated soil the capability to induce the structural incorporation of pb makes m ags a potentially passivating material that immobilizes pb available in the soil phase to verify this further experiments were conducted with real pb polluted soils using the agss as the stabilizing materials fig 6 shows the relative abundance of pb species in the soil samples before and after solidification by agss the data were recorded by sequential extraction using the bcr which included four fractions rauret et al 1999 exc refers to an acid soluble exchangeable fraction red is a reducible fraction attached to the femn oxides oxi stands for an oxidizable fraction captured by organic matter and sulfides and res is the remaining residue in the mineral matrix generally the exc and red fractions are considered to be more mobile and inclined to be released from the soil upon environmental changes thus representing great risks to the environment salam et al 2019 it should be noted that the proportion of exc in all tested samples varied in a quite narrow range this can be understood based on the fact that the use of acetic acid solution for extraction led to a ph below 3 0 at which the adsorption of agss to pb declined vulnerably thus masking the contribution of agss to the decrease in the acid soluble fraction li et al 2023 comparisons of the distribution of pb species after the exertion of different agss show that the unmodified ags had limited capability to promote the immobilization of pb by contrast the fe oxide involved agss apparently affected the proportion of pb fractions as the increasing operation time resulted in a gradual decrease in the percentage of red and an increase in the percentage of res a more pronounced effect was achieved for m ags for example the 28 day duration prompted the residual fraction of pb to rise to 41 significantly higher than the 20 increase in the pristine soil the reducible faction substantially decreased from 48 to 33 within the same period the leaching procedure tests were performed with the diluted acid nitric acid and sulfuric acid having a ph value of 3 2 which was added to the soil to extract pb the leached pb concentration not only suggests the passivation efficiency of the material to the heavy metal but also acts as a benchmark that can be compared with the concentration limits in the groundwater quality standards fig s13a shows that the 14 day operation reduced the pb concentration in the leaching extract by 83 4 from 0 68 to 0 11 mg l 1 when the dry weight ratio of ags to soil was 5 further increasing the duration to 28 days caused the leached pb content to approach 0 05 mg l 1 which is far below the limit value 0 10 mg l 1 regulated for the groundwater quality of china general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china 2017 fig s13b shows that the ratio of 3 might be insufficient in passivating pb as 0 12 mg l 1 pb was leached after the 28 day operation increasing the ratio from 5 to 7 only slightly reduced the concentration of pb in the leachate these findings together with the bcr results corroborate the effectiveness of m ags as a material capable of immobilizing pb in contaminated soils thus showing promise in minimizing the toxicity of the active fractions as elaborated above the enhancement of pb stabilization with the aid of m ags should be conducive to firm complexation between the heavy metal and the abundant functional groups in the material the formation of insoluble pb precipitates and more importantly the possible incorporation of pb in the inner structure of the fe matrix 4 conclusion we demonstrated that the utilization of magnetite helped to incorporate greater amounts of fe oxides into the inner structure of agss and the resulting m ags effectively promoted methane production more importantly the m ags achieved an enhanced adsorption capacity for pb which was superior to its ags counterparts without the involvement of fe oxides and those with ferrihydrite and hematite particularly noted is that the m ags significantly promoted the proportion of structural pb that is difficult to extract by weak acids the mechanistic studies have suggested that the formation of pb containing insoluble precipitates and the binding of pb to the fe oxide lattices accounts for this stabilization effect these results have significant environmental implications including i the practical application of conductive magnetite to stimulate the growth of ags that ultimately promotes methane generation from wastewater treatment and ii the recycling of magnetic ags as a promising adsorbent with several advantages such as enhancement of adsorption capacity promotion of heavy metal stabilization and the feasibility of magnetic separation of adsorbed heavy metals from aqueous and soil media declaration

14751,microalgae bacteria consortium mbc provides an alternative to sustainable treatment of human toilet wastewater tww and resource recovery this study compared the conventional activated sludge system and wastewater indigenous mbc system imbc for nitrogen removal in tww through the coupled partial nitrification pn and nitrite type denitrification process pn was firstly established by alternating fa and fna subsequently the successful pn maintenance with the nitrite accumulation rate ranging between 90 1 95 3 was achieved using two strategies light irradiation with the appropriate specific light energy density at 0 0188 0 0598 kj mg vss and the timely nitrite type denitrification with the algae secreted organics as the carbon source eventually resulting in the nitrite accumulation rate ranging between 90 1 95 3 in the imbc pn system bacterial metabolism contributed to 91 5 of nitrogen removal and the rest was through microalgal assimilation this study offers a sustainable hybrid imbc pn process for high nh4 n strength wastewater treatment e g tww which theoretically saves 23 5 aeration and 34 2 carbon source as well as reduces 17 0 sludge production keywords toilet wastewater indigenous microalgae bacteria consortium partial nitrification nitrite type denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rapid development of public transports such as high speed railways and aviation large amount of toilet wastewater tww with high ammonium nh4 n level is produced centralized biological nitrogen removal bnr process has been implemented as a promising way for nitrogen removal in tww through conventional nitrification and denitrification however this method requires aeration and external carbon which results in additional operation cost and limits its sustainability i e n recovery on a larger scale hence it is required to develop technologies that simultaneously treat tww and recover resources in a more sustainable manner microalgae bacteria consortium mbc is a sustainable approch where a complementary synergistic function was formed for efficient wastewater bioremediation and nutrient recovery and the synergistic function of the two has great potential in improving the removal efficiency of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus reducing the energy cost of wastewater treatment e g energy consumption of aeration and external carbon source and nitrous oxide n2o emission in enclosed open and aerated reactors li et al 2023 ramanan et al 2016 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 recently the mbc with the partial nitrification mbc pn was reported to further reduce the energy cost especially for the wastewater with high nh4 n levels and low c n e g landfill leachate wu et al 2018 similarly therefore the tww might be suitable for the application of the mbc pn process minimizing the requirement on aeration alkalinity and carbon source currently however the start up and maintenance of the mbc pn process remained at its early stage so far the process was mostly established in two steps firstly achieving pn by enriching ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in the activated sludge system using controlled conditions of free ammonia fa free nitrous acid fna or low dissolved oxygen do and then introducing the pure microalgae but this approach required a long start up period with the unexpected system stablility for example in the initial stage 50 days of a mbc pn system treating anaerobically digested swine manure centrate the continuous loss of the added algae biomass led to the weak symbiotic relationship between aob and pure microalgae as well as the unexpected system stability wang et al 2015 similar observation was reported in a granular mbc pn system where both the activity and the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae aob family were reduced due to the combined effect of sunlight exposure algal growth and fna application huang et al 2020 therefore novel approaches are urgently required to improve the start up and stable maintenance of the mbc pn treating tww recently a novel concept was proposed which consisted of two steps screening the wastewater indigenous mbc imbc and improvement of imbc adaptation in wastewater using the adaptive gradual stress increase strategy chen et al 2022 qiu et al 2021a qiu et al 2021b compared to both the pure microalgae strains and mbc the imbc were shown to have the potential to effectively adapt themselves to the wastewater system with better growth performance two fold growth rate as compared to the control and present superior nutrient uptake capacities recently the imbc pn process was succesfully applied in the treatment of municipal wastewater by optimizing the external light condition where microbial structure for pn was optimized with the enrichment of ellin6067 and other four nitrosomonadaceae genera wang et al 2021 similar light induced pn observation was also reported in a granular mbc treating synthetic wastewater si et al 2022 on the other hand the excessive accumulation of no2 n in the imbc pn system provides a substrate for nob oxidation which would destroy the stability of pn thus the timely denitrification should be achieved which is conducive to the maintenance of pn above all it is hypothesized that the combination of fa fna in tww and light application might achieve imbc pn coupled with nitrite type denitrification for tww bioremediation therefore the goal of this study was to propose an integrated imbc pn process using light irradiation for the real tww bioremediation specifically the start up and maintenance mechanism of pn in the reactor was firstly explored using the combined strategies moreover its performance in pn maintenance organic matter removal and the imbc system settlement were also evaluated the imbc pn system was then further analyzed from the perspective of microorganism through microbial community dynamics and picrust forecast the observations of this study are expected to provide insights on expanding the feasibility of imbc pn in tww bioremediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 tww composition and sludge source the tww used in this study was collected from a toilet at nanjing university of science and technology nanjing china and stored in the refrigerator for further use in the raw tww nitrogen mainly existed in the form of urea which was gradually decomposed to be ammonium nh4 n stabilizing at 6000 mg l with ph variations ph ranges 6 63 9 30 fig s1 the specific characteristics of the undiluted tww were

plant wwtp nanjing china performing conventional nitrification and denitrification 2 2 reactor set up operation and monitoring two identical sequencing batch reactors sbrs r1 and r2 with the working volume of 0 5 l were set up at a constant room temperature of 23 2 c fig 1 r1 was illuminated using a cool white fluorescent light philips cool whit 5 8 w while r2 was conducted without light exposure as the control each reactor was inoculated with sludge concentration at 3000 200 mg l based on the preliminary inhibition experiments results the diluted tww without sterilization containing around 300 mg l nh4 n was used for both sbrs both sbrs were operated one 13 hour cycle per day which was composed of five periods including anoxic feeding 5 min anoxic reaction 240 min aerobic reaction 480 min settling 50 min and decanting 5 min at the end of each cycle 250 ml wastewater was discharged from the reactor maintaining the hydraulic retention time hrt at 26 h and the sludge was not deliberately discharged except for the sludge loss via effluent the solids residence time srt in the reactor was not controlled do and ph were monitored using the ph oxi340i meter wtw company germany and controlled at 3 0 4 0 mg o2 l in aeration unless otherwise specified and 7 0 8 0 using the programmable logic controller system respectively the magnetic stirrer ika company germany at 1000 rpm was used to provide even mixing and mass transfer environment samples were collected at the end of each cycle to determine the n concentration in the effluent both sbrs were operated with the same strategies in three different phases after the initial 35 day sludge inoculation phase phase 0 the high nh4 n concentration in the raw undiluted tww was shown inhibiting algal growth and reducing the activities of nitrifiers in active sludge which was previously used to treat municipal wastewater additionally considering the fact that the flushing dilution effect on the collected tww in the real washing room as shown in table 1 in phase 1 day 0 70 the diluted tww was fed into two sbrs at the stepwise increasing nh4 n loading rates up to 300 mg l to initiate the pn the influent nh4 n increased by four gradients in phase 1 was recorded as phase 1a 50 100 mg l 1b 50 200 mg l 1c 200 250 mg l and 1d 300 mg l respectively when nitrite accumulation rate nar eq 1 approximately achieved 90 it was considered as the successful establishment of pn nar was calculated by eq 1 where c no 3 n and c no 2 n represented the effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations respectively in this phase fa and fna concentrations were also estimated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively abbew et al 2022 shen et al 2020 yamamoto et al 2008 1 nar c no 2 n mg l c no 2 n mg l c no 3 n mg l 100 2 fa mg l 1 214 nh 4 n mg l

irradiation to initiate and enrich the indigenous microalgae consortium eventually establishing the imbc pn system the light irradiation condition applied in imbc system was determined in terms of the specific light energy density es kj mg vss using eq 4 to present the actual illumination conditions in the reactor wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 which systematically considered the synergistic effects of illumination power p w time t h and sludge concentration mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss mg l as shown in table 1 phase 2 was subdivided into phase 2a day 71 120 and phase 2b day 121 156 when the pn imbc system was initiated with observable microalgal growth in r2 the experiment was proceeded into phase 3 day 157 181 and the same operations were applied for both reactors this phase was designed to compare the maintenance of pn system performance e g biomass variations and removal of organic matters of r1 was compared with that of r2 in phase 2b and 3 afterwards the influent nh4 n concentration was increased while the do level was reduced which eventually resulted in a fluctuated and slowly increased nar see fig 2 c and section 3 1 in contrast the nar of r2 continued to drop sharply 4 es kj mg vss 0 03 3 6 p t v mlvss 2 3 batch test contributions of the algae secreted organics to pn maintenance microalgal decomposition resulted in the release of the algae secreted organics that could be used as carbon source for denitrification in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands zhong et al 2019 therefore it was hypothesized that microalgae in imbc pn system might also secret organics that could be further utilized by bacteria such as denitrifies for denitrification this speculation was studied in phase 3 using batch tests imbc were roughly separated from bacteria in r1 by natural precipitation due to their different settling velocities the detailed procedures were described in text s2 specifically two 250 ml conical flasks were used as the reactors fig s2 under the same conditions i e wastewater light condition stirring and aeration as those for r1 operations but with different initial imbc inoculation concentrations 1 32 and 5 32 mg l the experiment was operated for 10 days and the variations of chlorophyll and cod in medium were measured every 2 days to evaluate the relationship between microalgal growth and organic matter released during the cultivation 2 4 estimation of aob and nob activities the activities of aob and nob were investigated in batch tests throughout the experiment phases they were indicated by the specific ammonium oxidation rate saor and specific nitrite oxidation rate snor respectively briefly nh4cl n or nano2 n solution was manually added into the biomass in conical flasks to achieve the specific initial concentrations ph controlled at 7 5 0 2 do controlled 3 0 0 5 mg l and the nh4 n or no2 n level was measured every 20 min or 10 min to obtain the saor and snor the detailed procedures were described in text s3 the ratio of saor in phase x to that in phase x 1 was defined as raob to indicate the variations of relative activities of aob raob using eq 5 similarly rnob was indicated

chemical oxygen demand cod and sludge volume index svi were measured according to standard methods apha 2012 before fluorescence analysis to minimize the inner filtering effects all samples especially the influents were diluted so that doc was below 10 mg l jiang et al 2018 stedmon and bro 2008 and then the samples were mixed thoroughly to ensure homogeneity excitation emission matrix eem was acquired using a f 7000 fl hitachi spectrophotometer by setting excitation different types of fluorescent groups in the tww were distinguished by the combination of eem and parallel factor analysis parallel factor analysis parafac scanning electron microscope sem images were taken according to the method described by chen et al 2020a 3 results 3 1 nitrogen conversion and pn performance figs 2a and 2b demonstrate the nitrogen conversion profile i e nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in two reactors under different light conditions in the activated sludge system and microalgae bacteria consortium system respectively in phase 1 the increments of influent nh4 n concentration up to 300 mg l resulted in the increased fa level with the maximum value of 6 50 mg l fig 2c meanwhile no2 n gradually dominated in the effluent with the concentration sharply increasing from 16 0 4 and 12 0 4 mg l day 0 to 149 11 and 141 10 mg l day 49 in r1 and r2 respectively while less than 10 0 mg l no3 n was detected in both reactors at the end of phase 1 the variations of n species gradually enhanced nar fig 2c specifically from 19 4 and 17 6 day 0 to 92 6 and 88 7 day 49 in r1 and r2 respectively indicating the successful establishment of pn in both reactors this observation was also supported by the variations of aob and nob activities in the system as illustrated in fig 2d in phase 1 saor stabilized at approximate 9 00 mg n g mlvss h while snor showed a sharp decrease by 97 1 in phase 2 starting from day 70 two reactors were operated with or without light treatment to respectively establish the imbc pn system and pn sludge system specifically in phase 2a the light treatment at es of 0 0188 0 0553 kj mg vss did not deteriorate the ammonium oxidation and pn performance with the nh4 n removal efficiency of 95 0 2 and nar of 95 0 2 respectively after around 40 day light irradiation the indigenous microalgae started to be observed in r1 details in section 3 2 fig 3 e indicating the start up of the imbc pn system subsequently in phase 2b day 121 156 the maintenance of pn in two different microbial systems showed comparable nars 95 0 3 in r1 vs 90 0 5 in r2 however the activities of aob and nob varied in two reactors as shown in fig 2d in r1 saor slightly increased to 9 91 mg n g mlvss h and snor was reduced to almost 0 while in r2 saor reduced by 21 5 compared with that in r1 8 35 mg n g mlvss h in r2 vs 10 6 mg n g mlvss h in r1 in this regard the light effects on aob and nob activities were investigated considering the illumination power time and sludge concentration in r1 in phase 2a the es value ranged at 0 0188 0 0553 kj mg vss the aob activity was significantly stimulated with raob of 133 but nob was light inhibited as indicated by the rnob of 56 3 further increase of the es to 0 0203 0 0598 kj mg vss decreased the nob activity supporting the stable pn in the imbc pn system however in r1 the pn systems were unexpectedly destroyed in phase 3 day 157 to 181 which was supported by the increased concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n as well as the 1 29 fold decreased nar down to 70 0 as compared with 90 31 in phase 2 similar situation also occurred in r2 to restore the pn process starting from day 157 phase 3 the influent nh4 n was increased and the do level was decreased as expected the nar in r1 gradually recovered to 81 0 3 after day 173 and maintained around 86 0 2 till the end however the recovery was not achieved in r2 and the system was destroyed with the nar and nh4 n removal efficiency dropping to 36 1 and 37 0 by the end of phase 3 respectively taken together r1 showed better performance on pn maintenance as compared with r2 the fa levels in the influent were monitored between 5 87 6 77 mg l meanwhile the variations of fa ph and fna along with nitrogenous species were also investigated in r1 in phase 1 as shown in fig 2e f specifically during the anoxic stage 0 4 h the nh4 n level maintained relatively stable but fa constantly grew from 1 64 to 5 86 mg l due to the increasing ph 7 28 to 7 85 with the processing of denitrification subsequently during 4 12 h the fa level started to drop as nh4 n was converted into no2 n 0 329 0 0727 mg l at 12 h in this stage ph decreased continuously to 7 11 in the 9th hour and subsequently the alkalinity was added to r1 to maintain ph at 7 0 7 5 the combination of no2 n accumulation and ph variation resulted in the sharp increase of fna from 0 002 at 4 h to 0 028 mg l at 12 h therefore the system presented the alternating fa and fna variations with both ranges above the threshold for nob inhibition as reported before duan et al 2019 3 2 consortium biomass variations and settling performance chlorophyll level i e chlorophyll a and b and mlss were specifically determined to monitor the variations of microalgal and bacterial biomass concentrations in phase 1 microbial biomass concentration maintained relatively stable in both reactors as expected in phase 2 the chlorophyll concentration showed an increasing trend in r1 fig 3a demonstrating the successful enrichment of the indigenous microalgae under the appropriate light irradiation it should be noted that mlss reductions were observed in both reactors in this phase fig 3b probably due to the fact that there was insufficient carbon source in the low c n tww for microbial assimilation and reproduction this reduction was even more severe in r2 in phase 3 with 18 7 lower mlss than that in phase 2 compared with r1 r2 demonstrated 1 7 fold higher average mlss decline rate from phase 1d to phase 2b indicating the rapid loss or absence of functional microorganisms in r2 however in r1 with the increasing microalgal biomass in phase 3 mlss was increased by 4 when comparing with phase 2b the differences on the mlss variation observed in the two reactors were likely due to the contribution of the algae secreted organics that could be used as carbon source for denitrification this was supported by the batch tests which investigated the organic matters released during the microalgal growth as shown in fig 3c in the two groups with different initial microalgal biomass concentrations 1 32 mg l and 5 32 mg l the chlorophyll increased on the first 4 days by assimilating organics in the tww in terms of the reduced cod levels subsequently the cod levels increased until the end when the nutrient n and p was depleted and the microalgae achieved their stable growth stage these results showed that microalgae continuously secreted and released organic matters into the medium moreover in the presence of microalgae r1 showed relatively better settling performance than r2 after phase 2 in fig 3d 7 50 8 40 lower svi values were obtained in r1 and consortium could be settled within 30 min in the decanting step resulting in a relatively clear supernatant and low total suspended solid tss average tss in the effluent 45 0 15 mg l microscope and sem investigations confirmed the mutual attachment between microalgae and bacteria cells in the imbc pn system fig 3e 3 3 removal properties of organic matter tww contained various organic matters with different fluorescence characteristics which also resulted in fluctuation on the cod levels therefore eem parafac was performed to compare the organic removals in the two different sludge systems a total of three components were identified from the influent and effluent with the contour maps shown in fig 4 specifically both component 1 c1 and component 2 c2 had a single excitation maximum ex max and a single emission maximum em max but at different wavelengths ex max em max for c1 and c2 280 nm 364 nm and 330 nm 400 nm respectively these results suggested that c1 and c2 were likely to be tryptophan like and microbial humic like substances however component 3 c3 had two em maxs of 270 and 375 nm with a single em max at 468 nm indicating that the fluorescence intensity response values here were similar to terrestrial humic like substances as shown in fig 4d the removal efficiency of c1 in r1 was 76 49 which was 23 69 higher than r2 removal efficiency of r2 61 84 however similar removal performance for c2 and c3 were observed in r1 and r2 fig 4e and 4f 3 4 microbial community dynamics and nitrogen functional genes analysis proteobacteria and bacteroidota two common bacteria which generally contribute to the removal of cod and nh4 n in the wastewater treatment system were observed to be the main functional bacteria in r1 fig 5 a d specifically the abundance of proteobacteria increased from 38 5 in the seed sludge to 60 0 in the following three phases similarly at the genus level the relative abundance of nitrosomonas which belongs to proteobacteria showed around 20 fold higher levels in the later phases as compared with phase 0 fig s4 comparatively the proportion of bacteroidota was stable in the system and this was likely attributed to the stable ratio of norank f saprospiraceae and niabella which were the main genus of bacteroidota at the genus level moreover as the main nob nitrospirota accounted for 0 390 in phase 0 while it was not detected in the subsequent phases which confirmed the pn establishment and demonstrated the critical role of the aob in nitrogen removal additionally the abundance of chloroflexi and actinobacteriota were relatively stable while the cyanobacteria level was increased from 0 to 1 64 in phase 3 regarding microalgae in phase 3 tetradesmus obliquus 72 2 and desmodesmus 26 8 were the two dominant species of indigenous microalgae in r1 with similar proportions as observed in phase 2 fig 5e to reveal the nitrogen metabolism in different phases of imbc pn system fig 5f picrust prediction was carried out using kegg database to screen the functional enzymes related to nitrogen transformation fig 5g among the four samples 24 functional enzymes were coupled with five nitrogen transformation processes fig 5f including nitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia anra dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra denitrification and nitrogen fixation respectively firstly for the nitrification process including four essential enzymes of ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxyamine dehydrogenase hao hydroxyamine reductase hcp and nitrite oxidoreductase nxra and nxrb the relative abundance of three amo types amoa amob and amoc presented the obvious increasing trend in the subsequent phases which was consistent with the variation of aob abundance fig s5 however hcp and hao demonstrated different responses to the reactor operation in phase 0 the relative abundance of hcp 367 was 4 7 fold over the hao 78 5 however the relative abundance of hao in the subsequent phases was 11 7 13 8 times higher than hcp in the corresponding phases probably which was likely due to the fa effect in phase 1 fig 2c the relative abundance of nxra and nxrb demonstrated a 2 65 fold and 2 79 foldincrease from phase 0 to phase 2 and a slight decrease was observed in phase 3 secondly among the three nitrate reduction groups including anra dnra and denitrification fig 5f different limiting steps were identified to be more specific the 8 9 fold higher abundance of nasa 5063 52 than nira 570 31 suggested that it was difficult to reduce nitrite to ammonia as compared with the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the anra process four dnra groups namely nari napab nirbd and nrfa were essential in the reduction to ammonia from nitrate contrary to the observations in anra the average abundance of nirbd 12 800 5 was 12 2 times of napab 1047 85 indicating that there was more barrier in the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in denitrification the abundance of each gene nirk norbc and nosz was enhanced in phase 3 however compared with phase 1 and 2 the slightly down regulated nirk and norb genes and the up regulated norz in phase 3 implied that after the stable imbc pn was established the reductions of nitrite to nitric oxide and nitric oxide to nitrous oxide were both retarded while further reduction from nitrous oxide to nitrogen was accelerated 4 discussion this study initiated the pn using alternating fa fna condition fig 2f in phase 1 initial fa at 1 64 5 86 mg l and subsequent fna at 0 002 0 028 mg l in the activated sludge system treating tww afterwards in phase 2 in the imbc system pn was maintained largely by two factors firstly light treatment with appropriate energy intensity for selectively stimulating aob and inhibiting nob secondly prompt nitrite type denitrification with the algae secreted organics for nitrite reduction rather than nitrite oxidation 4 1 pn maintenance in pn imbc system by light treatment and prompt nitrite type denitrification 4 1 1 aob stimulation and nob inhibition by appropriate specific light energy density as one of the most influencing parameters in mbc system light effects e g light photoperiod and density on microalgae have been extensively investigated in pure microalgae systems comparatively research regarding the light influence on the performance of nitrifiers in activated sludge was insufficient in this study the light irradiation condition in r1 selectively achieved aob stimulation while nob inhibition which was the primary factor for the maintenance of pn in imbc system as shown in fig 2d under the condition of es at 0 0203 0 1571 kj mg vss the raob in r1 was significantly increased by 120 0 compared with the stable raob 8 35 in the r2 this was consistent with our recent observation proposing the light density dependent photostimulation photoinhibition on nitrifies yang et al 2022 the appropriate light energy density applied on nitrifiers could regulate the metabolism of aob as indicated by the promoted electron transport system activity increased key enzyme activity i e amo up regulated gene expression i e amoa and enhanced energy production i e reduced atp consumption while the nob inhibition was ascribed to the joint light responses of metabolic disorders and lipid peroxidation similarly intense blue light was also found to induce the no2 n accumulation by selective photoinhibition of nob whose c type cytochrome was known to be photo bleachable at 408 nm kang et al 2018 it is worth noting that in the imbc pn system the selection of light conditions should not only consider the light intensity but also comprehensively take the three independent light factors i e using the es factor considering light power light time and sludge concentration into consideration both aob and nob activities were inhibited when the light intensity was too high especially when es was over 0 18 kj mg vss similar result was found that high light density 720 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 reduced the growth rate and photosynthetic activity of chlorella sp although its nutrient absorption efficiency was similar to that of low density group 54 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 chen et al 2021 therefore in the culture of imbc system the light condition should be optimized to balance microalgae and nitrifying bacteria to maintain the pn stability which also additionally promoted energy saving with photo oxygenation 4 1 2 prompt nitrite type denitrification using the algae secreted organics the excessive accumulation of no2 n in the reactor provided substrates for nob oxidation which impeded the stability of pn thus the timely denitrification was conducive to the maintenance of pn insufficient carbon source for denitrification and microbial assimilation reproduction was one of important factor deteriorating the pn in phase 3 in r2 the sludge biomass in both reactors decreased continuously which was partially due to the lack of organics moreover the carbon source determined by the eem was mainly composed of humic acid accounting for around 70 and tryptophan accounting for around 30 both of which were regarded as an unsatisfactory carbon source due to its refractory degradability collado et al 2018 comparatively in r1 of imbc system it was believed that indigenous microalgae might produce organic matters zang et al 2022 which could be used for denitrification and bacterial metabolism this is further supported by the batch tests fig 3c showing that the continuous microalgal growth was observed by initially using the organics in the influent decreasing cod and subsequently using the algae secreted organics increasing cod the supernatant of microalgae culture on day 10 in the batch test was obtained and it was found that the algae secreted organics could be applied as carbon source to promote nitrite type denitrification details shown in text s2 microalgae continuously secreted organic matters into the medium suggesting the improved availability of carbon source in the imbc pn system in addition to microalgae other cellulose carbon sources such as straw wheat straw and sawdust have also been reported as natural carbon sources to promote denitrification fu et al 2022 most importantly the algae secreted organics could also be served as the biodegradable carbons for nitrite type denitrification using no2 n which could avoid the unexpected no2 n oxidation and eventually facilitate the maintenance of pn stability in the imbc system for example in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands microalgae released organic matters in the process of microalgal decomposition which was shown as the carbon source for denitrification zhong et al 2019 nonetheless detailed research applying microalgae as the carbon source for no2 n removal has been poorly reported hindering the understanding of nitrogen removal in imbc system therefore the carbon source release rate and denitrification efficiency should be further explored 4 2 community structure dynamics of bacteria and microalgae in the imbc pn system both the bacterial diversity and microbial population decreased during the experiment period this was supported by the lower simpson index as well as the higher shannon index ace index and chao index in the sample in phase 0 compared with those in later phases fig s3a and b demonstrating that the microbial population in the inoculum sludge phase 0 was more abundant these observations were in line with a previous study in which the richness and diversity of microorganisms decreased in mbc system cultivation zhang et al 2022 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes as the dominant bacterial phyla in pn imbc are common functional bacteria in wastewater treatment systems deng et al 2021 actinobacteriota has a beneficial effect in promoting sludge flocculation liu et al 2019 chloroflexi has recently been reported with a potential in macromolecule degradation such as in degrading eps and utilizing dead biomass li et al 2020 these two phyla were essential in eps degradation and dead biomass utilization and contributed to the sludge flocculation and the pn imbc system stability moreover patescibacteria a newly defined super phylum was also observed in each phase fig 5a d which was prevalent in aquifer environment such as groundwater with less nutrition and low do tian et al 2020 as for the algal community according to the microbial analysis in fig 5e the proportion of indigenous microalgae was not significantly varied at different phases and no microalgae species were eliminated tetradesmus obliquus and desmodesmus were the dominant species of indigenous microalgae in r1 with similar proportion as compared with phase 2 which might be attributed to the good adaptation of the indigenous microalgae to wastewater tetradesmus obliquus has rapid growth rate and ability to accumulate substantial amounts of macromolecules additionally it could adapt to stressful conditions and utilize several sources of inorganic and organic carbon hence it is attracting attention especially in bioremediation and wastewater treatment bentahar and deschÃªnes 2022 desmodesmus on the other hand was a common green algal genus existing in freshwater bodies and even in the soil this genus was characterized by a high degree of phenotypic plasticity and depending on environmental conditions desmodesmus could be unicellular or colonial with two four or eight celled coenobia chen et al 2020b however when culturing in synthetic wastewater instead of tww in the current study chlorella sp njust 1 chlorella sp rather than tetradesmus obliquus and desmodesmus was surprisingly isolated chen et al 2021 therefore it suggests that the different types of indigenous microalgae even from the same seed sludge might be resulted from the special cultivation environment 4 3 nitrogen removal pathway in pn imbc system and environmental significance in order to explore the individual contributions of bacteria and microalgae towards nitrogen removal the concentrations of n species in the effluent were theoretically calculated based on the empirical formula described below eqs 7 10 and the detailed calculation process was described in text s7 when the imbc pn achieved stable operation the approximate 91 5 0 6 of influent nh4 n was mainly removed through bacterial metabolism which was consistent with a recent study on the synthetic domestic wastewater treated with algal mycelia pellets zhang et al 2022 in addition 8 50 0 4 of nh4 n was absorbed by microalgae as energy supply for the synthesis of cellular substances as shown in fig 5g the nitrogen metabolism of bacteria in r1 was mainly through three processes nitrification dnra and denitrification however in the process of anra the direct reduction from no2 n to nh4 n was relatively difficult from the perspective of nitrification process the promoted relative abundance of amo although phase 2 slightly decreased indicated the competitive relationship between aob and indigenous microalgae after its growth in phase 2 which might contribute to the reduction on the relative abundance of aob fig s4 however the aob activity was still enhanced as compared with phase 1 this suggested that although the aob abundance was decreased its ability to oxidize nh4 n was not essentially affected this observation was inconsistent with the conventional pn and nitrite type denitrification theory nh4 n is oxidized to no2 n by aob under oxic aeration eq 7 7 55nh4 76o2 109hco3 c5h7no2 54no2 57h2o 104h2co3 no2 n is oxidized to no3 n by nob under oxic aeration eq 8 8 400no2 195o2 nh4 4h2co3 hco3 c5h7no2 400no3 3h2o the overall reaction for bacteria assimilation is eq 9 9 nh4 1 83o2 1 98hco3 0 021c5h7no2 0 98no3 1 04h2o 1 88h2co3 microalgae assimilation with nh4 n and co2 for o2 production is eq 10 10 106co2 236h2o 16nh4 hpo4 2 c106h181o45n16p 118o2 171h2o 14h this study innovatively constructed the imbc pn system with timely nitrite type denitrification in tww which was operated for over 180 days with a relatively high nar value and nh4 n removal rate compared with the activated sludge system coupled with pn and nitrite type denitrification the current imbc pn system in tww shows a better performance in pn maintenance system stability prompt nitrite type denitrification and n removal compared with imbc coupled with conventional nitrification and denitrification the imbc pn has the potential to decrease sludge production with reduced demands on both oxygen and carbon source which is particularly important for enhanced nitrogen removal for low c n wastewater as shown in the fig 6 a and 6b the imbc coupled with conventional nitrification and denitrification system could save 18 8 of aeration and 10 0 of carbon source while produce 26 3 less sludge comparatively the imbc pn system reduces 23 5 oxygen 34 2 carbon source and 17 0 waste sludge fig 6c moreover regarding the removal of fluorescent organic compounds it is considered to mainly rely on the symbiotic system of bacteria and algae specificly the effective symbiotic relationship between bacteria and microalgae enriched the functional bacterial microbial community and hence improved the degradation performance of removing the humic like substance fluorescent organics in this study therefore the stable imbc pn system in r1 played essential roles in the degradation of all fluorescent components and nitrogen however it is still required to further investigate the pn stability by using the integrated strategy of fa and light irradiation when using algae secreted organics as carbon source the release rate and denitrification efficiency should be explored as well 5 conclusions after establishing stable pn appropriate light was selected to cultivate imbc pn system light irradiation with appropriate density successfully maintained the pn in the proposed imbc system additionally the algae secreted organics released by imbc was confirmed as a potential carbon source in the imbc system for timely denitrification to avoid the no2 n oxidation besides compared to the sludge system with pn and nitrite type denitrification in r2 the imbc pn system in r1 demonstrated a better performance in nitrogen removal capacity pn maintenance system stability organic matter removal and settlement taken together the hybrid imbc pn with timely nitrite type denitrification process demonstrated the potential as a sustainable and low cost technology for high nh4 n strength wastewater treatment such as tww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

14751,microalgae bacteria consortium mbc provides an alternative to sustainable treatment of human toilet wastewater tww and resource recovery this study compared the conventional activated sludge system and wastewater indigenous mbc system imbc for nitrogen removal in tww through the coupled partial nitrification pn and nitrite type denitrification process pn was firstly established by alternating fa and fna subsequently the successful pn maintenance with the nitrite accumulation rate ranging between 90 1 95 3 was achieved using two strategies light irradiation with the appropriate specific light energy density at 0 0188 0 0598 kj mg vss and the timely nitrite type denitrification with the algae secreted organics as the carbon source eventually resulting in the nitrite accumulation rate ranging between 90 1 95 3 in the imbc pn system bacterial metabolism contributed to 91 5 of nitrogen removal and the rest was through microalgal assimilation this study offers a sustainable hybrid imbc pn process for high nh4 n strength wastewater treatment e g tww which theoretically saves 23 5 aeration and 34 2 carbon source as well as reduces 17 0 sludge production keywords toilet wastewater indigenous microalgae bacteria consortium partial nitrification nitrite type denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rapid development of public transports such as high speed railways and aviation large amount of toilet wastewater tww with high ammonium nh4 n level is produced centralized biological nitrogen removal bnr process has been implemented as a promising way for nitrogen removal in tww through conventional nitrification and denitrification however this method requires aeration and external carbon which results in additional operation cost and limits its sustainability i e n recovery on a larger scale hence it is required to develop technologies that simultaneously treat tww and recover resources in a more sustainable manner microalgae bacteria consortium mbc is a sustainable approch where a complementary synergistic function was formed for efficient wastewater bioremediation and nutrient recovery and the synergistic function of the two has great potential in improving the removal efficiency of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus reducing the energy cost of wastewater treatment e g energy consumption of aeration and external carbon source and nitrous oxide n2o emission in enclosed open and aerated reactors li et al 2023 ramanan et al 2016 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 recently the mbc with the partial nitrification mbc pn was reported to further reduce the energy cost especially for the wastewater with high nh4 n levels and low c n e g landfill leachate wu et al 2018 similarly therefore the tww might be suitable for the application of the mbc pn process minimizing the requirement on aeration alkalinity and carbon source currently however the start up and maintenance of the mbc pn process remained at its early stage so far the process was mostly established in two steps firstly achieving pn by enriching ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in the activated sludge system using controlled conditions of free ammonia fa free nitrous acid fna or low dissolved oxygen do and then introducing the pure microalgae but this approach required a long start up period with the unexpected system stablility for example in the initial stage 50 days of a mbc pn system treating anaerobically digested swine manure centrate the continuous loss of the added algae biomass led to the weak symbiotic relationship between aob and pure microalgae as well as the unexpected system stability wang et al 2015 similar observation was reported in a granular mbc pn system where both the activity and the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae aob family were reduced due to the combined effect of sunlight exposure algal growth and fna application huang et al 2020 therefore novel approaches are urgently required to improve the start up and stable maintenance of the mbc pn treating tww recently a novel concept was proposed which consisted of two steps screening the wastewater indigenous mbc imbc and improvement of imbc adaptation in wastewater using the adaptive gradual stress increase strategy chen et al 2022 qiu et al 2021a qiu et al 2021b compared to both the pure microalgae strains and mbc the imbc were shown to have the potential to effectively adapt themselves to the wastewater system with better growth performance two fold growth rate as compared to the control and present superior nutrient uptake capacities recently the imbc pn process was succesfully applied in the treatment of municipal wastewater by optimizing the external light condition where microbial structure for pn was optimized with the enrichment of ellin6067 and other four nitrosomonadaceae genera wang et al 2021 similar light induced pn observation was also reported in a granular mbc treating synthetic wastewater si et al 2022 on the other hand the excessive accumulation of no2 n in the imbc pn system provides a substrate for nob oxidation which would destroy the stability of pn thus the timely denitrification should be achieved which is conducive to the maintenance of pn above all it is hypothesized that the combination of fa fna in tww and light application might achieve imbc pn coupled with nitrite type denitrification for tww bioremediation therefore the goal of this study was to propose an integrated imbc pn process using light irradiation for the real tww bioremediation specifically the start up and maintenance mechanism of pn in the reactor was firstly explored using the combined strategies moreover its performance in pn maintenance organic matter removal and the imbc system settlement were also evaluated the imbc pn system was then further analyzed from the perspective of microorganism through microbial community dynamics and picrust forecast the observations of this study are expected to provide insights on expanding the feasibility of imbc pn in tww bioremediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 tww composition and sludge source the tww used in this study was collected from a toilet at nanjing university of science and technology nanjing china and stored in the refrigerator for further use in the raw tww nitrogen mainly existed in the form of urea which was gradually decomposed to be ammonium nh4 n stabilizing at 6000 mg l with ph variations ph ranges 6 63 9 30 fig s1 the specific characteristics of the undiluted tww were shown in table s1 nh4 n 6473 7 6537 6 mg l tn 6501 2 6623 5 mg l tp 383 4 391 6 mg l total cod 6210 6328 mg l ph 9 29 9 43 the sludge inoculum was collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp nanjing china performing conventional nitrification and denitrification 2 2 reactor set up operation and monitoring two identical sequencing batch reactors sbrs r1 and r2 with the working volume of 0 5 l were set up at a constant room temperature of 23 2 c fig 1 r1 was illuminated using a cool white fluorescent light philips cool whit 5 8 w while r2 was conducted without light exposure as the control each reactor was inoculated with sludge concentration at 3000 200 mg l based on the preliminary inhibition experiments results the diluted tww without sterilization containing around 300 mg l nh4 n was used for both sbrs both sbrs were operated one 13 hour cycle per day which was composed of five periods including anoxic feeding 5 min anoxic reaction 240 min aerobic reaction 480 min settling 50 min and decanting 5 min at the end of each cycle 250 ml wastewater was discharged from the reactor maintaining the hydraulic retention time hrt at 26 h and the sludge was not deliberately discharged except for the sludge loss via effluent the solids residence time srt in the reactor was not controlled do and ph were monitored using the ph oxi340i meter wtw company germany and controlled at 3 0 4 0 mg o2 l in aeration unless otherwise specified and 7 0 8 0 using the programmable logic controller system respectively the magnetic stirrer ika company germany at 1000 rpm was used to provide even mixing and mass transfer environment samples were collected at the end of each cycle to determine the n concentration in the effluent both sbrs were operated with the same strategies in three different phases after the initial 35 day sludge inoculation phase phase 0 the high nh4 n concentration in the raw undiluted tww was shown inhibiting algal growth and reducing the activities of nitrifiers in active sludge which was previously used to treat municipal wastewater additionally considering the fact that the flushing dilution effect on the collected tww in the real washing room as shown in table 1 in phase 1 day 0 70 the diluted tww was fed into two sbrs at the stepwise increasing nh4 n loading rates up to 300 mg l to initiate the pn the influent nh4 n increased by four gradients in phase 1 was recorded as phase 1a 50 100 mg l 1b 50 200 mg l 1c 200 250 mg l and 1d 300 mg l respectively when nitrite accumulation rate nar eq 1 approximately achieved 90 it was considered as the successful establishment of pn nar was calculated by eq 1 where c no 3 n and c no 2 n represented the effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations respectively in this phase fa and fna concentrations were also estimated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively abbew et al 2022 shen et al 2020 yamamoto et al 2008 1 nar c no 2 n mg l c no 2 n mg l c no 3 n mg l 100 2 fa mg l 1 214 nh 4 n mg l

irradiation to initiate and enrich the indigenous microalgae consortium eventually establishing the imbc pn system the light irradiation condition applied in imbc system was determined in terms of the specific light energy density es kj mg vss using eq 4 to present the actual illumination conditions in the reactor wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 which systematically considered the synergistic effects of illumination power p w time t h and sludge concentration mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss mg l as shown in table 1 phase 2 was subdivided into phase 2a day 71 120 and phase 2b day 121 156 when the pn imbc system was initiated with observable microalgal growth in r2 the experiment was proceeded into phase 3 day 157 181 and the same operations were applied for both reactors this phase was designed to compare the maintenance of pn system performance e g biomass variations and removal of organic matters of r1 was compared with that of r2 in phase 2b and 3 afterwards the influent nh4 n concentration was increased while the do level was reduced which eventually resulted in a fluctuated and slowly increased nar see fig 2 c and section 3 1 in contrast the nar of r2 continued to drop sharply 4 es kj mg vss 0 03 3 6 p t v mlvss 2 3 batch test contributions of the algae secreted organics to pn maintenance microalgal decomposition resulted in the release of the algae secreted organics that could be used as carbon source for denitrification in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands zhong et al 2019 therefore it was hypothesized that microalgae in imbc pn system might also secret organics that could be further utilized by bacteria such as denitrifies for denitrification this speculation was studied in phase 3 using batch tests imbc were roughly separated from bacteria in r1 by natural precipitation due to their different settling velocities the detailed procedures were described in text s2 specifically two 250 ml conical flasks were used as the reactors fig s2 under the same conditions i e wastewater light condition stirring and aeration as those for r1 operations but with different initial imbc inoculation concentrations 1 32 and 5 32 mg l the experiment was operated for 10 days and the variations of chlorophyll and cod in medium were measured every 2 days to evaluate the relationship between microalgal growth and organic matter released during the cultivation 2 4 estimation of aob and nob activities the activities of aob and nob were investigated in batch tests throughout the experiment phases they were indicated by the specific ammonium oxidation rate saor and specific nitrite oxidation rate snor respectively briefly nh4cl n or nano2 n solution was manually added into the biomass in conical flasks to achieve the specific initial concentrations ph controlled at 7 5 0 2 do controlled 3 0 0 5 mg l and the nh4 n or no2 n level was measured every 20 min or 10 min to obtain the saor and snor the detailed procedures were described in text s3 the ratio of saor in phase x to that in phase x 1 was defined as raob to indicate the variations of relative activities of aob raob using eq 5 similarly rnob was indicated for the variations of nob activities as shown in eq 6 5 raob sao r phase x sao r phase x 1 6 rnob sno r phase x sno r phase x 1 2 5 microbial analysis miseq illumina sequencing technology was applied to analyze the sludge samples of bacteria and microalgae symbiosis system at the level of 16s rrna bacteria and 18s rrna samples were collected from r1 at the end of each phase by centrifuging at 5000

mixed liquor samples were taken by syringes and immediately filtered through 0 45 Î¼m filter papers prior to analysis the levels of nh4 n no3 n no2 n mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlss mlvss chemical oxygen demand cod and sludge volume index svi were measured according to standard methods apha 2012 before fluorescence analysis to minimize the inner filtering effects all samples especially the influents were diluted so that doc was below 10 mg l jiang et al 2018 stedmon and bro 2008 and then the samples were mixed thoroughly to ensure homogeneity excitation emission matrix eem was acquired using a f 7000 fl hitachi spectrophotometer by setting excitation different types of fluorescent groups in the tww were distinguished by the combination of eem and parallel factor analysis parallel factor analysis parafac scanning electron microscope sem images were taken according to the method described by chen et al 2020a 3 results 3 1 nitrogen conversion and pn performance figs 2a and 2b demonstrate the nitrogen conversion profile i e nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in two reactors under different light conditions in the activated sludge system and microalgae bacteria consortium system respectively in phase 1 the increments of influent nh4 n concentration up to 300 mg l resulted in the increased fa level with the maximum value of 6 50 mg l fig 2c meanwhile no2 n gradually dominated in the effluent with the concentration sharply increasing from 16 0 4 and 12 0 4 mg l day 0 to 149 11 and 141 10 mg l day 49 in r1 and r2 respectively while less than 10 0 mg l no3 n was detected in both reactors at the end of phase 1 the variations of n species gradually enhanced nar fig 2c specifically from 19 4 and 17 6 day 0 to 92 6 and 88 7 day 49 in r1 and r2 respectively indicating the successful establishment of pn in both reactors this observation was also supported by the variations of aob and nob activities in the system as illustrated in fig 2d in phase 1 saor stabilized at approximate 9 00 mg n g mlvss h while snor showed a sharp decrease by 97 1 in phase 2 starting from day 70 two reactors were operated with or without light treatment to respectively establish the imbc pn system and pn sludge system specifically in phase 2a the light treatment at es of 0 0188 0 0553 kj mg vss did not deteriorate the ammonium oxidation and pn performance with the nh4 n removal efficiency of 95 0 2 and nar of 95 0 2 respectively after around 40 day light irradiation the indigenous microalgae started to be observed in r1 details in section 3 2 fig 3 e indicating the start up of the imbc pn system subsequently in phase 2b day 121 156 the maintenance of pn in two different microbial systems showed comparable nars 95 0 3 in r1 vs 90 0 5 in r2 however the activities of aob and nob varied in two reactors as shown in fig 2d in r1 saor slightly increased to 9 91 mg n g mlvss h and snor was reduced to almost 0 while in r2 saor reduced by 21 5 compared with that in r1 8 35 mg n g mlvss h in r2 vs 10 6 mg n g mlvss h in r1 in this regard the light effects on aob and nob activities were investigated considering the illumination power time and sludge concentration in r1 in phase 2a the es value ranged at 0 0188 0 0553 kj mg vss the aob activity was significantly stimulated with raob of 133 but nob was light inhibited as indicated by the rnob of 56 3 further increase of the es to 0 0203 0 0598 kj mg vss decreased the nob activity supporting the stable pn in the imbc pn system however in r1 the pn systems were unexpectedly destroyed in phase 3 day 157 to 181 which was supported by the increased concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n as well as the 1 29 fold decreased nar down to 70 0 as compared with 90 31 in phase 2 similar situation also occurred in r2 to restore the pn process starting from day 157 phase 3 the influent nh4 n was increased and the do level was decreased as expected the nar in r1 gradually recovered to 81 0 3 after day 173 and maintained around 86 0 2 till the end however the recovery was not achieved in r2 and the system was destroyed with the nar and nh4 n removal efficiency dropping to 36 1 and 37 0 by the end of phase 3 respectively taken together r1 showed better performance on pn maintenance as compared with r2 the fa levels in the influent were monitored between 5 87 6 77 mg l meanwhile the variations of fa ph and fna along with nitrogenous species were also investigated in r1 in phase 1 as shown in fig 2e f specifically during the anoxic stage 0 4 h the nh4 n level maintained relatively stable but fa constantly grew from 1 64 to 5 86 mg l due to the increasing ph 7 28 to 7 85 with the processing of denitrification subsequently during 4 12 h the fa level started to drop as nh4 n was converted into no2 n 0 329 0 0727 mg l at 12 h in this stage ph decreased continuously to 7 11 in the 9th hour and subsequently the alkalinity was added to r1 to maintain ph at 7 0 7 5 the combination of no2 n accumulation and ph variation resulted in the sharp increase of fna from 0 002 at 4 h to 0 028 mg l at 12 h therefore the system presented the alternating fa and fna variations with both ranges above the threshold for nob inhibition as reported before duan et al 2019 3 2 consortium biomass variations and settling performance chlorophyll level i e chlorophyll a and b and mlss were specifically determined to monitor the variations of microalgal and bacterial biomass concentrations in phase 1 microbial biomass concentration maintained relatively stable in both reactors as expected in phase 2 the chlorophyll concentration showed an increasing trend in r1 fig 3a demonstrating the successful enrichment of the indigenous microalgae under the appropriate light irradiation it should be noted that mlss reductions were observed in both reactors in this phase fig 3b probably due to the fact that there was insufficient carbon source in the low c n tww for microbial assimilation and reproduction this reduction was even more severe in r2 in phase 3 with 18 7 lower mlss than that in phase 2 compared with r1 r2 demonstrated 1 7 fold higher average mlss decline rate from phase 1d to phase 2b indicating the rapid loss or absence of functional microorganisms in r2 however in r1 with the increasing microalgal biomass in phase 3 mlss was increased by 4 when comparing with phase 2b the differences on the mlss variation observed in the two reactors were likely due to the contribution of the algae secreted organics that could be used as carbon source for denitrification this was supported by the batch tests which investigated the organic matters released during the microalgal growth as shown in fig 3c in the two groups with different initial microalgal biomass concentrations 1 32 mg l and 5 32 mg l the chlorophyll increased on the first 4 days by assimilating organics in the tww in terms of the reduced cod levels subsequently the cod levels increased until the end when the nutrient n and p was depleted and the microalgae achieved their stable growth stage these results showed that microalgae continuously secreted and released organic matters into the medium moreover in the presence of microalgae r1 showed relatively better settling performance than r2 after phase 2 in fig 3d 7 50 8 40 lower svi values were obtained in r1 and consortium could be settled within 30 min in the decanting step resulting in a relatively clear supernatant and low total suspended solid tss average tss in the effluent 45 0 15 mg l microscope and sem investigations confirmed the mutual attachment between microalgae and bacteria cells in the imbc pn system fig 3e 3 3 removal properties of organic matter tww contained various organic matters with different fluorescence characteristics which also resulted in fluctuation on the cod levels therefore eem parafac was performed to compare the organic removals in the two different sludge systems a total of three components were identified from the influent and effluent with the contour maps shown in fig 4 specifically both component 1 c1 and component 2 c2 had a single excitation maximum ex max and a single emission maximum em max but at different wavelengths ex max em max for c1 and c2 280 nm 364 nm and 330 nm 400 nm respectively these results suggested that c1 and c2 were likely to be tryptophan like and microbial humic like substances however component 3 c3 had two em maxs of 270 and 375 nm with a single em max at 468 nm indicating that the fluorescence intensity response values here were similar to terrestrial humic like substances as shown in fig 4d the removal efficiency of c1 in r1 was 76 49 which was 23 69 higher than r2 removal efficiency of r2 61 84 however similar removal performance for c2 and c3 were observed in r1 and r2 fig 4e and 4f 3 4 microbial community dynamics and nitrogen functional genes analysis proteobacteria and bacteroidota two common bacteria which generally contribute to the removal of cod and nh4 n in the wastewater treatment system were observed to be the main functional bacteria in r1 fig 5 a d specifically the abundance of proteobacteria increased from 38 5 in the seed sludge to 60 0 in the following three phases similarly at the genus level the relative abundance of nitrosomonas which belongs to proteobacteria showed around 20 fold higher levels in the later phases as compared with phase 0 fig s4 comparatively the proportion of bacteroidota was stable in the system and this was likely attributed to the stable ratio of norank f saprospiraceae and niabella which were the main genus of bacteroidota at the genus level moreover as the main nob nitrospirota accounted for 0 390 in phase 0 while it was not detected in the subsequent phases which confirmed the pn establishment and demonstrated the critical role of the aob in nitrogen removal additionally the abundance of chloroflexi and actinobacteriota were relatively stable while the cyanobacteria level was increased from 0 to 1 64 in phase 3 regarding microalgae in phase 3 tetradesmus obliquus 72 2 and desmodesmus 26 8 were the two dominant species of indigenous microalgae in r1 with similar proportions as observed in phase 2 fig 5e to reveal the nitrogen metabolism in different phases of imbc pn system fig 5f picrust prediction was carried out using kegg database to screen the functional enzymes related to nitrogen transformation fig 5g among the four samples 24 functional enzymes were coupled with five nitrogen transformation processes fig 5f including nitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia anra dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra denitrification and nitrogen fixation respectively firstly for the nitrification process including four essential enzymes of ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxyamine dehydrogenase hao hydroxyamine reductase hcp and nitrite oxidoreductase nxra and nxrb the relative abundance of three amo types amoa amob and amoc presented the obvious increasing trend in the subsequent phases which was consistent with the variation of aob abundance fig s5 however hcp and hao demonstrated different responses to the reactor operation in phase 0 the relative abundance of hcp 367 was 4 7 fold over the hao 78 5 however the relative abundance of hao in the subsequent phases was 11 7 13 8 times higher than hcp in the corresponding phases probably which was likely due to the fa effect in phase 1 fig 2c the relative abundance of nxra and nxrb demonstrated a 2 65 fold and 2 79 foldincrease from phase 0 to phase 2 and a slight decrease was observed in phase 3 secondly among the three nitrate reduction groups including anra dnra and denitrification fig 5f different limiting steps were identified to be more specific the 8 9 fold higher abundance of nasa 5063 52 than nira 570 31 suggested that it was difficult to reduce nitrite to ammonia as compared with the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the anra process four dnra groups namely nari napab nirbd and nrfa were essential in the reduction to ammonia from nitrate contrary to the observations in anra the average abundance of nirbd 12 800 5 was 12 2 times of napab 1047 85 indicating that there was more barrier in the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in denitrification the abundance of each gene nirk norbc and nosz was enhanced in phase 3 however compared with phase 1 and 2 the slightly down regulated nirk and norb genes and the up regulated norz in phase 3 implied that after the stable imbc pn was established the reductions of nitrite to nitric oxide and nitric oxide to nitrous oxide were both retarded while further reduction from nitrous oxide to nitrogen was accelerated 4 discussion this study initiated the pn using alternating fa fna condition fig 2f in phase 1 initial fa at 1 64 5 86 mg l and subsequent fna at 0 002 0 028 mg l in the activated sludge system treating tww afterwards in phase 2 in the imbc system pn was maintained largely by two factors firstly light treatment with appropriate energy intensity for selectively stimulating aob and inhibiting nob secondly prompt nitrite type denitrification with the algae secreted organics for nitrite reduction rather than nitrite oxidation 4 1 pn maintenance in pn imbc system by light treatment and prompt nitrite type denitrification 4 1 1 aob stimulation and nob inhibition by appropriate specific light energy density as one of the most influencing parameters in mbc system light effects e g light photoperiod and density on microalgae have been extensively investigated in pure microalgae systems comparatively research regarding the light influence on the performance of nitrifiers in activated sludge was insufficient in this study the light irradiation condition in r1 selectively achieved aob stimulation while nob inhibition which was the primary factor for the maintenance of pn in imbc system as shown in fig 2d under the condition of es at 0 0203 0 1571 kj mg vss the raob in r1 was significantly increased by 120 0 compared with the stable raob 8 35 in the r2 this was consistent with our recent observation proposing the light density dependent photostimulation photoinhibition on nitrifies yang et al 2022 the appropriate light energy density applied on nitrifiers could regulate the metabolism of aob as indicated by the promoted electron transport system activity increased key enzyme activity i e amo up regulated gene expression i e amoa and enhanced energy production i e reduced atp consumption while the nob inhibition was ascribed to the joint light responses of metabolic disorders and lipid peroxidation similarly intense blue light was also found to induce the no2 n accumulation by selective photoinhibition of nob whose c type cytochrome was known to be photo bleachable at 408 nm kang et al 2018 it is worth noting that in the imbc pn system the selection of light conditions should not only consider the light intensity but also comprehensively take the three independent light factors i e using the es factor considering light power light time and sludge concentration into consideration both aob and nob activities were inhibited when the light intensity was too high especially when es was over 0 18 kj mg vss similar result was found that high light density 720 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 reduced the growth rate and photosynthetic activity of chlorella sp although its nutrient absorption efficiency was similar to that of low density group 54 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 chen et al 2021 therefore in the culture of imbc system the light condition should be optimized to balance microalgae and nitrifying bacteria to maintain the pn stability which also additionally promoted energy saving with photo oxygenation 4 1 2 prompt nitrite type denitrification using the algae secreted organics the excessive accumulation of no2 n in the reactor provided substrates for nob oxidation which impeded the stability of pn thus the timely denitrification was conducive to the maintenance of pn insufficient carbon source for denitrification and microbial assimilation reproduction was one of important factor deteriorating the pn in phase 3 in r2 the sludge biomass in both reactors decreased continuously which was partially due to the lack of organics moreover the carbon source determined by the eem was mainly composed of humic acid accounting for around 70 and tryptophan accounting for around 30 both of which were regarded as an unsatisfactory carbon source due to its refractory degradability collado et al 2018 comparatively in r1 of imbc system it was believed that indigenous microalgae might produce organic matters zang et al 2022 which could be used for denitrification and bacterial metabolism this is further supported by the batch tests fig 3c showing that the continuous microalgal growth was observed by initially using the organics in the influent decreasing cod and subsequently using the algae secreted organics increasing cod the supernatant of microalgae culture on day 10 in the batch test was obtained and it was found that the algae secreted organics could be applied as carbon source to promote nitrite type denitrification details shown in text s2 microalgae continuously secreted organic matters into the medium suggesting the improved availability of carbon source in the imbc pn system in addition to microalgae other cellulose carbon sources such as straw wheat straw and sawdust have also been reported as natural carbon sources to promote denitrification fu et al 2022 most importantly the algae secreted organics could also be served as the biodegradable carbons for nitrite type denitrification using no2 n which could avoid the unexpected no2 n oxidation and eventually facilitate the maintenance of pn stability in the imbc system for example in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands microalgae released organic matters in the process of microalgal decomposition which was shown as the carbon source for denitrification zhong et al 2019 nonetheless detailed research applying microalgae as the carbon source for no2 n removal has been poorly reported hindering the understanding of nitrogen removal in imbc system therefore the carbon source release rate and denitrification efficiency should be further explored 4 2 community structure dynamics of bacteria and microalgae in the imbc pn system both the bacterial diversity and microbial population decreased during the experiment period this was supported by the lower simpson index as well as the higher shannon index ace index and chao index in the sample in phase 0 compared with those in later phases fig s3a and b demonstrating that the microbial population in the inoculum sludge phase 0 was more abundant these observations were in line with a previous study in which the richness and diversity of microorganisms decreased in mbc system cultivation zhang et al 2022 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes as the dominant bacterial phyla in pn imbc are common functional bacteria in wastewater treatment systems deng et al 2021 actinobacteriota has a beneficial effect in promoting sludge flocculation liu et al 2019 chloroflexi has recently been reported with a potential in macromolecule degradation such as in degrading eps and utilizing dead biomass li et al 2020 these two phyla were essential in eps degradation and dead biomass utilization and contributed to the sludge flocculation and the pn imbc system stability moreover patescibacteria a newly defined super phylum was also observed in each phase fig 5a d which was prevalent in aquifer environment such as groundwater with less nutrition and low do tian et al 2020 as for the algal community according to the microbial analysis in fig 5e the proportion of indigenous microalgae was not significantly varied at different phases and no microalgae species were eliminated tetradesmus obliquus and desmodesmus were the dominant species of indigenous microalgae in r1 with similar proportion as compared with phase 2 which might be attributed to the good adaptation of the indigenous microalgae to wastewater tetradesmus obliquus has rapid growth rate and ability to accumulate substantial amounts of macromolecules additionally it could adapt to stressful conditions and utilize several sources of inorganic and organic carbon hence it is attracting attention especially in bioremediation and wastewater treatment bentahar and deschÃªnes 2022 desmodesmus on the other hand was a common green algal genus existing in freshwater bodies and even in the soil this genus was characterized by a high degree of phenotypic plasticity and depending on environmental conditions desmodesmus could be unicellular or colonial with two four or eight celled coenobia chen et al 2020b however when culturing in synthetic wastewater instead of tww in the current study chlorella sp njust 1 chlorella sp rather than tetradesmus obliquus and desmodesmus was surprisingly isolated chen et al 2021 therefore it suggests that the different types of indigenous microalgae even from the same seed sludge might be resulted from the special cultivation environment 4 3 nitrogen removal pathway in pn imbc system and environmental significance in order to explore the individual contributions of bacteria and microalgae towards nitrogen removal the concentrations of n species in the effluent were theoretically calculated based on the empirical formula described below eqs 7 10 and the detailed calculation process was described in text s7 when the imbc pn achieved stable operation the approximate 91 5 0 6 of influent nh4 n was mainly removed through bacterial metabolism which was consistent with a recent study on the synthetic domestic wastewater treated with algal mycelia pellets zhang et al 2022 in addition 8 50 0 4 of nh4 n was absorbed by microalgae as energy supply for the synthesis of cellular substances as shown in fig 5g the nitrogen metabolism of bacteria in r1 was mainly through three processes nitrification dnra and denitrification however in the process of anra the direct reduction from no2 n to nh4 n was relatively difficult from the perspective of nitrification process the promoted relative abundance of amo although phase 2 slightly decreased indicated the competitive relationship between aob and indigenous microalgae after its growth in phase 2 which might contribute to the reduction on the relative abundance of aob fig s4 however the aob activity was still enhanced as compared with phase 1 this suggested that although the aob abundance was decreased its ability to oxidize nh4 n was not essentially affected this observation was inconsistent with the conventional pn and nitrite type denitrification theory nh4 n is oxidized to no2 n by aob under oxic aeration eq 7 7 55nh4 76o2 109hco3 c5h7no2 54no2 57h2o 104h2co3 no2 n is oxidized to no3 n by nob under oxic aeration eq 8 8 400no2 195o2 nh4 4h2co3 hco3 c5h7no2 400no3 3h2o the overall reaction for bacteria assimilation is eq 9 9 nh4 1 83o2 1 98hco3 0 021c5h7no2 0 98no3 1 04h2o 1 88h2co3 microalgae assimilation with nh4 n and co2 for o2 production is eq 10 10 106co2 236h2o 16nh4 hpo4 2 c106h181o45n16p 118o2 171h2o 14h this study innovatively constructed the imbc pn system with timely nitrite type denitrification in tww which was operated for over 180 days with a relatively high nar value and nh4 n removal rate compared with the activated sludge system coupled with pn and nitrite type denitrification the current imbc pn system in tww shows a better performance in pn maintenance system stability prompt nitrite type denitrification and n removal compared with imbc coupled with conventional nitrification and denitrification the imbc pn has the potential to decrease sludge production with reduced demands on both oxygen and carbon source which is particularly important for enhanced nitrogen removal for low c n wastewater as shown in the fig 6 a and 6b the imbc coupled with conventional nitrification and denitrification system could save 18 8 of aeration and 10 0 of carbon source while produce 26 3 less sludge comparatively the imbc pn system reduces 23 5 oxygen 34 2 carbon source and 17 0 waste sludge fig 6c moreover regarding the removal of fluorescent organic compounds it is considered to mainly rely on the symbiotic system of bacteria and algae specificly the effective symbiotic relationship between bacteria and microalgae enriched the functional bacterial microbial community and hence improved the degradation performance of removing the humic like substance fluorescent organics in this study therefore the stable imbc pn system in r1 played essential roles in the degradation of all fluorescent components and nitrogen however it is still required to further investigate the pn stability by using the integrated strategy of fa and light irradiation when using algae secreted organics as carbon source the release rate and denitrification efficiency should be explored as well 5 conclusions after establishing stable pn appropriate light was selected to cultivate imbc pn system light irradiation with appropriate density successfully maintained the pn in the proposed imbc system additionally the algae secreted organics released by imbc was confirmed as a potential carbon source in the imbc system for timely denitrification to avoid the no2 n oxidation besides compared to the sludge system with pn and nitrite type denitrification in r2 the imbc pn system in r1 demonstrated a better performance in nitrogen removal capacity pn maintenance system stability organic matter removal and settlement taken together the hybrid imbc pn with timely nitrite type denitrification process demonstrated the potential as a sustainable and low cost technology for high nh4 n strength wastewater treatment such as tww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

14752,real time information on flooding extent severity and duration is necessary for effective metropolitan flood emergency management existing pluvial flood analysis methods are unable to simulate real time regional flooding processes under spatiotemporally varying rainstorms this paper presents a deep learning enabled super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method to simulate the real time pluvial flooding process over a large area under spatiotemporally varying rainstorms compared with existing flood downscaling techniques which are limited to flow depth the proposed method produces high resolution flow depth and velocity predictions providing more comprehensive information for flood emergency management the proposed method adopts a coarse grid hydrodynamic model to generate a low resolution flood map time series which is subsequently converted to high resolution flood maps by a deep learning model the deep learning model can be trained using a limited number of assumed rainfall scenarios which greatly reduces data preparation effort the proposed method is applied to a complex terrain of 352 km2 in hong kong that covers both mountainous and urban areas results show that the proposed method simulates the spatiotemporal variations of flood depth and velocity with root mean square errors as low as 0 082 m and 0 088 m s respectively and correlation coefficients of 0 962 and 0 921 respectively the computation time for a 48 h rainfall event in the study area is less than 30 s which is 2690 times faster than the direct fine grid hydrodynamic analysis the deep learning enabled super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method provides a promising computational tool for emergency flood risk management keywords flooding hydrodynamic analysis deep learning super resolution downscaling emergency management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flooding is a global hazard that poses serious threats to human lives properties and the environment fauvel et al 2016 ten veldhuis et al 2010 from 1998 to 2017 floods affected more than two billion people ranking first among natural hazards in terms of affected population and caused more than 142 thousand fatalities and economic losses of 656 billion cred and unisdr 2018 in july 2021 henan china was hit by an extreme rainstorm with maximum 24 h rainfall of 646 mm equivalent to the local mean annual precipitation the flood claimed 398 lives paralyzed the urban systems for weeks and led to a direct economic loss of 17 8 billion in 2021 2022 western europe eastern australia south africa and pakistan experienced record breaking rainfall as well due to climate change more frequent and intense rainfall is expected in many regions alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 such extreme rainfall could overwhelm structural mitigation measures hence timely emergency risk mitigation measures such as warning evacuation and traffic management should be adopted to reduce fatalities and losses takagi et al 2021 several critical questions must be answered in the flood emergency risk mitigation 1 where will be flooded 2 how severe will the flooding be and 3 how long will the flooding last although large scale fluvial flood emergency management has been enabled by efficient hydrological models liang et al 1994 niu et al 2017 wen et al 2012 it remains a challenge to develop similar techniques for pluvial flood emergency management in urban areas due to the high demands in both efficiency and resolution shallow water equations based two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic models such as lisflood fp bates and de roo 2000 hec ras usace 2018 flo 2d flo 2d 2018 and edda zhou 2020 appear to be a viable solution for simulating flooding processes in urban areas gao et al 2019 he et al 2021 however city wide 2d hydrodynamic flood simulation at a fine scale requires extensive computational resources and is usually time consuming making it difficult to apply such simulation to real time flood warnings some solutions have been proposed to enable real time flood forecast with 2d hydrodynamic models such as hardware acceleration using parallel computing and estimation with pre simulated flood scenarios henonin et al 2013 these solutions either require tremendous costs and programming efforts or do not cater for unprecedented rainfall scenarios how to significantly improve the efficiency of hydrodynamic models to enable real time flood simulation has always been a long term goal for flood emergency management extensive efforts have been paid to develop fast pluvial flood analysis methods and these methods can be classified into two categories maximum depth based and process based the maximum depth based methods only estimate the maximum flood depth during rainfall one of the most well known maximum depth based methods is cellular automata which simulates the evolution of cell states based on the states of neighboring cells and a set of transition rules by spreading the total rainfall volume on the terrain cellular automata methods can predict the maximum flood depth with speedups up to 1100 times compared with shallow water equations based hydrodynamic models e g jamali et al 2020 2019 2018 zhao et al 2019 the maximum depth based methods are further advanced in considering the temporal variation of rainfall using deep learning models guo et al 2021 hofmann and schÃ¼ttrumpf 2021 lÃ¶we et al 2021 although these methods predict the maximum flood depth with a real time level of efficiency information on the flooding process which is important for flood warning decision making peng and zhang 2012a 2012b and traffic system management he et al 2021 yin et al 2016 is missing process based methods adopt surrogate models as an alternative to shallow water equations for full process simulation moreno rodenas et al 2018 proposed a surrogate model to approximate 2d flooding processes caused by spatially uniform rainfall several cellular automata models have also been proposed to simulate the flooding process under spatiotemporally varying rainfall through well designed transition rules that describe water volume exchange among cells in a time step achieving efficiency improvement of 8 30 times compared to the hydrodynamic model e g dottori and todini 2011 ghimire et al 2012 guidolin et al 2016 however the improved efficiency of the existing process based methods may be insufficient to compensate for the extra computation cost of ensemble predictions which are important for accommodating uncertainties in the rainfall nowcast cloke and pappenberger 2009 pulkkinen et al 2019 to date neither hydrodynamic nor surrogate methods can achieve real time pluvial flooding process simulation under spatiotemporally varying rainstorms the objective of this study is to propose a deep learning enabled super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method for rapid flooding process simulation the proposed method uses a coarse grid hydrodynamic model to simulate the rainfall runoff process at a low resolution and then refines the coarse grid results to a high resolution using a super resolution deep learning model multiple flood parameters such as flow depth and velocity can be obtained simultaneously in a consistent framework the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to a complex terrain covering both mountainous and plain areas 2 super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method 2 1 cross scale similarity in regional surface hydrology the topographic features such as mountains and basins shape the regional surface hydrological process particularly rainfall runoff in hydrodynamic flood analysis the topographic features are usually characterized by a digital terrain model dtm where the elevation of the terrain is presented on a grid of a certain grid size the smaller the grid size is the more topographic details the dtm reveals within a certain range of grid sizes the dtm shares a certain degree of cross scale similarity because the coarser models are just spatially averaged versions of the finer ones as shown in fig 1 a although some detailed topographic features such as small catchments and valleys disappear in the dtm when the grid size is increased by a factor of 15 the elevation data of the coarse grid model is still strongly correlated with that of the fine grid model more importantly some large scale topographic features such as ridges and plains where the surface runoff divides and accumulates respectively are retained in the coarse grid model the cross scale similarity in topographic features indicates a certain degree of cross scale similarity in surface hydrology indeed we found that the flood prone areas identified by different grid size hydrodynamic flood analysis models share a similar spatial pattern fig 1 b hydrodynamic flood analysis over a large area with a fine grid may take a long computation time which hinders the application of hydrodynamic analysis in flood emergency management however when a coarse grid size is adopted the computation time can be significantly reduced because of fewer computational cells and larger time steps allowed by stability conditions considering the great efficiency improvement of the coarse grid hydrodynamic model and the cross scale similarity in regional surface hydrology a rapid hydrodynamic flood analysis method can be developed using a coarse grid hydrodynamic model for rapid flood process simulation and a cross scale correlation model for improving the resolution of the analysis results as indicated by the low correlation coefficient of flow depths simulated using different grid sizes fig 1 b the cross scale correlation in surface hydrology appears to be nonlinear and affected by many factors how to model the complex cross scale correlation in surface hydrology for downscaling the resolution of flood parameters is the key to developing such a rapid hydrodynamic flood analysis method downscaling climate model outputs to a finer resolution for hydrological analysis has been an endeavor for decades in atmospheric science fowler et al 2007 wood et al 2004 recently many downscaling methods have been proposed to refine the resolution of coarse grid hydrodynamic simulation results rucker et al 2021 schumann et al 2014 yin et al 2016 however existing flood downscaling methods mainly rely on pre defined rules e g mass conservation and are often limited to flow depth developing rules to effectively downscale other flood parameters such as flow velocity remains a challenge 2 2 framework inspired by the success of deep learning techniques in image super resolution dong et al 2014 kim et al 2016 ledig et al 2017 saharia et al 2021 we propose a super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method as shown in fig 2 the term super resolution originating from the field of computer vision refers to the task of enhancing the resolution of images or videos a process that is similar to downscaling we adopt deep learning techniques to quantify the cross scale correlation in surface water hydrology the input of the super resolution deep learning model is the simulated flooding process from a coarse grid hydrodynamic model and the output of the deep learning model is the fine grid flooding process of the desired resolution considering that detailed topographic features will vanish in a coarse grid dtm we add fine grid topographic features as the input of the deep learning model to assist the resolution refinement the proposed method is efficient because the computation time of the hydrodynamic model is greatly reduced with a coarse grid and the deep learning model for resolution refinement once trained only requires less than one second for prediction different from the existing deep learning aided rapid flood analysis methods that directly predict fine grid surface runoff given the rainfall using a deep learning model guo et al 2021 lÃ¶we et al 2021 the proposed method decouples the task of runoff prediction into two subtasks 1 to simulate the coarse grid surface runoff process given the rainfall and 2 to predict the fine grid surface runoff process given the coarse grid runoff process the first subtask can be perfectly handled by a coarse grid hydrodynamic model and the second subtask is undertaken by a super resolution deep learning model such decoupling makes full use of the existing knowledge namely using a hydrodynamic model instead of a deep learning model to quantify the complex spatiotemporal rainfall runoff relation in catchments with arbitrary sizes which greatly simplifies the task in a physically based manner furthermore the involvement of a coarse grid hydrodynamic model makes it possible to predict the whole flooding process even with unprecedented rainfall the fine grid flood process can be obtained by repetitively applying the deep learning model to the coarse grid flow depth and velocity maps at discrete time steps details of the proposed method are elaborated in the following sections 2 2 1 hydrodynamic flood analysis model hydrodynamic flood analysis is used to generate training data for developing the deep learning model and to simulate the coarse grid flood process in applications in this study an in house hydrodynamic model edda is adopted as an example chen and zhang 2015 shen et al 2018 zhou 2020 where surface flow and underground drainage flow are modeled by 2d shallow water equations and one dimensional pipe flow equations respectively and buildings are modeled with area reduction and width reduction factors o brien et al 1993 edda has been proven effective for simulating processes of a dam break flood chen and zhang 2015 surface runoff shen et al 2018 and urban flood with drainage networks zhou 2020 two hydrodynamic models with coarse and fine grid sizes should be developed and the fine grid hydrodynamic model can build the urban drainage network in detail the physical parameters of the coarse grid hydrodynamic model such as infiltration rate and manning s coefficient should be obtained by averagely downsampling the parameters of the fine grid model to maintain a better connection between the two models meanwhile the fine and coarse grid hydrodynamic models should share the same boundary settings 2 2 2 fine grid topographic features in the coarse grid hydrodynamic flood analysis model some detailed topographic features such as local scale terrain depressions and narrow valleys are lost due to the low dtm resolution these detailed topographic features govern the spatial distribution and flow characteristics of the surface runoff at a local scale if not bounded by the detailed topographic features a coarse grid flood scenario may correspond to multiple fine grid flood scenarios to reduce the nonuniqueness in the mapping from a coarse grid to a fine grid four critical fine grid topographic features namely elevation slope building coverage and catchment area are considered as additional inputs to the super resolution deep learning model fig 2 the fine grid elevation and slope features are adopted because they directly affect the flow depth and flow velocity the building coverage defined as the ratio of building area in a cell characterizes the urban catchment while the catchment area namely the total area of upstream cells describes the natural catchment features including streams and rivers note that the fine grid topographic features are of different orders of magnitude for example slopes are bounded in the range of 0 90 while catchment areas can be as large as tens of thousands of square meters therefore these fine grid topographic features should be normalized to a similar scale to help the deep learning model train faster 2 2 3 super resolution deep learning model many convolutional neural network models such as vgg resnet and u net are proven effective for image super resolution ledig et al 2017 saharia et al 2021 in this study a model with a u net structure ronneberger et al 2015 is adopted as the super resolution deep learning model as shown in fig 3 the model can handle arbitrary input sizes as long as the hardware specifications allow enabling a scalable and flexible application to various catchment sizes the deep learning model consists of encoding and decoding paths both containing several residual units denoted as resunit in fig 3 as the basic component of the deep learning model a residual unit consists of two 3 3 convolution layers with a stride of 1 and no padding following zhang et al 2018 a shortcut connection i e a 1 1 convolution with the full pre activation structure i e batch normalization and relu activation before each convolution layer he et al 2016a 2016b is used in each residual unit to ease the training of a model with a deep structure although the deep learning model adopted in this study does not include dropout layers it may be necessary to add dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of deep learning models in other cases two separate deep learning models of the same structure are developed for depth and velocity predictions respectively to avoid the complex multi objective optimization problem the input of each deep learning model is a 4 dimensional matrix with batch size channels i e number of features height and width as each dimension the coarse grid flood maps of flow depth or velocity are interpolated to the fine grid size and then combined with the fine grid topographic data to form a model input as shown in fig 3 in the encoding path the height and width of data are reduced to half each time by a maximum pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 2 and the channels are increased by the residual units the decoding path is like a reverse process of the encoding path where the height and width are doubled each time by a transposed convolution layer with a kernel size of 2 2 and a stride of 2 and the channels are reduced by the residual units intuitively the encoding path can be regarded as the process of extracting context information from the input and the decoding path gradually generates high resolution details based on the context information there are several shortcut connections between the residual units in the encoding and the decoding paths the shortcut connections between residual units ensure that details in the input data are not lost during convolution and pooling operations in the end a 1 1 convolution layer followed by relu activation is used to convert the 64 channel output of the last residual unit to the fine grid flood map detailed data size at each step is indicated in fig 3 the height and width of data are reduced by 4 through each residual unit reduced to half through each maximum pooling layer and doubled by each transposed convolution layer this leads to a loss of 88 cells in height and width namely 44 cells on each side of the input data in other words for an output size of h h the input data size should be h 88 h 88 note that the input size can be different during training and application for small catchments the entire catchment can be treated as a single input image in the application stage due to the flexibility of the super resolution model if catchment areas exceed the threshold allowed by the hardware specifications a more general solution would be to split the catchment into small patches for input and stitch back the resulting patches together this patch based solution is equivalent to the single image alternative but is not limited by hardware specifications 2 3 implementation of the proposed method a schematic diagram for implementing the proposed super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method is shown in fig 4 firstly several geospatial datasets of the study area should be prepared for the hydrodynamic model and the deep learning model then the coarse and fine grid hydrodynamic models are constructed based on selected grid sizes the fine grid size is the target resolution of flood maps a proper choice of coarse grid size should balance efficiency and accuracy which will be discussed later flood analyses under several assumed rainfall processes are carried out using the constructed hydrodynamic models to generate paired coarse and fine grid flood maps for training and testing the deep learning model the principle of designing the rainfall processes for model training is that the rainfall processes should be able to generate a wide range of flood depths covering possible flood depths during physically possible rainfall events this can help avoid extrapolation when the trained deep learning model is applied to real rainstorms the maps of flow depth and velocity generated under the assumed rainfall processes are partitioned into smaller patches to avoid computational memory overflow which is a common data preprocessing procedure in computer vision a data sample consists of a fine grid flood map patch a land mask patch a group of topographic feature patches and a coarse grid flood map patch as shown in fig 5 the land mask is a binary dataset that takes one if the cell is within the study area and on land and zero otherwise the mask layer is not an input of the deep learning model but a filter applied to the output of the deep learning model for excluding predictions outside the study area or in the sea the fine grid flood maps are partitioned without overlapping the land mask patches have the same size as the fine grid flood map patches the partitioned coarse grid flood map and topographic feature patches should overlap 44 cells on each side to compensate for the reduction in data size the overlapping width will change if the model structure changes the data samples are randomly split into training validation and testing datasets the training and validation datasets are augmented by random horizontal flip vertical flip and rotation to reduce model overfitting shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 the masked mean squared error is adopted as the loss l 1 l j 1 n s i 1 n c y i j y i j 2 m i j j 1 n s i 1 n c m i j where nc is the number of cells in a sample ns is the number of samples in a batch yij and y i j are the fine grid flood depths or velocities simulated by the hydrodynamic model and predicted by the deep learning model respectively at the i th cell in the j th sample of the batch and mij is the mask value i e 0 or 1 at the i th cell in the j th sample the model parameters corresponding to the minimum loss on the validation dataset are used as the optimal parameters the proposed super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method is validated against the edda based fine grid hydrodynamic modeling in two steps as shown in fig 4 in the first step the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated on the testing dataset under assumed constant and uniform rainfall events this step aims to optimize the deep learning architecture and the corresponding model parameters to ensure that the model can quantify the cross scale similarity in the surface hydrological response given a prescribed coarse grid model and simplified rainfall events in the second step the performance of the proposed method is further evaluated under real spatiotemporally varying rainstorms to ensure that the coarse grid hydrodynamic model and the simplified rainfall events are reasonable if the model performance is unsatisfactory it is necessary to improve the coarse grid model or and adjust the assumed rainfall events it should be noted that the proposed method aims to approximate fine grid hydrodynamic flood simulation thus its actual accuracy also highly depends on the developed fine grid hydrodynamic model before deploying the proposed method for practical flood warning it is necessary to calibrate validate and regularly update the fine grid hydrodynamic model using measured data hall et al 2011 silverman et al 2022 3 case study 3 1 study area the proposed method is applied to a study area in the east of hong kong with an area of 352 2 km2 fig 6 a the study area is dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 2398 mm and has experienced several severe flooding disasters in history fig 6 shows the topographic features of the study area the study area features a hill terrain with the highest peak in hong kong tai mo shan and several high mountains such as lion rock and ma on shan fig 6 a surrounding the mountains are densely populated low lying areas and reclaimed areas fig 6 b and c the complex topographic features of the study area result in a complex hydrological condition an urban town is a confluence zone of multiple headwater catchments fig 6 d 3 2 data preparation and implementation settings two hydrodynamic flood analysis models with grid sizes of 30 m and 450 m are prepared for the study area detailed underground drainage networks are established in the fine model the coarse grid simulation can be 1d 2d coupled with a drainage model in this case study the detailed drainage model is not considered in the coarse grid simulation for a better generalization to regions without detailed drainage models in the future the fine grid hydrodynamic model has been validated in urban areas using observations of flooding spots and depths during previous rainstorms by he et al 2021 and is directly taken as a benchmark model in this study for simplicity four 12 h uniform and constant rainfall processes with intensities of 20 50 100 and 200 mm h and a non rainfall event i e dry condition are used to generate the training data the return periods of 1 h rainfall amounts of 20 50 100 and 200 mm in the study area cover a wide range from 1 year to about 1000 years tang and cheung 2011 the hourly snapshots of flow depth and velocity are used for model training and testing namely 5 12 60 paired flood maps a size of 60 60 cells is used for the fine grid flood map patch due to the gpu memory limit and the size of the coarse grid flood map patch is hence 148 148 cells 44 cell overlap on each side each flood map can be partitioned into 462 patches resulting in a total number of 462 60 27 720 samples the fine grid topographic features are normalized to the range of 0 1 using min max scaling to ease the training process the data samples are randomly split into training validation and testing datasets in a ratio of 7 1 2 two super resolution deep learning models are trained for refining the maps of flow depth and velocity respectively the model parameters are optimized by minimizing the loss using the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2015 with a learning rate of 0 0001 and a batch size of 128 which means the model parameters will be updated every time based on the loss of 128 data samples in the training dataset the model is trained for 2000 epochs meaning that the entire training dataset is used 2000 times 3 3 performance under assumed rainfall the root mean square error rmse of the trained deep learning models on the validation dataset is 0 062 m for flow depth and 0 073 m s for flow velocity fig 7 shows an example of predicted flood maps under an assumed rainfall event with an intensity of 100 mm h the predicted extent of flooding agrees well with the fine grid numerical simulation result using edda the deep learning model also effectively predicts mountain torrents in small valleys the predicted flow velocity shares a similar spatial pattern with the direct simulation results high velocity in streams rivers and steep terrains although the urban area shown in the zoom in view is severely flooded the flow velocity is relatively low indicating that flooding is induced by waterlogging in low lying areas the deep learning model correctly recovers such a detail the trained deep learning model is then evaluated on the testing dataset as shown in fig 8 a and c the predicted flow depth and velocity are linearly correlated with the simulation results with high correlation coefficients of 0 984 and 0 959 respectively four levels of flooding severity are defined to quantitatively evaluate the pointwise performance non flooding 0 0 1 m or m s slight flooding 0 1 0 5 m or m s severe flooding 0 5 1 0 m or m s and extreme flooding 1 0 m or m s the 2d histograms using the four flooding severity levels as bins are shown in fig 8 b and d the diagonal cells have much higher frequencies than the non diagonal cells indicating that the deep learning model can correctly identify the flooding severity levels of most testing points based on fig 8 b and d quantitative evaluation indices are calculated as shown in table 1 denote prediction and simulation of the k th flooding severity level as pk and sk respectively recall quantifies how likely a particular flooding severity level can be correctly identified by the deep learning model p pk sk the recall value of each flooding severity level is the ratio of the diagonal value to the sum of each row for example the recall for slight flooding 0 1 0 5 m is 0 054 0 008 0 054 0 003 0 839 similarly the trained deep learning model can identify more than 90 of non flooding and extreme flooding cells precision means the credibility of the identified flooding severity level p sk pk which is the ratio of the diagonal value to the sum of each column the trained model can identify non flooding and extreme flooding cases with over 90 credibility the overall model performance in identifying the four flooding severity levels can be measured by accuracy which is the sum of diagonal values the accuracy on the testing dataset is as high as 97 3 and 89 2 for flow depth and flow velocity respectively confirming that the trained model can effectively associate the coarse and fine grid flood maps 3 4 application to a realistic spatiotemporally varying rainstorm the trained deep learning models are proven effective in refining the resolution of flood maps under assumed rainfall processes however it remains unclear whether the super resolution deep learning aided hydrodynamic flood analysis method can predict the flooding process under real rainstorms in this section the proposed method is applied to a rainstorm on 6 8 june 2008 in hong kong to evaluate the model performance in predicting flooding processes the rainfall on 6 8 june 2008 resulted from a low pressure trough with a record breaking hourly rainfall of 145 5 mm at hong kong observatory s hko headquarters in kowloon as shown in fig 9 a the rainfall is unevenly distributed over the study area with 48 h rainfall of 400 500 mm on the west and 300 400 mm on the east the rainfall and the simulated flooding process can be characterized by four stages 1 on average 82 8 mm of rain fell during the 9th 15th hour corresponding to an intensity of 13 8 mm h the area with a flow depth greater than 0 1 m increases to 23 3 km2 fig 9 b at the 15th hour and the area with a flow velocity greater than 0 1 m s peaks at 82 5 km2 fig 9 c 2 after the 15th hour the average rainfall intensity decreased to 5 3 mm h until the 29th hour with an average cumulative rainfall of 74 4 mm during this period the flooded area gradually decreases to 17 1 km2 under infiltration stormwater drainage and outflow to the sea 3 the rainfall became extremely intense during the 29th 35th hour with an average intensity of 32 8 mm h and cumulative rainfall of 197 0 mm in 6 h the hourly rainfall record at hko s headquarters 145 5 mm was observed during the 32nd 33rd hour the intense rainfall leads to a sharp increase in the flooded area the areas with flow depths of 0 5 1 0 m and 1 0 m peak at 6 6 and 1 9 km2 respectively the areas with flow velocities of 0 5 1 0 m s and 1 0 m s also reaches the maxima of 12 8 and 1 6 km2 respectively 4 the average rainfall intensity dropped to 3 7 mm h after the 35th hour and the area with a flow depth greater than 0 1 m recedes to 12 8 km2 the temporal variations of areas with different depths and velocities predicted by the proposed method are shown in fig 9 b and c the coarse grid simulation results are interpolated to the fine grid size and provided in fig 9 for comparison temporally both the prediction of the proposed method and the interpolated coarse grid simulation results show a two peak process of flooding extent that is consistent with the fine grid simulation however there are systematical biases in the interpolated coarse grid flow depth and velocity such biases can be effectively reduced by the super resolution deep learning model the prediction of the flooded area flow depth 0 1 m is very close to the fine grid simulation with a maximum error of 4 3 km2 at the 30th hour and an average absolute error of 1 2 km2 the peak areas of different flooding severities and the occurrence times are perfectly predicted with relative errors in peak areas of 4 0 5 3 and 0 2 for slight severe and extreme flooding severities respectively the maximum error in the predicted flooded area occurs in the first flood receding process because the flooding predicted by the proposed method recedes slightly faster than the fine grid simulation a possible explanation is that the terrain in a coarse resolution is smoothed so that the outflow paths to the sea for the flooding water are shortened the predicted temporal variation of flow velocity is also consistent with the simulation the average absolute error of the predicted area with a flow velocity greater than 0 1 m s is only 4 1 km2 note that fig 9 only compares results on the time dimension the good agreement of severly and extremely flooded areas between the interpolated results and the direct fine grid simulation in fig 9 does not mean the locations of these flood depths are correctly predicted spatially the flooded area predicted by the proposed method is consistent with the fine grid simulation figs 10 and 11 show flow depth and velocity snapshots at several representative times respectively examples of urban and valley areas are provided in the zoom in views in figs 10 and 11 although the interpolated coarse grid depths lack some details they have similar spatial patterns to the fine grid depths during the whole process of flooding as for flow velocity the interpolated coarse grid results significantly overestimate the areas with high flow velocities especially in the urban area in the zoom in view with learned representations of cross scale similarity in surface hydrology the proposed method successfully reproduces the whole flooding process from the initial urban flooding at the 15th hour the severe urban flooding and torrential mountain floods at the 34th hour to the waterlogging in the low lying areas at the end of the simulation the characteristics of waterlogging in urban areas low flow velocity and mountain torrents in valleys high flow velocity are well simulated by the proposed method errors in the examples of urban and valley areas are indicated in the zoom in views in figs 10 and 11 the errors of predicted depths in the zoom in views range from 0 029 to 0 178 m corresponding to a reduction of 37 9 71 4 compared with the interpolated coarse grid depths similarly the proposed method reduces the errors of predicted velocities by 26 4 77 4 compared with the interpolated coarse grid velocities the performance indices evaluated over the entire study area under the real rainstorm are shown in table 2 performance indices of the interpolated coarse grid results are also presented in table 2 at the peak time of flooding extent the 34th hour the recall and precision values of the interpolated coarse grid results are very low for severe and extreme flood severities indicating that the interpolated results can barely provide reliable information for flood risk management while the proposed method effectively predicts 65 3 78 0 of severely flooded areas and the predictions are of 74 1 74 9 credibility compared with the rmse of the interpolated coarse grid results the rmse of predicted depth and velocity by the proposed method are as low as 0 047 m and 0 068 m s respectively more importantly the deep learning model improves the correlation coefficients of flow depth and velocity from 0 302 and 0 526 to 0 962 and 0 921 respectively compared with the interpolated coarse grid results fig 12 visualizes the improvement of depth and velocity prediction by the deep learning model as shown in fig 12 b and d large depths and velocities are absent in the interpolated coarse grid results which can be attributed to the reduced ponding areas and flattened slopes in the coarse grid terrain respectively fig 12 b suggests that the interpolation method underestimates higher flood depths leading to a reduction in total areas of higher flood depths and overestimates lower flood depths leading to an increase in total areas of higher flood depths the two types of biases happen to offset the bias in total areas of higher flood depths leading to seemly good interpolation results for higher flood depths in fig 9 b with the help of the input fine grid topographic features and the learned representations of cross scale hydrological similarity the deep learning model successfully predicts large depths and velocities and systematically reduces errors fig 12 a and c through the entire process of the rainstorm the maximum rmse of flow depth and flow velocity are only 0 083 m and 0 088 m s respectively which are comparable to the performance of state of the art fast pluvial flood analysis methods rmse 0 038 0 20 m for depth and 0 09 0 13 m s for velocity guo et al 2022 jamali et al 2019 lÃ¶we et al 2021 the results indicate that the proposed method can simulate the flooding process under a spatiotemporally varying rainstorm with reasonable accuracy even though it is trained using only a limited number of constant and uniform rainfall events moreover the good agreement between the prediction of the proposed method and the direct fine grid simulation suggests that the super resolution model can map the coarse grid simulation without a drainage network to the 1d 2d coupled fine grid simulation the proposed method significantly reduces the computation time compared with direct fine grid hydrodynamic simulations for the 48 hour june 2008 rainstorm the direct fine grid simulation takes about 22 h the computation time of hydrodynamic analysis can be significantly reduced to only 20 s with a 450 m coarse grid size and the deep learning model takes additional 9 6 s to generate fine grid flow depth and velocity maps at 1 h intervals the efficiency improvement compared with direct numerical simulation reaches 2690 times 4 influence of coarse grid size the choice of the coarse grid size affects the performance and efficiency of the proposed method a large coarse grid size will lead to poor performance while a small coarse grid size hardly meets the requirement of prompt flooding assessment therefore a proper choice of coarse grid size that balances accuracy and simulation efficiency is crucial three coarse grid sizes are tested namely 450 m 900 m and 1800 m fig 13 shows topographic features of different grid sizes most of the terrain features are retained in 450 m resolution compared to the elevation map in a 30 m resolution although many small catchments disappear for the coarse grid size of 900 m the drainage divides of large catchments and the plain urban areas are still visible when the grid size further increases to 1800 m almost all small catchments are smoothed out and some local topographic features in urban areas are missing at such a coarse resolution only large scale topographic features such as mountains and plains remain the performance of the proposed method with different coarse grid sizes is investigated using the june 2008 rainstorm as summarized in table 3 the computation efficiency increases with the coarse grid size for coarse grid sizes of 900 m and 1800 m the efficiency improvement can be as high as 5855 and 6865 times respectively although the efficiency improvement is evaluated against edda similar improvements can be achieved with other hydrodynamic flood simulation models as well this is because the efficiency improvement over direct fine grid simulation mainly comes from reduced simulation cells and increased time steps allowed by stability conditions in hydrodynamic analysis which are independent of the flood simulation model the prediction errors during the flooding process are shown in fig 14 for the three coarse grid sizes investigated rmse values of the proposed method are similar about half of that using the direct interpolation from coarse grid simulations as expected the largest errors in both flow depth and velocity come from the prediction based on the 1800 m coarse grid simulation model detailed performance indices are summarized in table 3 generally increasing the coarse grid size only leads to a slight decline in model performance indicating that the proposed method is robust against the choice of coarse grid size within a certain range for the study area the acceptable coarse grid size widely ranges from 450 m to 1800 m 5 limitations and further works at present the proposed super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method has several limitations the first limitation is that the performance of the proposed method is affected by the accuracy of the coarse grid simulation as grid size increases some fine topographic features such as flow paths slopes and potential ponding areas will change or even disappear which may lead to incorrect coarse grid results and subsequently mislead the super resolution deep learning model this problem can be solved by manually modifying coarse grid elevations or adopting an unstructured grid to refine critical areas local resolutions in the coarse grid simulation model secondly the proposed method aims to serve as a tool for flood emergency management in a specific region when applied to a new area with different topographic characteristics the deep learning model should be retrained with simulation results in the target area which limits its usefulness in screening flood prone areas the generalization ability of the deep learning model to new regions should be improved by adopting a deeper model and a larger training dataset that includes various types of terrain lastly a fine grid size of 30 m is used in the case study while some hydrological processes such as street flows occur on a finer scale it may be difficult to refine the resolution of flow depth and velocity from hundreds of meters to several meters using a single super resolution model because such a task will need much more parameters and a longer time for training a more feasible solution may be to break down the refinement task into a chain of subtasks on different scales with each subtask handled by a separately trained super resolution model saharia et al 2021 we envision potential extensions of the proposed method the proposed method can be extended to fluvial and coastal flooding qiang et al 2021 by incorporating a one dimensional river model and coastal boundary conditions in the hydrodynamic models it is also possible to extend the proposed method to other water driven hazard processes such as soil erosion abuzied and pradhan 2021 and landslide mobility cascini et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 as these processes can be described by governing equations similar to shallow water equations shen et al 2018 6 summary and conclusions this paper presents a machine learning enabled super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method for prompt flood process modeling the method considers the spatiotemporally varying rainfall process and simulates the whole process of flooding providing key information for emergency management the model performance is assessed based on an extreme historical rainstorm in hong kong the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the cross scale correlation in surface hydrology can be quantified by a deep learning model which can be trained using a limited number of assumed rainfall events even trained with constant and uniform rainfall events the proposed method can be well generalized to a spatiotemporally varying rainstorm 2 the proposed method is highly efficient with a relative grid size of 15 the efficiency can increase as much as 2690 times for the study area of 352 km2 the computation time of the proposed method for a 48 h rainstorm is limited to 30 s which meets the requirement for real time flood warning and emergency response 3 the proposed method can predict the evolution of flow depth and velocity with high accuracy in both space and time the maximum rmse during the flooding process is as low as 0 083 m for flow depth and 0 088 m s for flow velocity both flow depth and velocity can be predicted with a relative coarse grid size ranging from 15 to 60

14752,real time information on flooding extent severity and duration is necessary for effective metropolitan flood emergency management existing pluvial flood analysis methods are unable to simulate real time regional flooding processes under spatiotemporally varying rainstorms this paper presents a deep learning enabled super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method to simulate the real

et al 2006 donat et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 such extreme rainfall could overwhelm structural mitigation measures hence timely emergency risk mitigation measures such as warning evacuation and traffic management should be adopted to reduce fatalities and losses takagi et al 2021 several critical questions must be answered in the flood emergency risk mitigation 1 where will be flooded 2 how severe will the flooding be and 3 how long will the flooding last although large scale fluvial flood emergency management has been enabled by efficient hydrological models liang et al 1994 niu et al 2017 wen et al 2012 it remains a challenge to develop similar techniques for pluvial flood emergency management in urban areas due to the high demands in both efficiency and resolution shallow water equations based two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic models such as lisflood fp bates and de roo 2000 hec ras usace 2018 flo 2d flo 2d 2018 and edda zhou 2020 appear to be a viable solution for simulating flooding processes in urban areas gao et al 2019 he et al 2021 however city wide 2d hydrodynamic flood simulation at a fine scale requires extensive computational resources and is usually time consuming making it difficult to apply such simulation to real time flood warnings some solutions have been proposed to enable real time flood forecast with 2d hydrodynamic models such as hardware acceleration using parallel computing and estimation with pre simulated flood scenarios henonin et al 2013 these solutions either require tremendous costs and programming efforts or do not cater for unprecedented rainfall scenarios how to significantly improve the efficiency of hydrodynamic models to enable real time flood simulation has always been a long term goal for flood emergency management extensive efforts have been paid to develop fast pluvial flood analysis methods and these methods can be classified into two categories maximum depth based and process based the maximum depth based methods only estimate the maximum flood depth during rainfall one of the most well known maximum depth based methods is cellular automata which simulates the evolution of cell states based on the states of neighboring cells and a set of transition rules by spreading the total rainfall volume on the terrain cellular automata methods can predict the maximum flood depth with speedups up to 1100 times compared with shallow water equations based hydrodynamic models e g jamali et al 2020 2019 2018 zhao et al 2019 the maximum depth based methods are further advanced in considering the temporal variation of rainfall using deep learning models guo et al 2021 hofmann and schÃ¼ttrumpf 2021 lÃ¶we et al 2021 although these methods predict the maximum flood depth with a real time level of efficiency information on the flooding process which is important for flood warning decision making peng and zhang 2012a 2012b and traffic system management he et al 2021 yin et al 2016 is missing process based methods adopt surrogate models as an alternative to shallow water equations for full process simulation moreno rodenas et al 2018 proposed a surrogate model to approximate 2d flooding processes caused by spatially uniform rainfall several cellular automata models have also been proposed to simulate the flooding process under spatiotemporally varying rainfall through well designed transition rules that describe water volume exchange among cells in a time step achieving efficiency improvement of 8 30 times compared to the hydrodynamic model e g dottori and todini 2011 ghimire et al 2012 guidolin et al 2016 however the improved efficiency of the existing process based methods may be insufficient to compensate for the extra computation cost of ensemble predictions which are important for accommodating uncertainties in the rainfall nowcast cloke and pappenberger 2009 pulkkinen et al 2019 to date neither hydrodynamic nor surrogate methods can achieve real time pluvial flooding process simulation under spatiotemporally varying rainstorms the objective of this study is to propose a deep learning enabled super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method for rapid flooding process simulation the proposed method uses a coarse grid hydrodynamic model to simulate the rainfall runoff process at a low resolution and then refines the coarse grid results to a high resolution using a super resolution deep learning model multiple flood parameters such as flow depth and velocity can be obtained simultaneously in a consistent framework the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to a complex terrain covering both mountainous and plain areas 2 super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method 2 1 cross scale similarity in regional surface hydrology the topographic features such as mountains and basins shape the regional surface hydrological process particularly rainfall runoff in hydrodynamic flood analysis the topographic features are usually characterized by a digital terrain model dtm where the elevation of the terrain is presented on a grid of a certain grid size the smaller the grid size is the more topographic details the dtm reveals within a certain range of grid sizes the dtm shares a certain degree of cross scale similarity because the coarser models are just spatially averaged versions of the finer ones as shown in fig 1 a although some detailed topographic features such as small catchments and valleys disappear in the dtm when the grid size is increased by a factor of 15 the elevation data of the coarse grid model is still strongly correlated with that of the fine grid model more importantly some large scale topographic features such as ridges and plains where the surface runoff divides and accumulates respectively are retained in the coarse grid model the cross scale similarity in topographic features indicates a certain degree of cross scale similarity in surface hydrology indeed we found that the flood prone areas identified by different grid size hydrodynamic flood analysis models share a similar spatial pattern fig 1 b hydrodynamic flood analysis over a large area with a fine grid may take a long computation time which hinders the application of hydrodynamic analysis in flood emergency management however when a coarse grid size is adopted the computation time can be significantly reduced because of fewer computational cells and larger time steps allowed by stability conditions considering the great efficiency improvement of the coarse grid hydrodynamic model and the cross scale similarity in regional surface hydrology a rapid hydrodynamic flood analysis method can be developed using a coarse grid hydrodynamic model for rapid flood process simulation and a cross scale correlation model for improving the resolution of the analysis results as indicated by the low correlation coefficient of flow depths simulated using different grid sizes fig 1 b the cross scale correlation in surface hydrology appears to be nonlinear and affected by many factors how to model the complex cross scale correlation in surface hydrology for downscaling the resolution of flood parameters is the key to developing such a rapid hydrodynamic flood analysis method downscaling climate model outputs to a finer resolution for hydrological analysis has been an endeavor for decades in atmospheric science fowler et al 2007 wood et al 2004 recently many downscaling methods have been proposed to refine the resolution of coarse grid hydrodynamic simulation results rucker et al 2021 schumann et al 2014 yin et al 2016 however existing flood downscaling methods mainly rely on pre defined rules e g mass conservation and are often limited to flow depth developing rules to effectively downscale other flood parameters such as flow velocity remains a challenge 2 2 framework inspired by the success of deep learning techniques in image super resolution dong et al 2014 kim et al 2016 ledig et al 2017 saharia et al 2021 we propose a super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method as shown in fig 2 the term super resolution originating from the field of computer vision refers to the task of enhancing the resolution of images or videos a process that is similar to downscaling we adopt deep learning techniques to quantify the cross scale correlation in surface water hydrology the input of the super resolution deep learning model is the simulated flooding process from a coarse grid hydrodynamic model and the output of the deep learning model is the fine grid flooding process of the desired resolution considering that detailed topographic features will vanish in a coarse grid dtm we add fine grid topographic features as the input of the deep learning model to assist the resolution refinement the proposed method is efficient because the computation time of the hydrodynamic model is greatly reduced with a coarse grid and the deep learning model for resolution refinement once trained only requires less than one second for prediction different from the existing deep learning aided rapid flood analysis methods that directly predict fine grid surface runoff given the rainfall using a deep learning model guo et al 2021 lÃ¶we et al 2021 the proposed method decouples the task of runoff prediction into two subtasks 1 to simulate the coarse grid surface runoff process given the rainfall and 2 to predict the fine grid surface runoff process given the coarse grid runoff process the first subtask can be perfectly handled by a coarse grid hydrodynamic model and the second subtask is undertaken by a super resolution deep learning model such decoupling makes full use of the existing knowledge namely using a hydrodynamic model instead of a deep learning model to quantify the complex spatiotemporal rainfall runoff relation in catchments with arbitrary sizes which greatly simplifies the task in a physically based manner furthermore the involvement of a coarse grid hydrodynamic model makes it possible to predict the whole flooding process even with unprecedented rainfall the fine grid flood process can be obtained by repetitively applying the deep learning model to the coarse grid flow depth and velocity maps at discrete time steps details of the proposed method are elaborated in the following sections 2 2 1 hydrodynamic flood analysis model hydrodynamic flood analysis is used to generate training data for developing the deep learning model and to simulate the coarse grid flood process in applications in this study an in house hydrodynamic model edda is adopted as an example chen and zhang 2015 shen et al 2018 zhou 2020 where surface flow and underground drainage flow are modeled by 2d shallow water equations and one dimensional pipe flow equations respectively and buildings are modeled with area reduction and width reduction factors o brien et al 1993 edda has been proven effective for simulating processes of a dam break flood chen and zhang 2015 surface runoff shen et al 2018 and urban flood with drainage networks zhou 2020 two hydrodynamic models with coarse and fine grid sizes should be developed and the fine grid hydrodynamic model can build the urban drainage network in detail the physical parameters of the coarse grid hydrodynamic model such as infiltration rate and manning s coefficient should be obtained by averagely downsampling the parameters of the fine grid model to maintain a better connection between the two models meanwhile the fine and coarse grid hydrodynamic models should share the same boundary settings 2 2 2 fine grid topographic features in the coarse grid hydrodynamic flood analysis model some detailed topographic features such as local scale terrain depressions and narrow valleys are lost due to the low dtm resolution these detailed topographic features govern the spatial distribution and flow characteristics of the surface runoff at a local scale if not bounded by the detailed topographic features a coarse grid flood scenario may correspond to multiple fine grid flood scenarios to reduce the nonuniqueness in the mapping from a coarse grid to a fine grid four critical fine grid topographic features namely elevation slope building coverage and catchment area are considered as additional inputs to the super resolution deep learning model fig 2 the fine grid elevation and slope features are adopted because they directly affect the flow depth and flow velocity the building coverage defined as the ratio of building area in a cell characterizes the urban catchment while the catchment area namely the total area of upstream cells describes the natural catchment features including streams and rivers note that the fine grid topographic features are of different orders of magnitude for example slopes are bounded in the range of 0 90 while catchment areas can be as large as tens of thousands of square meters therefore these fine grid topographic features should be normalized to a similar scale to help the deep learning model train faster 2 2 3 super resolution deep learning model many convolutional neural network models such as vgg resnet and u net are proven effective for image super resolution ledig et al 2017 saharia et al 2021 in this study a model with a u net structure ronneberger et al 2015 is adopted as the super resolution deep learning model as shown in fig 3 the model can handle arbitrary input sizes as long as the hardware specifications allow enabling a scalable and flexible application to various catchment sizes the deep learning model consists of encoding and decoding paths both containing several residual units denoted as resunit in fig 3 as the basic component of the deep learning model a residual unit consists of two 3 3 convolution layers with a stride of 1 and no padding following zhang et al 2018 a shortcut connection i e a 1 1 convolution with the full pre activation structure i e batch normalization and relu activation before each convolution layer he et al 2016a 2016b is used in each residual unit to ease the training of a model with a deep structure although the deep learning model adopted in this study does not include dropout layers it may be necessary to add dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of deep learning models in other cases two separate deep learning models of the same structure are developed for depth and velocity predictions respectively to avoid the complex multi objective optimization problem the input of each deep learning model is a 4 dimensional matrix with batch size channels i e number of features height and width as each dimension the coarse grid flood maps of flow depth or velocity are interpolated to the fine grid size and then combined with the fine grid topographic data to form a model input as shown in fig 3 in the encoding path the height and width of data are reduced to half each time by a maximum pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 2 and the channels are increased by the residual units the decoding path is like a reverse process of the encoding path where the height and width are doubled each time by a transposed convolution layer with a kernel size of 2 2 and a stride of 2 and the channels are reduced by the residual units intuitively the encoding path can be regarded as the process of extracting context information from the input and the decoding path gradually generates high resolution details based on the context information there are several shortcut connections between the residual units in the encoding and the decoding paths the shortcut connections between residual units ensure that details in the input data are not lost during convolution and pooling operations in the end a 1 1 convolution layer followed by relu activation is used to convert the 64 channel output of the last residual unit to the fine grid flood map detailed data size at each step is indicated in fig 3 the height and width of data are reduced by 4 through each residual unit reduced to half through each maximum pooling layer and doubled by each transposed convolution layer this leads to a loss of 88 cells in height and width namely 44 cells on each side of the input data in other words for an output size of h h the input data size should be h 88 h 88 note that the input size can be different during training and application for small catchments the entire catchment can be treated as a single input image in the application stage due to the flexibility of the super resolution model if catchment areas exceed the threshold allowed by the hardware specifications a more general solution would be to split the catchment into small patches for input and stitch back the resulting patches together this patch based solution is equivalent to the single image alternative but is not limited by hardware specifications 2 3 implementation of the proposed method a schematic diagram for implementing the proposed super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method is shown in fig 4 firstly several geospatial datasets of the study area should be prepared for the hydrodynamic model and the deep learning model then the coarse and fine grid hydrodynamic models are constructed based on selected grid sizes the fine grid size is the target resolution of flood maps a proper choice of coarse grid size should balance efficiency and accuracy which will be discussed later flood analyses under several assumed rainfall processes are carried out using the constructed hydrodynamic models to generate paired coarse and fine grid flood maps for training and testing the deep learning model the principle of designing the rainfall processes for model training is that the rainfall processes should be able to generate a wide range of flood depths covering possible flood depths during physically possible rainfall events this can help avoid extrapolation when the trained deep learning model is applied to real rainstorms the maps of flow depth and velocity generated under the assumed rainfall processes are partitioned into smaller patches to avoid computational memory overflow which is a common data preprocessing procedure in computer vision a data sample consists of a fine grid flood map patch a land mask patch a group of topographic feature patches and a coarse grid flood map patch as shown in fig 5 the land mask is a binary dataset that takes one if the cell is within the study area and on land and zero otherwise the mask layer is not an input of the deep learning model but a filter applied to the output of the deep learning model for excluding predictions outside the study area or in the sea the fine grid flood maps are partitioned without overlapping the land mask patches have the same size as the fine grid flood map patches the partitioned coarse grid flood map and topographic feature patches should overlap 44 cells on each side to compensate for the reduction in data size the overlapping width will change if the model structure changes the data samples are randomly split into training validation and testing datasets the training and validation datasets are augmented by random horizontal flip vertical flip and rotation to reduce model overfitting shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 the masked mean squared error is adopted as the loss l 1 l j 1 n s i 1 n c y i j y i j 2 m i j j 1 n s i 1 n c m i j where nc is the number of cells in a sample ns is the number of samples in a batch yij and y i j are the fine grid flood depths or velocities simulated by the hydrodynamic model and predicted by the deep learning model respectively at the i th cell in the j th sample of the batch and mij is the mask value i e 0 or 1 at the i th cell in the j th sample the model parameters corresponding to the minimum loss on the validation dataset are used as the optimal parameters the proposed super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method is validated against the edda based fine grid hydrodynamic modeling in two steps as shown in fig 4 in the first step the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated on the testing dataset under assumed constant and uniform rainfall events this step aims to optimize the deep learning architecture and the corresponding model parameters to ensure that the model can quantify the cross scale similarity in the surface hydrological response given a prescribed coarse grid model and simplified rainfall events in the second step the performance of the proposed method is further evaluated under real spatiotemporally varying rainstorms to ensure that the coarse grid hydrodynamic model and the simplified rainfall events are reasonable if the model performance is unsatisfactory it is necessary to improve the coarse grid model or and adjust the assumed rainfall events it should be noted that the proposed method aims to approximate fine grid hydrodynamic flood simulation thus its actual accuracy also highly depends on the developed fine grid hydrodynamic model before deploying the proposed method for practical flood warning it is necessary to calibrate validate and regularly update the fine grid hydrodynamic model using measured data hall et al 2011 silverman et al 2022 3 case study 3 1 study area the proposed method is applied to a study area in the east of hong kong with an area of 352 2 km2 fig 6 a the study area is dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 2398 mm and has experienced several severe flooding disasters in history fig 6 shows the topographic features of the study area the study area features a hill terrain with the highest peak in hong kong tai mo shan and several high mountains such as lion rock and ma on shan fig 6 a surrounding the mountains are densely populated low lying areas and reclaimed areas fig 6 b and c the complex topographic features of the study area result in a complex hydrological condition an urban town is a confluence zone of multiple headwater catchments fig 6 d 3 2 data preparation and implementation settings two hydrodynamic flood analysis models with grid sizes of 30 m and 450 m are prepared for the study area detailed underground drainage networks are established in the fine model the coarse grid simulation can be 1d 2d coupled with a drainage model in this case study the detailed drainage model is not considered in the coarse grid simulation for a better generalization to regions without detailed drainage models in the future the fine grid hydrodynamic model has been validated in urban areas using observations of flooding spots and depths during previous rainstorms by he et al 2021 and is directly taken as a benchmark model in this study for simplicity four 12 h uniform and constant rainfall processes with intensities of 20 50 100 and 200 mm h and a non rainfall event i e dry condition are used to generate the training data the return periods of 1 h rainfall amounts of 20 50 100 and 200 mm in the study area cover a wide range from 1 year to about 1000 years tang and cheung 2011 the hourly snapshots of flow depth and velocity are used for model training and testing namely 5 12 60 paired flood maps a size of 60 60 cells is used for the fine grid flood map patch due to the gpu memory limit and the size of the coarse grid flood map patch is hence 148 148 cells 44 cell overlap on each side each flood map can be partitioned into 462 patches resulting in a total number of 462 60 27 720 samples the fine grid topographic features are normalized to the range of 0 1 using min max scaling to ease the training process the data samples are randomly split into training validation and testing datasets in a ratio of 7 1 2 two super resolution deep learning models are trained for refining the maps of flow depth and velocity respectively the model parameters are optimized by minimizing the loss using the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2015 with a learning rate of 0 0001 and a batch size of 128 which means the model parameters will be updated every time based on the loss of 128 data samples in the training dataset the model is trained for 2000 epochs meaning that the entire training dataset is used 2000 times 3 3 performance under assumed rainfall the root mean square error rmse of the trained deep learning models on the validation dataset is 0 062 m for flow depth and 0 073 m s for flow velocity fig 7 shows an example of predicted flood maps under an assumed rainfall event with an intensity of 100 mm h the predicted extent of flooding agrees well with the fine grid numerical simulation result using edda the deep learning model also effectively predicts mountain torrents in small valleys the predicted flow velocity shares a similar spatial pattern with the direct simulation results high velocity in streams rivers and steep terrains although the urban area shown in the zoom in view is severely flooded the flow velocity is relatively low indicating that flooding is induced by waterlogging in low lying areas the deep learning model correctly recovers such a detail the trained deep learning model is then evaluated on the testing dataset as shown in fig 8 a and c the predicted flow depth and velocity are linearly correlated with the simulation results with high correlation coefficients of 0 984 and 0 959 respectively four levels of flooding severity are defined to quantitatively evaluate the pointwise performance non flooding 0 0 1 m or m s slight flooding 0 1 0 5 m or m s severe flooding 0 5 1 0 m or m s and extreme flooding 1 0 m or m s the 2d histograms using the four flooding severity levels as bins are shown in fig 8 b and d the diagonal cells have much higher frequencies than the non diagonal cells indicating that the deep learning model can correctly identify the flooding severity levels of most testing points based on fig 8 b and d quantitative evaluation indices are calculated as shown in table 1 denote prediction and simulation of the k th flooding severity level as pk and sk respectively recall quantifies how likely a particular flooding severity level can be correctly identified by the deep learning model p pk sk the recall value of each flooding severity level is the ratio of the diagonal value to the sum of each row for example the recall for slight flooding 0 1 0 5 m is 0 054 0 008 0 054 0 003 0 839 similarly the trained deep learning model can identify more than 90 of non flooding and extreme flooding cells precision means the credibility of the identified flooding severity level p sk pk which is the ratio of the diagonal value to the sum of each column the trained model can identify non flooding and extreme flooding cases with over 90 credibility the overall model performance in identifying the four flooding severity levels can be measured by accuracy which is the sum of diagonal values the accuracy on the testing dataset is as high as 97 3 and 89 2 for flow depth and flow velocity respectively confirming that the trained model can effectively associate the coarse and fine grid flood maps 3 4 application to a realistic spatiotemporally varying rainstorm the trained deep learning models are proven effective in refining the resolution of flood maps under assumed rainfall processes however it remains unclear whether the super resolution deep learning aided hydrodynamic flood analysis method can predict the flooding process under real rainstorms in this section the proposed method is applied to a rainstorm on 6 8 june 2008 in hong kong to evaluate the model performance in predicting flooding processes the rainfall on 6 8 june 2008 resulted from a low pressure trough with a record breaking hourly rainfall of 145 5 mm at hong kong observatory s hko headquarters in kowloon as shown in fig 9 a the rainfall is unevenly distributed over the study area with 48 h rainfall of 400 500 mm on the west and 300 400 mm on the east the rainfall and the simulated flooding process can be characterized by four stages 1 on average 82 8 mm of rain fell during the 9th 15th hour corresponding to an intensity of 13 8 mm h the area with a flow depth greater than 0 1 m increases to 23 3 km2 fig 9 b at the 15th hour and the area with a flow velocity greater than 0 1 m s peaks at 82 5 km2 fig 9 c 2 after the 15th hour the average rainfall intensity decreased to 5 3 mm h until the 29th hour with an average cumulative rainfall of 74 4 mm during this period the flooded area gradually decreases to 17 1 km2 under infiltration stormwater drainage and outflow to the sea 3 the rainfall became extremely intense during the 29th 35th hour with an average intensity of 32 8 mm h and cumulative rainfall of 197 0 mm in 6 h the hourly rainfall record at hko s headquarters 145 5 mm was observed during the 32nd 33rd hour the intense rainfall leads to a sharp increase in the flooded area the areas with flow depths of 0 5 1 0 m and 1 0 m peak at 6 6 and 1 9 km2 respectively the areas with flow velocities of 0 5 1 0 m s and 1 0 m s also reaches the maxima of 12 8 and 1 6 km2 respectively 4 the average rainfall intensity dropped to 3 7 mm h after the 35th hour and the area with a flow depth greater than 0 1 m recedes to 12 8 km2 the temporal variations of areas with different depths and velocities predicted by the proposed method are shown in fig 9 b and c the coarse grid simulation results are interpolated to the fine grid size and provided in fig 9 for comparison temporally both the prediction of the proposed method and the interpolated coarse grid simulation results show a two peak process of flooding extent that is consistent with the fine grid simulation however there are systematical biases in the interpolated coarse grid flow depth and velocity such biases can be effectively reduced by the super resolution deep learning model the prediction of the flooded area flow depth 0 1 m is very close to the fine grid simulation with a maximum error of 4 3 km2 at the 30th hour and an average absolute error of 1 2 km2 the peak areas of different flooding severities and the occurrence times are perfectly predicted with relative errors in peak areas of 4 0 5 3 and 0 2 for slight severe and extreme flooding severities respectively the maximum error in the predicted flooded area occurs in the first flood receding process because the flooding predicted by the proposed method recedes slightly faster than the fine grid simulation a possible explanation is that the terrain in a coarse resolution is smoothed so that the outflow paths to the sea for the flooding water are shortened the predicted temporal variation of flow velocity is also consistent with the simulation the average absolute error of the predicted area with a flow velocity greater than 0 1 m s is only 4 1 km2 note that fig 9 only compares results on the time dimension the good agreement of severly and extremely flooded areas between the interpolated results and the direct fine grid simulation in fig 9 does not mean the locations of these flood depths are correctly predicted spatially the flooded area predicted by the proposed method is consistent with the fine grid simulation figs 10 and 11 show flow depth and velocity snapshots at several representative times respectively examples of urban and valley areas are provided in the zoom in views in figs 10 and 11 although the interpolated coarse grid depths lack some details they have similar spatial patterns to the fine grid depths during the whole process of flooding as for flow velocity the interpolated coarse grid results significantly overestimate the areas with high flow velocities especially in the urban area in the zoom in view with learned representations of cross scale similarity in surface hydrology the proposed method successfully reproduces the whole flooding process from the initial urban flooding at the 15th hour the severe urban flooding and torrential mountain floods at the 34th hour to the waterlogging in the low lying areas at the end of the simulation the characteristics of waterlogging in urban areas low flow velocity and mountain torrents in valleys high flow velocity are well simulated by the proposed method errors in the examples of urban and valley areas are indicated in the zoom in views in figs 10 and 11 the errors of predicted depths in the zoom in views range from 0 029 to 0 178 m corresponding to a reduction of 37 9 71 4 compared with the interpolated coarse grid depths similarly the proposed method reduces the errors of predicted velocities by 26 4 77 4 compared with the interpolated coarse grid velocities the performance indices evaluated over the entire study area under the real rainstorm are shown in table 2 performance indices of the interpolated coarse grid results are also presented in table 2 at the peak time of flooding extent the 34th hour the recall and precision values of the interpolated coarse grid results are very low for severe and extreme flood severities indicating that the interpolated results can barely provide reliable information for flood risk management while the proposed method effectively predicts 65 3 78 0 of severely flooded areas and the predictions are of 74 1 74 9 credibility compared with the rmse of the interpolated coarse grid results the rmse of predicted depth and velocity by the proposed method are as low as 0 047 m and 0 068 m s respectively more importantly the deep learning model improves the correlation coefficients of flow depth and velocity from 0 302 and 0 526 to 0 962 and 0 921 respectively compared with the interpolated coarse grid results fig 12 visualizes the improvement of depth and velocity prediction by the deep learning model as shown in fig 12 b and d large depths and velocities are absent in the interpolated coarse grid results which can be attributed to the reduced ponding areas and flattened slopes in the coarse grid terrain respectively fig 12 b suggests that the interpolation method underestimates higher flood depths leading to a reduction in total areas of higher flood depths and overestimates lower flood depths leading to an increase in total areas of higher flood depths the two types of biases happen to offset the bias in total areas of higher flood depths leading to seemly good interpolation results for higher flood depths in fig 9 b with the help of the input fine grid topographic features and the learned representations of cross scale hydrological similarity the deep learning model successfully predicts large depths and velocities and systematically reduces errors fig 12 a and c through the entire process of the rainstorm the maximum rmse of flow depth and flow velocity are only 0 083 m and 0 088 m s respectively which are comparable to the performance of state of the art fast pluvial flood analysis methods rmse 0 038 0 20 m for depth and 0 09 0 13 m s for velocity guo et al 2022 jamali et al 2019 lÃ¶we et al 2021 the results indicate that the proposed method can simulate the flooding process under a spatiotemporally varying rainstorm with reasonable accuracy even though it is trained using only a limited number of constant and uniform rainfall events moreover the good agreement between the prediction of the proposed method and the direct fine grid simulation suggests that the super resolution model can map the coarse grid simulation without a drainage network to the 1d 2d coupled fine grid simulation the proposed method significantly reduces the computation time compared with direct fine grid hydrodynamic simulations for the 48 hour june 2008 rainstorm the direct fine grid simulation takes about 22 h the computation time of hydrodynamic analysis can be significantly reduced to only 20 s with a 450 m coarse grid size and the deep learning model takes additional 9 6 s to generate fine grid flow depth and velocity maps at 1 h intervals the efficiency improvement compared with direct numerical simulation reaches 2690 times 4 influence of coarse grid size the choice of the coarse grid size affects the performance and efficiency of the proposed method a large coarse grid size will lead to poor performance while a small coarse grid size hardly meets the requirement of prompt flooding assessment therefore a proper choice of coarse grid size that balances accuracy and simulation efficiency is crucial three coarse grid sizes are tested namely 450 m 900 m and 1800 m fig 13 shows topographic features of different grid sizes most of the terrain features are retained in 450 m resolution compared to the elevation map in a 30 m resolution although many small catchments disappear for the coarse grid size of 900 m the drainage divides of large catchments and the plain urban areas are still visible when the grid size further increases to 1800 m almost all small catchments are smoothed out and some local topographic features in urban areas are missing at such a coarse resolution only large scale topographic features such as mountains and plains remain the performance of the proposed method with different coarse grid sizes is investigated using the june 2008 rainstorm as summarized in table 3 the computation efficiency increases with the coarse grid size for coarse grid sizes of 900 m and 1800 m the efficiency improvement can be as high as 5855 and 6865 times respectively although the efficiency improvement is evaluated against edda similar improvements can be achieved with other hydrodynamic flood simulation models as well this is because the efficiency improvement over direct fine grid simulation mainly comes from reduced simulation cells and increased time steps allowed by stability conditions in hydrodynamic analysis which are independent of the flood simulation model the prediction errors during the flooding process are shown in fig 14 for the three coarse grid sizes investigated rmse values of the proposed method are similar about half of that using the direct interpolation from coarse grid simulations as expected the largest errors in both flow depth and velocity come from the prediction based on the 1800 m coarse grid simulation model detailed performance indices are summarized in table 3 generally increasing the coarse grid size only leads to a slight decline in model performance indicating that the proposed method is robust against the choice of coarse grid size within a certain range for the study area the acceptable coarse grid size widely ranges from 450 m to 1800 m 5 limitations and further works at present the proposed super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method has several limitations the first limitation is that the performance of the proposed method is affected by the accuracy of the coarse grid simulation as grid size increases some fine topographic features such as flow paths slopes and potential ponding areas will change or even disappear which may lead to incorrect coarse grid results and subsequently mislead the super resolution deep learning model this problem can be solved by manually modifying coarse grid elevations or adopting an unstructured grid to refine critical areas local resolutions in the coarse grid simulation model secondly the proposed method aims to serve as a tool for flood emergency management in a specific region when applied to a new area with different topographic characteristics the deep learning model should be retrained with simulation results in the target area which limits its usefulness in screening flood prone areas the generalization ability of the deep learning model to new regions should be improved by adopting a deeper model and a larger training dataset that includes various types of terrain lastly a fine grid size of 30 m is used in the case study while some hydrological processes such as street flows occur on a finer scale it may be difficult to refine the resolution of flow depth and velocity from hundreds of meters to several meters using a single super resolution model because such a task will need much more parameters and a longer time for training a more feasible solution may be to break down the refinement task into a chain of subtasks on different scales with each subtask handled by a separately trained super resolution model saharia et al 2021 we envision potential extensions of the proposed method the proposed method can be extended to fluvial and coastal flooding qiang et al 2021 by incorporating a one dimensional river model and coastal boundary conditions in the hydrodynamic models it is also possible to extend the proposed method to other water driven hazard processes such as soil erosion abuzied and pradhan 2021 and landslide mobility cascini et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 as these processes can be described by governing equations similar to shallow water equations shen et al 2018 6 summary and conclusions this paper presents a machine learning enabled super resolution hydrodynamic flood analysis method for prompt flood process modeling the method considers the spatiotemporally varying rainfall process and simulates the whole process of flooding providing key information for emergency management the model performance is assessed based on an extreme historical rainstorm in hong kong the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the cross scale correlation in surface hydrology can be quantified by a deep learning model which can be trained using a limited number of assumed rainfall events even trained with constant and uniform rainfall events the proposed method can be well generalized to a spatiotemporally varying rainstorm 2 the proposed method is highly efficient with a relative grid size of 15 the efficiency can increase as much as 2690 times for the study area of 352 km2 the computation time of the proposed method for a 48 h rainstorm is limited to 30 s which meets the requirement for real time flood warning and emergency response 3 the proposed method can predict the evolution of flow depth and velocity with high accuracy in both space and time the maximum rmse during the flooding process is as low as 0 083 m for flow depth and 0 088 m s for flow velocity both flow depth and velocity can be predicted with a relative coarse grid size ranging from 15 to 60

14753,widely distributed soil humic acid ha would significantly affect the environmental migration behavior of tl i but a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the dynamic tl i retention process on ha is limited a unified kinetic model was established by coupling the humic ion binding model with a stirred flow kinetic model which quantified the complexation constants and responsiveness coefficients during dynamic tl i ha complexation furthermore the heterogeneous complexation mechanism of ha and tl i was revealed by batch adsorption experiments stirred flow migration

tl i complexation k d 1 9 min 1 in strongly acidic environments under weakly acidic conditions tl i retention on ha was mainly attributed to the synergistic complexation effect of carboxyl and amide

induced by the intensification of mineral mining and heavy metal smelting has gradually attracted attention within the geochemical cycle of thallium kersten et al 2014 peter and viraraghavan 2005 vanÄk et al 2016 the heavy metal tl is ordinarily dispersed in the crust at low concentrations belzile and chen 2017 nielsen et al 2005 but emerging tl water pollution mainly originates from mine drainage and industrial wastewater liu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 compared with the more toxic form tl iii rickwood et al 2015 thermodynamically stable tl i is the primary source of tl pollution in aqueous environments hutapea et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 as good metal ion scavengers feng et al 2022 ye et al 2022 natural minerals and natural organic matter can retain tl i through ion exchange adsorption complexation or oxidation processes d orazio et al 2020 gomez gonzalez et al 2015 wick et al 2018 however periodic changes in the external water environment might drive the remobilization of retained tl i in natural media liu et al 2018 wen et al 2021 thereby affecting the environmental behavior of tl i acid rain and mine drainage induce additional tl leaching in soil environments liu et al 2021a vejvodovÃ¡ et al 2022 and sediment resuspension might also accelerate the release of heavy metals bao et al 2023 hence the investigation of the migration and retention behavior of tl i in natural environmental media is crucial for understanding the fate of thallium pollution chen et al 2019 wei et al 2021 the controlling mechanism of tl migration and transformation by natural inorganic minerals has been revealed in previous studies the oxidative retention of tl i on vacancy sites of manganese oxides cruz hernÃ¡ndez et al 2019 marafatto et al 2021 wick et al 2019 the exchangeable retention of tl i in clay mineral interlayers lin et al 2021 martin et al 2018 wick et al 2018 the surface complexation of tl i by hydroxyl groups of iron oxides chen et al 2022a li et al 2017 and the electrostatic retention of tl i through surface electrostatic attraction on quartz sands wang et al 2020 yao et al 2022 mainly revealed the relationship between the properties of mineral structure and tl i binding capacity zhuang et al 2021 the structure of inorganic minerals is the main intrinsic mineralogical factor liu et al 2016 2021b that affects tl i migration and retention behavior while environmental ph is the crucial external hydrochemical factor liu et al 2020 natural organic matter which is widely distributed in soils sediments and water bodies has also been reported to strongly influence tl i transport due to the presence of various organic functional groups gomez gonzalez et al 2015 jacobson et al 2005 zhuang and song 2021 wang et al showed that humic acid ha promotes tl i migration on quartz sands in neutral and alkaline environments and slightly inhibits tl i migration in acidic environments while bovine serum albumin bsa colloids inhibit the migration of tl i wang et al 2020 compared with inorganic minerals there have been few studies involving the quantitative and mechanistic effects of multidentate complexation with complex functional groups in organic matter on the migration and retention of tl i humus formed by the decomposition of plants animals and microorganisms is representative of natural organic matter in swamp and wetland environments guo et al 2019 peng et al 2022 yu et al 2019 the complexation capacity of humic acid or fulvic acid to tl i under equilibrium conditions has been explored previously to estimate the distribution ratio of dissolved organic tl i species in natural water systems kaplan et al defined the complexation constants of carboxyl and hydroxyl adsorption sites on fulvic acid fa extracted from acidic swamp soil through the mean fulvic acid unit model logk tl fa1 4 83 and logk tl fa2 3 32 respectively kaplan and mattigod 1998 computations showed that almost one fifth of dissolved thallium exists as organic complexes and 67 of free tl i ions bond to dissolved fulvic acid even in acidic swampy soil environments martin et al combined the donnan membrane technique dmt and the nica donnan model to determine the dissolved tl i om fraction 15 of total tl i species of free tl i complexed with dissolved ha logk tl ha1 0 2 and logk tl ha2 2 4 martin et al 2020 ruiz garcÃ­a focused on tl i adsorption by soluble ha in an alkaline environment and the nica donnan model was adopted to distinguish the tl i binding abilities of ha surface carboxyl sites and phenolic hydroxyl groups logk tl ha1 2 1 and logk tl ha2 0 26 ruiz garcÃ­a et al 2022 although the complexation constants of humus and tl i were obtained in previous studies the adsorption sites of humus were roughly divided into carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl sites which failed to reflect the bidentate and tridentate interactions between various organic functional groups and tl i moreover the knowledge gaps in the dynamic retention process of tl i on humus particles might severely limit the understanding of the organic complexation process of inorganic tl i in this study a unified kinetic model was established by combining humic ion binding model vii and a stirred flow kinetic model that elucidated the adsorption and desorption process the tl i migration and retention behaviors on ha were predicted by calculating the tl i ha complexation parameters reflecting the binding ability and response order in the unified kinetic model the molecular level insights of the 2d ftir cos technology also help to reveal heterogeneous complexation mechanisms during the dynamic adsorption and desorption of tl i on ha an in depth exploration of the tl i migration and retention behavior on ha under different environmental concentrations and ph values would help to elucidate the process of transformation of inorganic tl i to organic tl i and its geochemical cycles in natural water environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 purification of humic acid sigma aldrich ha was purified to remove interfering metal ions the purification steps were as follows tan et al 2008 vermeer et al 1998 5 ml hydrofluoric acid and 5 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid were added into 1 l aqueous solution containing 10 g of ha after stirring for 24 h the solution was filtered through a whatman membrane filter 0 45 Âµm with 1 m hcl washing to remove silica and soluble minerals the residue of humic acid was neutralized and adjusted to ph 10 with 0 5 m naoh which was kept for 24 h and then filtered the filtrate was adjusted to ph 2 with 1 m hcl and stirred for another 24 h to form the ha suspension the suspension was transferred to a dialysis bag regenerated cellulose mwco8000 spectrum and dialyzed with deionized water for another 2 weeks the deionized water for dialysis was replaced every 1 2 days to remove interfering trace metal ions in the ha after dialysis the suspension was centrifuged and the remaining solid was freeze dried for 2 days to obtain purified ha powder 2 2 batch adsorption experiments all adsorption equilibrium experiments were conducted in a 150 ml glass beaker at 25 c and away from light the batch tl i adsorption experiments were initiated by adding a known weight 50 mg of solid purified ha to a 10 mm nano3 and 2 5 10 0 mg l 1 tl i solution the experimental concentrations of tl i and ha maximized the tl ha complexation reaction to allow for the derivation of complexation constants the ph value of the adsorption reaction was controlled at 3 0 5 0 0 1 by the dropwise addition of a hno3 or nano3 solution based on the results of the adsorption kinetics experiments fig s1 samples were taken after the adsorption reaction was equilibrated for 2 h the obtained samples were quickly filtered with a 0 1 Âµm filter and acidified with 5 concentrated hno3 the total and residual concentrations of tl i were analyzed through inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the amount of adsorbed tl i on humic acid was calculated by the difference between the initial tl i concentration and the reaction equilibrium tl i concentration 2 3 stirred flow kinetics experiments the background solution used in the kinetic experiments was 10 mm nano3 the tl i stock solution was added to the background solution to prepare 1 1 10 5 mg l 1 tl i containing influent solutions with different concentrations and ph values a stirred flow reactor contained a magnetic stir bar and 6 5 ml of 0 5 or 5 g l 1 ha suspension at ph 3 and 5 before the stirred flow kinetics experiments were initiated the humic acid suspension in the reactor was sealed with a filter membrane 0 1 Î¼m and equilibrated with the influent background solution for 30 min tl i influent solutions with different concentrations and ph values were then pumped into the reactor to initiate adsorption desorption kinetic experiments after 2 h adsorption reaction the influent solution was switched to the background solution by a converter and the desorption experiments were carried out for another 2 h the solution flow rate of the entire adsorption and desorption kinetics experiments was maintained at 1 ml min 1 to simulate deep percolation in a swamp or wetland environment scott et al 2008 tam and wong 1999 zhang et al 2023 and the effluent solution was collected every 3 min during the reaction the collected samples were acidified with concentrated hno3 and the tl i concentration was detected through icp oes all adsorption and desorption experiments were performed at room temperature 25 1 c 2 4 humic ion binding model vii the humic ion binding model vii is an electrostatic model describing the interaction of protons and metal ions with fulvic and humic acids redundant model parameters were eliminated in model vii by establishing a formal relationship between the monodentate binding of strong and weak acid oxygenated ligands and removing factors that provided a range of ligand binding strengths metal ions could bind to different ha adsorption groups to form monodentate bidentate and tridentate complexes in addition model vii also considers interactions with groups containing softer ligand atoms such as n and s and Î´lk 2 was adopted to reflect the heterogeneity of multidentate binding sites more details of the humic ion binding model vii are shown in text s3 phreeqc is computational software for fitting and simulating the adsorption and complexation reactions of humic acid and metal ions marsac and catrouillet et al successfully fitted the complexation of radionuclides rare earth elements and ferrous ions with ha in phreeqc software catrouillet et al 2014 marsac et al 2012 2017 fifty adsorption sites on humic acid and their complexation reactions with tl i were defined in the model vii database of the phreeqc software table s2 for model vii each cation metal has only two main formal parameters logk ma and Î´lk 2 marsac et al 2017 tipping et al 2011 a universal proton and metal competition reaction system with ha in water could be constructed through the two tunable parameters eq s1 s9 the complexation constant of tl i ha log k ma and the softer ligand impact parameter Î´lk 2 were determined by minimizing the root mean square error between the experimental and predicted adsorption percentages logk ma 1 48 Î´lk 2 0 5 rmse 0 05 n 15 2 5 the unified kinetics model the tl i adsorption and desorption kinetics were completely controlled by the reaction of tl i with ha due to the minimal diffusion restriction in the stirred flow reactor compared with other kinetic reactors tl i binding species on various adsorption sites of ha showed different adsorption rate coefficients k ai and desorption rate coefficients k di according to the mass balance inside the stirred flow reactor the tl i retention and migration rates dc pi dt dcion dt on the binding site i of humic acid in the reactor could be described as shi et al 2013 1 d c p i d t k d i c p i k a i c

binding site i of humic acid respectively c pi mg g 1 represents the adsorbed tl i concentration c ion mg l 1 represents the dissolved tl i concentration in the solution m g l 1 represents the concentration of ha q l min 1 represents the flow rate in the reactor and v l represents the volume of the stirred flow kinetic reactor 3 k a i k d i c p i c i o n k p i c p i p h the relationship between the humic ion binding model and the stirred flow kinetic model was established eq 3 thereby incorporating the tl i ha complexation equilibrium reaction into the dynamic tl i adsorption desorption process both the adsorption rate coefficient k ai and the desorption rate coefficient k di of each binding site in this unified kinetic model are constrained by the equilibrium distribution coefficient k pi l g 1 feng et al 2018 tian et al 2017 the tl i distribution coefficient k pi of tl i on ha in the kinetic process could be derived from the humic ion binding model as a function of the ph value and adsorbed tl i concentration c pi at different sites of ha the fitted desorption rate coefficient and other parameters of the unified kinetic model could be obtained by minimizing the sum of squares of the difference between the calculated effluent tl i concentration and the measured effluent tl i concentration more calculation details of the kinetic model are shown in the si text s4 2 6 spectroscopic measurements and 2d cos analysis in situ flow cell attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir measurements for tl i adsorption on ha were performed using a thermo nicolet nexus is50r ftir spectrometer after ultrasonic dispersion 650 Î¼l of 10 mg ml 1 ha slurry was dropped on a znse surface to form a stable adsorption film under a n2 atmosphere at room temperature a 10 mm nano3 solution at ph 5 was passed through the flow cell at 1 ml min 1 for 30 min to remove loosely deposited particles on the surface of the ha coated film the background spectra for ha were acquired after the rinsing and preconditioning process was complete then the influent solution was switched to the solution containing 1 0 mg l 1 tl i 0 01 m nano3 at ph 5 during the reaction the influent solution was purged with n2 to eliminate interference from co2 on the ph of the solution spectra were collected every 15 min during the 2 h tl i adsorption process scanning from 400 to 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and 64 scans atr ftir spectra were collected and analyzed using omnic 9 2 software and data were smoothed and normalized then the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos method proposed by noda noda 1993 was adopted to deconvolute overlapping peaks in the spectrum and investigate spectral dynamics 2d cos could provide additional information on the correlation between external perturbations tl i adsorption from the continuous flow and sample ha structural changes typically via synchronous and asynchronous spectroscopy the sensitivity and response of the detected samples to external perturbations could be obtained by analyzing the information from autopeaks and cross peaks in the synchronous asynchronous spectra therefore 2d ftir cos could be used to improve the resolution of highly overlapping peaks in the ha spectra and assign different newly generated tl i species verifying the binding ability and response of functional groups on ha to tl i 3 results and discussion 3 1 humic ion binding modeling for tl i on ha the adsorption equilibrium of tl i and ha with ph variation was investigated at different tl concentrations 2 5 10 mg l 1 the inorganic tl species in the reaction system were mainly free tl i ions due to their weak binding ability for no3 and oh fig s4 in an acidic to neutral environment the complexation reaction of tl i with ha was ph dependent and tl i adsorption on ha was enhanced significantly with increasing ph less than 10 of tl i was adsorbed by ha at ph 3 while the adsorption ratio of tl i increased to 40 at ph 5 the strong adsorption dependence on ph suggested that the adsorption mechanism between tl i and ha might be humic ion complexation moreover the good fit of humic ion binding model vii to the adsorption equilibrium experimental data also indicated the complexation mechanism between metal tl i ions and organic functional groups on ha the ha carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl dominated the tl i complexation reaction the organic tl i ha binding sites in model vii were divided into mono multidentate or carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl binding sites and the distribution of tl i binding species at different ha adsorption sites was also obtained fig 1 the fundamental complexation constants of tl i and ha were calculated from the simulation of phreeqc model vii table s2 the softer ligand impact parameter Î´lk 2 0 5 reflected the potential synergistic effects of sulfhydryl or amine groups on the multidentate complexation the model fitting results showed that the monodentate sites of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 61 5 of the total ha adsorption sites contributed less to the tl i complexing capacity the bidentate complexation species was the dominant binding form 64 81 of retained tl i species on ha an increase in the external tl i ion concentration induced more bidentate complexation of tl i by ha with a transition from a strongly acidic to weakly acidic environment ph 3 to 5 the 1 distribution ratio of tridentate complexation species gradually increased to 16 while the proportion of monodentate complexes decreased from 36 to 10 among the tl i organic binding species 74 95 originated from the binding of tl i to carboxyl groups indicating an important tl i complexation role for the ha surface carboxyl groups moreover the multidentate complexing sites formed by the combination of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl functional groups and the participation of sulfhydryl amine groups also resulted in strong complexation of tl i in weakly acidic environments the tl i complexation ability of ha was enhanced significantly with increasing ph which is consistent with the experimental results at ph 3 7 and 9 from ruiz garcÃ­a et al 2022 the increase in ph enhanced the availability of various adsorption sites on ha fig s4 b c significantly strengthening tl i adsorption capacity in the acidic environment the available adsorption sites on ha were mainly composed of monodentate and bidentate carboxylate sites fig s4 b c so they dominated the organic complexation of tl i martin et al also indicated that a small amount of bound tl i is controlled by low affinity ha adsorption sites at ph values below 5 martin et al 2020 an increase in external tl i ions also promoted the formation of tl i carboxyl complexes in comparison phenolic hydroxyl groups were expected to be mainly deprotonated at ph 9 jayalath et al 2018 neale et al 2009 su et al 2021 wang and mulligan 2009 in previous studies mainly the tl i complexation ability of phenolic hydroxyl groups on ha in neutral to basic environments was demonstrated martin et al 2020 ruiz garcÃ­a et al 2022 phenolic hydroxyl sites have high affinity and availability in neutral and basic environments and may become the leading tl i complexing group on ha however their lower site availability and moderate complexation capacity logk 3 00 make it difficult for independent phenolic hydroxyl sites to complex free tl i ions at ph values below 5 although the availability of multidentate adsorption sites e g carboxy phenolic hydroxyl sites was also low they might bind a small fraction of tl i due to their strong complexation ability logk 4 48 7 46 hence the monodentate carboxyl complexes might be the major organic tl i binding species on ha at low ph 3 the multidentate complexation effect of carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl and sulfhydryl amine groups would increase tl i adsorption on ha in weakly acidic environments 3 2 kinetic modeling of tl i adsorption desorption on ha the migration kinetics of tl i on ha at different reaction ph values and influent tl i ion concentrations are shown in fig 2 according to the classification of functional groups and complex forms table s2 different sets of distribution coefficients k pi for carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl or mono multidentate binding sites were obtained by humic ion binding modeling the tl i distribution coefficients at different adsorption binding sites were functions of ph and retained tl i concentration c pi and were primarily regulated by ph conditions fig s5 unified kinetic models with different distribution coefficient classifications were constructed to determine the role of various functional groups and complexation forms on ha in the migration and retention of tl i the small rmse calculated by the model indicated that the unified kinetic models fitted well with the experimental data and could reflect the migration behaviors of tl i on ha under different environmental conditions fig 2 in a weakly acidic environment higher ha concentrations significantly inhibited the migration of tl i at different influent concentrations and delayed the peak in effluent tl i concentration the apparent migration and retention behaviors of tl i in the stirred flow reaction device were essentially considered to be the combined effect of tl i ha adsorption and desorption reactions an increase in ph significantly reduced the apparent tl i migration rate on ha which might be attributed to its effect on the adsorption rate coefficient k ai according to eq 1 consistent with previous studies involving tl i transport on inorganic minerals ambient ph is a significant environmental factor affecting the migration behavior of tl i cao et al 2023 chen et al 2022b yao et al 2022 the distribution of retained tl i binding species on ha fig 3 during the adsorption desorption reaction was obtained according to the unified kinetic models monodentate and bidentate carboxyl complexation contributed more to the dynamic tl i retention behavior in acidic environments with increasing ph the bidentate carboxyl groups of ha exhibited a more significant organic retention ability for tl i while tl i complexation by monodentate adsorption groups gradually weakened the inflow of tl i ions with increasing ambient concentration further improved the contribution of bidentate carboxyl groups on ha to tl i retention fig s6 the weakly acidic environment also enhanced tl i retention on the multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites during the desorption process a portion of the monodentate and bidentate carboxyl tl i species might be converted to multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl tl i species leading to sustained tl i accumulation on ha in weakly acidic environments hence the organic complexation effects of ha were the critical intrinsic factor affecting the migration and retention behaviors of tl i in changing water environments 3 3 adsorption and desorption rate coefficients of various complexes the desorption rate coefficient k di values obtained from the unified kinetic models for different adsorption sites are shown in table 1 the desorption reaction was considered independent of the complexation reaction between tl i and ha the desorption rate coefficient was a constant that did not vary with the reaction conditions and was an intrinsic coefficient that directly reflected the tl i ha complexation ability chen et al 2022a the k di values of monodentate bidentate and tridentate tl i binding species decreased successively the fitted tl i desorption rate coefficient on the carboxyl sites was larger than that on the multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites k d c 5 8 10 2 k d c p 1 1 10 3 the tl i binding ability indicated by the desorption rate coefficients of different organic adsorption sites was also consistent with that reflected by the complexation constant the complexation ability of multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites to tl i was stronger than that of monodentate bidentate carboxyl sites the adsorption rate coefficients varied with retained tl i concentration and ph fig 4 which reflected the complexation kinetics of tl i at different binding sites the increase in tl i retention slightly weakened the k ai on each adsorption binding site of ha which could be attributed to the reduced availability of adsorption sites in contrast the effect of ph on k ai was more severe and the k ai values of all tl i binding sites on ha increased with increasing ph the k ai values of multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites surged by 3 4 magnitude from ph 3 to ph 5 which refected a significant enhancement in the tl i adsorption reaction on these sites in addition the monodentate carboxyl sites had the largest k ai values which indicated a strong adsorption response to the influent tl i ions the multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites had the smallest k ai values which reflected their weak sensitivity and hysteresis response to the dynamic tl i ha complexation reaction in the predictions for environmental tl i transport and retention kinetics obtained from the unified model fig s7 the influent tl i 0 02 to 7 25 Î¼g l 1 would be retained on the swamp ha particles mainly through carboxyl sites among them the bidentate carboxyl sites dominate the complexation of tl i on ha due to their high availability fig s4 and their stronger complexation ability logk 2 96 3 96 which was consistent with the variation in the intensity of the spectral response in 2d ftir cos in fig 5 below in comparison the monodentate carboxyl sites which have weaker complexation ability logk 1 48 contributed less to tl i retention on ha the high k ai and moderate k d of the carboxyl sites monodentate and bidentate carboxyl sites led to the rapid response of ha to changes in the environmental tl i concentration and the formation of the exchangeable carboxyl tl i complex on ha although tl i might be accumulated by ha particles in the dynamic adsorption reaction the weaker binding ability of the monodentate and bidentate sites would lead to the unstable retention of tl i on ha which is consistent with observations of thallium migration in organic compound rich soils vanÄk et al 2009 2013 furthermore under higher ph conditions ha might immobilize free tl i for a long time in the form of stable multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl tl i complexes with small k ai and small k di 3 4 analysis of atr ftir with 2d cos atr ftir spectroscopy was conducted to determine the changes in ha functional groups in the dynamic tl i complexation reaction fig 5 a and the spectrum in the range of 1200 1800 cm 1 was analyzed by the 2d cos method fig 5 b c the positive cross peaks at 1350 1800 cm 1 in the synchronous map characterized the ha organic groups complexed with tl i the ha functional groups within this range had positive and synergistic correlation responses to the continuous influx of tl i ions two predominant peaks in atr ftir spectra fig 5 a and the autopeaks at 1700 and 1546 cm 1 in the synchronous map fig 5 b demonstrated the intense change in peak strength which were attributed to the stretching of carboxyl v co zhang et al 2018 and the stretching of amide v nh guan et al 2018 chelated carboxyl v co zhang et al 2017 2018 respectively the autopeaks showed that the carboxyl tl i species might be the predominant tl i binding species on ha the multidentate carboxyl chelating sites affected by amide groups 1546 cm 1 might dominate the tl i ha complexation process previous studies have also reported the synergistic complexation of amide and carboxyl groups of ha with other metal ions cu2 pb2 and cd2 jin et al 2018 shi et al 2018 tang et al 2019 the asynchronous map provided additional information on the response sequence of ha organic groups to the influent tl i ions and the details of the cross peaks in the tl i ha system are shown in table s3 the cross peaks of ha at 1700 1640 1585 1546 and 1386 cm 1 were found during the dynamic tl i adsorption process the peaks at 1640 and 1585 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching of amide v co chen et al 2014 guan et al 2018 and the symmetric stretching of coo v cos yang et al 2021 and the peaks at 1386 cm 1 were ascribed to the asymmetric stretching of coo or co stretching of phenolic hydroxyl groups v coas chen et al 2014 yang et al 2021 according to noda s rules noda 1993 the asynchronous map indicated that the order for the variation in ha peaks was 1700 1546 1640 1585 1386 cm 1 which corresponded to the response sequence of ha functional groups in the tl i complexation process c o stretching of carboxyl groups c o stretching of chelated carboxyl groups affected by amide c o stretching of amide groups co symmetric stretching of carboxyl groups co asymmetric vibration of carboxyl groups or phenolic hydroxyl groups the k value estimated from atr absorbance also verified the rapid tl i adsorption kinetics on the carboxyl groups compared with chelated carboxyl amide groups table s4 the preferential variation in the overall carboxyl c o stretching compared with the chelated carboxyl c o stretching might be attributed to the rapid tl i binding response of monodentate carboxyl sites widely distributed on ha in general the synchronous spectral information in 2d ftir cos revealed the strong response of carboxyl groups especially multidentate carboxyl groups affected by amide groups to the tl i complexation process at ph 5 conditions which corroborated the dominant role of bidentate carboxyl sites in the humic ion binding modeling for tl i ha in the asynchronous map of 2d ftir cos the response sequence of organic functional groups in the tl ha system verified the rapid tl i adsorption on monodentate carboxyl sites and a temporal lag in tl i adsorption on multidentate carboxyl sites which was also consistent with the response order within the unified kinetic modeling previous studies have focused on complexation equilibrium between tl i and dissolved ha in neutral to alkaline environments martin et al 2020 ruiz garcÃ­a et al 2022 it was reported that ha could effectively adsorb heavy metal ions at low ph but the complexation of heavy metals with soluble ha with increasing ph might lead to the formation of soluble ha heavy metal salts coles and yong 2006 havelcovÃ¡ et al 2009 consistent with findings in previous studies the low tl i adsorption capacity of ha was also demonstrated in this study fig s2 nevertheless as a widely distributed natural organic matter in environmental soil or sediment particulate organic matter insoluble ha particles in acidic environments could effectively inhibit tl i migration and retain influent tl i ions which might have been overlooked previously based on spectral analysis and unified kinetics modeling the dynamic tl i migration and retention behavior were mainly affected by three aspects of heterogeneous adsorption sites on ha i the availability of adsorption sites the availability of phenolic hydroxyl sites was significantly reduced due to their low deprotonation in acidic environments although the complexation constant logk of phenolic hydroxyl sites was greater than that of carboxyl sites phenolic hydroxyl contributes less to tl i retention on ha ii the complexation responsiveness of adsorption sites the adsorption sites with high k ai monodentate carboxyl sites had higher kinetic responsiveness to influent tl i leading to preferential tl i adsorption under different environmental conditions higher ph environments favored the alleviation of the competition of dissolved hydrogen ions increasing the k ai of the adsorption sites and accelerating the adsorption response of ha to tl i moreover the increased retained tl i concentration would slightly reduce k ai due to the decrease in available sites iii the complexation ability of adsorption sites the complexation constant logk and desorption rate coefficient k d reflected the intrinsic binding ability of an adsorption site to tl i which were independent of ph and environmental tl concentration the larger complexation constants and lower desorption rate coefficients were indicative of strong complexation and the persistent retention of tl i at these adsorption sites e g tridentate adsorption sites 4 conclusions humus particles could act as temporary scavengers of tl i in naturally acidic environments and the retained tl i might be slowly released to the environment with a periodic change in dynamic tl concentration the transformation patterns of tl i on ha were similar under different environmental tl i concentrations in contrast environmental ph could regulate the organic binding pathway of tl i by strongly impacting the complexation responsiveness of ha binding sites in strongly acidic environments carboxyl monodentate complexation might be the principal organic retention pathway for tl i nevertheless multidentate carboxyl complexation affected by amide groups would be the main binding mode in the dynamic tl i retention process under weakly acidic environments the potentially sustained retention of tl i onto ha was attributed to the slow responsiveness and strong complexing ability of the multidentate carboxyl phenol hydroxyl sites natural

14753,widely distributed soil humic acid ha would significantly affect the environmental migration behavior of tl i but a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the dynamic tl i retention process on ha is limited a unified kinetic model was established by coupling the humic ion binding model with a stirred flow kinetic model which quantified the complexation constants and responsiveness coefficients during dynamic tl i ha complexation furthermore the heterogeneous complexation mechanism of ha and tl i was revealed by batch adsorption experiments stirred flow migration experiments and 2d ftir cos analysis an increase in ph significantly improved the responsiveness of ha organic binding sites promoting tl i dynamic retention monodentate carboxyl groups induced rapid tl i complexation k d 1 9 min 1 in strongly acidic environments under weakly acidic conditions tl i retention on ha was mainly attributed to the synergistic complexation effect of carboxyl and amide

induced by the intensification of mineral mining and heavy metal smelting has gradually attracted attention within the geochemical cycle of thallium kersten et al 2014 peter and viraraghavan 2005 vanÄk et al 2016 the heavy metal tl is ordinarily dispersed in the crust at low concentrations belzile and chen 2017 nielsen et al 2005 but emerging tl water pollution mainly originates from mine drainage and industrial wastewater liu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 compared with the more toxic form tl iii rickwood et al 2015 thermodynamically stable tl i is the primary source of tl pollution in aqueous environments hutapea et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 as good metal ion scavengers feng et al 2022 ye et al 2022 natural minerals and natural organic matter can retain tl i through ion exchange adsorption complexation or oxidation processes d orazio et al 2020 gomez gonzalez et al 2015 wick et al 2018 however periodic changes in the external water environment might drive the remobilization of retained tl i in natural media liu et al 2018 wen et al 2021 thereby affecting the environmental behavior of tl i acid rain and mine drainage induce additional tl leaching in soil environments liu et al 2021a vejvodovÃ¡ et al 2022 and sediment resuspension might also accelerate the release of heavy metals bao et al 2023 hence the investigation of the migration and retention behavior of tl i in natural environmental media is crucial for understanding the fate of thallium pollution chen et al 2019 wei et al 2021 the controlling mechanism of tl migration and transformation by natural inorganic minerals has been revealed in previous studies the oxidative retention of tl i on vacancy sites of manganese oxides cruz hernÃ¡ndez et al 2019 marafatto et al 2021 wick et al 2019 the exchangeable retention of tl i in clay mineral interlayers lin et al 2021 martin et al 2018 wick et al 2018 the surface complexation of tl i by hydroxyl groups of iron oxides chen et al 2022a li et al 2017 and the electrostatic retention of tl i through surface electrostatic attraction on quartz sands wang et al 2020 yao et al 2022 mainly revealed the relationship between the properties of mineral structure and tl i binding capacity zhuang et al 2021 the structure of inorganic minerals is the main intrinsic mineralogical factor liu et al 2016 2021b that affects tl i migration and retention behavior while environmental ph is the crucial external hydrochemical factor liu et al 2020 natural organic matter which is widely distributed in soils sediments and water bodies has also been reported to strongly influence tl i transport due to the presence of various organic functional groups gomez gonzalez et al 2015 jacobson et al 2005 zhuang and song 2021 wang et al showed that humic acid ha promotes tl i migration on quartz sands in neutral and alkaline environments and slightly inhibits tl i migration in acidic environments while bovine serum albumin bsa colloids inhibit the migration of tl i wang et al 2020 compared with inorganic minerals there have been few studies involving the quantitative and mechanistic effects of multidentate complexation with complex functional groups in organic matter on the migration and retention of tl i humus formed by the decomposition of plants animals and microorganisms is representative of natural organic matter in swamp and wetland environments guo et al 2019 peng et al 2022 yu et al 2019 the complexation capacity of humic acid or fulvic acid to tl i under equilibrium conditions has been explored previously to estimate the distribution ratio of dissolved organic tl i species in natural water systems kaplan et al defined the complexation constants of carboxyl and hydroxyl adsorption sites on fulvic acid fa extracted from acidic swamp soil through the mean fulvic acid unit model logk tl fa1 4 83 and logk tl fa2 3 32 respectively kaplan and mattigod 1998 computations showed that almost one fifth of dissolved thallium exists as organic complexes and 67 of free tl i ions bond to dissolved fulvic acid even in acidic swampy soil environments martin et al combined the donnan membrane technique dmt and the nica donnan model to determine the dissolved tl i om fraction 15 of total tl i species of free tl i complexed with dissolved ha logk tl ha1 0 2 and logk tl ha2 2 4 martin et al 2020 ruiz garcÃ­a focused on tl i adsorption by soluble ha in an alkaline environment and the nica donnan model was adopted to distinguish the tl i binding abilities of ha surface carboxyl sites and phenolic hydroxyl groups logk tl ha1 2 1 and logk tl ha2 0 26 ruiz garcÃ­a et al 2022 although the complexation constants of humus and tl i were obtained in previous studies the adsorption sites of humus were roughly divided into carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl sites which failed to reflect the bidentate and tridentate interactions between various organic functional groups and tl i moreover the knowledge gaps in the dynamic retention process of tl i on humus particles might severely limit the understanding of the organic complexation process of inorganic tl i in this study a unified kinetic model was established by combining humic ion binding model vii and a stirred flow kinetic model that elucidated the adsorption and desorption process the tl i migration and retention behaviors on ha were predicted by calculating the tl i ha complexation parameters reflecting the binding ability and response order in the unified kinetic model the molecular level insights of the 2d ftir cos technology also help to reveal heterogeneous complexation mechanisms during the dynamic adsorption and desorption of tl i on ha an in depth exploration of the tl i migration and retention behavior on ha under different environmental concentrations and ph values would help to elucidate the process of transformation of inorganic tl i to organic tl i and its geochemical cycles in natural water environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 purification of humic acid sigma aldrich ha was purified to remove interfering metal ions the purification steps were as follows tan et al 2008 vermeer et al 1998 5 ml hydrofluoric acid and 5 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid were added into 1 l aqueous solution containing 10 g of ha after stirring for 24 h the solution was filtered through a whatman membrane filter 0 45 Âµm with 1 m hcl washing to remove silica and soluble minerals the residue of humic acid was neutralized and adjusted to ph 10 with 0 5 m naoh which was kept for 24 h and then filtered the filtrate was adjusted to ph 2 with 1 m hcl and stirred for another 24 h to form the ha suspension the suspension was transferred to a dialysis bag regenerated cellulose mwco8000 spectrum and dialyzed with deionized water for another 2 weeks the deionized water for dialysis was replaced every 1 2 days to remove interfering trace metal ions in the ha after dialysis the suspension was centrifuged and the remaining solid was freeze dried for 2 days to obtain purified ha powder 2 2 batch adsorption experiments all adsorption equilibrium experiments were conducted in a 150 ml glass beaker at 25 c and away from light the batch tl i adsorption experiments were initiated by adding a known weight 50 mg of solid purified ha to a 10 mm nano3 and 2 5 10 0 mg l 1 tl i solution the experimental concentrations of tl i and ha maximized the tl ha complexation reaction to allow for the derivation of complexation constants the ph value of the adsorption reaction was controlled at 3 0 5 0 0 1 by the dropwise addition of a hno3 or nano3 solution based on the results of the adsorption kinetics experiments fig s1 samples were taken after the adsorption reaction was equilibrated for 2 h the obtained samples were quickly filtered with a 0 1 Âµm filter and acidified with 5 concentrated hno3 the total and residual concentrations of tl i were analyzed through inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the amount of adsorbed tl i on humic acid was calculated by the difference between the initial tl i concentration and the reaction equilibrium tl i concentration 2 3 stirred flow kinetics experiments the background solution used in the kinetic experiments was 10 mm nano3 the tl i stock solution was added to the background solution to prepare 1 1 10 5 mg l 1 tl i containing influent solutions with different concentrations and ph values a stirred flow reactor contained a magnetic stir bar and 6 5 ml of 0 5 or 5 g l 1 ha suspension at ph 3 and 5 before the stirred flow kinetics experiments were initiated the humic acid suspension in the reactor was sealed with a filter membrane 0 1 Î¼m and equilibrated with the influent background solution for 30 min tl i influent solutions with different concentrations and ph values were then pumped into the reactor to initiate adsorption desorption kinetic experiments after 2 h adsorption reaction the influent solution was switched to the background solution by a converter and the desorption experiments were carried out for another 2 h the solution flow rate of the entire adsorption and desorption kinetics experiments was maintained at 1 ml min 1 to simulate deep percolation in a swamp or wetland environment scott et al 2008 tam and wong 1999 zhang et al 2023 and the effluent solution was collected every 3 min during the reaction the collected samples were acidified with concentrated hno3 and the tl i concentration was detected through icp oes all adsorption and desorption experiments were performed at room temperature 25 1 c 2 4 humic ion binding model vii the humic ion binding model vii is an electrostatic model describing the interaction of protons and metal ions with fulvic and humic acids redundant model parameters were eliminated in model vii by establishing a formal relationship between the monodentate binding of strong and weak acid oxygenated ligands and removing factors that provided a range of ligand binding strengths metal ions could bind to different ha adsorption groups to form monodentate bidentate and tridentate complexes in addition model vii also considers interactions with groups containing softer ligand atoms such as n and s and Î´lk 2 was adopted to reflect the heterogeneity of multidentate binding sites more details of the humic ion binding model vii are shown in text s3 phreeqc is computational software for fitting and simulating the adsorption and complexation reactions of humic acid and metal ions marsac and catrouillet et al successfully fitted the complexation of radionuclides rare earth elements and ferrous ions with ha in phreeqc software catrouillet et al 2014 marsac et al 2012 2017 fifty adsorption sites on humic acid and their complexation reactions with tl i were defined in the model vii database of the phreeqc software table s2 for model vii each cation metal has only two main formal parameters logk ma and Î´lk 2 marsac et al 2017 tipping et al 2011 a universal proton and metal competition reaction system with ha in water could be constructed through the two tunable parameters eq s1 s9 the complexation constant of tl i ha log k ma and the softer ligand impact parameter Î´lk 2 were determined by minimizing the root mean square error between the experimental and predicted adsorption percentages logk ma 1 48 Î´lk 2 0 5 rmse 0 05 n 15 2 5 the unified kinetics model the tl i adsorption and desorption kinetics were completely controlled by the reaction of tl i with ha due to the minimal diffusion restriction in the stirred flow reactor compared with other kinetic reactors tl i binding species on various adsorption sites of ha showed different adsorption rate coefficients k ai and desorption rate coefficients k di according to the mass balance inside the stirred flow reactor the tl i retention and migration rates dc pi dt dcion dt on the binding site i of humic acid in the reactor could be described as shi et al 2013 1 d c p i d t k d i c p i k a i c

binding site i of humic acid respectively c pi mg g 1 represents the adsorbed tl i concentration c ion mg l 1 represents the dissolved tl i concentration in the solution m g l 1 represents the concentration of ha q l min 1 represents the flow rate in the reactor and v l represents the volume of the stirred flow kinetic reactor 3 k a i k d i c p i c i o n k p i c p i p h the relationship between the humic ion binding model and the stirred flow kinetic model was established eq 3 thereby incorporating the tl i ha complexation equilibrium reaction into the dynamic tl i adsorption desorption process both the adsorption rate coefficient k ai and the desorption rate coefficient k di of each binding site in this unified kinetic model are constrained by the equilibrium distribution coefficient k pi l g 1 feng et al 2018 tian et al 2017 the tl i distribution coefficient k pi of tl i on ha in the kinetic process could be derived from the humic ion binding model as a function of the ph value and adsorbed tl i concentration c pi at different sites of ha the fitted desorption rate coefficient and other parameters of the unified kinetic model could be obtained by minimizing the sum of squares of the difference between the calculated effluent tl i concentration and the measured effluent tl i concentration more calculation details of the kinetic model are shown in the si text s4 2 6 spectroscopic measurements and 2d cos analysis in situ flow cell attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir measurements for tl i adsorption on ha were performed using a thermo nicolet nexus is50r ftir spectrometer after ultrasonic dispersion 650 Î¼l of 10 mg ml 1 ha slurry was dropped on a znse surface to form a stable adsorption film under a n2 atmosphere at room temperature a 10 mm nano3 solution at ph 5 was passed through the flow cell at 1 ml min 1 for 30 min to remove loosely deposited particles on the surface of the ha coated film the background spectra for ha were acquired after the rinsing and preconditioning process was complete then the influent solution was switched to the solution containing 1 0 mg l 1 tl i 0 01 m nano3 at ph 5 during the reaction the influent solution was purged with n2 to eliminate interference from co2 on the ph of the solution spectra were collected every 15 min during the 2 h tl i adsorption process scanning from 400 to 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and 64 scans atr ftir spectra were collected and analyzed using omnic 9 2 software and data were smoothed and normalized then the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos method proposed by noda noda 1993 was adopted to deconvolute overlapping peaks in the spectrum and investigate spectral dynamics 2d cos could provide additional information on the correlation between external perturbations tl i adsorption from the continuous flow and sample ha structural changes typically via synchronous and asynchronous spectroscopy the sensitivity and response of the detected samples to external perturbations could be obtained by analyzing the information from autopeaks and cross peaks in the synchronous asynchronous spectra therefore 2d ftir cos could be used to improve the resolution of highly overlapping peaks in the ha spectra and assign different newly generated tl i species verifying the binding ability and response of functional groups on ha to tl i 3 results and discussion 3 1 humic ion binding modeling for tl i on ha the adsorption equilibrium of tl i and ha with ph variation was investigated at different tl concentrations 2 5 10 mg l 1 the inorganic tl species in the reaction system were mainly free tl i ions due to their weak binding ability for no3 and oh fig s4 in an acidic to neutral environment the complexation reaction of tl i with ha was ph dependent and tl i adsorption on ha was enhanced significantly with increasing ph less than 10 of tl i was adsorbed by ha at ph 3 while the adsorption ratio of tl i increased to 40 at ph 5 the strong adsorption dependence on ph suggested that the adsorption mechanism between tl i and ha might be humic ion complexation moreover the good fit of humic ion binding model vii to the adsorption equilibrium experimental data also indicated the complexation mechanism between metal tl i ions and organic functional groups on ha the ha carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl dominated the tl i complexation reaction the organic tl i ha binding sites in model vii were divided into mono multidentate or carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl binding sites and the distribution of tl i binding species at different ha adsorption sites was also obtained fig 1 the fundamental complexation constants of tl i and ha were calculated from the simulation of phreeqc model vii table s2 the softer ligand impact parameter Î´lk 2 0 5 reflected the potential synergistic effects of sulfhydryl or amine groups on the multidentate complexation the model fitting results showed that the monodentate sites of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 61 5 of the total ha adsorption sites contributed less to the tl i complexing capacity the bidentate complexation species was the dominant binding form 64 81 of retained tl i species on ha an increase in the external tl i ion concentration induced more bidentate complexation of tl i by ha with a transition from a strongly acidic to weakly acidic environment ph 3 to 5 the 1 distribution ratio of tridentate complexation species gradually increased to 16 while the proportion of monodentate complexes decreased from 36 to 10 among the tl i organic binding species 74 95 originated from the binding of tl i to carboxyl groups indicating an important tl i complexation role for the ha surface carboxyl groups moreover the multidentate complexing sites formed by the combination of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl functional groups and the participation of sulfhydryl amine groups also resulted in strong complexation of tl i in weakly acidic environments the tl i complexation ability of ha was enhanced significantly with increasing ph which is consistent with the experimental results at ph 3 7 and 9 from ruiz garcÃ­a et al 2022 the increase in ph enhanced the availability of various adsorption sites on ha fig s4 b c significantly strengthening tl i adsorption capacity in the acidic environment the available adsorption sites on ha were mainly composed of monodentate and bidentate carboxylate sites fig s4 b c so they dominated the organic complexation of tl i martin et al also indicated that a small amount of bound tl i is controlled by low affinity ha adsorption sites at ph values below 5 martin et al 2020 an increase in external tl i ions also promoted the formation of tl i carboxyl complexes in comparison phenolic hydroxyl groups were expected to be mainly deprotonated at ph 9 jayalath et al 2018 neale et al 2009 su et al 2021 wang and mulligan 2009 in previous studies mainly the tl i complexation ability of phenolic hydroxyl groups on ha in neutral to basic environments was demonstrated martin et al 2020 ruiz garcÃ­a et al 2022 phenolic hydroxyl sites have high affinity and availability in neutral and basic environments and may become the leading tl i complexing group on ha however their lower site availability and moderate complexation capacity logk 3 00 make it difficult for independent phenolic hydroxyl sites to complex free tl i ions at ph values below 5 although the availability of multidentate adsorption sites e g carboxy phenolic hydroxyl sites was also low they might bind a small fraction of tl i due to their strong complexation ability logk 4 48 7 46 hence the monodentate carboxyl complexes might be the major organic tl i binding species on ha at low ph 3 the multidentate complexation effect of carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl and sulfhydryl amine groups would increase tl i adsorption on ha in weakly acidic environments 3 2 kinetic modeling of tl i adsorption desorption on ha the migration kinetics of tl i on ha at different reaction ph values and influent tl i ion concentrations are shown in fig 2 according to the classification of functional groups and complex forms table s2 different sets of distribution coefficients k pi for carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl or mono multidentate binding sites were obtained by humic ion binding modeling the tl i distribution coefficients at different adsorption binding sites were functions of ph and retained tl i concentration c pi and were primarily regulated by ph conditions fig s5 unified kinetic models with different distribution coefficient classifications were constructed to determine the role of various functional groups and complexation forms on ha in the migration and retention of tl i the small rmse calculated by the model indicated that the unified kinetic models fitted well with the experimental data and could reflect the migration behaviors of tl i on ha under different environmental conditions fig 2 in a weakly acidic environment higher ha concentrations significantly inhibited the migration of tl i at different influent concentrations and delayed the peak in effluent tl i concentration the apparent migration and retention behaviors of tl i in the stirred flow reaction device were essentially considered to be the combined effect of tl i ha adsorption and desorption reactions an increase in ph significantly reduced the apparent tl i migration rate on ha which might be attributed to its effect on the adsorption rate coefficient k ai according to eq 1 consistent with previous studies involving tl i transport on inorganic minerals ambient ph is a significant environmental factor affecting the migration behavior of tl i cao et al 2023 chen et al 2022b yao et al 2022 the distribution of retained tl i binding species on ha fig 3 during the adsorption desorption reaction was obtained according to the unified kinetic models monodentate and bidentate carboxyl complexation contributed more to the dynamic tl i retention behavior in acidic environments with increasing ph the bidentate carboxyl groups of ha exhibited a more significant organic retention ability for tl i while tl i complexation by monodentate adsorption groups gradually weakened the inflow of tl i ions with increasing ambient concentration further improved the contribution of bidentate carboxyl groups on ha to tl i retention fig s6 the weakly acidic environment also enhanced tl i retention on the multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites during the desorption process a portion of the monodentate and bidentate carboxyl tl i species might be converted to multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl tl i species leading to sustained tl i accumulation on ha in weakly acidic environments hence the organic complexation effects of ha were the critical intrinsic factor affecting the migration and retention behaviors of tl i in changing water environments 3 3 adsorption and desorption rate coefficients of various complexes the desorption rate coefficient k di values obtained from the unified kinetic models for different adsorption sites are shown in table 1 the desorption reaction was considered independent of the complexation reaction between tl i and ha the desorption rate coefficient was a constant that did not vary with the reaction conditions and was an intrinsic coefficient that directly reflected the tl i ha complexation ability chen et al 2022a the k di values of monodentate bidentate and tridentate tl i binding species decreased successively the fitted tl i desorption rate coefficient on the carboxyl sites was larger than that on the multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites k d c 5 8 10 2 k d c p 1 1 10 3 the tl i binding ability indicated by the desorption rate coefficients of different organic adsorption sites was also consistent with that reflected by the complexation constant the complexation ability of multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites to tl i was stronger than that of monodentate bidentate carboxyl sites the adsorption rate coefficients varied with retained tl i concentration and ph fig 4 which reflected the complexation kinetics of tl i at different binding sites the increase in tl i retention slightly weakened the k ai on each adsorption binding site of ha which could be attributed to the reduced availability of adsorption sites in contrast the effect of ph on k ai was more severe and the k ai values of all tl i binding sites on ha increased with increasing ph the k ai values of multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites surged by 3 4 magnitude from ph 3 to ph 5 which refected a significant enhancement in the tl i adsorption reaction on these sites in addition the monodentate carboxyl sites had the largest k ai values which indicated a strong adsorption response to the influent tl i ions the multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl sites had the smallest k ai values which reflected their weak sensitivity and hysteresis response to the dynamic tl i ha complexation reaction in the predictions for environmental tl i transport and retention kinetics obtained from the unified model fig s7 the influent tl i 0 02 to 7 25 Î¼g l 1 would be retained on the swamp ha particles mainly through carboxyl sites among them the bidentate carboxyl sites dominate the complexation of tl i on ha due to their high availability fig s4 and their stronger complexation ability logk 2 96 3 96 which was consistent with the variation in the intensity of the spectral response in 2d ftir cos in fig 5 below in comparison the monodentate carboxyl sites which have weaker complexation ability logk 1 48 contributed less to tl i retention on ha the high k ai and moderate k d of the carboxyl sites monodentate and bidentate carboxyl sites led to the rapid response of ha to changes in the environmental tl i concentration and the formation of the exchangeable carboxyl tl i complex on ha although tl i might be accumulated by ha particles in the dynamic adsorption reaction the weaker binding ability of the monodentate and bidentate sites would lead to the unstable retention of tl i on ha which is consistent with observations of thallium migration in organic compound rich soils vanÄk et al 2009 2013 furthermore under higher ph conditions ha might immobilize free tl i for a long time in the form of stable multidentate carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl tl i complexes with small k ai and small k di 3 4 analysis of atr ftir with 2d cos atr ftir spectroscopy was conducted to determine the changes in ha functional groups in the dynamic tl i complexation reaction fig 5 a and the spectrum in the range of 1200 1800 cm 1 was analyzed by the 2d cos method fig 5 b c the positive cross peaks at 1350 1800 cm 1 in the synchronous map characterized the ha organic groups complexed with tl i the ha functional groups within this range had positive and synergistic correlation responses to the continuous influx of tl i ions two predominant peaks in atr ftir spectra fig 5 a and the autopeaks at 1700 and 1546 cm 1 in the synchronous map fig 5 b demonstrated the intense change in peak strength which were attributed to the stretching of carboxyl v co zhang et al 2018 and the stretching of amide v nh guan et al 2018 chelated carboxyl v co zhang et al 2017 2018 respectively the autopeaks showed that the carboxyl tl i species might be the predominant tl i binding species on ha the multidentate carboxyl chelating sites affected by amide groups 1546 cm 1 might dominate the tl i ha complexation process previous studies have also reported the synergistic complexation of amide and carboxyl groups of ha with other metal ions cu2 pb2 and cd2 jin et al 2018 shi et al 2018 tang et al 2019 the asynchronous map provided additional information on the response sequence of ha organic groups to the influent tl i ions and the details of the cross peaks in the tl i ha system are shown in table s3 the cross peaks of ha at 1700 1640 1585 1546 and 1386 cm 1 were found during the dynamic tl i adsorption process the peaks at 1640 and 1585 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching of amide v co chen et al 2014 guan et al 2018 and the symmetric stretching of coo v cos yang et al 2021 and the peaks at 1386 cm 1 were ascribed to the asymmetric stretching of coo or co stretching of phenolic hydroxyl groups v coas chen et al 2014 yang et al 2021 according to noda s rules noda 1993 the asynchronous map indicated that the order for the variation in ha peaks was 1700 1546 1640 1585 1386 cm 1 which corresponded to the response sequence of ha functional groups in the tl i complexation process c o stretching of carboxyl groups c o stretching of chelated carboxyl groups affected by amide c o stretching of amide groups co symmetric stretching of carboxyl groups co asymmetric vibration of carboxyl groups or phenolic hydroxyl groups the k value estimated from atr absorbance also verified the rapid tl i adsorption kinetics on the carboxyl groups compared with chelated carboxyl amide groups table s4 the preferential variation in the overall carboxyl c o stretching compared with the chelated carboxyl c o stretching might be attributed to the rapid tl i binding response of monodentate carboxyl sites widely distributed on ha in general the synchronous spectral information in 2d ftir cos revealed the strong response of carboxyl groups especially multidentate carboxyl groups affected by amide groups to the tl i complexation process at ph 5 conditions which corroborated the dominant role of bidentate carboxyl sites in the humic ion binding modeling for tl i ha in the asynchronous map of 2d ftir cos the response sequence of organic functional groups in the tl ha system verified the rapid tl i adsorption on monodentate carboxyl sites and a temporal lag in tl i adsorption on multidentate carboxyl sites which was also consistent with the response order within the unified kinetic modeling previous studies have focused on complexation equilibrium between tl i and dissolved ha in neutral to alkaline environments martin et al 2020 ruiz garcÃ­a et al 2022 it was reported that ha could effectively adsorb heavy metal ions at low ph but the complexation of heavy metals with soluble ha with increasing ph might lead to the formation of soluble ha heavy metal salts coles and yong 2006 havelcovÃ¡ et al 2009 consistent with findings in previous studies the low tl i adsorption capacity of ha was also demonstrated in this study fig s2 nevertheless as a widely distributed natural organic matter in environmental soil or sediment particulate organic matter insoluble ha particles in acidic environments could effectively inhibit tl i migration and retain influent tl i ions which might have been overlooked previously based on spectral analysis and unified kinetics modeling the dynamic tl i migration and retention behavior were mainly affected by three aspects of heterogeneous adsorption sites on ha i the availability of adsorption sites the availability of phenolic hydroxyl sites was significantly reduced due to their low deprotonation in acidic environments although the complexation constant logk of phenolic hydroxyl sites was greater than that of carboxyl sites phenolic hydroxyl contributes less to tl i retention on ha ii the complexation responsiveness of adsorption sites the adsorption sites with high k ai monodentate carboxyl sites had higher kinetic responsiveness to influent tl i leading to preferential tl i adsorption under different environmental conditions higher ph environments favored the alleviation of the competition of dissolved hydrogen ions increasing the k ai of the adsorption sites and accelerating the adsorption response of ha to tl i moreover the increased retained tl i concentration would slightly reduce k ai due to the decrease in available sites iii the complexation ability of adsorption sites the complexation constant logk and desorption rate coefficient k d reflected the intrinsic binding ability of an adsorption site to tl i which were independent of ph and environmental tl concentration the larger complexation constants and lower desorption rate coefficients were indicative of strong complexation and the persistent retention of tl i at these adsorption sites e g tridentate adsorption sites 4 conclusions humus particles could act as temporary scavengers of tl i in naturally acidic environments and the retained tl i might be slowly released to the environment with a periodic change in dynamic tl concentration the transformation patterns of tl i on ha were similar under different environmental tl i concentrations in contrast environmental ph could regulate the organic binding pathway of tl i by strongly impacting the complexation responsiveness of ha binding sites in strongly acidic environments carboxyl monodentate complexation might be the principal organic retention pathway for tl i nevertheless multidentate carboxyl complexation affected by amide groups would be the main binding mode in the dynamic tl i retention process under weakly acidic environments the potentially sustained retention of tl i onto ha was attributed to the slow responsiveness and strong complexing ability of the multidentate carboxyl phenol hydroxyl sites natural organic matter present in swamp environments is expected to be highly involved in the natural remediation process of tl pollution and these findings would be helpful for further elucidating tl i

14754,eukaryotic microorganisms play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of rivers dynamic hydrological processes in rivers are thought to influence the assembly processes of eukaryotic microbes as well as affecting local geomorphology these processes have not been extensively studied for eukaryotic river microbes in extreme environments on the tibetan plateau this study used 18s rdna gene amplification sequencing a neutral community model and a null model to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics and assembly processes of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river we conducted analyses across wet and dry seasons as well as varying altitudinal gradients our results showed that the diversity structure and taxonomic composition of eukaryotic microbial communities varied more with altitude than season and the diversity of the communities first increased then decreased with increasing elevation distance decay analysis showed that the correlation between eukaryotic microbial communities and environmental distance was stronger than the correlation between the microbial communities and geographical distance deterministic processes homogeneous selection dominated the construction of eukaryotic microbial communities and water temperature ph and total phosphorus were the primary environmental factors that influenced the construction of eukaryotic microbial communities these results expand our understanding of the characteristics of eukaryotic microbial communities in rivers on the tibetan plateau and provide clues to understanding the mechanisms that maintain eukaryotic microbial diversity in extreme environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords yarlung zangbo river eukaryotic microorganisms community assembly 18s rdna amplicon data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquatic environments are among the most diverse and vulnerable ecosystems on earth and play an important role in maintaining global aquatic biodiversity and providing ecosystem services wang et al 2021 riverine ecosystems are a fundamental component of the water cycle and are critical to biogeochemical cycles therefore revealing the dynamic components of riverine ecosystems can improve our understanding of ecological processes in the aquatic environment eukaryotic microorganisms are one of the main drivers of biogeochemical cycling in rivers these microorganisms contribute to nutrient cycling and pollutant degradation wang et al 2022 the composition of eukaryotic microbial communities can change in response to rapid changes in the environment dubey et al 2021 moreover due to their short reproductive period high abundance wide distribution ease of collection and treatment and high sensitivity to pollutants eukaryotic microorganisms are widely accepted as indicators that can be used to evaluate the environmental quality of freshwater aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2022 eukaryotic microbial communities are a multifunctional component of riverine ecosystems and the structural and diversity characteristics of communities vary with environmental factors at a spatial and temporal scale tamminen et al 2022 the biogeographical pattern of communities is one of the core elements of ecology which primarily consists of the study of geographic and environmental distances zhao et al 2020 liu et al 2020 in addition the delineation of key taxa can be assessed in order to understand community assembly mechanisms via interactions between decomposing microbiota that is based on the topological characteristics of co occurrence networks among taxa yuan et al 2021 ecological niche theory and neutrality theory are the two core theories of microbial community construction ecological niche theory assumes that microbial communities are mainly controlled by determinants including abiotic factors ph temperature and oxygen and biotic factors competition mutualism predation etc in contrast neutral theory assumes that stochastic processes birth death mutation limited dispersal and immigration govern the microbial community assembly process chen et al 2022 zhou and ning 2017 in recent years advances in molecular biology have led to novel sequencing techniques that have been increasingly important in the study of diversity spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as in the interactions within and between eukaryotic microbial communities sprong et al 2020 at present high throughput sequencing hts technologies are widely used to study eukaryotic microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2020 han et al 2022 though these studies have mainly focused on marine ecosystems zhu et al 2021 and low elevation rivers at temporal scales chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 there is less available research on eukaryotic microbial communities and their spatial and temporal characteristics in high elevation rivers the tibetan plateau also known as the third pole of the earth has a unique high plateau alpine climate that plays a key role in the earth s climate biodiversity and water cycle due to the complex interactions of cryospheric atmospheric geographic hydrological and environmental processes yang et al 2019 the tibetan plateau is highly sensitive to global climate change tian et al 2020 the yarlung zangbo river is the third largest river in china and one of the highest elevation rivers in the world with a vast watershed and large volume of water the yarlung zangbo river is the main water network of the tibetan plateau and has an irreplaceable role in maintaining the ecosystem stability of the tibetan plateau han et al 2018 in addition due to the complex topography diverse habitat conditions and low anthropogenic disturbance the yarlung zangbo river is an excellent natural laboratory for researchers interested in the microbial distribution patterns of highland rivers studies of eukaryotic microbes in the yarlung zangbo river could provide us with more information on microbial responses to environmental changes on the tibetan plateau which will aid in our understanding of plateau ecology as well as global and local climate change although some studies of eukaryotic microbes in the yarlung zangbo river have been completed they have mostly used inefficient methods such as microscopic identification and enumeration hota et al 2022 and have been small in scope focusing only on community composition and species identification there are few studies showcasing molecular biology techniques to study the diversity of eukaryotic microbial communities in high altitude rivers on the tibetan plateau at a large watershed scale in this study the diversity characteristics biogeographical patterns community symbiotic networks and community assembly processes of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle yarlung zangbo river under different seasons wet and dry and altitudinal gradients were analyzed using 18s rdna amplicon sequencing technology to address the following questions 1 does the eukaryotic microbial community exhibit spatial and temporal variability 2 what are the biogeographical patterns of eukaryotic microbes 3 do deterministic or stochastic processes dominate eukaryotic microbial community construction our results will provide important data that may be used for further studies of the yarlung zangbo river basin and the plateau water ecosystem and provide new insights for better understanding the diversity characteristics of eukaryotic microbial communities in extreme environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the study area extends from gongga county west to pai town east in tibet fig 1 in the middle reaches

distance decay analysis was performed using the vegan and geosphere packages the Î² approximate taxon index Î²nti and bray curtis based raup crick metric rcbray were calculated using the nst package where Î²nti values less than 2 indicated homogeneous selection and values greater than 2 indicated heterogeneous selection zhou and ning 2017 Î²nti values between 2 and 2 and rcbray values less than 0

eukaryotic microbial community composition and alpha diversity in the study we collected water samples along the altitudinal gradient of the middle segment of the yarlung zangbo river during the rainy and dry seasons after amplification and sequencing of eukaryotic microbial 18srdna genes quality testing and sequence screening yielded 35 474 high quality asvs the wet season yielded 24 797 asvs and the dry season yielded 19 540 asvs in total 11 047 asvs were available for species level annotation of which 4660 were individually annotated in the wet season 3110 were individually annotated in the dry season and 3277 asvs were jointly annotated in both seasons the eukaryotic microbial community composition varied with seasonal and altitudinal gradients in this study ochrophyta had the highest percentage composition 27 35 in the wet season followed by chlorophyta 14 57 the most dominant clade was ochrophyta 24 09 followed by chlorophyta 23 30 in the dry season fig s1 these taxa showed similar dominance patterns in the wet and dry seasons and the percentage of chlorophyta was higher in the dry season in the altitudinal gradient grouping the dominant taxa were also chlorophyta and ochrophyta fig s1 richness was significantly different between seasons p 0 05 fig s1 shows a venn diagram that illustrates the distribution characteristics of asvs in the community shannon s diversity index and the gini simpson diversity index were used to represent the alpha diversity of eukaryotic microbial communities shannon s diversity index did not differ significantly between the wet and dry seasons but differed significantly across the elevational gradient fig 2 a and b similarly gini simpson s diversity index showed the same phenomena fig 2d and e community alpha diversity showed a single peaked trend that first increased and then decreased with elevation fig 2c and f simper similarity percentage analysis showed that ochrophyta diatomea chlorophyta arthropoda and dinoflagellata were the main taxa responsible for the spatial variation of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle yarlung zangbo river table s2 3 2 biogeographic analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities the Î± diversity analysis showed that eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle yarlung zangbo river differed significantly along the altitudinal gradient the nmds plots and similarity analysis anosim based on bray curtis distance showed the same results community composition differed significantly among elevations during the rainy season r 0 202 p 0 002 and dry season r 0 206 p 0 001 fig 3 a b the results of bray curtis heterogeneity analysis of the communities showed that group a had the highest bray curtis heterogeneity in the rainy season mean 0 695 or and dry season mean 0 698 fig 3c to investigate the potential factors influencing the variation in eukaryotic microbial communities we performed a biogeographical analysis biogeography forms an important basis for studying the spatial and temporal distribution of biodiversity and the mechanisms of diversity maintenance including the study of local environmental factors deterministic processes and regional geographic distance processes stochastic processes the distance decay relationship is a common method that is widely used in microbial community biogeographical studies xue et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 the results of the distance decay relationship analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle yarlung zangbo river showed that bray curtis heterogeneity was more strongly correlated with environmental distance based on euclidean measures than geographic distance and elevation distance in dry or and wet season eukaryotic microbial communities this indicated that the spatio temporal distribution of eukaryotic microbes is more influenced by deterministic processes such as environmental factors fig 3d e and f 3 3 relationships between eukaryotic microbial communities and environmental factors once we had shown that environmental factors dominated the distribution of eukaryotic microorganisms we next investigated the relationship between eukaryotic microbial communities and environmental factors among the environmental factors measured in this study tp and no3 n were significantly different between seasonal gradients and ph ec wt do tur ws and nh4 n were significantly different in altitudinal gradients table s3 the mantel test revealed the strongest relationship between wt and eukaryotic microbial communities r 0 4 p 0 001 three environmental factors ph ec and no3 n showed significant correlations with eukaryotic microbial composition in both wet r 0 2 p 0 01 and dry r 0 2 p 0 001 fig 4 a seasons in order to identify the main environmental factors affecting the eukaryotic microbial communities we performed a correlation analysis between the main phyla contributing to the community differences and the environmental factors environmental factors were mainly positively correlated with the eukaryotic microbial community in the wet season and negatively correlated in the dry season and wt ph no3 n and tp were the main influencing factors wt was significantly positively correlated with diatomea and significantly negatively with ochrophyta in the wet season and significantly positively correlated with dinoflagellata and significantly negatively with ochrophyta and chlorophyta in dry season ph was significantly positively correlated with chlorophyta and significantly negatively correlated with ochrophyta in the wet season while significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyta and ochrophyta in the dry season no3 n was significantly positively correlated with diatomea and significantly negatively correlated with ochrophyta in the wet season tp was significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyta and ochrophyta in the dry season fig 4b c the variation partition analysis vpa further quantitatively assessed the contribution of different environmental factors to the variation of eukaryotic microbial communities and the results showed that no3 n tn and ph were the main environmental factors affecting the community structure fig 4d 3 4 co occurrence patterns of eukaryotic microbial communities asvs were selected with relative abundance values 0 02 in each altitudinal gradient in order to construct a symbiotic network of eukaryotic microbial communities a set of network level and node level topological features were calculated there was a higher average degree and graph density and lower average network path length in group b indicating that these eukaryotic microbes have closer interrelationships table s4 asvs exhibited mainly positive correlations with each other in all networks while node level topological features showed significant differences in altitudinal gradients fig 5 a b overall the topological characteristic parameters showed that the eukaryotic microbial community had a more complex and compact network in group b while the network was found to be simplest in group d the within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi define the positioning of a node asv in the network based on the zi and pi values network nodes can be classified into four categories as follows network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 are defined as asvs that are highly connected in general and within modules module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 are asvs that are highly connected within only one module asvs that connect modules are called connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 while peripherals zi 2 5 pi 0 62 have few connections to other species in general network hubs module hubs and connectors are considered to contain key species that build communities and may play an important role in maintaining community structure modules and networks may break down if these taxa are removed yuan et al 2021 in our study there was one module hub in each of the group a and b networks fig 5c 3 5 assembly process of eukaryotic microbial communities a null model based analysis calculated the stochastic ratio of phylogenetic normalization pnst our results showed that deterministic processes pnst 0 5 were dominant in both seasonal and altitudinal gradients and the percentage of deterministic processes increased with elevation fig s2 to further explore the relative contributions of stochastic and deterministic processes null models based on Î²nti and rcbray were used most Î²nti values were less than 2 on both seasonal and altitudinal gradients fig 6 a and b indicating that deterministic processes played a more important role in the dry season Î²nti values had a significant positive correlation with elevation fig 6c according to rcbray analysis homogeneous selection was the most important process affecting eukaryotic microbial community assembly during the rainy season 87 and dry season 83 fig 6d in addition the community assembly process was analyzed using a neutral model based on r2 values r2 0 666 to 0 678 and taxa outside the outer proportional dashed line 9 in the wet season and 12 in the dry season the migration rate m estimated by the neutral model reflected the dispersal ability of the species migration rates were low in both the wet season 0 050 and dry season 0 046 indicating that stochastic processes contribute less to eukaryotic microbial community construction and that deterministic processes dominate community construction which is consistent with the results of the null model analysis fig 6e and f to further identify the intrinsic factors driving community construction we next explored the correlation between Î²nti and environmental variables using the mantel test the results showed that total phosphorus r 0 2350 p 0 01 water temperature r 0 1536 p 0 01 and ph r 0 1932 p 0 05 were significantly correlated with rainfed community construction while ph r 0 1603 p 0 05 and wt r 0 2921 p 0 001 were significantly correlated with rainfed community table s5 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of eukaryotic microbial communities the study of eukaryotic microbial communities in water bodies is an important facet of water ecology research sprong et al 2020 in this study we found that the Î± diversity of eukaryotic microbial communities in the yarlung zangbo river exhibited a trend that first increased and then decreased with elevation fig 3c f while was not affected by seasonal variation some studies have found that microbial diversity at high elevation shows a positive correlation with elevation shigyo et al 2019 xing et al 2021 which differs from the results in this study there are several possible reasons that might explain this phenomenon first differences in environmental conditions among studies may result in differences in eukaryotic microbial community composition and diversity second in this study eukaryotic microbial communities at higher elevations 4000 4500 m were less disturbed by the outside world and lacked nutrient sources given a long term nutrient poor state there was a decline in community diversity third high elevation areas are generally at the headwaters of rivers where water flow is low and slow this may inhibit the spread of eukaryotic microorganisms among communities which is also one of the reasons for the decrease in diversity it has been suggested that the mechanism of maintaining the elevational gradient distribution pattern of microbial diversity is more influenced by environmental factors xing et al 2021 which is similar to the distance decay results found in this study fig 3 this could indicate that the communities were more influenced by deterministic processes as one of the determining processes the co occurrence patterns of microorganisms are considered to be an important driver of community construction yu et al 2023 in the co occurrence network positive and negative correlations represent reciprocal and competitive relationships between connected species respectively zhang et al 2018 our study found that the proportion of positive correlations among eukaryotic microorganisms in the middle yarlung zangbo river was relatively large and showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing along the altitudinal gradient table s4 which was highly consistent with the trend of diversity fig 2c and f this may be due to the fact that in extreme environments such as alpine or low oxygen in response to environmental changes positive correlations tend to dominate among community species positive correlations representing reciprocal relationships thereby reduce direct competition among species and maintain or enhance community diversity and stability through processes such as synergism and ecological niche complementation selbmann et al 2013 wu et al 2023 previous studies have shown that key taxa have an important role in maintaining network structure and that the loss of these key taxa may lead to network instability or even disintegration yang et al 2022 in this study key taxa were only found at lower elevational gradients groups a and b and these key taxa were species with very low abundance rankings 1 fig 4c these results suggest that some low abundance species may play a non negligible role in the stability of the network structure regarding the spatial and temporal dynamics of eukaryotic microbial communities in general the effects of spatial variation to the eukaryotic microbial community composition were greater than that of seasonal variation in the middle of yarlung zangbo river and the community diversity showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with increasing altitude the geographic distribution patterns of eukaryotic microorganisms were mainly influenced by deterministic processes such as environmental factors the interspecific correlation of eukaryotic microorganisms was mainly positive and rare species played an important role in maintaining community stability 4 2 environmental factors and community structure in the study we performed various statistical methods including the mantel test correlation analysis and vpa analysis to reveal the main environmental attributes that affect the structure of eukaryotic microbial communities wt ph ec tn tp and no3 n were found to be the most important factors affecting eukaryotic microbial community structure fig 6 wt directly affects the life cycle of microorganisms by influencing their growth and metabolic capacity and can also indirectly affect the growth and reproduction of microorganisms by influencing the growth of their food sources zhou et al 2022 hu et al 2019 yu et al 2023 the optimal living temperature for most microorganisms is 18 25 c shen 1999 however wt in this study 6 34 21 11 c was lower than the optimal temperature for microorganisms the diversity of eukaryotic microorganisms in the yarlung zangbo river was high compared to other low elevation 1500 m water environments hu et al 2018 lu et al 2021 this phenomenon may be due to the characteristics of the habitat the long term low temperature environment of the qinghai tibet plateau may have reduced the lower limit of the temperature tolerance range of eukaryotic microorganisms so that eukaryotic microorganisms have strong survival in this low temperature environment ph is considered to be an important driver of microbial diversity which affects the growth metabolism and other life activities of aquatic organisms by influencing enzyme synthesis and cellular osmotic pressure to affect nutrient uptake santini et al 2022 ec can reflect the total concentration of various ions in a water body rainfall is a key factor affecting river ec which impacts the eukaryotic microbial community structure by changing the nutrient structure of the water body zheng et al 2018 in the wet season more plants and soil organic matter enter the river from the riparian zone and thus directly impact the total aquatic ion content in the dry season the massive dieback of riparian vegetation also greatly increases the ec of the water column the ec has an important role in eukaryotic microbial community structure a result that has been confirmed in most microbial studies wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 nutrients such as tn tp and no3 n can alter the trophic state of the aquatic environment and affect the eukaryotic microbial community structure cai et al 2022 the results of the vpa in this study showed that nitrate nitrogen 6 92 and total nitrogen 3 44 were the main explanatory factors for community structure fig 5a 4 3 eukaryotic microbial community assembly processes eukaryotic microbial communities exhibit spatio temporal dynamics suggesting that the assembly process may vary periodically the null model showed that deterministic processes were dominant in community construction in both wet and dry seasons and driven mainly by homogeneous selection the proportion of deterministic processes increased with increasing elevation fig s2 which differs from the results of some studies on microorganisms in low elevation waterbodies for example one study found that stochastic processes dominated eukaryotic microbial community construction in the ting river chen et al 2019 another study found that planktonic bacterial community prokaryotic microbes construction was more influenced by stochastic processes sun et al 2021 yi et al 2022 and the eukaryotic microbial community was found to be dominated by deterministic processes our deterministic process results may be due to slow water velocity mean 0 5 m s in the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river which could inhibit the microbial dispersal process song et al 2022 on the other hand compared to lower elevation rivers the recharge of tibetan plateau rivers is mainly glacial meltwater and the nutrient composition of water bodies in the basin varies little leading to a stronger synergistic filtration of the environment compared to prokaryotic microorganisms eukaryotic microorganisms have more complex cellular structures including organelles related to a variety of functions e g vacuolar constrictors for osmoregulation peduncles for phagocytic feeding and chloroplasts for photosynthesis and may respond more extensively to environmental heterogeneity and be more influenced by deterministic factors logares et al 2018 in this study the trait community model fitted moderate r2 values r2 0 678 for wet season and r2 0 666 for dry season to the eukaryotic microbial community fig 6e and f the neutral model estimated a small migration rate m indicating that community construction was dominated by deterministic processes while stochastic processes played only a moderate role zhang et al 2022 in addition distance decay analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities showed that the communities were less influenced by spatial factors fig 3a b further confirming that stochastic processes were less influential in eukaryotic community construction in the middle yarlung zangbo river and that the communities were dominated by deterministic processes mantel analysis showed significant positive correlations between ph wt tp and Î²nti it has been shown that temperature is the main factor that mediates the balance between the stochastic and deterministic assembly of the community he et al 2021 temperature enhances the dissolution of mineral elements accelerates the rate of redox reactions konrad schmolke et al 2018 and affects the photosynthesis of eukaryotic microorganisms chlorophyta and diatomea in this study the eukaryotic microbial community construction was strongly influenced by temperature and these results may help us to predict trends in eukaryotic microbial communities in highland rivers in the context of global warming we look forward to a more comprehensive study of the mechanisms of microbial response to temperature in highland rivers previous studies have confirmed that ph also has a significant effect on community construction and that changes in ph gradients will significantly alter nutrient availability yang et al 2019 fan et al 2018 substances such as total phosphorus can alter the nutrient levels in the water column and have an impact on the diversity of the microbial community in conclusion these findings highlight the link between environmental variables and community assembly processes which may further influence microbial community structure and functional stability 5 conclusion in the study we analyzed the dynamics of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river at different altitudinal gradients in the wet and dry seasons using 18s rdna amplicon sequencing and multiple statistical analyses the diversity structure and taxonomic composition of the eukaryotic microbial communities showed temporal and spatial variations with spatial variations being more significant diversity first increased and then decreased with elevation distance decay analysis showed that the dissimilarity of eukaryotic microbial communities was closely related to environmental distance deterministic processes dominated community construction and the proportion of deterministic processes increased with elevation wt ph and tp were the primary environmental factors influencing the community construction process the study expands our understanding of the construction and ecological mechanisms of eukaryotic microbial communities in aquatic systems the analysis of the variability of symbiotic networks and environmental factors has provided us with further insight into the maintenance mechanisms of eukaryotic microbial communities for high elevation ecosystems elevational gradients can serve as a new perspective for in depth analysis of the biogeographic characteristics of communities the results of the study provide considerations for future studies of microbial diversity in aquatic ecosystems especially in extreme environments such as

distances zhao et al 2020 liu et al 2020 in addition the delineation of key taxa can be assessed in order to understand community assembly mechanisms via interactions between decomposing microbiota that is based on the topological characteristics of co occurrence networks among taxa yuan et al 2021 ecological niche theory and neutrality theory are the two core theories of microbial community construction ecological niche theory assumes that microbial communities are mainly controlled by determinants including abiotic factors ph temperature and oxygen and biotic factors competition mutualism predation etc in contrast neutral theory assumes that stochastic processes birth death mutation limited dispersal and immigration govern the microbial community assembly process chen et al 2022 zhou and ning 2017 in recent years advances in molecular biology have led to novel sequencing techniques that have been increasingly important in the study of diversity spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as in the interactions within and between eukaryotic microbial communities sprong et al 2020 at present high throughput sequencing hts technologies are widely used to study eukaryotic microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2020 han et al 2022 though these studies have mainly focused on marine ecosystems zhu et al 2021 and low elevation rivers at temporal scales chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 there is less available research on eukaryotic microbial communities and their spatial and temporal characteristics in high elevation rivers the tibetan plateau also known as the third pole of the earth has a unique high plateau alpine climate that plays a key role in the earth s climate biodiversity and water cycle due to the complex interactions of cryospheric atmospheric geographic hydrological and environmental processes yang et al 2019 the tibetan plateau is highly sensitive to global climate change tian et al 2020 the yarlung zangbo river is the third largest river in china and one of the highest elevation rivers in the world with a vast watershed and large volume of water the yarlung zangbo river is the main water network of the tibetan plateau and has an irreplaceable role in maintaining the ecosystem stability of the tibetan plateau han et al 2018 in addition due to the complex topography diverse habitat conditions and low anthropogenic disturbance the yarlung zangbo river is an excellent natural laboratory for researchers interested in the microbial distribution patterns of highland rivers studies of eukaryotic microbes in the yarlung zangbo river could provide us with more information on microbial responses to environmental changes on the tibetan plateau which will aid in our understanding of plateau ecology as well as global and local climate change although some studies of eukaryotic microbes in the yarlung zangbo river have been completed they have mostly used inefficient methods such as microscopic identification and enumeration hota et al 2022 and have been small in scope focusing only on community composition and species identification there are few studies showcasing molecular biology techniques to study the diversity of eukaryotic microbial communities in high altitude rivers on the tibetan plateau at a large watershed scale in this study the diversity characteristics biogeographical patterns community symbiotic networks and community assembly processes of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle yarlung zangbo river under different seasons wet and dry and altitudinal gradients were analyzed using 18s rdna amplicon sequencing technology to address the following questions 1 does the eukaryotic microbial community exhibit spatial and temporal variability 2 what are the biogeographical patterns of eukaryotic microbes 3 do deterministic or stochastic processes dominate eukaryotic microbial community construction our results will provide important data that may be used for further studies of the yarlung zangbo river basin and the plateau water ecosystem and provide new insights for better understanding the diversity characteristics of eukaryotic microbial communities in extreme environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the study area extends from gongga county west to pai town east in tibet fig 1 in the middle reaches

eukaryotic microbial community composition and alpha diversity in the study we collected water samples along the altitudinal gradient of the middle segment of the yarlung zangbo river during the rainy and dry seasons after amplification and sequencing of eukaryotic microbial 18srdna genes quality testing and sequence screening yielded 35 474 high quality asvs the wet season yielded 24 797 asvs and the dry season yielded 19 540 asvs in total 11 047 asvs were available for species level annotation of which 4660 were individually annotated in the wet season 3110 were individually annotated in the dry season and 3277 asvs were jointly annotated in both seasons the eukaryotic microbial community composition varied with seasonal and altitudinal gradients in this study ochrophyta had the highest percentage composition 27 35 in the wet season followed by chlorophyta 14 57 the most dominant clade was ochrophyta 24 09 followed by chlorophyta 23 30 in the dry season fig s1 these taxa showed similar dominance patterns in the wet and dry seasons and the percentage of chlorophyta was higher in the dry season in the altitudinal gradient grouping the dominant taxa were also chlorophyta and ochrophyta fig s1 richness was significantly different between seasons p 0 05 fig s1 shows a venn diagram that illustrates the distribution characteristics of asvs in the community shannon s diversity index and the gini simpson diversity index were used to represent the alpha diversity of eukaryotic microbial communities shannon s diversity index did not differ significantly between the wet and dry seasons but differed significantly across the elevational gradient fig 2 a and b similarly gini simpson s diversity index showed the same phenomena fig 2d and e community alpha diversity showed a single peaked trend that first increased and then decreased with elevation fig 2c and f simper similarity percentage analysis showed that ochrophyta diatomea chlorophyta arthropoda and dinoflagellata were the main taxa responsible for the spatial variation of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle yarlung zangbo river table s2 3 2 biogeographic analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities the Î± diversity analysis showed that eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle yarlung zangbo river differed significantly along the altitudinal gradient the nmds plots and similarity analysis anosim based on bray curtis distance showed the same results community composition differed significantly among elevations during the rainy season r 0 202 p 0 002 and dry season r 0 206 p 0 001 fig 3 a b the results of bray curtis heterogeneity analysis of the communities showed that group a had the highest bray curtis heterogeneity in the rainy season mean 0 695 or and dry season mean 0 698 fig 3c to investigate the potential factors influencing the variation in eukaryotic microbial communities we performed a biogeographical analysis biogeography forms an important basis for studying the spatial and temporal distribution of biodiversity and the mechanisms of diversity maintenance including the study of local environmental factors deterministic processes and regional geographic distance processes stochastic processes the distance decay relationship is a common method that is widely used in microbial community biogeographical studies xue et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 the results of the distance decay relationship analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle yarlung zangbo river showed that bray curtis heterogeneity was more strongly correlated with environmental distance based on euclidean measures than geographic distance and elevation distance in dry or and wet season eukaryotic microbial communities this indicated that the spatio temporal distribution of eukaryotic microbes is more influenced by deterministic processes such as environmental factors fig 3d e and f 3 3 relationships between eukaryotic microbial communities and environmental factors once we had shown that environmental factors dominated the distribution of eukaryotic microorganisms we next investigated the relationship between eukaryotic microbial communities and environmental factors among the environmental factors measured in this study tp and no3 n were significantly different between seasonal gradients and ph ec wt do tur ws and nh4 n were significantly different in altitudinal gradients table s3 the mantel test revealed the strongest relationship between wt and eukaryotic microbial communities r 0 4 p 0 001 three environmental factors ph ec and no3 n showed significant correlations with eukaryotic microbial composition in both wet r 0 2 p 0 01 and dry r 0 2 p 0 001 fig 4 a seasons in order to identify the main environmental factors affecting the eukaryotic microbial communities we performed a correlation analysis between the main phyla contributing to the community differences and the environmental factors environmental factors were mainly positively correlated with the eukaryotic microbial community in the wet season and negatively correlated in the dry season and wt ph no3 n and tp were the main influencing factors wt was significantly positively correlated with diatomea and significantly negatively with ochrophyta in the wet season and significantly positively correlated with dinoflagellata and significantly negatively with ochrophyta and chlorophyta in dry season ph was significantly positively correlated with chlorophyta and significantly negatively correlated with ochrophyta in the wet season while significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyta and ochrophyta in the dry season no3 n was significantly positively correlated with diatomea and significantly negatively correlated with ochrophyta in the wet season tp was significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyta and ochrophyta in the dry season fig 4b c the variation partition analysis vpa further quantitatively assessed the contribution of different environmental factors to the variation of eukaryotic microbial communities and the results showed that no3 n tn and ph were the main environmental factors affecting the community structure fig 4d 3 4 co occurrence patterns of eukaryotic microbial communities asvs were selected with relative abundance values 0 02 in each altitudinal gradient in order to construct a symbiotic network of eukaryotic microbial communities a set of network level and node level topological features were calculated there was a higher average degree and graph density and lower average network path length in group b indicating that these eukaryotic microbes have closer interrelationships table s4 asvs exhibited mainly positive correlations with each other in all networks while node level topological features showed significant differences in altitudinal gradients fig 5 a b overall the topological characteristic parameters showed that the eukaryotic microbial community had a more complex and compact network in group b while the network was found to be simplest in group d the within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi define the positioning of a node asv in the network based on the zi and pi values network nodes can be classified into four categories as follows network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 are defined as asvs that are highly connected in general and within modules module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 are asvs that are highly connected within only one module asvs that connect modules are called connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 while peripherals zi 2 5 pi 0 62 have few connections to other species in general network hubs module hubs and connectors are considered to contain key species that build communities and may play an important role in maintaining community structure modules and networks may break down if these taxa are removed yuan et al 2021 in our study there was one module hub in each of the group a and b networks fig 5c 3 5 assembly process of eukaryotic microbial communities a null model based analysis calculated the stochastic ratio of phylogenetic normalization pnst our results showed that deterministic processes pnst 0 5 were dominant in both seasonal and altitudinal gradients and the percentage of deterministic processes increased with elevation fig s2 to further explore the relative contributions of stochastic and deterministic processes null models based on Î²nti and rcbray were used most Î²nti values were less than 2 on both seasonal and altitudinal gradients fig 6 a and b indicating that deterministic processes played a more important role in the dry season Î²nti values had a significant positive correlation with elevation fig 6c according to rcbray analysis homogeneous selection was the most important process affecting eukaryotic microbial community assembly during the rainy season 87 and dry season 83 fig 6d in addition the community assembly process was analyzed using a neutral model based on r2 values r2 0 666 to 0 678 and taxa outside the outer proportional dashed line 9 in the wet season and 12 in the dry season the migration rate m estimated by the neutral model reflected the dispersal ability of the species migration rates were low in both the wet season 0 050 and dry season 0 046 indicating that stochastic processes contribute less to eukaryotic microbial community construction and that deterministic processes dominate community construction which is consistent with the results of the null model analysis fig 6e and f to further identify the intrinsic factors driving community construction we next explored the correlation between Î²nti and environmental variables using the mantel test the results showed that total phosphorus r 0 2350 p 0 01 water temperature r 0 1536 p 0 01 and ph r 0 1932 p 0 05 were significantly correlated with rainfed community construction while ph r 0 1603 p 0 05 and wt r 0 2921 p 0 001 were significantly correlated with rainfed community table s5 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of eukaryotic microbial communities the study of eukaryotic microbial communities in water bodies is an important facet of water ecology research sprong et al 2020 in this study we found that the Î± diversity of eukaryotic microbial communities in the yarlung zangbo river exhibited a trend that first increased and then decreased with elevation fig 3c f while was not affected by seasonal variation some studies have found that microbial diversity at high elevation shows a positive correlation with elevation shigyo et al 2019 xing et al 2021 which differs from the results in this study there are several possible reasons that might explain this phenomenon first differences in environmental conditions among studies may result in differences in eukaryotic microbial community composition and diversity second in this study eukaryotic microbial communities at higher elevations 4000 4500 m were less disturbed by the outside world and lacked nutrient sources given a long term nutrient poor state there was a decline in community diversity third high elevation areas are generally at the headwaters of rivers where water flow is low and slow this may inhibit the spread of eukaryotic microorganisms among communities which is also one of the reasons for the decrease in diversity it has been suggested that the mechanism of maintaining the elevational gradient distribution pattern of microbial diversity is more influenced by environmental factors xing et al 2021 which is similar to the distance decay results found in this study fig 3 this could indicate that the communities were more influenced by deterministic processes as one of the determining processes the co occurrence patterns of microorganisms are considered to be an important driver of community construction yu et al 2023 in the co occurrence network positive and negative correlations represent reciprocal and competitive relationships between connected species respectively zhang et al 2018 our study found that the proportion of positive correlations among eukaryotic microorganisms in the middle yarlung zangbo river was relatively large and showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing along the altitudinal gradient table s4 which was highly consistent with the trend of diversity fig 2c and f this may be due to the fact that in extreme environments such as alpine or low oxygen in response to environmental changes positive correlations tend to dominate among community species positive correlations representing reciprocal relationships thereby reduce direct competition among species and maintain or enhance community diversity and stability through processes such as synergism and ecological niche complementation selbmann et al 2013 wu et al 2023 previous studies have shown that key taxa have an important role in maintaining network structure and that the loss of these key taxa may lead to network instability or even disintegration yang et al 2022 in this study key taxa were only found at lower elevational gradients groups a and b and these key taxa were species with very low abundance rankings 1 fig 4c these results suggest that some low abundance species may play a non negligible role in the stability of the network structure regarding the spatial and temporal dynamics of eukaryotic microbial communities in general the effects of spatial variation to the eukaryotic microbial community composition were greater than that of seasonal variation in the middle of yarlung zangbo river and the community diversity showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with increasing altitude the geographic distribution patterns of eukaryotic microorganisms were mainly influenced by deterministic processes such as environmental factors the interspecific correlation of eukaryotic microorganisms was mainly positive and rare species played an important role in maintaining community stability 4 2 environmental factors and community structure in the study we performed various statistical methods including the mantel test correlation analysis and vpa analysis to reveal the main environmental attributes that affect the structure of eukaryotic microbial communities wt ph ec tn tp and no3 n were found to be the most important factors affecting eukaryotic microbial community structure fig 6 wt directly affects the life cycle of microorganisms by influencing their growth and metabolic capacity and can also indirectly affect the growth and reproduction of microorganisms by influencing the growth of their food sources zhou et al 2022 hu et al 2019 yu et al 2023 the optimal living temperature for most microorganisms is 18 25 c shen 1999 however wt in this study 6 34 21 11 c was lower than the optimal temperature for microorganisms the diversity of eukaryotic microorganisms in the yarlung zangbo river was high compared to other low elevation 1500 m water environments hu et al 2018 lu et al 2021 this phenomenon may be due to the characteristics of the habitat the long term low temperature environment of the qinghai tibet plateau may have reduced the lower limit of the temperature tolerance range of eukaryotic microorganisms so that eukaryotic microorganisms have strong survival in this low temperature environment ph is considered to be an important driver of microbial diversity which affects the growth metabolism and other life activities of aquatic organisms by influencing enzyme synthesis and cellular osmotic pressure to affect nutrient uptake santini et al 2022 ec can reflect the total concentration of various ions in a water body rainfall is a key factor affecting river ec which impacts the eukaryotic microbial community structure by changing the nutrient structure of the water body zheng et al 2018 in the wet season more plants and soil organic matter enter the river from the riparian zone and thus directly impact the total aquatic ion content in the dry season the massive dieback of riparian vegetation also greatly increases the ec of the water column the ec has an important role in eukaryotic microbial community structure a result that has been confirmed in most microbial studies wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 nutrients such as tn tp and no3 n can alter the trophic state of the aquatic environment and affect the eukaryotic microbial community structure cai et al 2022 the results of the vpa in this study showed that nitrate nitrogen 6 92 and total nitrogen 3 44 were the main explanatory factors for community structure fig 5a 4 3 eukaryotic microbial community assembly processes eukaryotic microbial communities exhibit spatio temporal dynamics suggesting that the assembly process may vary periodically the null model showed that deterministic processes were dominant in community construction in both wet and dry seasons and driven mainly by homogeneous selection the proportion of deterministic processes increased with increasing elevation fig s2 which differs from the results of some studies on microorganisms in low elevation waterbodies for example one study found that stochastic processes dominated eukaryotic microbial community construction in the ting river chen et al 2019 another study found that planktonic bacterial community prokaryotic microbes construction was more influenced by stochastic processes sun et al 2021 yi et al 2022 and the eukaryotic microbial community was found to be dominated by deterministic processes our deterministic process results may be due to slow water velocity mean 0 5 m s in the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river which could inhibit the microbial dispersal process song et al 2022 on the other hand compared to lower elevation rivers the recharge of tibetan plateau rivers is mainly glacial meltwater and the nutrient composition of water bodies in the basin varies little leading to a stronger synergistic filtration of the environment compared to prokaryotic microorganisms eukaryotic microorganisms have more complex cellular structures including organelles related to a variety of functions e g vacuolar constrictors for osmoregulation peduncles for phagocytic feeding and chloroplasts for photosynthesis and may respond more extensively to environmental heterogeneity and be more influenced by deterministic factors logares et al 2018 in this study the trait community model fitted moderate r2 values r2 0 678 for wet season and r2 0 666 for dry season to the eukaryotic microbial community fig 6e and f the neutral model estimated a small migration rate m indicating that community construction was dominated by deterministic processes while stochastic processes played only a moderate role zhang et al 2022 in addition distance decay analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities showed that the communities were less influenced by spatial factors fig 3a b further confirming that stochastic processes were less influential in eukaryotic community construction in the middle yarlung zangbo river and that the communities were dominated by deterministic processes mantel analysis showed significant positive correlations between ph wt tp and Î²nti it has been shown that temperature is the main factor that mediates the balance between the stochastic and deterministic assembly of the community he et al 2021 temperature enhances the dissolution of mineral elements accelerates the rate of redox reactions konrad schmolke et al 2018 and affects the photosynthesis of eukaryotic microorganisms chlorophyta and diatomea in this study the eukaryotic microbial community construction was strongly influenced by temperature and these results may help us to predict trends in eukaryotic microbial communities in highland rivers in the context of global warming we look forward to a more comprehensive study of the mechanisms of microbial response to temperature in highland rivers previous studies have confirmed that ph also has a significant effect on community construction and that changes in ph gradients will significantly alter nutrient availability yang et al 2019 fan et al 2018 substances such as total phosphorus can alter the nutrient levels in the water column and have an impact on the diversity of the microbial community in conclusion these findings highlight the link between environmental variables and community assembly processes which may further influence microbial community structure and functional stability 5 conclusion in the study we analyzed the dynamics of eukaryotic microbial communities in the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river at different altitudinal gradients in the wet and dry seasons using 18s rdna amplicon sequencing and multiple statistical analyses the diversity structure and taxonomic composition of the eukaryotic microbial communities showed temporal and spatial variations with spatial variations being more significant diversity first increased and then decreased with elevation distance decay analysis showed that the dissimilarity of eukaryotic microbial communities was closely related to environmental distance deterministic processes dominated community construction and the proportion of deterministic processes increased with elevation wt ph and tp were the primary environmental factors influencing the community construction process the study expands our understanding of the construction and ecological mechanisms of eukaryotic microbial communities in aquatic systems the analysis of the variability of symbiotic networks and environmental factors has provided us with further insight into the maintenance mechanisms of eukaryotic microbial communities for high elevation ecosystems elevational gradients can serve as a new perspective for in depth analysis of the biogeographic characteristics of communities the results of the study provide considerations for future studies of microbial diversity in aquatic ecosystems especially in extreme environments such as
