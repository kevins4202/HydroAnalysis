11510,assessment of specific yields is important for effective groundwater management in semi arid hardrock aquifers especially in india with its unsustainable groundwater usage rates the dharta watershed in the udaipur district of rajasthan is one such hardrock area in india where the groundwater extraction rate is a concern in this study we use groundwater balance analysis to estimate the specific yield sy based on crop irrigation water use and changes in water table depths during the irrigation season to develop an understanding of the volume of groundwater recharge from pre and post monsoon water table depths and an understanding of the spatial and temporal changes in estimates of specific yield in the study area the analysis used here estimates values at village scale average area 3 65 km2 and is a technique compatible with the farmers monitoring of groundwater levels to facilitate local cooperative groundwater management five villages in the dharta watershed in rajasthan were selected and 50 wells per village were monitored for water table depth at weekly intervals over a two year period this resulted in a total of 250 wells in the study area and the monitoring was carried out by local farmer volunteers called bhujal jankaars bjs a hindi word meaning groundwater informed crop area coverage with a total of 40 crops was examined for two years in the study area estimates of sy in the five villages were between 1 4 and 8 resulting in values comparable with previous studies the watershed area weighted average sy was 3 8 the method used in this study enabled estimates of recharge without needing a calibrated groundwater model in an area with sparse information on aquifer hydraulic characteristics and unreliable digital elevation maps keywords water balance method water table fluctuation method regional specific yield india groundwater hardrock aquifer system semi arid region 1 introduction groundwater has become a critical natural resource with great economic value in both urban and rural areas burness and brill 2001 qureshi et al 2010 groenfeldt 2013 groundwater has been recognised as the major source of irrigation water in india particularly in states with inadequate supplies from surface water sources and limited rainfall maheshwari et al 2014 varua et al 2016 this is further complicated by the fact that monsoonal rainfall in india has become more erratic with frequent floods and drought as well as a shift of the monsoon peak rainfall probably due to the effect of climate change howe et al 2014 the erratic nature of rainfall is more evident nowadays and for this reason farmers are more dependent on groundwater to avoid crop failure during the kharif season and successfully grow crops during the rabi season chinnasamy 2016 chinnasamy et al 2017 india is the world s largest groundwater user with a usage of 230 km3 per year cgwb 2013 hoekstra 2013 globally india has 39 million ha of agricultural land under groundwater irrigation followed by china and the usa with 19 and 17 million ha respectively world bank 2010 siebert et al 2010 india s groundwater use has increased dramatically over the last 40 years due to easy availability and affordability of diesel and electric pumps to farmers with such an increase in the ease of accessing groundwater post monsoon crops rabi crop in many regions in india are solely irrigated using groundwater which has resulted in increasing crop yield undoubtedly groundwater irrigation in india has enhanced farmer livelihood over the past few decades resulting in substantial socio economic benefits chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 agoramoorthy et al 2016 but it has also led to complex groundwater sustainability and management challenges burke and moench 2000 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2016 groundwater use by industries and a growing urban population in recent years has further increased stress on groundwater resources and the continual lowering of groundwater levels chinnasamy et al 2013 chinnasamy et al 2015a without any regulation on groundwater pumping the aforementioned socio economic growth and agricultural growth also meant that annual groundwater use began to exceed the annual natural rainfall recharge shah 2008 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 consequently over the past decade many dug wells and surface water stores are now dry and have been abandoned the groundwater levels surrounding these areas have also declined deeply due to the limited recharge from surface water as a result farmers with limited shallow groundwater resources have started drilling tube wells to access water from deeper aquifers shah 2010 shah et al 2003 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2016 this extensive unregulated and unsustainable use of groundwater resources by indian agricultural domestic and industrial users has created a set of complex management problems and sustainability concerns thus there is a need for efficient groundwater management especially in the semi arid regions of india where groundwater recharge is low and pumping is high chinnasamy et al 2015a chinnasamy et al 2015b chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 2 estimation of aquifer properties effective groundwater management requires an estimation of annual recharge and groundwater volume that can be pumped from a given area for this we need reliable estimates of aquifer properties such as specific yield and other hydrogeological information freeze and cherry 1979 the estimate of groundwater volume that is available for pumping is important for commencing a meaningful dialogue with local villagers managers in government agencies and policy makers this helps in creating objectivity and a better understanding of the groundwater situation and options for future actions further to estimate the sustainable groundwater yield the first step in this process is to determine storage change using groundwater level data and specific yield of aquifer these estimates can provide a scientific basis to explore alternative management scenarios and strategies with the farming community for improving their livelihood while sustaining the groundwater resource in most semi arid regions in india there is a scarcity of aquifer data especially groundwater levels and aquifer hydro geologic data chinnasamy et al 2015a due to the property of hardrock aquifers there is often a large spatial variation in aquifer hydraulic parameters this is further complicated by the variation in aquifer material types and properties with depth from the land surface particularly evident when there are significant changes in the water table during monsoon and pumping seasons therefore the aquifer properties based on methods that are traditionally used in alluvial aquifers e g pumping test method may not provide representative values of the aquifer properties in hardrock areas machiwal and jha 2014 in particular the estimation of specific yield has been difficult in hardrock aquifers while detailed and sophisticated measurements of groundwater balance components in a developing country situation is often difficult and beyond the financial resources of most government agencies in the past specific yield has been determined by a number of methods that include pumping tests soil moisture measurements geophysical methods water balance methods and the water table fluctuation technique gec 2009 freeze and cherry 1979 in response to growing concerns pertaining to uncertainties in groundwater resource estimation the indian government established the central groundwater board cgwb in 1970 cgwb 2004 under the ministry of agriculture to quantify and regulate groundwater resources nationwide on this note the cgwb in collaboration with the groundwater resource estimation committee gec developed and validated scientific methods to monitor groundwater resources and also included the state groundwater departments gec 2009 due to this collaboration many scientific reports at district and state levels have been published to date e g cgwb 2011 the cgwb and gec recommend the use of the water balance method and water table fluctuation methods to estimate specific yield in india s hardrock regions especially in shallow water tables and unconfined aquifers gec 2009 nabard 2006 cgwb 1997 for estimating specific yield in hardrock areas the methods based on groundwater level data tended to yield more reliable values machiwal and jha 2014 in general the methodology for estimating specific yield needs to be robust and defensible and provide good estimates of groundwater balance components and insights into groundwater dynamics at the village level effective methods also need to account for considerable spatial variations in specific yield values which are due to heterogeneity and anisotropy in aquifer properties that are characteristic of hardrock aquifers the main objective of this study is to estimate the specific yield based on crop irrigation water use and changes in the pre and post irrigation season water table depths the other objective is to understand the spatial and temporal changes in specific yield in the study area unlike other studies in the past the current study takes into account spatial and temporal variations by incorporating site specific high frequency weekly water table depth information one important outcome of the analysis is to develop a methodology for the estimation of specific yield based on data that can be easily collected by local farmers and government agencies subsequently the computed specific yield is considered with pre and post monsoon groundwater levels to give a simple and reliable method to indicate recharge to hard rock aquifers in the absence or scarcity of data on which other methods rely such a simplified method can aid land managers and farmers to estimate specific yields from their limited field data and also aid in estimating total water storage for a given water level change using the water table fluctuation wtf method 3 study area the study was conducted in the dharta watershed of the udaipur district rajasthan india fig 1 the watershed has a semi arid climate with an average annual rainfall of 600 mm however almost 90 of this rainfall is concentrated during the monsoon months of june to october cgwb 2010 the dry months are from november to march the farmers in the watershed grow cluster bean groundnut soya bean maize black gram mung bean guar and vegetables as kharif crops during the monsoon season wheat gram sorghum and mustard are the main rabi crops grown during the winter season farmers with groundwater and surface water access e g canal water grow two crops a year while a limited number of farmers with year round water grow some summer crops such as vegetables and fodder most farmers in the watershed are from mainstream groups since agriculture is the dominant occupation in the watershed there is a need to quantify water resources that can increase agricultural production and eventually improve livelihoods of farmers in the watershed the occurrence and distribution of rainfall is highly uneven in time and space as a result kharif crops which are monsoon dependent often face either complete or partial crop failure because of below average rainfall or absence of rainfall at critical stages of crop growth during such instances crop failure can be averted by using rainwater stored in ponds check dams or groundwater a number of in situ water conservation measures e g farm ponds percolation ponds and check dams have been constructed in the watershed by the integrated watershed management iwm and mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mnrega programs funded by the government the rajasthan state government and the central government have invested significant amounts of funds for accelerating groundwater recharge in these areas in the past and continue to do so by constructing more of these structures maheshwari et al 2014 chinnasamy et al 2013 cgwb 2013 it is important to note that the dharta watershed has hardrock aquifers and these aquifers are well known for their low porosity and low connectivity and how the movement of groundwater occurs mostly through faults fissures and fractures freeze and cherry 1979 as a result hardrock aquifers have limited water storage capacity and this is one of the reasons that the excessive pumping in recent years have rendered them empty of water and the depth of water table has dropped dramatically with significant water scarcity during summer months or drier years cgwb 2011 cgwb 2014 machiwal and jha 2014 according to machiwal and jha machiwal and jha 2014 southern rajasthan s geology is dominated by phyllite schist geology and consists of phyllite schist gneiss schist granite and quartzite similar to other hardrock regions both confined and unconfined aquifers are present in this region typically the unconfined aquifers are within 100 m of the surface while the deeper aquifers are confined aquifers gwd 2008 the cgwb cgwb 2010 reports that groundwater in this region is controlled by variations in land use elevation physiography and geologic properties field pumping tests by machiwal machiwal 2009 indicates that the hydraulic conductivity in this region ranges from 1 33 41 65 m day while machiwal and jha machiwal and jha 2014 estimated the specific yield to be 0 038 0 002 4 data collection this study is part of the project titled managed aquifer recharge through village level interventions marvi funded by the australian centre for international agricultural research the marvi project is focussed on evaluating the effectiveness of village scale interventions including managed aquifer recharge for sustaining groundwater resources to meet drinking and irrigation water needs five villages in the dharta watershed in rajasthan were selected in this study a total of 50 wells per village were monitored for water table depth at weekly intervals over a two year period this resulted in a total of 250 wells and over 6000 water table depth measurements for the study the monitoring was carried out by local farmer volunteers called bhujal jankaars bjs a hindi word meaning groundwater informed bjs were identified from a set of local farmers and trained for data collection and scientific concepts related to geohydrology and were trained to explain how groundwater levels are influenced by local rainfall patterns and pumping patterns through the participatory approach bjs were trained and involved in the collection of water table depth rainfall water quality and agronomic data while the village school students were also trained and involved in the monitoring of rainfall at the commencement of this project the dharta watershed initially had limited information on topography number and types of wells for irrigation cropped area area under irrigation yield of irrigated crops and no local hydro meteorological data especially groundwater level and rainfall information maheshwari et al 2014 in the current scenario the project has addressed these information gaps 4 1 groundwater data groundwater data were collected by bjs during 2012 2014 and the bjs were supervised by local project staff called bj facilitators to ensure data quality and resolve any issue that may come up during the study period the dharta watershed was divided into 5 villages fig 1 with 50 wells in each village the delineation of village boundaries was based on the clustering of the dug wells used for monitoring this delineation enabled site specific estimations of specific yield for each village that depended on the groundwater behaviour and land use pattern there were a total of 25 bjs in the study and each bj monitored 10 dug wells and therefore a total of 250 dug wells were monitored by them on a weekly basis every sunday morning in the watershed fig 2 before well monitoring all bjs and the marvi team were involved in a baseline survey to compile information related to the village wells the bjs helped in identifying farmers who were willing to provide their wells for groundwater level monitoring the bjs monitored the variations in water table fluctuation by measuring the water level depth from the ground surface using measuring tapes in addition ph and ec were monitored by them on a monthly basis the depth to water table was measured from identified datum for each well and the values were recorded to the nearest centimetre in a log book supplied to them their data were collected weekly on mondays by the bj facilitator who made random checks on one well for each bj each week and gave immediate feedback and this ensured the reliability of data collected by the bjs in addition the bjs acted as an interface between the project team and village community and helped by liaising with the local farmers and the marvi project team as a result the bjs are now the local champions of groundwater and an important link between farmers and the marvi project team 4 2 crop area and land use the data related to land use and cropped areas in the watershed were collected through a village level survey for two growing periods 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 the land use data were divided into two main categories agricultural and non agricultural the agricultural land use data is further divided into rain fed kharif and irrigated rabi cropped areas in the entire watershed 71 of the land is under agriculture while 29 is non agricultural land of the agricultural land 52 is under kharif while the remaining 48 is under rabi crop 5 data analysis 5 1 estimation of village scale specific yield in an unconfined hardrock aquifer there is a strong seasonality healy and cook 2002a b machiwal and jha 2014 during the monsoon season groundwater levels rise due to recharge followed by a drop in the groundwater level due to pumping during rabi november march and summer april june seasons therefore as per the water balance and water table fluctuation methods the hydrological year can be divided into two seasons 1 recharge monsoon season and 2 discharge pumping and dry season the groundwater balance analysis is used to estimate the change in groundwater storage which is later used with the water table fluctuation to estimate specific yield maréchal et al 2006 estimating the change in groundwater storage in hardrock aquifers is a difficult task due to the heterogeneity and complexity in the geologic properties that affect the aquifer porosity and connectivity of fractures in the present study for the purpose of groundwater balance analysis we assume that the groundwater is not pumped or the pumping is negligible during the kharif season hence any change in water table depth is due to rainfall recharge only during the season this is a reasonable assumption as crop water demand during the kharif season is met by monsoonal rain and generally there is no groundwater pumping if there is groundwater pumping for life saving irrigation it is insignificant compared to the volume of groundwater used during the rabi season therefore the change in water table depth between the end of the dry season june and at the end of the monsoon september october is considered to be mainly due to rainfall recharge and includes the recharge attributed to recharge structures the change in groundwater storage δs during the rabi season is due to pumping of groundwater for irrigation it is to be noted that there is no baseflow in streams and since the water table depth in the study area is 10 m below the surface the groundwater use by trees and other local vegetation is assumed negligible furthermore since the water table is quite deep and the local streams are dry during the rabi season for simplicity the baseflow contributions can also be assumed negligible therefore by ignoring the unknown net lateral groundwater flow the groundwater storage change δs is equal to the groundwater use essentially irrigation water use iwu therefore once iwu is equated to dry season δs the water table fluctuation method is used to estimate specific yield as follows 1 i w u i 1 n a c i cwu i 10 3 where iwu is the total irrigation water use m3 cwui is the seasonal crop water use mm for crop type i aci is the total area under a given crop type i m2 for each of n crop types present it is to be noted that due to lack of pumped volume measures it was assumed in eq 1 that the iwu is equal to the product of the cwu and cropped area in reality the pumped volume could be higher or lower depending on the available water and how sensitively the irrigation water was applied the cwu is estimated using the food and agricultural organisation fao method allen et al 1998 as follows 2 c w u k c e t r e f where kc is the crop coefficient estimated from fao allen et al 1998 and etref is the reference evapotranspiration mm etref is estimated from published values for the region e g cgwb 2010 the representative value of the specific yield of the area based on water table depth change during the dry season rabi is given by the following equation 3 s y 1 i w u a δ h m where sy1 is the upper bound specific yield dimensionless a is the area of the village m2 and δhm average head change over the cropped area m the above method is used for two rabi seasons november 2012 march 2013 and november 2013 march 2014 the groundwater storage change is estimated using the water table fluctuation wtf method which is well cited globally and used by the gec committee for characterising groundwater depletion in india gec 2009 the changes in groundwater storage by the wtf method are estimated as 4 δs1 a δhm sy where δs is the groundwater storage change m3 and a is the area of the village m2 the wtf method is widely used by many government agencies e g us geological survey usa cgwb india and researchers martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 touhami et al 2013 sharma et al 2015 rohde et al 2015 asoka et al 2017 as it is easy to use and less data intensive yet successful in application healy and cook 2002a b provide an extensive review of the wtf method and discuss the applicability and limitation of the method the method was modified to account for an approximation of the drawdown that occurs outside the village area in the absence of reliable digital elevation maps groundwater gradients could not be deduced nor a groundwater model developed instead the storage change outside the village area was calculated analytically based on a method of glover glover 1978 that is used to calculate bank storage change adjacent to a reservoir having a sudden decrease in level where head in the unconfined aquifer is given by 5 h x t δ h m e r f x 4 a t 1 2 where h x t is the height of the water table above the drawn down water table level of the village area m δh m is the average drawn down of water table over the village area at the end of the irrigation season m x is the outward distance perpendicular to the perimeter of the village area m α is the aquifer diffusivity assumed to be constant t sy m2 d where t is the transmissivity of the aquifer m2 d and sy is the specific yield which therefore is determined recursively it was shown by glover 1978 using darcy s law and differentiating h x t with respect to x at x 0 and integrating with respect to time from t 0 to t t that the inflow to the drawn down reservoir in this case the village area per metre of its perimeter at time t v 0 t m2 d is 6 v 0 t δ h m s y 4 α t π 1 2 converting this to approximate the total volume of drawdown beyond the village perimeter gives 7 δs2 f p v 0 t s y y where f is a correction to account for the gradual decline of the village groundwater level over the irrigation season in this case f 0 5 was used and a sensitivity analysis evaluated the effect of f on results and p is the village area perimeter m this enables calculation of the corrected specific yield of 8 s y i w u δ s 1 δ s 2 the correction for drawdown beyond the study area involves a number of assumptions a he dupuit forchheimer conditions are valid horizontal uniform flow b the aquifer is homogeneous and extensive with no external interferences c the ambient gradient across the perimeter without groundwater pumping is low d the village area is sufficiently large that flow across the boundary perimeter p may be approximated as more or less parallel and perpendicular to the perimeter rather than radial flow e the aquifer diffusivity is considered constant in spite of water level variations and f that a step change of one half of δhm f 0 5 applied at the start of the time period produces similar storage change to a linear change in head within the village over the period of pumping tp 150 days taking account of drawdown outside the village areas was found to reduce the uncorrected specific yield by values between 6 and 26 when t 5m2 d and f 0 5 and the magnitude of the correction increased as the area to perimeter ratio decreased in the current study the groundwater storage change is estimated for two distinct periods in the xth year i during the recharge season april of xth year to september 30 of xth year and ii during the discharge season november of x 1th year to march 31 of xth year it is noted that the estimated groundwater storage change is a net change after the groundwater storage is subjected to pumping an analysis of variance anova was also performed on the estimated sy to understand differences among the values and to investigate statistical significance the anova two factor without replication tomson et al 1981 was used on the data to understand if the sy varied significantly between villages spatial and between years temporal 6 results and discussion 6 1 water table trends for the study period from august 2012 to december 2014 the average water table behaviour is shown in fig 3 a comparison between trends shows that similar seasons of shallow water table depths and similar seasons of deep water table depths exist these fluctuating water table depths indicate that the recharge is influenced by rainfall recharge during the monsoon season and is influenced by pumping during the dry season which is typical of hardrock unconfined aquifers maréchal et al 2006 the overall trend shows that on average october has shallower water table depth while february recorded deeper water table depths more descriptive statistics of the groundwater data is given in table 1 6 2 cropping area and crop water use water table fluctuations observed in the two rabi seasons considered in this study are generally similar indicating that there is negligible change in farmer behaviour in terms of crop type and groundwater use during the two years key crops in the rabi season include wheat sorghum mustard isabgol psyllium husk onion and lucerne type of alfalfa annual cropped areas of these crops are listed in table 2 while the average cropped area per village is shown in fig 4 the resulting iwu for each village is given in table 3 annually the hinta varni village has the highest iwu with 2 1 million m3 while sunderpura2 village has the lowest iwu with 0 3 million m3 the average annual water use in the study area 5 villages is 4 6 million m3 additionally it is noted that wheat crop consumes the largest iwu with 634 mm followed by sorghum 615 mm onion 614 mm lucerne 600 mm mustard and isabgol 556 mm each it is to be noted that the above estimated crop water consumption due to lack of pumped data is the estimates of crop water consumption and not the amount of water applied to the field the estimated iwu provides the volume of water that corresponds to the net groundwater storage change over the village sub areas during the rabi season the groundwater head change during the rabi season was calculated and tabulated in table 3 the table indicates that the sunderpura village recorded the maximum average change of 12 37 m followed by dharta and badgaon hinta varni region had the lowest groundwater change of 5 62 m even though the cropped area is highest in this village once the crop water use i e net storage change and head change were estimated the specific yield was estimated using eq 3 estimated specific yield values are shown in table 3 individual specific yield results indicate that the hinta varni village had the highest specific yield values 1 05 and 1 26 for 2012 13 and 2013 14 years respectively while sunderpura2 had the lowest values 7 32 and 4 47 for 2012 13 and 2013 14 years respectively this indicates that the specific yield values vary considerably possibly due to variations in geology and depth to water table furthermore with a decrease in water table depth there is a possibility of some layers not being active in groundwater flow closing of fractures and changes in dominant flowpaths and as such all these factors can change the specific yield values similar to previous studies the specific yield values in this study indicate the complexity and heterogeneity that exist in hardrock aquifers machiwal and jha 2014 maréchal et al 2006 it is to be noted that machiwal and jha machiwal and jha 2014 estimated the specific yield using double water table fluctuation method to be between 3 8 0 2 for a study area in the udaipur district while the current study result indicates an average specific yield of 2 with some spatial variations related to water table depth and groundwater use patterns 6 3 sensitivity analysis to remove any bias errors a sensitivity analysis was performed on the estimated specific yield sy values the sy values were estimated by increasing the variables in eq 3 individually by changing one at a time and keeping the other variables the same to understand which variable had more influence on the specific yield the variables were adjusted from 10 to 50 and the sy and change in sy was estimated the iwu irrigation water use had the most influence on the sy changing the values similarly by which it was changed while the village area a and change in head δhm also had a similar impact on sy the overall analysis thus indicated that the sy is sensitive to irrigation water use groundwater elevation change and area 6 4 statistical analysis the results showed that there was statistically significant variance in the sy between the village sites fcrit f and p value 0 05 indicating that the geophysical characteristics that influence the sy are different between villages the results also showed that there was no statistically significant variance in the sy between the two experimental years fcrit f and p value 0 05 indicating that the processes that influenced the sy did not change significantly between years therefore the results indicated that the sy varied spatially but not temporally 6 5 groundwater storage change the groundwater storage changes in volumetric units during the recharge and discharge season for the study villages are shown in fig 5 the hinta varni village had the highest groundwater storage change during the recharge season of 2 2 million cubic meter mcm per year while sunderpura2 village had the lowest of 0 3 mcm similarly the hinta varni village had the highest groundwater storage change of 2 1 mcm during the discharge season while sunderpura2 village had the lowest of 0 3 mcm the overall analysis indicates that the recharge volumes are approximately equal to the withdrawal volumes and hence the groundwater levels during the study period are on a stable trend this phenomenon is also noted in the groundwater trend in fig 3 wherein the groundwater levels return to pre monsoon levels indicating the recharge and discharge are occurring at a similar rate 6 6 groundwater management and citizen science water table monitoring provides important information about the groundwater situation in an area and how the aquifer system responds to pumping land use change and climatic variability for the monitoring to provide useful data for sustainable groundwater resource management it is important to have a reasonably distributed long term monitoring well network in a watershed little et al 2016 varua et al 2016 participatory monitoring involving farmers can complement existing government run monitoring programs and provide an effective and affordable tool for sustainable groundwater management participatory monitoring is basically citizen science and is a cross cutting concept which is increasingly becoming popular in natural science research and many other disciplines buytaert et al 2014 it is also known by crowd sourcing civic science community science and other terms and can involve community based data collection requesting contributions carrying out specific technical tasks with the help local citizen as demonstrated in the present study the participation of farmers schools and other community groups in the research design data collection and interpretation process together with researchers can be an important step forward in tackling the complexity of groundwater management in hardrock areas even though specific yield estimation methodology is not new the basis of this study is to use limited information i e a cost effective public participatory and citizen science approach alternative method to determine water balances in the absence of long term data citizen science is increasingly becoming an important part of formal scientific research in some topic areas where data are collected from a large geographical area when research budgets are limited and the involvement of local citizens is vital to improve a complex problematic situation baretto et al 2003 hand 2010 brossard et al 2005 this allows public participation of local citizens in scientific research and may take form of participatory monitoring and participatory action research the research is conducted in whole or in part by local citizens who have an interest in the local problem as performed in this study the citizen science may involve regular collection and analysis of data development and testing of technology and sharing of knowledge and understanding gained for improving the situation 7 limitations and future research it is noted that the assumption of equating irrigation water mostly estimated from pumped volumes is equal to the crop water requirement times the area could be higher or lower than the actual water applied to the crops however since the study did not have the data from pumping regimes the aforementioned assumption was made future studies should where possible incorporate measurements of actual pumped volume for irrigation while deriving the specific yield it is also understood that there could be a possibility of lateral groundwater flow flowing into and out of the villages which may not follow the topographic boundary or village boundary such groundwater flux boundary conditions for each village could be assessed by setting up monitoring wells along the boundary and will be a topic for future research however installation of new wells at the boundary was not done in the current study due to limitation in securing permissions to monitor observation wells and the fact that most monitored wells were those used by the farmers in each village since the land use and groundwater consumption was similar within and out of each village owing to the local agricultural patterns and small size of the villages it was assumed that any groundwater flux entering a village would be the same volume that exits the village boundary thus keeping the inflow and outflow balanced clustering of observation wells in villages could lead to disproportionate bearing on research findings however since our field investigations revealed that the land use and geologic setting were similar within each village results from the clustered wells were taken as representative results for each village future research can identify more wells in each village but given the small size of each village and the associated costs for installation and monitoring of new wells it is viewed that the results might not vary much within villages it is noted that the study aims to investigate hydrologic conditions with the present infrastructure and how knowledge can be improved with current monitoring stations flowmeters fixed to wells can relay actual pumped volumes however the farmers in the study villages were sensitive to the installations as they are concerned if they will be taxed per water use based on these new meters due to the difficulties in commissioning them in the study villages the study used irrigated water use iwu computations future studies wherever possible should validate the iwu computations with flowmeters to obtain better pumped volume results in addition future research should also investigate the potential of other methods e g micro gravimetric measurements howle et al 2003 gehman et al 2009 and conduct a comparison between different methods such an exercise will benefit land managers in choosing appropriate methods for site specific conditions 8 conclusions the current study used a combination of water balance and water table fluctuation methods to estimate regional specific yield in the dharta watershed a semi arid hardrock region in rajasthan a north western state of india the study indicated that it is possible to use local participatory monitoring of water table depths and estimated irrigation water use based on cropped areas to estimate reliable values of specific yield based on the results of this study the regional specific yield values varied between 1 4 with a slight variation between villages there were no significant variations in specific yield between study periods it is concluded that the combination of the water balance method and the water level fluctuation technique could be a valuable tool for estimating regional specific yield values in a semi arid hardrock watershed where data is scarce the method used in this study is affordable simplified and enables local participation the methodology can be used to obtain specific yield values for formulating groundwater management plans in hardrock regions and can be effectively up scaled to watershed block and district level analysis

11510,assessment of specific yields is important for effective groundwater management in semi arid hardrock aquifers especially in india with its unsustainable groundwater usage rates the dharta watershed in the udaipur district of rajasthan is one such hardrock area in india where the groundwater extraction rate is a concern in this study we use groundwater balance analysis to estimate the specific yield sy based on crop irrigation water use and changes in water table depths during the irrigation season to develop an understanding of the volume of groundwater recharge from pre and post monsoon water table depths and an understanding of the spatial and temporal changes in estimates of specific yield in the study area the analysis used here estimates values at village scale average area 3 65 km2 and is a technique compatible with the farmers monitoring of groundwater levels to facilitate local cooperative groundwater management five villages in the dharta watershed in rajasthan were selected and 50 wells per village were monitored for water table depth at weekly intervals over a two year period this resulted in a total of 250 wells in the study area and the monitoring was carried out by local farmer volunteers called bhujal jankaars bjs a hindi word meaning groundwater informed crop area coverage with a total of 40 crops was examined for two years in the study area estimates of sy in the five villages were between 1 4 and 8 resulting in values comparable with previous studies the watershed area weighted average sy was 3 8 the method used in this study enabled estimates of recharge without needing a calibrated groundwater model in an area with sparse information on aquifer hydraulic characteristics and unreliable digital elevation maps keywords water balance method water table fluctuation method regional specific yield india groundwater hardrock aquifer system semi arid region 1 introduction groundwater has become a critical natural resource with great economic value in both urban and rural areas burness and brill 2001 qureshi et al 2010 groenfeldt 2013 groundwater has been recognised as the major source of irrigation water in india particularly in states with inadequate supplies from surface water sources and limited rainfall maheshwari et al 2014 varua et al 2016 this is further complicated by the fact that monsoonal rainfall in india has become more erratic with frequent floods and drought as well as a shift of the monsoon peak rainfall probably due to the effect of climate change howe et al 2014 the erratic nature of rainfall is more evident nowadays and for this reason farmers are more dependent on groundwater to avoid crop failure during the kharif season and successfully grow crops during the rabi season chinnasamy 2016 chinnasamy et al 2017 india is the world s largest groundwater user with a usage of 230 km3 per year cgwb 2013 hoekstra 2013 globally india has 39 million ha of agricultural land under groundwater irrigation followed by china and the usa with 19 and 17 million ha respectively world bank 2010 siebert et al 2010 india s groundwater use has increased dramatically over the last 40 years due to easy availability and affordability of diesel and electric pumps to farmers with such an increase in the ease of accessing groundwater post monsoon crops rabi crop in many regions in india are solely irrigated using groundwater which has resulted in increasing crop yield undoubtedly groundwater irrigation in india has enhanced farmer livelihood over the past few decades resulting in substantial socio economic benefits chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 agoramoorthy et al 2016 but it has also led to complex groundwater sustainability and management challenges burke and moench 2000 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2016 groundwater use by industries and a growing urban population in recent years has further increased stress on groundwater resources and the continual lowering of groundwater levels chinnasamy et al 2013 chinnasamy et al 2015a without any regulation on groundwater pumping the aforementioned socio economic growth and agricultural growth also meant that annual groundwater use began to exceed the annual natural rainfall recharge shah 2008 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 consequently over the past decade many dug wells and surface water stores are now dry and have been abandoned the groundwater levels surrounding these areas have also declined deeply due to the limited recharge from surface water as a result farmers with limited shallow groundwater resources have started drilling tube wells to access water from deeper aquifers shah 2010 shah et al 2003 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2016 this extensive unregulated and unsustainable use of groundwater resources by indian agricultural domestic and industrial users has created a set of complex management problems and sustainability concerns thus there is a need for efficient groundwater management especially in the semi arid regions of india where groundwater recharge is low and pumping is high chinnasamy et al 2015a chinnasamy et al 2015b chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 2 estimation of aquifer properties effective groundwater management requires an estimation of annual recharge and groundwater volume that can be pumped from a given area for this we need reliable estimates of aquifer properties such as specific yield and other hydrogeological information freeze and cherry 1979 the estimate of groundwater volume that is available for pumping is important for commencing a meaningful dialogue with local villagers managers in government agencies and policy makers this helps in creating objectivity and a better understanding of the groundwater situation and options for future actions further to estimate the sustainable groundwater yield the first step in this process is to determine storage change using groundwater level data and specific yield of aquifer these estimates can provide a scientific basis to explore alternative management scenarios and strategies with the farming community for improving their livelihood while sustaining the groundwater resource in most semi arid regions in india there is a scarcity of aquifer data especially groundwater levels and aquifer hydro geologic data chinnasamy et al 2015a due to the property of hardrock aquifers there is often a large spatial variation in aquifer hydraulic parameters this is further complicated by the variation in aquifer material types and properties with depth from the land surface particularly evident when there are significant changes in the water table during monsoon and pumping seasons therefore the aquifer properties based on methods that are traditionally used in alluvial aquifers e g pumping test method may not provide representative values of the aquifer properties in hardrock areas machiwal and jha 2014 in particular the estimation of specific yield has been difficult in hardrock aquifers while detailed and sophisticated measurements of groundwater balance components in a developing country situation is often difficult and beyond the financial resources of most government agencies in the past specific yield has been determined by a number of methods that include pumping tests soil moisture measurements geophysical methods water balance methods and the water table fluctuation technique gec 2009 freeze and cherry 1979 in response to growing concerns pertaining to uncertainties in groundwater resource estimation the indian government established the central groundwater board cgwb in 1970 cgwb 2004 under the ministry of agriculture to quantify and regulate groundwater resources nationwide on this note the cgwb in collaboration with the groundwater resource estimation committee gec developed and validated scientific methods to monitor groundwater resources and also included the state groundwater departments gec 2009 due to this collaboration many scientific reports at district and state levels have been published to date e g cgwb 2011 the cgwb and gec recommend the use of the water balance method and water table fluctuation methods to estimate specific yield in india s hardrock regions especially in shallow water tables and unconfined aquifers gec 2009 nabard 2006 cgwb 1997 for estimating specific yield in hardrock areas the methods based on groundwater level data tended to yield more reliable values machiwal and jha 2014 in general the methodology for estimating specific yield needs to be robust and defensible and provide good estimates of groundwater balance components and insights into groundwater dynamics at the village level effective methods also need to account for considerable spatial variations in specific yield values which are due to heterogeneity and anisotropy in aquifer properties that are characteristic of hardrock aquifers the main objective of this study is to estimate the specific yield based on crop irrigation water use and changes in the pre and post irrigation season water table depths the other objective is to understand the spatial and temporal changes in specific yield in the study area unlike other studies in the past the current study takes into account spatial and temporal variations by incorporating site specific high frequency weekly water table depth information one important outcome of the analysis is to develop a methodology for the estimation of specific yield based on data that can be easily collected by local farmers and government agencies subsequently the computed specific yield is considered with pre and post monsoon groundwater levels to give a simple and reliable method to indicate recharge to hard rock aquifers in the absence or scarcity of data on which other methods rely such a simplified method can aid land managers and farmers to estimate specific yields from their limited field data and also aid in estimating total water storage for a given water level change using the water table fluctuation wtf method 3 study area the study was conducted in the dharta watershed of the udaipur district rajasthan india fig 1 the watershed has a semi arid climate with an average annual rainfall of 600 mm however almost 90 of this rainfall is concentrated during the monsoon months of june to october cgwb 2010 the dry months are from november to march the farmers in the watershed grow cluster bean groundnut soya bean maize black gram mung bean guar and vegetables as kharif crops during the monsoon season wheat gram sorghum and mustard are the main rabi crops grown during the winter season farmers with groundwater and surface water access e g canal water grow two crops a year while a limited number of farmers with year round water grow some summer crops such as vegetables and fodder most farmers in the watershed are from mainstream groups since agriculture is the dominant occupation in the watershed there is a need to quantify water resources that can increase agricultural production and eventually improve livelihoods of farmers in the watershed the occurrence and distribution of rainfall is highly uneven in time and space as a result kharif crops which are monsoon dependent often face either complete or partial crop failure because of below average rainfall or absence of rainfall at critical stages of crop growth during such instances crop failure can be averted by using rainwater stored in ponds check dams or groundwater a number of in situ water conservation measures e g farm ponds percolation ponds and check dams have been constructed in the watershed by the integrated watershed management iwm and mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mnrega programs funded by the government the rajasthan state government and the central government have invested significant amounts of funds for accelerating groundwater recharge in these areas in the past and continue to do so by constructing more of these structures maheshwari et al 2014 chinnasamy et al 2013 cgwb 2013 it is important to note that the dharta watershed has hardrock aquifers and these aquifers are well known for their low porosity and low connectivity and how the movement of groundwater occurs mostly through faults fissures and fractures freeze and cherry 1979 as a result hardrock aquifers have limited water storage capacity and this is one of the reasons that the excessive pumping in recent years have rendered them empty of water and the depth of water table has dropped dramatically with significant water scarcity during summer months or drier years cgwb 2011 cgwb 2014 machiwal and jha 2014 according to machiwal and jha machiwal and jha 2014 southern rajasthan s geology is dominated by phyllite schist geology and consists of phyllite schist gneiss schist granite and quartzite similar to other hardrock regions both confined and unconfined aquifers are present in this region typically the unconfined aquifers are within 100 m of the surface while the deeper aquifers are confined aquifers gwd 2008 the cgwb cgwb 2010 reports that groundwater in this region is controlled by variations in land use elevation physiography and geologic properties field pumping tests by machiwal machiwal 2009 indicates that the hydraulic conductivity in this region ranges from 1 33 41 65 m day while machiwal and jha machiwal and jha 2014 estimated the specific yield to be 0 038 0 002 4 data collection this study is part of the project titled managed aquifer recharge through village level interventions marvi funded by the australian centre for international agricultural research the marvi project is focussed on evaluating the effectiveness of village scale interventions including managed aquifer recharge for sustaining groundwater resources to meet drinking and irrigation water needs five villages in the dharta watershed in rajasthan were selected in this study a total of 50 wells per village were monitored for water table depth at weekly intervals over a two year period this resulted in a total of 250 wells and over 6000 water table depth measurements for the study the monitoring was carried out by local farmer volunteers called bhujal jankaars bjs a hindi word meaning groundwater informed bjs were identified from a set of local farmers and trained for data collection and scientific concepts related to geohydrology and were trained to explain how groundwater levels are influenced by local rainfall patterns and pumping patterns through the participatory approach bjs were trained and involved in the collection of water table depth rainfall water quality and agronomic data while the village school students were also trained and involved in the monitoring of rainfall at the commencement of this project the dharta watershed initially had limited information on topography number and types of wells for irrigation cropped area area under irrigation yield of irrigated crops and no local hydro meteorological data especially groundwater level and rainfall information maheshwari et al 2014 in the current scenario the project has addressed these information gaps 4 1 groundwater data groundwater data were collected by bjs during 2012 2014 and the bjs were supervised by local project staff called bj facilitators to ensure data quality and resolve any issue that may come up during the study period the dharta watershed was divided into 5 villages fig 1 with 50 wells in each village the delineation of village boundaries was based on the clustering of the dug wells used for monitoring this delineation enabled site specific estimations of specific yield for each village that depended on the groundwater behaviour and land use pattern there were a total of 25 bjs in the study and each bj monitored 10 dug wells and therefore a total of 250 dug wells were monitored by them on a weekly basis every sunday morning in the watershed fig 2 before well monitoring all bjs and the marvi team were involved in a baseline survey to compile information related to the village wells the bjs helped in identifying farmers who were willing to provide their wells for groundwater level monitoring the bjs monitored the variations in water table fluctuation by measuring the water level depth from the ground surface using measuring tapes in addition ph and ec were monitored by them on a monthly basis the depth to water table was measured from identified datum for each well and the values were recorded to the nearest centimetre in a log book supplied to them their data were collected weekly on mondays by the bj facilitator who made random checks on one well for each bj each week and gave immediate feedback and this ensured the reliability of data collected by the bjs in addition the bjs acted as an interface between the project team and village community and helped by liaising with the local farmers and the marvi project team as a result the bjs are now the local champions of groundwater and an important link between farmers and the marvi project team 4 2 crop area and land use the data related to land use and cropped areas in the watershed were collected through a village level survey for two growing periods 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 the land use data were divided into two main categories agricultural and non agricultural the agricultural land use data is further divided into rain fed kharif and irrigated rabi cropped areas in the entire watershed 71 of the land is under agriculture while 29 is non agricultural land of the agricultural land 52 is under kharif while the remaining 48 is under rabi crop 5 data analysis 5 1 estimation of village scale specific yield in an unconfined hardrock aquifer there is a strong seasonality healy and cook 2002a b machiwal and jha 2014 during the monsoon season groundwater levels rise due to recharge followed by a drop in the groundwater level due to pumping during rabi november march and summer april june seasons therefore as per the water balance and water table fluctuation methods the hydrological year can be divided into two seasons 1 recharge monsoon season and 2 discharge pumping and dry season the groundwater balance analysis is used to estimate the change in groundwater storage which is later used with the water table fluctuation to estimate specific yield maréchal et al 2006 estimating the change in groundwater storage in hardrock aquifers is a difficult task due to the heterogeneity and complexity in the geologic properties that affect the aquifer porosity and connectivity of fractures in the present study for the purpose of groundwater balance analysis we assume that the groundwater is not pumped or the pumping is negligible during the kharif season hence any change in water table depth is due to rainfall recharge only during the season this is a reasonable assumption as crop water demand during the kharif season is met by monsoonal rain and generally there is no groundwater pumping if there is groundwater pumping for life saving irrigation it is insignificant compared to the volume of groundwater used during the rabi season therefore the change in water table depth between the end of the dry season june and at the end of the monsoon september october is considered to be mainly due to rainfall recharge and includes the recharge attributed to recharge structures the change in groundwater storage δs during the rabi season is due to pumping of groundwater for irrigation it is to be noted that there is no baseflow in streams and since the water table depth in the study area is 10 m below the surface the groundwater use by trees and other local vegetation is assumed negligible furthermore since the water table is quite deep and the local streams are dry during the rabi season for simplicity the baseflow contributions can also be assumed negligible therefore by ignoring the unknown net lateral groundwater flow the groundwater storage change δs is equal to the groundwater use essentially irrigation water use iwu therefore once iwu is equated to dry season δs the water table fluctuation method is used to estimate specific yield as follows 1 i w u i 1 n a c i cwu i 10 3 where iwu is the total irrigation water use m3 cwui is the seasonal crop water use mm for crop type i aci is the total area under a given crop type i m2 for each of n crop types present it is to be noted that due to lack of pumped volume measures it was assumed in eq 1 that the iwu is equal to the product of the cwu and cropped area in reality the pumped volume could be higher or lower depending on the available water and how sensitively the irrigation water was applied the cwu is estimated using the food and agricultural organisation fao method allen et al 1998 as follows 2 c w u k c e t r e f where kc is the crop coefficient estimated from fao allen et al 1998 and etref is the reference evapotranspiration mm etref is estimated from published values for the region e g cgwb 2010 the representative value of the specific yield of the area based on water table depth change during the dry season rabi is given by the following equation 3 s y 1 i w u a δ h m where sy1 is the upper bound specific yield dimensionless a is the area of the village m2 and δhm average head change over the cropped area m the above method is used for two rabi seasons november 2012 march 2013 and november 2013 march 2014 the groundwater storage change is estimated using the water table fluctuation wtf method which is well cited globally and used by the gec committee for characterising groundwater depletion in india gec 2009 the changes in groundwater storage by the wtf method are estimated as 4 δs1 a δhm sy where δs is the groundwater storage change m3 and a is the area of the village m2 the wtf method is widely used by many government agencies e g us geological survey usa cgwb india and researchers martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 touhami et al 2013 sharma et al 2015 rohde et al 2015 asoka et al 2017 as it is easy to use and less data intensive yet successful in application healy and cook 2002a b provide an extensive review of the wtf method and discuss the applicability and limitation of the method the method was modified to account for an approximation of the drawdown that occurs outside the village area in the absence of reliable digital elevation maps groundwater gradients could not be deduced nor a groundwater model developed instead the storage change outside the village area was calculated analytically based on a method of glover glover 1978 that is used to calculate bank storage change adjacent to a reservoir having a sudden decrease in level where head in the unconfined aquifer is given by 5 h x t δ h m e r f x 4 a t 1 2 where h x t is the height of the water table above the drawn down water table level of the village area m δh m is the average drawn down of water table over the village area at the end of the irrigation season m x is the outward distance perpendicular to the perimeter of the village area m α is the aquifer diffusivity assumed to be constant t sy m2 d where t is the transmissivity of the aquifer m2 d and sy is the specific yield which therefore is determined recursively it was shown by glover 1978 using darcy s law and differentiating h x t with respect to x at x 0 and integrating with respect to time from t 0 to t t that the inflow to the drawn down reservoir in this case the village area per metre of its perimeter at time t v 0 t m2 d is 6 v 0 t δ h m s y 4 α t π 1 2 converting this to approximate the total volume of drawdown beyond the village perimeter gives 7 δs2 f p v 0 t s y y where f is a correction to account for the gradual decline of the village groundwater level over the irrigation season in this case f 0 5 was used and a sensitivity analysis evaluated the effect of f on results and p is the village area perimeter m this enables calculation of the corrected specific yield of 8 s y i w u δ s 1 δ s 2 the correction for drawdown beyond the study area involves a number of assumptions a he dupuit forchheimer conditions are valid horizontal uniform flow b the aquifer is homogeneous and extensive with no external interferences c the ambient gradient across the perimeter without groundwater pumping is low d the village area is sufficiently large that flow across the boundary perimeter p may be approximated as more or less parallel and perpendicular to the perimeter rather than radial flow e the aquifer diffusivity is considered constant in spite of water level variations and f that a step change of one half of δhm f 0 5 applied at the start of the time period produces similar storage change to a linear change in head within the village over the period of pumping tp 150 days taking account of drawdown outside the village areas was found to reduce the uncorrected specific yield by values between 6 and 26 when t 5m2 d and f 0 5 and the magnitude of the correction increased as the area to perimeter ratio decreased in the current study the groundwater storage change is estimated for two distinct periods in the xth year i during the recharge season april of xth year to september 30 of xth year and ii during the discharge season november of x 1th year to march 31 of xth year it is noted that the estimated groundwater storage change is a net change after the groundwater storage is subjected to pumping an analysis of variance anova was also performed on the estimated sy to understand differences among the values and to investigate statistical significance the anova two factor without replication tomson et al 1981 was used on the data to understand if the sy varied significantly between villages spatial and between years temporal 6 results and discussion 6 1 water table trends for the study period from august 2012 to december 2014 the average water table behaviour is shown in fig 3 a comparison between trends shows that similar seasons of shallow water table depths and similar seasons of deep water table depths exist these fluctuating water table depths indicate that the recharge is influenced by rainfall recharge during the monsoon season and is influenced by pumping during the dry season which is typical of hardrock unconfined aquifers maréchal et al 2006 the overall trend shows that on average october has shallower water table depth while february recorded deeper water table depths more descriptive statistics of the groundwater data is given in table 1 6 2 cropping area and crop water use water table fluctuations observed in the two rabi seasons considered in this study are generally similar indicating that there is negligible change in farmer behaviour in terms of crop type and groundwater use during the two years key crops in the rabi season include wheat sorghum mustard isabgol psyllium husk onion and lucerne type of alfalfa annual cropped areas of these crops are listed in table 2 while the average cropped area per village is shown in fig 4 the resulting iwu for each village is given in table 3 annually the hinta varni village has the highest iwu with 2 1 million m3 while sunderpura2 village has the lowest iwu with 0 3 million m3 the average annual water use in the study area 5 villages is 4 6 million m3 additionally it is noted that wheat crop consumes the largest iwu with 634 mm followed by sorghum 615 mm onion 614 mm lucerne 600 mm mustard and isabgol 556 mm each it is to be noted that the above estimated crop water consumption due to lack of pumped data is the estimates of crop water consumption and not the amount of water applied to the field the estimated iwu provides the volume of water that corresponds to the net groundwater storage change over the village sub areas during the rabi season the groundwater head change during the rabi season was calculated and tabulated in table 3 the table indicates that the sunderpura village recorded the maximum average change of 12 37 m followed by dharta and badgaon hinta varni region had the lowest groundwater change of 5 62 m even though the cropped area is highest in this village once the crop water use i e net storage change and head change were estimated the specific yield was estimated using eq 3 estimated specific yield values are shown in table 3 individual specific yield results indicate that the hinta varni village had the highest specific yield values 1 05 and 1 26 for 2012 13 and 2013 14 years respectively while sunderpura2 had the lowest values 7 32 and 4 47 for 2012 13 and 2013 14 years respectively this indicates that the specific yield values vary considerably possibly due to variations in geology and depth to water table furthermore with a decrease in water table depth there is a possibility of some layers not being active in groundwater flow closing of fractures and changes in dominant flowpaths and as such all these factors can change the specific yield values similar to previous studies the specific yield values in this study indicate the complexity and heterogeneity that exist in hardrock aquifers machiwal and jha 2014 maréchal et al 2006 it is to be noted that machiwal and jha machiwal and jha 2014 estimated the specific yield using double water table fluctuation method to be between 3 8 0 2 for a study area in the udaipur district while the current study result indicates an average specific yield of 2 with some spatial variations related to water table depth and groundwater use patterns 6 3 sensitivity analysis to remove any bias errors a sensitivity analysis was performed on the estimated specific yield sy values the sy values were estimated by increasing the variables in eq 3 individually by changing one at a time and keeping the other variables the same to understand which variable had more influence on the specific yield the variables were adjusted from 10 to 50 and the sy and change in sy was estimated the iwu irrigation water use had the most influence on the sy changing the values similarly by which it was changed while the village area a and change in head δhm also had a similar impact on sy the overall analysis thus indicated that the sy is sensitive to irrigation water use groundwater elevation change and area 6 4 statistical analysis the results showed that there was statistically significant variance in the sy between the village sites fcrit f and p value 0 05 indicating that the geophysical characteristics that influence the sy are different between villages the results also showed that there was no statistically significant variance in the sy between the two experimental years fcrit f and p value 0 05 indicating that the processes that influenced the sy did not change significantly between years therefore the results indicated that the sy varied spatially but not temporally 6 5 groundwater storage change the groundwater storage changes in volumetric units during the recharge and discharge season for the study villages are shown in fig 5 the hinta varni village had the highest groundwater storage change during the recharge season of 2 2 million cubic meter mcm per year while sunderpura2 village had the lowest of 0 3 mcm similarly the hinta varni village had the highest groundwater storage change of 2 1 mcm during the discharge season while sunderpura2 village had the lowest of 0 3 mcm the overall analysis indicates that the recharge volumes are approximately equal to the withdrawal volumes and hence the groundwater levels during the study period are on a stable trend this phenomenon is also noted in the groundwater trend in fig 3 wherein the groundwater levels return to pre monsoon levels indicating the recharge and discharge are occurring at a similar rate 6 6 groundwater management and citizen science water table monitoring provides important information about the groundwater situation in an area and how the aquifer system responds to pumping land use change and climatic variability for the monitoring to provide useful data for sustainable groundwater resource management it is important to have a reasonably distributed long term monitoring well network in a watershed little et al 2016 varua et al 2016 participatory monitoring involving farmers can complement existing government run monitoring programs and provide an effective and affordable tool for sustainable groundwater management participatory monitoring is basically citizen science and is a cross cutting concept which is increasingly becoming popular in natural science research and many other disciplines buytaert et al 2014 it is also known by crowd sourcing civic science community science and other terms and can involve community based data collection requesting contributions carrying out specific technical tasks with the help local citizen as demonstrated in the present study the participation of farmers schools and other community groups in the research design data collection and interpretation process together with researchers can be an important step forward in tackling the complexity of groundwater management in hardrock areas even though specific yield estimation methodology is not new the basis of this study is to use limited information i e a cost effective public participatory and citizen science approach alternative method to determine water balances in the absence of long term data citizen science is increasingly becoming an important part of formal scientific research in some topic areas where data are collected from a large geographical area when research budgets are limited and the involvement of local citizens is vital to improve a complex problematic situation baretto et al 2003 hand 2010 brossard et al 2005 this allows public participation of local citizens in scientific research and may take form of participatory monitoring and participatory action research the research is conducted in whole or in part by local citizens who have an interest in the local problem as performed in this study the citizen science may involve regular collection and analysis of data development and testing of technology and sharing of knowledge and understanding gained for improving the situation 7 limitations and future research it is noted that the assumption of equating irrigation water mostly estimated from pumped volumes is equal to the crop water requirement times the area could be higher or lower than the actual water applied to the crops however since the study did not have the data from pumping regimes the aforementioned assumption was made future studies should where possible incorporate measurements of actual pumped volume for irrigation while deriving the specific yield it is also understood that there could be a possibility of lateral groundwater flow flowing into and out of the villages which may not follow the topographic boundary or village boundary such groundwater flux boundary conditions for each village could be assessed by setting up monitoring wells along the boundary and will be a topic for future research however installation of new wells at the boundary was not done in the current study due to limitation in securing permissions to monitor observation wells and the fact that most monitored wells were those used by the farmers in each village since the land use and groundwater consumption was similar within and out of each village owing to the local agricultural patterns and small size of the villages it was assumed that any groundwater flux entering a village would be the same volume that exits the village boundary thus keeping the inflow and outflow balanced clustering of observation wells in villages could lead to disproportionate bearing on research findings however since our field investigations revealed that the land use and geologic setting were similar within each village results from the clustered wells were taken as representative results for each village future research can identify more wells in each village but given the small size of each village and the associated costs for installation and monitoring of new wells it is viewed that the results might not vary much within villages it is noted that the study aims to investigate hydrologic conditions with the present infrastructure and how knowledge can be improved with current monitoring stations flowmeters fixed to wells can relay actual pumped volumes however the farmers in the study villages were sensitive to the installations as they are concerned if they will be taxed per water use based on these new meters due to the difficulties in commissioning them in the study villages the study used irrigated water use iwu computations future studies wherever possible should validate the iwu computations with flowmeters to obtain better pumped volume results in addition future research should also investigate the potential of other methods e g micro gravimetric measurements howle et al 2003 gehman et al 2009 and conduct a comparison between different methods such an exercise will benefit land managers in choosing appropriate methods for site specific conditions 8 conclusions the current study used a combination of water balance and water table fluctuation methods to estimate regional specific yield in the dharta watershed a semi arid hardrock region in rajasthan a north western state of india the study indicated that it is possible to use local participatory monitoring of water table depths and estimated irrigation water use based on cropped areas to estimate reliable values of specific yield based on the results of this study the regional specific yield values varied between 1 4 with a slight variation between villages there were no significant variations in specific yield between study periods it is concluded that the combination of the water balance method and the water level fluctuation technique could be a valuable tool for estimating regional specific yield values in a semi arid hardrock watershed where data is scarce the method used in this study is affordable simplified and enables local participation the methodology can be used to obtain specific yield values for formulating groundwater management plans in hardrock regions and can be effectively up scaled to watershed block and district level analysis

introduction water scarcity has become more acute due to air temperature rise and erratic rainfall distribution thereby affecting agricultural production adversely farrea and faci 2008 zhao et al 2010 accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et from the cropped surfaces at various growth stages is critical for effective agricultural water management shi et al 2008 particularly under the climate change scenario ferrara et al 2010 a higher precision in the estimation of crop et etc may result in a reduction in the loss of water resources both in planning as well as in the management of crop gharsallah et al 2013 many approaches have been developed to measure and estimate the evapotranspiration based on observations theoretical and numerical analysis porporato et al 2004 soil water balance models swb are based on theoretical depictions of a finite portion of the water cycle campos et al 2016 and are helpful in the determination of irrigation scheduling of a crop moratiel et al 2016 the swb approach requires as input soil water depletion within the crop root zone rainfall drainage and irrigation allen et al 1998 a major advantage of this method is its applicability while estimating the water loss from a crop field wilson et al 2001 however the major disadvantage of swb method in estimating etc is that it does not consider canopy intercept into consideration and is typically only applicable for a smaller area wilson et al 2001 despite this it remains as a simple method for estimating total water loss from the soil by taking into account soil water evaporation e and transpiration t as major components comprehensive and periodic soil water monitoring are beneficial as they impart evaluation of soil water depletion independently comparable to et even in dry periods when irrigation precipitation and drainage are negligible the precision in soil water balance confides on space and time scales of actual measurement of soil water the time domain reflectometry tdr is a method that can be used to estimate et for irrigation management with the application of the tdr probes it is feasible to obtain a soil water balance at hourly and plot scales rana and katerji 2000 schelde et al 2011 topp et al 1994 as tdr method is capable of giving daily soil moisture content so instead of calculating the evapotranspiration for a 7 day week period the evapotranspiration was calculated on a daily basis thus the cumulative evapotranspiration obtained on a daily basis would yield more precise results in comparison to weekly period in which fluctuations corresponding to soil moisture would be more the process based single layer penman monteith pm irmak and muttibwa 2010 monteith et al 1965 is one of the most widely acceptable and used method for the evaluation of evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 2005 katerji and rana 2006 katerji et al 2011 gharsallah et al 2013 the pm method calculates etc without an intermedial computation for a reference surface rana and katerji 2008 2009 and is derived from the principles of energy conservation and air diffusion li et al 2014 the single layer pm method uses the aerodynamic resistance ra and canopy resistance rc with the stomatal conductance and the effective leaf area index allen et al 1998 however the pm model requires values of rc which is crop specific and varies with respect to microclimatic attributes of the boundary layer above the crop irmak and muttibwa 2010 rana and katerji 2009 the rc is a physiological as well as aerodynamic parameter in the et process and is a function water potential and meteorological variables alves et al 1998 alves and pereira 2000 lecina et al 2003 perrier 1975 many approaches have been developed to calculate rc using microclimatic variables and plant or soil water status as inputs ershadi et al 2015 irmak and muttibwa 2010 li et al 2014 stewart 1988 the etc estimated on the basis of soil moisture balance and meteorological variables are not so accurate since the error is high due to fluctuation in weather variables however in case of canopy resistance approach which relies on the leaf area index and stomatal conductance can help in estimation of etc with higher accuracy level gharsallah et al 2013 maize zea mays is a major crop after rice and wheat that can grow in different soils and climatic conditions however it is sensitive to water stress panda et al 2004 zhao et al 2010 the most critical growth stage of maize is flowering which affects its biomass grain yield and plant height farréa and faci 2008 pandey et al 2000 several studies have been conducted to assess the water requirement of maize djaman and irmak 2013 a and faci 2006 2008 the primary objective of this study was to compare four different canopy resistance rc approaches using the standard pm method to calculate etc for irrigated maize in a sub humid region the four approaches considered were a monteith monteith et al 1965 b katerji and perrier katerji and perrier 1983 c todorovic todorovic 1999 and d jarvis jarvis 1976 approaches these values of etc approaches were then compared on a daily basis with etc estimated using swb and measured soil water content variations the best approach to estimate the irrigated maize etc was selected on the basis of statistical analysis comparing the values estimated by different models and those obtained from the swb method 2 materials and methodology 2 1 experimental site two field experiments were conducted on irrigated maize at the experimental farm of department of agricultural and food engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur west bengal india 22 33 n latitude 87 33 e longitude and altitude 48 m in the year 2013 and 2014 srivastava et al 2017a 2017b the texture of the soil is sandy loam and classified as an alfisol halder et al 2016 2017 with a field capacity of 23 and a wilting point of 10 and an effective root depth of 0 6 m srivastava et al 2017a 2 2 meteorological conditions kharagpur climate is classified as sub humid with an average temperature range of 21 41 c with an average rainfall of 1200 1500 mm annually srivastava et al 2017a 2017b the weather data was recorded by an automated weather station located at the agriculture farm the daily and hourly recorded weather variables were air temperature hc2s3 model campbell scientific inc rainfall tipping bucket wind speed 05103 10 model campbell scientific inc solar irradiance cs300l model campbell scientific inc and relative humidity hc2s3 model campbell scientific inc other micrometeorological parameters such as vpd net irradiance were estimated using the measured weather data as method stated in allen et al 1998 the validation of relative humidity wind speed and air temperature data was done using a nearby observatory through double mass analysis todorovic 1999 fig 1 a and b shows the daily value of temperature maximum and minimum c and rainfall mm for the year 2013 and 2014 fig 2 a and b shows the daily value of vpd kpa and wind speed m s 1 which were found to be lower during the wet season and higher during the dry season for the year 2013 and 2014 respectively the net irradiance rn was calculated as suggested by allen et al 1994 1998 smith et al 1991 and todorovic 1999 further the accuracy of solar irradiance data was tested by solar irradiance envelope curve i e the maximum solar irradiance for a particular day todorovic 1999 the steady solar irradiance values below or above the curve were used for the estimation of likelihood occurrence of the improper functioning of the instrument during solar irradiance determination allen et al 1994 and allen 1996 proposed a method for the correction of solar irradiance eq 1 1 rso 0 75 2 10 5z ra where rso is the solar irradiance envelope curve ra extra terrestrial irradiance and z station elevation m the solar irradiance values calculated with the angstrom formula from the measured bright sunshine hours were below the solar irradiance envelope curve computed by eq 1 2 3 crop experimental details two field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 under irrigated condition for maize hybrid variety t 367 sown on 5th january and harvested after 90 days in an area of 1470 m2 the field experiment was a randomized split plot design 5 4 with three replicates and the seeds were sown at a depth of 5 cm with row to row space 30 cm and plant to plant space 20 cm on ridge fertilizer application rate was 100 50 50 n p k kg ha for the irrigated maize which was furrow irrigated irrigation scheduling was calculated on the basis of available soil water up to crop maturation for both the years fig 3 water table lied in the range of 3 55 m during spring to summer cgwb 2009 the measured amount of water was calculated by taking into account the soil water depletion level maintained up to 45 and subsequently the irrigation was done accordingly fig 3 a and b represent the diurnal variation of volumetric soil moisture and irrigation and rainfall inputs for maize crop for the year a 2013 and b 2014 the amount of irrigation mm provided was more in the year 2013 than 2014 due to the difference in the amount of observed rainfall mm 2 4 soil water and crop parameters measurement 2 4 1 daily soil water measurement several studies have reported time domain reflectometry tdr application in different environmental conditions for estimation of et e g mastrorilli et al 1998 srivastava et al 2017a topp et al 1994 daily soil water content was measured with a time domain reflectometry tdr trime imko gmbh germany imko 2000 by setting the instrument in a manual mode noborio 2001 srivastava et al 2017a ten access tubes were installed vertically up to a depth of 1 m in the center of each plot and the probe was inserted into access tubes at different depths 20 40 60 90 cm for measuring the soil water soil water was measured twice a day tdr was calibrated and validated by the gravimetric method by taking the soil samples near to the tdr probes for two wetting drying cycles 15 days for depths of 20 40 60 and 90 cm respectively fig 4 fig 4 a reveals that the volumetric soil water content measured by tdr closely follows the volumetric soil water content measured by gravimetric method srivastava et al 2017a fig 4 b indicate good relationship for soil moisture between tdr and gravimetric method the best fit 1 1 corroborates good matching between the values determined by both approaches fig 4b 2 4 2 crop parameter measurement crop growth stages were recorded after the germination of the crop the plant height leaf area index lai and above ground biomass were quantified by collecting sample observations at different stage of maize crop vegetative tasseling maturing and harvesting stages the leaf area meter acmas technocracy pvt ltd model no acm 52301 j was used to measure leaf area the lai was obtained by dividing the total leaf area of each plant by the soil surface available for each plant soler et al 2007 2 5 evapotranspiration estimation methods 2 5 1 water balance daily crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated using the swb equation and soil moisture measurements by tdr allen et al 1998 eq 2 2 etc r i δsm dp ro cr where etc is crop evapotranspiration δsm is the change of water content between two successive days and measured by tdr 17 62 2 5 i is the irrigation mm dp is deep percolation mm r is the rainfall mm ro is surface runoff flux mm and cr is capillary rise flux mm which was neglected due to shallow to deep water table depth 3 55 m and also due to no contribution from groundwater with capillary rise into the root zone ridolfi et al 2008 deep percolation was calculated twice a day on the basis of soil water at different growth stages hatiye et al 2016 because the soil moisture content data can only be collected at discrete depth intervals soil moisture storage in the root zone was considered at discrete depth intervals following the root growth hatiye et al 2016 2 5 2 the penman monteith pm model the pm combination model eq 3 allen et al 2005 howell et al 1997 monteith et al 1965 is expressed as follows 3 λ e t δ r n g ρ c p e c e a r a δ γ 1 r c r a where λet is the evapotranspiration w m 2 λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve kpa k l g is the soil heat flux w m 2 ρ is air density kg m 3 rn is the net irradiance w m 2 cp is the specific heat of moist air j kg 1 c l ec and ea are the saturated and actual vapor pressure of the air kpa respectively rc is the canopy resistance s m 1 and ra is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 the aerodynamic resistance ra was computed by the two models one proposed by monteith et al 1965 eq 4 and used in monteith and jarvis approach the other one developed by perrier 1975 eq 5 which was used for katerji perrier model gharsallah et al 2013 kashyap and panda 2001 katerji and rana 2006 katerji et al 2011 4 r a ln z d z 0 ln z d z o h k 2 u z 5 r a ln z d z 0 ln z d h c d u z k 2 where z is the reference height of measurement m zo is the roughness length governing the momentum transfer m zoh is the roughness length governing the heat and vapor transfer d is the zero plane displacement height m hc is the mean crop height m u z is the wind speed at height z m s 1 and k is the von karman s constant 2 5 2 1 estimation of rc using monteith approach canopy resistance rc is estimated from the ratio of the stomatal resistance rs and the effective leaf area laieff shown in eq 6 allen et al 1998 gharsallah et al 2013 howell et al 1997 6 r c r s 0 5 l a i during the study a value of 252 s m 1 for was used for rs as suggested by howell et al 1997 and validated by gharsallah et al 2013 for maize as effective lai strongly contributes to the vapor transfer and surface heat during the initial and developing stage of the crop the lai was used as effective lai while at mid and harvesting stage effective lai was estimated eq 6 allen et al 1998 gharsallah et al 2013 2 5 2 2 estimation of rc using katerji and perrier approach the kp approach has been applied to estimate et for different crops such as grass soybean alfalfa sunflower tomato and grain sorghum katerji et al 2011 rana and katerji 1997 2008 2009 rana et al 2001 but unfortunately this approach was not used for maize hence this study took kp approach into consideration to estimate crop evapotranspiration in irrigated maize katerji and perrier 1983 suggested a relationship of the canopy resistance rc and micrometeorological variables shi et al 2008 eq 7 shows a linear relationship between the canopy resistance rc and climatic resistance r 7 r c r a a r r a b where a and b are empirical dimensionless calibration coefficients which need experimental determination the critical resistance r s m 1 is defined as eq 8 8 r δ γ ρ d c p γ δ r n g this critical resistance r is associated to the isothermal resistance and is studied as a climatic resistance because it relies upon the weather variables katerji and rana 2006 rana et al 1997 in this study the parameters a and b were derived from the available data and calibrated validated by following the approach adopted by katerji and rana 2006 the calibration of the kp model was done using daily data which was estimated by choosing ten days from the experimental period the ra and r were estimated using eqs 7 and 10 respectively previous studies done by katerji and rana 2006 and katerji et al 2011 reported canopy resistance for different crops but this approach has not been used for the irrigated maize hence the study used kp approach of canopy resistance for calibration for the year 2013 and 2014 fig 5 the kp calibration parameters a and b values were 1 0 and 0 82 for the year 2013 and 0 95 and 0 82 for the year 2014 respectively the kp approach based on the calibration coefficients was derived using rc ra and r ra fig 5 fig 5 a and b shows the relation between rc ra and r ra for the maize crop similar results were reported by rana and katerji 2008 for sweet sorghum and reported in other studies such as katerji and rana 2006 rana and katerji 2008 the slopes intercepts and the correlation coefficients obtained by linear regression analysis varied for each year the correlation coefficients ranged between 0 96 for the year 2013 and 0 97 for the year 2014 during the model evaluation the calibration data were not used 2 5 2 3 estimation of canopy resistance using todorovic approach a mechanistic approach suggested by todorovic 1999 presumed that the contrast in the latent heat flux between the actual and potential et was a result of an additional sensible heat flux forced to heat the evaporating surface the canopy to support the extra energy needed to move the saturated air out of the canopy components shi et al 2008 and then proposed a quadratic equation eq 9 this quadratic equation had only one positive solution katerji et al 2011 shi et al 2008 9 a r c r i 2 b r c r i c 0 where ri is the climatologically resistance s m 1 calculated by eq 10 10 r i ρ c p e s e a γ r n g where a b c are calculated by eq 11 13 respectively 11 a δ γ r i r a δ γ r i r s e s e a 12 b γ r i r a γ e s e a δ δ γ 13 c δ γ γ e s e a δ δ γ this model was tested for two grasslands under semi arid conditions by lecina et al 2003 and shi et al 2008 for the mixed forest while steduto et al 2003 tested it for the cropped surface under optimal nutritional and water conditions however this approach could not describe its applicability for other vegetation types and climatic conditions shi et al 2008 one of the major advantages of the td approach is that it can be applied without any need of definitive calibration in comparison to the kp approach katerji et al 2011 2 5 2 4 estimation of rc using jarvis approach jarvis approach jarvis 1976 assumes that the canopy resistance rc depends on the soil water and also on the climatic factors eq 14 ershadi et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 14 r c r s l a i f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 where rs max is the maximum stomatal resistance equal to 5000 s m 1 chen and dudhia 2001 gharsallah et al 2013 and rs 252 s m 1 which was as per recommendation of howell et al 1997 and also suggested by gharsallah et al 2013 and rn is the net radation w m 2 f1 represents the photosynthetically active radiation eq 15 with f calculated from eq 16 as suggested by gharsallah et al 2013 15 f 1 r s r s m a x f 1 f 16 f 0

air temperature eq 18 ershadi et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 18 f 3 1 1 0016 298 t a 2 the factor f4 introduces the influence of soil moisture eq 19 19 f 4 1 i f θ θ t θ θ w i l t θ t θ w i l t i f

the critical soil water content at the field capacity 2 5 3 statistical evaluation comparisons were made using a linear regression among the estimated etc by four different approaches and soil water balance swb method slope of regression m regression coefficient r2 katerji et al 2011 for each method the roots mean square error rmse eq 20 the mean relative error mre eq 21 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 22 indices were computed using the following equations gharsallah et al 2013 20 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 21 m r e 1 n i 1 n x i y i y i 100 22 n s e 1 1 n x i y i 2 1 n y i y a v g 2 where xi is the estimated value obtained from different models and yi is the estimated value obtained from the soil water balance method 3 results and discussion 3 1 daily evapotranspiration estimated by swb method fig 6 a and b shows that the etc value was high during development 20 45 days and mid stage 50 75 days because of higher leaf area index and plant height table 1 there was a decrease in etc value when there was a progression in crop stage i e from mid to harvesting stage 75 90 days 3 2 estimation of etc using rc approaches fig 7 shows the daily evaluation of rc estimated by monteith katerji perrier todorovic and jarvis approach starting from emergence of the crop the averaged value of rc reported was 71 74 40 43 s m 1 during the year 2013 fig 7a and 71 86 47 62 s m 1 during the year 2014 fig 7b for the kp monteith todorovic and jarvis approaches respectively fig 7 a and b indicates monteith approach gave higher canopy resistance during emergence to vegetative stage in comparison to kp jarvis and todorovic approach because of fixed rs value gharsallah et al 2013 while during developing maturing and harvesting stages the effect of meteorological variables becomes almost constant because of which overlapping of rc can be seen for all the approaches fig 7 todorovic 1999 reported rc estimated by pm method showed high variance due to biases in the lysimeter and weather parameters measurements that are gathered into the rc term alves and pereira clearly explained the significance of kp approach in well watered crops for short periods of time when the weather does not change too much from day to day there was no significant variation in the values of rc under this condition moreover estimated rc shows regular parabolic tendency same tendency was observed by alves and pereira 2000 monteith 1995 todorovic 1999 gharsallah et al 2013 todorovic 1999 reported that the error in rc does not have a great influence on the error in etc 3 2 1 the monteith approach with pm model figs 8 a and 9 a showed that the et estimated using pm method with monteith rc approach is at par with the et estimated by swb but was underestimated during initial and development stage the pm model eq 3 using monteith approach eq 6 is based on effective leaf area index lai and stomatal resistance rs the stomatal resistance is taken as a constant as suggested by howell et al 1997 and validated by gharsallah et al 2013 for the irrigated maize effective leaf area was estimated as suggested by allen et al 1998 and farahani and bausch 1995 during the initial stage lai was lower 0 1 m2m 2 and 1 2 m2m 2 while at the mid stage it was found to be higher 4 6 m2m 2 gardiol et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 the pm et with monteith rc approach was seen to improve with an increase in the lai similar results were reported by several researchers that the et pm with monteith canopy resistance approach underestimated for the lower lai lai 1 5 while was seen to improve for the higher lai farahani and bausch 1995 howell et al 1997 irmak and mutiibwa 2010 3 2 2 the katerji perrier approach with pm model figs 8c and 9c shows that at the mid stage pm et using kp approach matched the swb et but at the initial and developing stages the model underestimated the values similar results were documented by gharsallah et al 2013 and li et al 2015 for the kp model in maize gharsallah et al 2013 also reported that kp approach provides scattered results in comparison to monteith and jarvis approaches for maize crop while li et al 2015 reported that the kp approach significance in dense crop instead of a sparse crop the possible reason for this underestimation might be due to the calibration coefficient a and b gharsallah et al 2013 apart from this major studies using kp approach for evapotranspiration were done for dense plants such as lecina et al 2003 for grass in a river valley for grasslands pauwels and samson 2006 and for mixed forest shi et al 2008 furthermore katerji and rana 2006 reported that kp model is only applicable for grass and tomato and not for tall crops such as soybean sunflower and sorghum 3 2 3 the todorovic approach with pm model figs 8c and 9c show that the todorovic approach closely follows evapotranspiration by swb method for the initial and developing stages but in the mid and harvesting stage it was overestimated the possible explanation for this overestimation is due to maximum vpd during the harvesting stage of the crop which is shown in fig 2 having maximum vpd 1 23 3 0 kpa during march to june similar results were reported by lecina et al 2003 pauwels and samson 2006 and shi et al 2008 which overestimated the crop evapotranspiration due to the effect of vapor pressure deficit vpd katerji et al 2011 reported that the canopy resistance rc linearly varies with the vpd hence this overestimation could be diminished with vpd and the sensitivity of the stomatal resistance of the crop in response to vpd 3 2 4 the jarvis approach with pm model figs 8d and 9d showed that the et estimated by pm model using jarvis approach gave the reliable values at the initial and developing stages but underestimated during the harvesting stage the possible explanation for this underestimation is due to the lai and soil evaporation gharsallah et al 2013 reported that the jarvis approach had no substantial effect on the et estimated by net radation rn vpd and θ daily variations stewart 1988 reported that the jarvis model underestimated by 14 and 11 against the et estimated by the eddy covariance in a pine forest li et al 2014 reported that the underestimation of the jarvis model can simulate the canopy resistance well in a dense canopy but the water transfer in the soil medium was not accounted li et al 2015 3 3 statistical evaluation the statistical evaluation of different approaches is shown in table 2 the ranking of the methods was based on mre rmse nse and r2 todorovic approach gave a r2 of 84 for the year 2013 and 85 for the year 2014 while the r2 values ranged between 81 and 86 for the year 2013 and 78 89 for the year 2014 in the case of jarvis katerji and perrier and monteith approaches the least mre 0 57 value was obtained for todorovic approach similarly the best rmse values of 0 33 and 0 43 mm day 1 were also obtained for the todorovic approach which made todorovic approach the best despite the jarvis approach which gave a rmse value of 0 35 mm day 1 one of the possible explanations for the above is the lower mre value 1 12 in case of jarvis approach which relinquished the significant effect of r2 0 89 and rmse 0 35 values giving an overall rank 2 ershadi et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 since the accuracy in terms of mre and nse values is higher in the case of todorovic approach therefore a rank of 1 is assigned to it the other two canopy resistance approaches namely monteith and katerji perrier gave a r2 of 81 and 86 respectively for the year 2013 and r2 ranged between 78 88 for the year 2014 the mre 2 24 and nse 0 81 values in the monteith approach gave it an overall rank of 4 while the mre 1 98 and nse 0 84 values in case of katerji and perrier approach suggested underestimation of crop evapotranspiration hence it was assigned a rank of 3 gharsallah et al 2013 crop growth stage wise evapotranspiration estimated by different approaches along with rainfall mm and irrigation mm is shown in table 3 for the maize crop table 3 shows evapotranspiration calculated by soil water balance method swb closely follow the et determined by todorovic approach followed by jarvis katerji perrier and monteith approaches respectively 4 conclusions four different canopy resistance approaches namely monteith jarvis todorovic and katerji perrier combined with penman monteith model were used to evaluate the significance of crop evapotranspiration in comparison to soil water balance method for irrigated maize in a sub humid and sub tropical region the stated approaches were compared on the basis of r2 and mre values out of the four approaches for both the years 2013 and 2014 todorovic was given first rank with an r2 and mre values of 0 84 0 85 and 0 57 1 11 jarvis second rank with an r2 and mre values of 0 83 0 89 and 1 12 to 1 70 kp third rank with an r2 and mre values of 0 86 0 88 and 1 98 to 2 05 monteith fourth rank with an r2 and mre values of 0 78 0 81 and 2 24 2 92 respectively despite of the higher r2 values the ranking was lower in the some of the approaches due to higher mre the results also stated that if the micrometeorological variables temperature wind speed vapor pressure deficit net radiation and relative humidity are available then the todorovic approach should be applied in a sub humid region on the contrary if the soil moisture lai and stomatal resistance are available then the jarvis approach should be taken into consideration for a sub humid and sub tropical region this study also suggests that canopy resistance model can be successfully used to predict the effect of climate change with increase in temperature on plant growth and water demand further investigation is needed to assess the impact of different environmental variables on rc having different environment conditions for different crops 
11511,the single layer penman monteith pm method is widely used method for the estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc the accuracy of etc estimate relies upon the quality of input weather data and capacity to approach adequately canopy rc and aerodynamic resistance ra in this study the pm method was used to estimate daily crop evapotranspiration of irrigated maize for the years 2013 and 2014 in a sub humid region four different approaches monteith katerji perrier todorovic and jarvis were used to estimate canopy resistance and then after crop evapotranspiration by pm equation were evaluated the comparison was made to daily crop evapotranspiration obtained from the soil water balance swb and soil water content variation measured by time domain reflectometry tdr the cumulative crop evapotranspiration of swb monteith katerji perrier todorovic and jarvis approach was respectively 260 4 266 8 252 8 263 4 256 mm for the year 2013 and 250 5 257 7 240 6 251 8 247 6 mm for the year 2014 the comparison of results and the statistical analysis confirmed that todorovic and jarvis approach gave reliable values while the katerji perrier approach could be used as an alternative method

introduction water scarcity has become more acute due to air temperature rise and erratic rainfall distribution thereby affecting agricultural production adversely farrea and faci 2008 zhao et al 2010 accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et from the cropped surfaces at various growth stages is critical for effective agricultural water management shi et al 2008 particularly under the climate change scenario ferrara et al 2010 a higher precision in the estimation of crop et etc may result in a reduction in the loss of water resources both in planning as well as in the management of crop gharsallah et al 2013 many approaches have been developed to measure and estimate the evapotranspiration based on observations theoretical and numerical analysis porporato et al 2004 soil water balance models swb are based on theoretical depictions of a finite portion of the water cycle campos et al 2016 and are helpful in the determination of irrigation scheduling of a crop moratiel et al 2016 the swb approach requires as input soil water depletion within the crop root zone rainfall drainage and irrigation allen et al 1998 a major advantage of this method is its applicability while estimating the water loss from a crop field wilson et al 2001 however the major disadvantage of swb method in estimating etc is that it does not consider canopy intercept into consideration and is typically only applicable for a smaller area wilson et al 2001 despite this it remains as a simple method for estimating total water loss from the soil by taking into account soil water evaporation e and transpiration t as major components comprehensive and periodic soil water monitoring are beneficial as they impart evaluation of soil water depletion independently comparable to et even in dry periods when irrigation precipitation and drainage are negligible the precision in soil water balance confides on space and time scales of actual measurement of soil water the time domain reflectometry tdr is a method that can be used to estimate et for irrigation management with the application of the tdr probes it is feasible to obtain a soil water balance at hourly and plot scales rana and katerji 2000 schelde et al 2011 topp et al 1994 as tdr method is capable of giving daily soil moisture content so instead of calculating the evapotranspiration for a 7 day week period the evapotranspiration was calculated on a daily basis thus the cumulative evapotranspiration obtained on a daily basis would yield more precise results in comparison to weekly period in which fluctuations corresponding to soil moisture would be more the process based single layer penman monteith pm irmak and muttibwa 2010 monteith et al 1965 is one of the most widely acceptable and used method for the evaluation of evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 2005 katerji and rana 2006 katerji et al 2011 gharsallah et al 2013 the pm method calculates etc without an intermedial computation for a reference surface rana and katerji 2008 2009 and is derived from the principles of energy conservation and air diffusion li et al 2014 the single layer pm method uses the aerodynamic resistance ra and canopy resistance rc with the stomatal conductance and the effective leaf area index allen et al 1998 however the pm model requires values of rc which is crop specific and varies with respect to microclimatic attributes of the boundary layer above the crop irmak and muttibwa 2010 rana and katerji 2009 the rc is a physiological as well as aerodynamic parameter in the et process and is a function water potential and meteorological variables alves et al 1998 alves and pereira 2000 lecina et al 2003 perrier 1975 many approaches have been developed to calculate rc using microclimatic variables and plant or soil water status as inputs ershadi et al 2015 irmak and muttibwa 2010 li et al 2014 stewart 1988 the etc estimated on the basis of soil moisture balance and meteorological variables are not so accurate since the error is high due to fluctuation in weather variables however in case of canopy resistance approach which relies on the leaf area index and stomatal conductance can help in estimation of etc with higher accuracy level gharsallah et al 2013 maize zea mays is a major crop after rice and wheat that can grow in different soils and climatic conditions however it is sensitive to water stress panda et al 2004 zhao et al 2010 the most critical growth stage of maize is flowering which affects its biomass grain yield and plant height farréa and faci 2008 pandey et al 2000 several studies have been conducted to assess the water requirement of maize djaman and irmak 2013 a and faci 2006 2008 the primary objective of this study was to compare four different canopy resistance rc approaches using the standard pm method to calculate etc for irrigated maize in a sub humid region the four approaches considered were a monteith monteith et al 1965 b katerji and perrier katerji and perrier 1983 c todorovic todorovic 1999 and d jarvis jarvis 1976 approaches these values of etc approaches were then compared on a daily basis with etc estimated using swb and measured soil water content variations the best approach to estimate the irrigated maize etc was selected on the basis of statistical analysis comparing the values estimated by different models and those obtained from the swb method 2 materials and methodology 2 1 experimental site two field experiments were conducted on irrigated maize at the experimental farm of department of agricultural and food engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur west bengal india 22 33 n latitude 87 33 e longitude and altitude 48 m in the year 2013 and 2014 srivastava et al 2017a 2017b the texture of the soil is sandy loam and classified as an alfisol halder et al 2016 2017 with a field capacity of 23 and a wilting point of 10 and an effective root depth of 0 6 m srivastava et al 2017a 2 2 meteorological conditions kharagpur climate is classified as sub humid with an average temperature range of 21 41 c with an average rainfall of 1200 1500 mm annually srivastava et al 2017a 2017b the weather data was recorded by an automated weather station located at the agriculture farm the daily and hourly recorded weather variables were air temperature hc2s3 model campbell scientific inc rainfall tipping bucket wind speed 05103 10 model campbell scientific inc solar irradiance cs300l model campbell scientific inc and relative humidity hc2s3 model campbell scientific inc other micrometeorological parameters such as vpd net irradiance were estimated using the measured weather data as method stated in allen et al 1998 the validation of relative humidity wind speed and air temperature data was done using a nearby observatory through double mass analysis todorovic 1999 fig 1 a and b shows the daily value of temperature maximum and minimum c and rainfall mm for the year 2013 and 2014 fig 2 a and b shows the daily value of vpd kpa and wind speed m s 1 which were found to be lower during the wet season and higher during the dry season for the year 2013 and 2014 respectively the net irradiance rn was calculated as suggested by allen et al 1994 1998 smith et al 1991 and todorovic 1999 further the accuracy of solar irradiance data was tested by solar irradiance envelope curve i e the maximum solar irradiance for a particular day todorovic 1999 the steady solar irradiance values below or above the curve were used for the estimation of likelihood occurrence of the improper functioning of the instrument during solar irradiance determination allen et al 1994 and allen 1996 proposed a method for the correction of solar irradiance eq 1 1 rso 0 75 2 10 5z ra where rso is the solar irradiance envelope curve ra extra terrestrial irradiance and z station elevation m the solar irradiance values calculated with the angstrom formula from the measured bright sunshine hours were below the solar irradiance envelope curve computed by eq 1 2 3 crop experimental details two field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 under irrigated condition for maize hybrid variety t 367 sown on 5th january and harvested after 90 days in an area of 1470 m2 the field experiment was a randomized split plot design 5 4 with three replicates and the seeds were sown at a depth of 5 cm with row to row space 30 cm and plant to plant space 20 cm on ridge fertilizer application rate was 100 50 50 n p k kg ha for the irrigated maize which was furrow irrigated irrigation scheduling was calculated on the basis of available soil water up to crop maturation for both the years fig 3 water table lied in the range of 3 55 m during spring to summer cgwb 2009 the measured amount of water was calculated by taking into account the soil water depletion level maintained up to 45 and subsequently the irrigation was done accordingly fig 3 a and b represent the diurnal variation of volumetric soil moisture and irrigation and rainfall inputs for maize crop for the year a 2013 and b 2014 the amount of irrigation mm provided was more in the year 2013 than 2014 due to the difference in the amount of observed rainfall mm 2 4 soil water and crop parameters measurement 2 4 1 daily soil water measurement several studies have reported time domain reflectometry tdr application in different environmental conditions for estimation of et e g mastrorilli et al 1998 srivastava et al 2017a topp et al 1994 daily soil water content was measured with a time domain reflectometry tdr trime imko gmbh germany imko 2000 by setting the instrument in a manual mode noborio 2001 srivastava et al 2017a ten access tubes were installed vertically up to a depth of 1 m in the center of each plot and the probe was inserted into access tubes at different depths 20 40 60 90 cm for measuring the soil water soil water was measured twice a day tdr was calibrated and validated by the gravimetric method by taking the soil samples near to the tdr probes for two wetting drying cycles 15 days for depths of 20 40 60 and 90 cm respectively fig 4 fig 4 a reveals that the volumetric soil water content measured by tdr closely follows the volumetric soil water content measured by gravimetric method srivastava et al 2017a fig 4 b indicate good relationship for soil moisture between tdr and gravimetric method the best fit 1 1 corroborates good matching between the values determined by both approaches fig 4b 2 4 2 crop parameter measurement crop growth stages were recorded after the germination of the crop the plant height leaf area index lai and above ground biomass were quantified by collecting sample observations at different stage of maize crop vegetative tasseling maturing and harvesting stages the leaf area meter acmas technocracy pvt ltd model no acm 52301 j was used to measure leaf area the lai was obtained by dividing the total leaf area of each plant by the soil surface available for each plant soler et al 2007 2 5 evapotranspiration estimation methods 2 5 1 water balance daily crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated using the swb equation and soil moisture measurements by tdr allen et al 1998 eq 2 2 etc r i δsm dp ro cr where etc is crop evapotranspiration δsm is the change of water content between two successive days and measured by tdr 17 62 2 5 i is the irrigation mm dp is deep percolation mm r is the rainfall mm ro is surface runoff flux mm and cr is capillary rise flux mm which was neglected due to shallow to deep water table depth 3 55 m and also due to no contribution from groundwater with capillary rise into the root zone ridolfi et al 2008 deep percolation was calculated twice a day on the basis of soil water at different growth stages hatiye et al 2016 because the soil moisture content data can only be collected at discrete depth intervals soil moisture storage in the root zone was considered at discrete depth intervals following the root growth hatiye et al 2016 2 5 2 the penman monteith pm model the pm combination model eq 3 allen et al 2005 howell et al 1997 monteith et al 1965 is expressed as follows 3 λ e t δ r n g ρ c p e c e a r a δ γ 1 r c r a where λet is the evapotranspiration w m 2 λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve kpa k l g is the soil heat flux w m 2 ρ is air density kg m 3 rn is the net irradiance w m 2 cp is the specific heat of moist air j kg 1 c l ec and ea are the saturated and actual vapor pressure of the air kpa respectively rc is the canopy resistance s m 1 and ra is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 the aerodynamic resistance ra was computed by the two models one proposed by monteith et al 1965 eq 4 and used in monteith and jarvis approach the other one developed by perrier 1975 eq 5 which was used for katerji perrier model gharsallah et al 2013 kashyap and panda 2001 katerji and rana 2006 katerji et al 2011 4 r a ln z d z 0 ln z d z o h k 2 u z 5 r a ln z d z 0 ln z d h c d u z k 2 where z is the reference height of measurement m zo is the roughness length governing the momentum transfer m zoh is the roughness length governing the heat and vapor transfer d is the zero plane displacement height m hc is the mean crop height m u z is the wind speed at height z m s 1 and k is the von karman s constant 2 5 2 1 estimation of rc using monteith approach canopy resistance rc is estimated from the ratio of the stomatal resistance rs and the effective leaf area laieff shown in eq 6 allen et al 1998 gharsallah et al 2013 howell et al 1997 6 r c r s 0 5 l a i during the study a value of 252 s m 1 for was used for rs as suggested by howell et al 1997 and validated by gharsallah et al 2013 for maize as effective lai strongly contributes to the vapor transfer and surface heat during the initial and developing stage of the crop the lai was used as effective lai while at mid and harvesting stage effective lai was estimated eq 6 allen et al 1998 gharsallah et al 2013 2 5 2 2 estimation of rc using katerji and perrier approach the kp approach has been applied to estimate et for different crops such as grass soybean alfalfa sunflower tomato and grain sorghum katerji et al 2011 rana and katerji 1997 2008 2009 rana et al 2001 but unfortunately this approach was not used for maize hence this study took kp approach into consideration to estimate crop evapotranspiration in irrigated maize katerji and perrier 1983 suggested a relationship of the canopy resistance rc and micrometeorological variables shi et al 2008 eq 7 shows a linear relationship between the canopy resistance rc and climatic resistance r 7 r c r a a r r a b where a and b are empirical dimensionless calibration coefficients which need experimental determination the critical resistance r s m 1 is defined as eq 8 8 r δ γ ρ d c p γ δ r n g this critical resistance r is associated to the isothermal resistance and is studied as a climatic resistance because it relies upon the weather variables katerji and rana 2006 rana et al 1997 in this study the parameters a and b were derived from the available data and calibrated validated by following the approach adopted by katerji and rana 2006 the calibration of the kp model was done using daily data which was estimated by choosing ten days from the experimental period the ra and r were estimated using eqs 7 and 10 respectively previous studies done by katerji and rana 2006 and katerji et al 2011 reported canopy resistance for different crops but this approach has not been used for the irrigated maize hence the study used kp approach of canopy resistance for calibration for the year 2013 and 2014 fig 5 the kp calibration parameters a and b values were 1 0 and 0 82 for the year 2013 and 0 95 and 0 82 for the year 2014 respectively the kp approach based on the calibration coefficients was derived using rc ra and r ra fig 5 fig 5 a and b shows the relation between rc ra and r ra for the maize crop similar results were reported by rana and katerji 2008 for sweet sorghum and reported in other studies such as katerji and rana 2006 rana and katerji 2008 the slopes intercepts and the correlation coefficients obtained by linear regression analysis varied for each year the correlation coefficients ranged between 0 96 for the year 2013 and 0 97 for the year 2014 during the model evaluation the calibration data were not used 2 5 2 3 estimation of canopy resistance using todorovic approach a mechanistic approach suggested by todorovic 1999 presumed that the contrast in the latent heat flux between the actual and potential et was a result of an additional sensible heat flux forced to heat the evaporating surface the canopy to support the extra energy needed to move the saturated air out of the canopy components shi et al 2008 and then proposed a quadratic equation eq 9 this quadratic equation had only one positive solution katerji et al 2011 shi et al 2008 9 a r c r i 2 b r c r i c 0 where ri is the climatologically resistance s m 1 calculated by eq 10 10 r i ρ c p e s e a γ r n g where a b c are calculated by eq 11 13 respectively 11 a δ γ r i r a δ γ r i r s e s e a 12 b γ r i r a γ e s e a δ δ γ 13 c δ γ γ e s e a δ δ γ this model was tested for two grasslands under semi arid conditions by lecina et al 2003 and shi et al 2008 for the mixed forest while steduto et al 2003 tested it for the cropped surface under optimal nutritional and water conditions however this approach could not describe its applicability for other vegetation types and climatic conditions shi et al 2008 one of the major advantages of the td approach is that it can be applied without any need of definitive calibration in comparison to the kp approach katerji et al 2011 2 5 2 4 estimation of rc using jarvis approach jarvis approach jarvis 1976 assumes that the canopy resistance rc depends on the soil water and also on the climatic factors eq 14 ershadi et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 14 r c r s l a i f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 where rs max is the maximum stomatal resistance equal to 5000 s m 1 chen and dudhia 2001 gharsallah et al 2013 and rs 252 s m 1 which was as per recommendation of howell et al 1997 and also suggested by gharsallah et al 2013 and rn is the net radation w m 2 f1 represents the photosynthetically active radiation eq 15 with f calculated from eq 16 as suggested by gharsallah et al 2013 15 f 1 r s r s m a x f 1 f 16 f 0 55 r n l a i f2 accounts for the dependence on the vapor pressure deficit eq 17 ershadi et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 li et al 2015 17 f 2 1 g e s e a the factor f3 introduces the influence of the air temperature eq 18 ershadi et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 18 f 3 1 1 0016 298 t a 2 the factor f4 introduces the influence of soil moisture eq 19 19 f 4 1 i f θ θ t θ θ w i l t θ t θ w i l t i f

al 2013 and ershadi et al 2015 which is taken as 0 0025 kpa 1 θ is the actual soil water content m3 m 3 ta is the air temperature k θwilt is the soil water content at wilting point m3 m 3 while θt is the critical soil water content at the field capacity 2 5 3 statistical evaluation comparisons were made using a linear regression among the estimated etc by four different approaches and soil water balance swb method slope of regression m regression coefficient r2 katerji et al 2011 for each method the roots mean square error rmse eq 20 the mean relative error mre eq 21 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 22 indices were computed using the following equations gharsallah et al 2013 20 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 21 m r e 1 n i 1 n x i y i y i 100 22 n s e 1 1 n x i y i 2 1 n y i y a v g 2 where xi is the estimated value obtained from different models and yi is the estimated value obtained from the soil water balance method 3 results and discussion 3 1 daily evapotranspiration estimated by swb method fig 6 a and b shows that the etc value was high during development 20 45 days and mid stage 50 75 days because of higher leaf area index and plant height table 1 there was a decrease in etc value when there was a progression in crop stage i e from mid to harvesting stage 75 90 days 3 2 estimation of etc using rc approaches fig 7 shows the daily evaluation of rc estimated by monteith katerji perrier todorovic and jarvis approach starting from emergence of the crop the averaged value of rc reported was 71 74 40 43 s m 1 during the year 2013 fig 7a and 71 86 47 62 s m 1 during the year 2014 fig 7b for the kp monteith todorovic and jarvis approaches respectively fig 7 a and b indicates monteith approach gave higher canopy resistance during emergence to vegetative stage in comparison to kp jarvis and todorovic approach because of fixed rs value gharsallah et al 2013 while during developing maturing and harvesting stages the effect of meteorological variables becomes almost constant because of which overlapping of rc can be seen for all the approaches fig 7 todorovic 1999 reported rc estimated by pm method showed high variance due to biases in the lysimeter and weather parameters measurements that are gathered into the rc term alves and pereira clearly explained the significance of kp approach in well watered crops for short periods of time when the weather does not change too much from day to day there was no significant variation in the values of rc under this condition moreover estimated rc shows regular parabolic tendency same tendency was observed by alves and pereira 2000 monteith 1995 todorovic 1999 gharsallah et al 2013 todorovic 1999 reported that the error in rc does not have a great influence on the error in etc 3 2 1 the monteith approach with pm model figs 8 a and 9 a showed that the et estimated using pm method with monteith rc approach is at par with the et estimated by swb but was underestimated during initial and development stage the pm model eq 3 using monteith approach eq 6 is based on effective leaf area index lai and stomatal resistance rs the stomatal resistance is taken as a constant as suggested by howell et al 1997 and validated by gharsallah et al 2013 for the irrigated maize effective leaf area was estimated as suggested by allen et al 1998 and farahani and bausch 1995 during the initial stage lai was lower 0 1 m2m 2 and 1 2 m2m 2 while at the mid stage it was found to be higher 4 6 m2m 2 gardiol et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 the pm et with monteith rc approach was seen to improve with an increase in the lai similar results were reported by several researchers that the et pm with monteith canopy resistance approach underestimated for the lower lai lai 1 5 while was seen to improve for the higher lai farahani and bausch 1995 howell et al 1997 irmak and mutiibwa 2010 3 2 2 the katerji perrier approach with pm model figs 8c and 9c shows that at the mid stage pm et using kp approach matched the swb et but at the initial and developing stages the model underestimated the values similar results were documented by gharsallah et al 2013 and li et al 2015 for the kp model in maize gharsallah et al 2013 also reported that kp approach provides scattered results in comparison to monteith and jarvis approaches for maize crop while li et al 2015 reported that the kp approach significance in dense crop instead of a sparse crop the possible reason for this underestimation might be due to the calibration coefficient a and b gharsallah et al 2013 apart from this major studies using kp approach for evapotranspiration were done for dense plants such as lecina et al 2003 for grass in a river valley for grasslands pauwels and samson 2006 and for mixed forest shi et al 2008 furthermore katerji and rana 2006 reported that kp model is only applicable for grass and tomato and not for tall crops such as soybean sunflower and sorghum 3 2 3 the todorovic approach with pm model figs 8c and 9c show that the todorovic approach closely follows evapotranspiration by swb method for the initial and developing stages but in the mid and harvesting stage it was overestimated the possible explanation for this overestimation is due to maximum vpd during the harvesting stage of the crop which is shown in fig 2 having maximum vpd 1 23 3 0 kpa during march to june similar results were reported by lecina et al 2003 pauwels and samson 2006 and shi et al 2008 which overestimated the crop evapotranspiration due to the effect of vapor pressure deficit vpd katerji et al 2011 reported that the canopy resistance rc linearly varies with the vpd hence this overestimation could be diminished with vpd and the sensitivity of the stomatal resistance of the crop in response to vpd 3 2 4 the jarvis approach with pm model figs 8d and 9d showed that the et estimated by pm model using jarvis approach gave the reliable values at the initial and developing stages but underestimated during the harvesting stage the possible explanation for this underestimation is due to the lai and soil evaporation gharsallah et al 2013 reported that the jarvis approach had no substantial effect on the et estimated by net radation rn vpd and θ daily variations stewart 1988 reported that the jarvis model underestimated by 14 and 11 against the et estimated by the eddy covariance in a pine forest li et al 2014 reported that the underestimation of the jarvis model can simulate the canopy resistance well in a dense canopy but the water transfer in the soil medium was not accounted li et al 2015 3 3 statistical evaluation the statistical evaluation of different approaches is shown in table 2 the ranking of the methods was based on mre rmse nse and r2 todorovic approach gave a r2 of 84 for the year 2013 and 85 for the year 2014 while the r2 values ranged between 81 and 86 for the year 2013 and 78 89 for the year 2014 in the case of jarvis katerji and perrier and monteith approaches the least mre 0 57 value was obtained for todorovic approach similarly the best rmse values of 0 33 and 0 43 mm day 1 were also obtained for the todorovic approach which made todorovic approach the best despite the jarvis approach which gave a rmse value of 0 35 mm day 1 one of the possible explanations for the above is the lower mre value 1 12 in case of jarvis approach which relinquished the significant effect of r2 0 89 and rmse 0 35 values giving an overall rank 2 ershadi et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 since the accuracy in terms of mre and nse values is higher in the case of todorovic approach therefore a rank of 1 is assigned to it the other two canopy resistance approaches namely monteith and katerji perrier gave a r2 of 81 and 86 respectively for the year 2013 and r2 ranged between 78 88 for the year 2014 the mre 2 24 and nse 0 81 values in the monteith approach gave it an overall rank of 4 while the mre 1 98 and nse 0 84 values in case of katerji and perrier approach suggested underestimation of crop evapotranspiration hence it was assigned a rank of 3 gharsallah et al 2013 crop growth stage wise evapotranspiration estimated by different approaches along with rainfall mm and irrigation mm is shown in table 3 for the maize crop table 3 shows evapotranspiration calculated by soil water balance method swb closely follow the et determined by todorovic approach followed by jarvis katerji perrier and monteith approaches respectively 4 conclusions four different canopy resistance approaches namely monteith jarvis todorovic and katerji perrier combined with penman monteith model were used to evaluate the significance of crop evapotranspiration in comparison to soil water balance method for irrigated maize in a sub humid and sub tropical region the stated approaches were compared on the basis of r2 and mre values out of the four approaches for both the years 2013 and 2014 todorovic was given first rank with an r2 and mre values of 0 84 0 85 and 0 57 1 11 jarvis second rank with an r2 and mre values of 0 83 0 89 and 1 12 to 1 70 kp third rank with an r2 and mre values of 0 86 0 88 and 1 98 to 2 05 monteith fourth rank with an r2 and mre values of 0 78 0 81 and 2 24 2 92 respectively despite of the higher r2 values the ranking was lower in the some of the approaches due to higher mre the results also stated that if the micrometeorological variables temperature wind speed vapor pressure deficit net radiation and relative humidity are available then the todorovic approach should be applied in a sub humid region on the contrary if the soil moisture lai and stomatal resistance are available then the jarvis approach should be taken into consideration for a sub humid and sub tropical region this study also suggests that canopy resistance model can be successfully used to predict the effect of climate change with increase in temperature on plant growth and water demand further investigation is needed to assess the impact of different environmental variables on rc having different environment conditions for different crops 
11512,in order to increase crop yield in semi arid and arid areas plastic film mulching pfm is widely used in northwestern china to date many studies have addressed the effects of pfm on soil physical and biochemical properties in rain fed agriculture in northwestern china but the findings of different studies are often contradictory therefore a comprehensive review of the impacts of pfm on soil water content soil nutrients and food production is needed we compiled the results of 1278 observations to evaluate the overall effects of pfm on soil water content the distribution of nitrate and soil organic carbon and crop yield in rain fed agriculture in northwestern china our results showed that pfm increased soil moisture and nitrate concentration in topsoils 0 20 cm by 12 9 and 28 2 respectively but slightly decreased 1 8 soil organic carbon soc content in the 0 10 cm soil layer pfm significantly increased grain yields by 43 1 with greatest effect in spring maize 79 4 when related to cumulative precipitation during the crop growing season yield increase from pfm was greatest 72 8 at 200 300 mm which was attributed to the large increase for spring maize and potato implying that crop zoning would be beneficial for pfm in this region when related to n application rate crop yields benefited most from pfm 80 2 at 200 300 kg ha a cost benefit analysis indicated that

differ for different crops or different climatic regions some studies have suggested that the mechanism for yield increase under pfm is an improvement in soil water and temperature conditions and an

increased soil water content by 9 0 across all soil layers fig 1 compared with traditional cultivation the effect decreased with increasing soil depth for example soil water content at 0 20 cm depth was increased by 12 9 more than twice of that at 80 100 cm depth 6 1 fig 1 3 2 effect of pfm on soil nitrate and soil organic carbon distribution overall pfm had no significant effect on soil nitrate at 0 100 cm soil depth fig 2 a however with pfm soil nitrate content was significantly increased by 28 2 in the 0 20 cm soil layer fig 2a the soil organic carbon soc contents of the 0 10 cm soil layer were slightly decreased 1 8 although changes in the light fraction organic carbon lfoc in surface soil 0 10 cm were not significant under pfm across all crops in northwestern china fig 2b however the lfoc contents in topsoils were significantly decreased for spring wheat and spring maize fig 2b 3 3 effect of pfm on grain yield 3 3 1 effect of pfm on grain yield and water use efficiency wue for different crops overall compared with traditional cultivation grain yield was significantly increased by 43 1 with pfm fig 3 a the yield increase in maize including spring maize 79 4 and summer maize 51 4 was greater than that of potato 43 4 and wheat 19 8 and 24 6 for winter wheat and spring wheat respectively fig 3a the average wue across all crops was significantly increased by 42 6 with pfm fig 3b with the highest increase in spring maize 76 followed by potato 40 2 winter wheat 21 9 and summer maize 18 9 fig 3b however the pfm had no significant effect on the wue of spring wheat fig 3b 3 3 2 effect of pfm on grain yield for different cumulative precipitation in the growing season the effect of the pfm on crop yield was significantly different under different rainfall conditions during growing season fig 4 the increase in crop yield was greatest 72 8 when cumulative rainfall in the growing season was in the range 200 300 mm fig 4 the yields were increased by 38 3 42 0 and 21 5 25 5 respectively when the cumulative rainfall was 300 mm and 200 mm fig 4 the yield of summer maize was significantly increased by 42 0 when the cumulative rainfall during the growing period was 400 mm whereas there was no significant effect of pfm when cumulative rainfall was 300 400 mm fig 5 a for spring maize pfm had a greater effect on grain yield for cumulative rainfall in the range 200 300 mm 109 4 than for other rainfall amounts fig 5a pfm increased spring wheat yield by 22 across all cumulative rainfall amounts with the highest increase 25 2 when cumulative rainfall was less 100 mm fig 5b for winter wheat greatest effect 23 1 was for cumulative rainfall of 200 300 mm fig 5b for potato a greater effect on yield under pfm was observed when cumulative rainfall was 200 300 mm 30 8 compared to 100 200 mm 21 9 fig 5c 3 3 3 effect of pfm on grain yield under different n application rates across all crops pfm enhanced crop yield at all n fertilizer application rates fig 6 with greatest effect at 200 300 kg ha 80 2 for n application rates 300 kg ha the effect of pfm on enhancing grain yield decreased dramatically fig 6 it is worth noting that pfm significantly increased crop yield at zero n input 23 3 fig 6 for summer maize the greatest impact of pfm on yield was 168 1 at a low n input 100 200 kg ha fig 7 a with no significant effect at n applications of 300 400 kg ha fig 7a noticeably summer maize yield was significantly reduced under pfm by 9 3 if there was no n input fig 7a for spring maize the greatest yield increase with pfm was 103 3 at n application rates of 200 300 kg ha the effect of pfm on grain yield was 82 2 76 9 and 46 8 at low n rates 100 200 kg ha 0 100 kg ha 0 kg ha and 25 20 2 at high n input 400 kg ha 300 400 kg ha fig 7a for spring wheat yield increase with pfm was similar 23 5 across the different n application rates fig 7b interestingly the effect of pfm on winter wheat yield became non significant at n rates of 0 100 kg ha fig 7b moreover the greatest yield increase with pfm was 49 1 at n application rates of 200 300 kg ha fig 7b the greatest yield effect of pfm for potato was 54 4 at n application rates of 200 300 kg ha fig 7c 3 4 effect of pfm on net economic benefit compared with traditional cultivation the average neb was significantly increased by 29 5 through pfm fig 8 the increased neb with pfm was greatest in spring maize 71 1 followed by summer maize 38 6 potato 33 0 and winter wheat 10 4 fig 8 for spring wheat there was no significant difference in neb between pfm and traditional cultivation fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content water is one of the most important driving factors of agricultural production hanjra and qureshi 2010 we found that pfm increased the soil water content significantly 12 9 for topsoils 0 20 cm compared with traditional cultivation as has also been reported by others li et al 2011 wang et al 2009 liu et al 2014 the pfm directly inhibits evaporation of water from the soil surface promotes water movement from deeper soil layers to the topsoil by vapor transfer and enhances the topsoil water content during critical stages of crop growth gan and siddique 2013 our results show that this enhancement in soil water content is not only for topsoils but for the 0 1 m soil layer fig 1 implying an improvement in soil water storage in the soil profile by pfm however there were too few data for soil layers below 1 m to include in the meta analysis a previous study showed that pfm might cause a soil water deficit in deep soil layers zhang et al 2011 meanwhile zhang et al 2007 showed that water reached deeper horizons under mulching resulting in 15 more deep percolation in a wet year thus any water deficit might be recharged during wet year the effect of pfm on deeper soil water content is still unclear and should be a focus of future studies 4 2 soil nitrate and carbon content the contents of nitrate soc and lfoc in soil are important indicators of soil fertility liu et al 2013 our study showed that pfm was effective in increasing the nitrate content 28 2 of topsoils 0 20 cm and slightly decreased nitrate content in deeper soil layers but not significantly fig 2 gao and li 2009 suggested that enhanced soil mineralization might be the main reason for an increased nitrate content in topsoils as a result of higher soil temperature and water content under pfm wilson and jefferies 1996 in our study it should be noted that soc decreased slightly in the 0 10 cm soil layer and that the decrease in lfoc content in topsoil was significant for spring maize and spring wheat under pfm fig 2 the amount of organic c in the soil is dependent upon the rate of organic matter decomposition and the amount of crop residue returned to the soil liang et al 2010 pfm likely enhances soil organic matter decomposition through increased water content and heat in the surface soil song et al 2002 enhancing soil microbial activity thus promoting microbial degradation of soil organic carbon pang and huang 2006 however liu et al 2014 note that the dynamics of soc floc can relate to the number of years that mulching has been practiced and that long term mulching may increase soc floc through an increase in root biomass 4 3 grain yield the northwest region is an important food production area in china our study showed that pfm significantly increased grain production by an average of 43 1 19 8 79 4 in northwestern china fig 3a our analysis confirmed findings of previous studies that pfm is an effective cultivation practice to improve food production in rain fed agricultural areas jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 this increase in yield was largely attributed to improved wue fig 3b and a more suitable soil environment for crop growth because pfm can improve the soil water content wang 1998 increase soil temperature enhance the activation of soil nutrients improve soil nutrient availability zhao et al 2002 zhou 1996 and shorten the growth period of crops holding water in the soil and increasing wue are key drivers for improved crop yield in areas where evaporation is larger than precipitation the water stress in arid and semiarid rain fed agriculture areas of northwestern china is not caused by a lack of total rainfall but by the irregular distribution of rainfall over time and the inefficient management of rainwater lin et al 2015 thus the positive effect of pfm on soil water content during water stress periods plays an important role in increasing crop yield which has been accepted as the primary mechanism of the yield enhancing effect of pfm for example many studies noted the largest increase in soil water content with pfm was during the early stage of the maize growing season which contributed to the improvement of maize production in loess plateau liu et al 2009 2013 zhang et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 however pfm increased the soil water content by only 9 on average which could not explain the 43 1 yield increase moreno and moreno 2008 found that pfm enhanced crop nitrogen use efficiency nue as well as soil water content wei et al 2015 showed that pfm significantly increased nue for wheat and maize and that nue was significantly and positively related to soil organic matter hence increased nue under pfm might be another reason for the increase in crop yield however some studies have pointed out that crop yield increases under pfm were based on the consumption of soil organic carbon which may have negative effects on the soil ecosystem and not be sustainable wilson and jefferies 1996 gao and li 2009 our analysis also showed a slight decrease in soc under pfm and an accumulation of nitrate in topsoils fig 2 which may be of importance regarding the ideal ratio of soil n and c therefore the n and c transformation processes play important roles in both crop yield response and agricultural sustainability and thus further studies to better quantify these processes are needed in the rain fed agriculture area of northwestern china the effects of pfm on yield differed for different crops with increases ranging from 19 8 to 79 4 fig 3a averaged across all studies we found that the yield increasing effect on spring maize 79 4 was significantly higher than for other crops on the one hand this may be attributed to the fact that maize as a c4 crop is more photosynthetically efficient long et al 2006 and more sensitive to water deficit on the other hand spring maize often suffers from drought and low temperature during the early stage of the growing season jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 and thus pfm could play an important role in early stage growth and subsequent increase in grain yield our analysis showed that cumulative rainfall over the crop growing season had significant effect on the crop yield increase observed under pfm and that the effects were different for different crops figs 4 and 5 a notable yield increase was observed 72 8 fig 4 for cumulative growing season rainfall of 200 300 mm which was attributed to the effects for spring maize and potato fig 5 the reason for the large yield effect for spring maize and potato was that the rainy season for the region coincided with the major crop growing period for these crops and pfm improved the soil water content and temperature during the early stages drought period zhang et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 the effect of pfm on summer maize yield was significantly enhanced when the rainfall during the growing period was 400 mm fig 5a summer maize grows during the summer period when temperature and evaporation are high but pfm may further increase temperature thus inhibiting crop growth under low rainfall li et al 2003 for spring wheat it seems that the effect of pfm on yield tended to decrease with increased rainfall the yield increased the largest by 25 5 when the rainfall was less than 100 mm fig 5b in part this is due to that the rainfall meets the demand of spring wheat is relatively low and it s sensitive to drought when rainfall is lower than 100 mm for winter wheat it s different with spring wheat which the rainfall of 200 300 mm showed the highest increase for grain yield fig 5b it s likely because that the winter wheat has longer growth period and the precipitation is mainly in the form of snow which caused the low utilization rate of precipitation in winter due to the uneven distribution of precipitation in northwestern china and the different impact for different crops crop zoning should be considered to match the rainfall and crop water requirement under pfm a recommended crop zoning under pfm from west to east on the loess plateau would be spring wheat potato spring maize winter wheat and summer maize in particular regions with cumulative rainfall 200 300 mm during may to september should grow potato or maize to achieve the largest increase of crop yield under pfm the effects of pfm on crop grain yield are also affected by n application rate fig 6 farmers often use excessive n fertilizer to pursue high yields and profits particularly in china ju et al 2009 however n losses to the environment can be substantial when the availability of soil n exceeds crop n demand cui et al 2013 and excessive fertilization can lead to declining production damage the natural environment and economic waste reeves 1997 our analysis showed that pfm resulted in the largest grain yield enhancement when the n application rate was 200 300 kg ha and there was no significant yield increase at n application rates of 300 400 kg ha for most of the crops included in this study therefore n application rates of 200 300 kg ha are recommended for high yields under pfm this result is consistent with zhang et al 2008 we speculate that n was no longer limiting was responsible for the large increase in grain yield liu et al 2014 our result showed that n application rates ranging from 200 to 300 kg ha nearly satisfied the maize potato n requirements chen et al 2011 showed that synchronizing the n supply with crop n demand is crucial to improving crop yields the n application rates are comparable to the rates recommended for high yielding maize in china 237 kg n ha on average chen et al 2011 however for summer maize and spring wheat the effect of the pfm on yield did not increase with increased n input implying that factors other than n input were more important in driving the increasing in crop yield under pfm interestingly we found that pfm can significantly increase crop yield by 23 3 at an n application rate of 0 kg ha fig 6 this may be explained by improved soil moisture but also through enhanced soil fertility pfm can improve the soil water content and temperature which may increase the soil microbial activities and enhance the soil mineralization rate wang et al 2006 thereby improving plant n uptake from the soil and subsequent crop yield even with zero fertilizer n input thus pfm may directly influence soil fertility when compared with traditional cultivation however it is important to consider potential environmental impacts of the n rates observed to give greatest yield increases under pfm few studies have addressed the potential impacts of nitrate accumulation in the soil profile under pfm system liu et al 2014 thus the appropriate recommended n application rate under pfm should be further studied taking account of crop yield and environmental effects 4 4 economic benefits by taking the costs of various agricultural inputs e g fertilizers and mechanical operations into consideration we conducted a preliminary assessment of the neb associated with the implementation of pfm although grain yields were significantly enhanced by pfm the input costs increased accordingly and neb differed for different crops although overall neb was significantly increased by 29 5 fig 9 for spring wheat was no significant increase zhang et al 2013 showed that wheat production was more likely related to the antecedent soil moisture before sowing which was influenced by the previous year s precipitation li et al 1999 found that pfm reduced spring wheat yield because of low antecedent soil moisture and severe nutrient depletion during the mulching period therefore careful consideration should be given to the implementation of pfm for spring wheat in northwestern china the impact of pfm on neb for spring maize was the greatest suggesting that northwestern china could be a maize belt if supported by widespread implementation of pfm as discussed above pfm can increase the nitrate content in the topsoil layer improve nue and contribute to the yield increase additionally it might reduce n leaching to deeper soil layers ruidisch et al 2013 but may increase n2o emissions li et al 2003 there are also potentially negative effects on soil quality through loss of soc however there were insufficient data available on potential environmental costs to include in the meta analysis for the neb and further studies on the environmental influence related to n losses and soil fertility are recommended in addition the pfm system showed serious non point source pollution caused by plastic film yan et al 2006 use of a biodegradable film or thick 0 01 mm film may be options to achieve economic benefit and minimise plastic film pollution fig 9 5 conclusions although pfm has been widely applied in arid and semiarid regions such as in northwestern china to increase the crop production the impacts of the pfm on crop yields and the underlying mechanisms are still under debate here we conducted a comprehensive meta analysis on the effects of the pfm on three major crops maize wheat and potato in northwest china to clarify the mechanisms underlying the changes in crop yields we further assessed how pfm influenced soil biochemical properties including soil water nitrate and soc lfoc and how pfm affected yields under different levels of precipitation and n application rate our study suggests that the pfm can significantly increase crop yields especially spring maize in northwestern china although the environmental costs of pfm are still unclear due to a lack of data some options such as using thick film 0 01 mm or biodegradable film to avoid non point source pollution may enable high neb our study provides evidence that pfm can be a key practice to increase crop productivity and achieve better economic and environmental benefits in the rain fed agriculture of northwestern china however the future studies are needed to fully quantify environmental costs economic befits and agricultural sustainability particularly relating to n and c transformation processes acknowledgments this study was funded by the natural science

11512,in order to increase crop yield in semi arid and arid areas plastic film mulching pfm is widely used in northwestern china to date many studies have addressed the effects of pfm on soil physical and biochemical properties in rain fed agriculture in northwestern china but the findings of different studies are often contradictory therefore a comprehensive review of the impacts of pfm on soil water content soil nutrients and food production is needed we compiled the results of 1278 observations to evaluate the overall effects of pfm on soil water content the distribution of nitrate and soil organic carbon and crop yield in rain fed agriculture in northwestern china our results showed that pfm increased soil moisture and nitrate concentration in topsoils 0 20 cm by 12 9 and 28 2 respectively but slightly decreased 1 8 soil organic carbon soc content in the 0 10 cm soil layer pfm significantly increased grain yields by 43 1 with greatest effect in spring maize 79 4 when related to cumulative precipitation during the crop growing season yield increase from pfm was greatest 72 8 at 200 300 mm which was attributed to the large increase for spring maize and potato implying that crop zoning would be beneficial for pfm in this region when related to n application rate crop yields benefited most from pfm 80 2 at 200 300 kg ha a cost benefit analysis indicated that pfm increased economic return by an average of 29 5 with the best improvement for spring maize 71 1 and no increase for spring wheat in conclusion pfm can significantly increase crop yield and economic return especially for spring maize in rain fed agriculture areas of northwestern china crop zoning is recommended for pfm to achieve the largest economic benefit however full account needs to

at 0 100 cm soil depth fig 2 a however with pfm soil nitrate content was significantly increased by 28 2 in the 0 20 cm soil layer fig 2a the soil organic carbon soc contents of the 0 10 cm soil layer were slightly decreased 1 8 although changes in the light fraction organic carbon lfoc in surface soil 0 10 cm were not significant under pfm across all crops in northwestern china fig 2b however the lfoc contents in topsoils were significantly decreased for spring wheat and spring maize fig 2b 3 3 effect of pfm on grain yield 3 3 1 effect of pfm on grain yield and water use efficiency wue for different crops overall compared with traditional cultivation grain yield was significantly increased by 43 1 with pfm fig 3 a the yield increase in maize including spring maize 79 4 and summer maize 51 4 was greater than that of potato 43 4 and wheat 19 8 and 24 6 for winter wheat and spring wheat respectively fig 3a the average wue across all crops was significantly increased by 42 6 with pfm fig 3b with the highest increase in spring maize 76 followed by potato 40 2 winter wheat 21 9 and summer maize 18 9 fig 3b however the pfm had no significant effect on the wue of spring wheat fig 3b 3 3 2 effect of pfm on grain yield for different cumulative precipitation in the growing season the effect of the pfm on crop yield was significantly different under different rainfall conditions during growing season fig 4 the increase in crop yield was greatest 72 8 when cumulative rainfall in the growing season was in the range 200 300 mm fig 4 the yields were increased by 38 3 42 0 and 21 5 25 5 respectively when the cumulative rainfall was 300 mm and 200 mm fig 4 the yield of summer maize was significantly increased by 42 0 when the cumulative rainfall during the growing period was 400 mm whereas there was no significant effect of pfm when cumulative rainfall was 300 400 mm fig 5 a for spring maize pfm had a greater effect on grain yield for cumulative rainfall in the range 200 300 mm 109 4 than for other rainfall amounts fig 5a pfm increased spring wheat yield by 22 across all cumulative rainfall amounts with the highest increase 25 2 when cumulative rainfall was less 100 mm fig 5b for winter wheat greatest effect 23 1 was for cumulative rainfall of 200 300 mm fig 5b for potato a greater effect on yield under pfm was observed when cumulative rainfall was 200 300 mm 30 8 compared to 100 200 mm 21 9 fig 5c 3 3 3 effect of pfm on grain yield under different n application rates across all crops pfm enhanced crop yield at all n fertilizer application rates fig 6 with greatest effect at 200 300 kg ha 80 2 for n application rates 300 kg ha the effect of pfm on enhancing grain yield decreased dramatically fig 6 it is worth noting that pfm significantly increased crop yield at zero n input 23 3 fig 6 for summer maize the greatest impact of pfm on yield was 168 1 at a low n input 100 200 kg ha fig 7 a with no significant effect at n applications of 300 400 kg ha fig 7a noticeably summer maize yield was significantly reduced under pfm by 9 3 if there was no n input fig 7a for spring maize the greatest yield increase with pfm was 103 3 at n application rates of 200 300 kg ha the effect of pfm on grain yield was 82 2 76 9 and 46 8 at low n rates 100 200 kg ha 0 100 kg ha 0 kg ha and 25 20 2 at high n input 400 kg ha 300 400 kg ha fig 7a for spring wheat yield increase with pfm was similar 23 5 across the different n application rates fig 7b interestingly the effect of pfm on winter wheat yield became non significant at n rates of 0 100 kg ha fig 7b moreover the greatest yield increase with pfm was 49 1 at n application rates of 200 300 kg ha fig 7b the greatest yield effect of pfm for potato was 54 4 at n application rates of 200 300 kg ha fig 7c 3 4 effect of pfm on net economic benefit compared with traditional cultivation the average neb was significantly increased by 29 5 through pfm fig 8 the increased neb with pfm was greatest in spring maize 71 1 followed by summer maize 38 6 potato 33 0 and winter wheat 10 4 fig 8 for spring wheat there was no significant difference in neb between pfm and traditional cultivation fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content water is one of the most important driving factors of agricultural production hanjra and qureshi 2010 we found that pfm increased the soil water content significantly 12 9 for topsoils 0 20 cm compared with traditional cultivation as has also been reported by others li et al 2011 wang et al 2009 liu et al 2014 the pfm directly inhibits evaporation of water from the soil surface promotes water movement from deeper soil layers to the topsoil by vapor transfer and enhances the topsoil water content during critical stages of crop growth gan and siddique 2013 our results show that this enhancement in soil water content is not only for topsoils but for the 0 1 m soil layer fig 1 implying an improvement in soil water storage in the soil profile by pfm however there were too few data for soil layers below 1 m to include in the meta analysis a previous study showed that pfm might cause a soil water deficit in deep soil layers zhang et al 2011 meanwhile zhang et al 2007 showed that water reached deeper horizons under mulching resulting in 15 more deep percolation in a wet year thus any water deficit might be recharged during wet year the effect of pfm on deeper soil water content is still unclear and should be a focus of future studies 4 2 soil nitrate and carbon content the contents of nitrate soc and lfoc in soil are important indicators of soil fertility liu et al 2013 our study showed that pfm was effective in increasing the nitrate content 28 2 of topsoils 0 20 cm and slightly decreased nitrate content in deeper soil layers but not significantly fig 2 gao and li 2009 suggested that enhanced soil mineralization might be the main reason for an increased nitrate content in topsoils as a result of higher soil temperature and water content under pfm wilson and jefferies 1996 in our study it should be noted that soc decreased slightly in the 0 10 cm soil layer and that the decrease in lfoc content in topsoil was significant for spring maize and spring wheat under pfm fig 2 the amount of organic c in the soil is dependent upon the rate of organic matter decomposition and the amount of crop residue returned to the soil liang et al 2010 pfm likely enhances soil organic matter decomposition through increased water content and heat in the surface soil song et al 2002 enhancing soil microbial activity thus promoting microbial degradation of soil organic carbon pang and huang 2006 however liu et al 2014 note that the dynamics of soc floc can relate to the number of years that mulching has been practiced and that long term mulching may increase soc floc through an increase in root biomass 4 3 grain yield the northwest region is an important food production area in china our study showed that pfm significantly increased grain production by an average of 43 1 19 8 79 4 in northwestern china fig 3a our analysis confirmed findings of previous studies that pfm is an effective cultivation practice to improve food production in rain fed agricultural areas jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 this increase in yield was largely attributed to improved wue fig 3b and a more suitable soil environment for crop growth because pfm can improve the soil water content wang 1998 increase soil temperature enhance the activation of soil nutrients improve soil nutrient availability zhao et al 2002 zhou 1996 and shorten the growth period of crops holding water in the soil and increasing wue are key drivers for improved crop yield in areas where evaporation is larger than precipitation the water stress in arid and semiarid rain fed agriculture areas of northwestern china is not caused by a lack of total rainfall but by the irregular distribution of rainfall over time and the inefficient management of rainwater lin et al 2015 thus the positive effect of pfm on soil water content during water stress periods plays an important role in increasing crop yield which has been accepted as the primary mechanism of the yield enhancing effect of pfm for example many studies noted the largest increase in soil water content with pfm was during the early stage of the maize growing season which contributed to the improvement of maize production in loess plateau liu et al 2009 2013 zhang et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 however pfm increased the soil water content by only 9 on average which could not explain the 43 1 yield increase moreno and moreno 2008 found that pfm enhanced crop nitrogen use efficiency nue as well as soil water content wei et al 2015 showed that pfm significantly increased nue for wheat and maize and that nue was significantly and positively related to soil organic matter hence increased nue under pfm might be another reason for the increase in crop yield however some studies have pointed out that crop yield increases under pfm were based on the consumption of soil organic carbon which may have negative effects on the soil ecosystem and not be sustainable wilson and jefferies 1996 gao and li 2009 our analysis also showed a slight decrease in soc under pfm and an accumulation of nitrate in topsoils fig 2 which may be of importance regarding the ideal ratio of soil n and c therefore the n and c transformation processes play important roles in both crop yield response and agricultural sustainability and thus further studies to better quantify these processes are needed in the rain fed agriculture area of northwestern china the effects of pfm on yield differed for different crops with increases ranging from 19 8 to 79 4 fig 3a averaged across all studies we found that the yield increasing effect on spring maize 79 4 was significantly higher than for other crops on the one hand this may be attributed to the fact that maize as a c4 crop is more photosynthetically efficient long et al 2006 and more sensitive to water deficit on the other hand spring maize often suffers from drought and low temperature during the early stage of the growing season jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 and thus pfm could play an important role in early stage growth and subsequent increase in grain yield our analysis showed that cumulative rainfall over the crop growing season had significant effect on the crop yield increase observed under pfm and that the effects were different for different crops figs 4 and 5 a notable yield increase was observed 72 8 fig 4 for cumulative growing season rainfall of 200 300 mm which was attributed to the effects for spring maize and potato fig 5 the reason for the large yield effect for spring maize and potato was that the rainy season for the region coincided with the major crop growing period for these crops and pfm improved the soil water content and temperature during the early stages drought period zhang et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 the effect of pfm on summer maize yield was significantly enhanced when the rainfall during the growing period was 400 mm fig 5a summer maize grows during the summer period when temperature and evaporation are high but pfm may further increase temperature thus inhibiting crop growth under low rainfall li et al 2003 for spring wheat it seems that the effect of pfm on yield tended to decrease with increased rainfall the yield increased the largest by 25 5 when the rainfall was less than 100 mm fig 5b in part this is due to that the rainfall meets the demand of spring wheat is relatively low and it s sensitive to drought when rainfall is lower than 100 mm for winter wheat it s different with spring wheat which the rainfall of 200 300 mm showed the highest increase for grain yield fig 5b it s likely because that the winter wheat has longer growth period and the precipitation is mainly in the form of snow which caused the low utilization rate of precipitation in winter due to the uneven distribution of precipitation in northwestern china and the different impact for different crops crop zoning should be considered to match the rainfall and crop water requirement under pfm a recommended crop zoning under pfm from west to east on the loess plateau would be spring wheat potato spring maize winter wheat and summer maize in particular regions with cumulative rainfall 200 300 mm during may to september should grow potato or maize to achieve the largest increase of crop yield under pfm the effects of pfm on crop grain yield are also affected by n application rate fig 6 farmers often use excessive n fertilizer to pursue high yields and profits particularly in china ju et al 2009 however n losses to the environment can be substantial when the availability of soil n exceeds crop n demand cui et al 2013 and excessive fertilization can lead to declining production damage the natural environment and economic waste reeves 1997 our analysis showed that pfm resulted in the largest grain yield enhancement when the n application rate was 200 300 kg ha and there was no significant yield increase at n application rates of 300 400 kg ha for most of the crops included in this study therefore n application rates of 200 300 kg ha are recommended for high yields under pfm this result is consistent with zhang et al 2008 we speculate that n was no longer limiting was responsible for the large increase in grain yield liu et al 2014 our result showed that n application rates ranging from 200 to 300 kg ha nearly satisfied the maize potato n requirements chen et al 2011 showed that synchronizing the n supply with crop n demand is crucial to improving crop yields the n application rates are comparable to the rates recommended for high yielding maize in china 237 kg n ha on average chen et al 2011 however for summer maize and spring wheat the effect of the pfm on yield did not increase with increased n input implying that factors other than n input were more important in driving the increasing in crop yield under pfm interestingly we found that pfm can significantly increase crop yield by 23 3 at an n application rate of 0 kg ha fig 6 this may be explained by improved soil moisture but also through enhanced soil fertility pfm can improve the soil water content and temperature which may increase the soil microbial activities and enhance the soil mineralization rate wang et al 2006 thereby improving plant n uptake from the soil and subsequent crop yield even with zero fertilizer n input thus pfm may directly influence soil fertility when compared with traditional cultivation however it is important to consider potential environmental impacts of the n rates observed to give greatest yield increases under pfm few studies have addressed the potential impacts of nitrate accumulation in the soil profile under pfm system liu et al 2014 thus the appropriate recommended n application rate under pfm should be further studied taking account of crop yield and environmental effects 4 4 economic benefits by taking the costs of various agricultural inputs e g fertilizers and mechanical operations into consideration we conducted a preliminary assessment of the neb associated with the implementation of pfm although grain yields were significantly enhanced by pfm the input costs increased accordingly and neb differed for different crops although overall neb was significantly increased by 29 5 fig 9 for spring wheat was no significant increase zhang et al 2013 showed that wheat production was more likely related to the antecedent soil moisture before sowing which was influenced by the previous year s precipitation li et al 1999 found that pfm reduced spring wheat yield because of low antecedent soil moisture and severe nutrient depletion during the mulching period therefore careful consideration should be given to the implementation of pfm for spring wheat in northwestern china the impact of pfm on neb for spring maize was the greatest suggesting that northwestern china could be a maize belt if supported by widespread implementation of pfm as discussed above pfm can increase the nitrate content in the topsoil layer improve nue and contribute to the yield increase additionally it might reduce n leaching to deeper soil layers ruidisch et al 2013 but may increase n2o emissions li et al 2003 there are also potentially negative effects on soil quality through loss of soc however there were insufficient data available on potential environmental costs to include in the meta analysis for the neb and further studies on the environmental influence related to n losses and soil fertility are recommended in addition the pfm system showed serious non point source pollution caused by plastic film yan et al 2006 use of a biodegradable film or thick 0 01 mm film may be options to achieve economic benefit and minimise plastic film pollution fig 9 5 conclusions although pfm has been widely applied in arid and semiarid regions such as in northwestern china to increase the crop production the impacts of the pfm on crop yields and the underlying mechanisms are still under debate here we conducted a comprehensive meta analysis on the effects of the pfm on three major crops maize wheat and potato in northwest china to clarify the mechanisms underlying the changes in crop yields we further assessed how pfm influenced soil biochemical properties including soil water nitrate and soc lfoc and how pfm affected yields under different levels of precipitation and n application rate our study suggests that the pfm can significantly increase crop yields especially spring maize in northwestern china although the environmental costs of pfm are still unclear due to a lack of data some options such as using thick film 0 01 mm or biodegradable film to avoid non point source pollution may enable high neb our study provides evidence that pfm can be a key practice to increase crop productivity and achieve better economic and environmental benefits in the rain fed agriculture of northwestern china however the future studies are needed to fully quantify environmental costs economic befits and agricultural sustainability particularly relating to n and c transformation processes acknowledgments this study was funded by the natural science

11513,the interactive effects of co2 concentration elevation n fertilization and reduced irrigation regimes on water and nitrogen use efficiency wue and nue of tomato solanum lycopersicum l plants at both leaf and whole plant scales were investigated in a split root pot experiment the plants were grown in two separate climate controlled greenhouse cells at atmospheric co2 of 400 a co2 and 800 e co2 ppm respectively in each cell plants were fertilized at either 1 5 or 3 g n per pot the leaf physiological parameters c and n content in stem leaf and fruit were determined and both wue and nue were evaluated plants harvested from 3 g n per pot associated with e co2 environment possessed the greatest photosynthetic rate pn and lowest stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr resulting in the highest wue at stomatal and leaf levels especially alternate partial root zone irrigation pri strategy coupled with e co2 had the potential to synergistically reduce gs and tr while sustain pn and leaf water status and further improve tomato leaf wue e co2 combined with sufficient n fertilization enhanced the biomass c accumulation and n uptake of plants under reduced irrigation yet the wue and nue at whole plant scale were affected solely by the n supply being greater in low n fertilizer these findings provide useful knowledge on efficient irrigation and n management for adapting to the future water limited and co2 enriched environment keywords co2 concentration nitrogen reduced irrigation water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration has been constantly increasing and is predicted to reach nearly 800 ppm at the end of this century ipcc 2013 the elevated co2 concentration e co2 in atmosphere could stimulate global warming induce severe declining freshwater resources in agricultural regions around the world pazzagli et al 2016 this has led to increased attention into the research of developing novel irrigation strategies for improved crop water use efficiency wue wang et al 2010a on the other hand e co2 could decrease mineral contents particularly nitrogen n in plants li et al 2016 mostly due to dilution effect and potentially exacerbate the prevalence of hidden hunger loladze 2002 myers et al 2014 therefore it is of great interest to understand the influences of reduced irrigation and limited n fertilizer on plant physiological response and nutrient status in e co2 condition which may provide further insights into the regulatory mechanisms of water and n availability as well as co2 environment effects on water and n use efficiency wue and nue of plants it is widely accepted that alternate partial root zone irrigation pri and deficit irrigation di are effective irrigation techniques which have been extensively studied throughout the world davies et al 2002 du et al 2015 di is a method that irrigates the entire root zone with an amount of water less than the potential evapotranspiration and the mild stress that develops minimal effects on the yield dodd 2009 pri is a further refinement of di which has been demonstrated to maintain crop product quality and allows considerable water savings the underlying mechanisms for the improved wue from leaf to plant scale under pri are to alternately allow one part of the root system to be irrigated to keep the leaves hydrated while the other part is exposed to soil drying triggering stronger root to shoot abscisic acid aba hormonal signaling inducing partial closure of stomata and reduction in leaf expansion growth thereby curtailing the transpirational water loss larger than photosynthesis davies et al 2002 kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 loveys et al 2000 wang et al 2010a wei et al 2016 in addition to enhancing crop wue recent studies have indicated that pri could improve n nutrition as well as nue as compared to di with the same degree of water saving hu et al 2009 shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2009 2010a b c 2012 2013 the greater accumulated n nutrient accompanied with modified dry matter and n allocation of the plant might have increased leaf photosynthetic capacity contributing to the higher wue in the pri plants wang et al 2009 2010a b c the improved plant n nutrition of pri treatment could be predominantly ascribed to an enhanced root n uptake capacity associated with an increased mineral n availability caused by the intensive drying and wetting cycles of the soil sun et al 2013a wang et al 2010a c 2012 previous evidence has demonstrated that e co2 could increase leaf photosynthetic rate pn but decrease stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2009 as well as modify the morphology of stomata haworth et al 2016 hereby maintaining a better leaf water status tausz posch et al 2015 wullschleger et al 2002 and resulting in an improvement of wue at leaf scale da silva et al 2017 li et al 2017 kang et al 2002 pazzagli et al 2016 yan et al 2017 the higher photosynthesis and lower stomatal aperture are predominantly induced by stronger rubisco activity and depolarization of guard cell membrane potential respectively ainsworth and rogers 2007 probably leading to declined leaf transpiration and plant water consumption therefore further enhancing wue of plant da silva et al 2017 kaminski et al 2014 pazzagli et al 2016 despite improving wue at both leaf and plant scale at e co2 there is generally a reduction in n concentration of plant partly having an impact on the leaf photosynthetic and carbohydrate metabolic process da silva et al 2017 li et al 2016 sanz sáez et al 2010 and such phenomenon has been proposed to attribute primarily to the dilution of n by increased biomass altered root architecture and physiology and changed requirement for n as protein cofactors or in other organic complexes as well as reduced root n uptake due to limited transpiration mass flow of plant resulting from partial stomatal closure taub and wang 2008 loladze 2002 mcgrath and lobell 2013 myers et al 2014 furthermore nue is commonly observed to enhance in plant harvested from e co2 environment resulted from the increased c and decreased n content in dry matter reddy et al 2010 nevertheless to date no studies are available to elucidate the mechanism and response of combined effects of n fertilization and reduced irrigation regimes on plant wue and nue under e co2 environment in this study tomato plants were grown in two atmospheric co2 concentrations 400 and 800 ppm combined with two n fertilizer rates 1 5 and 3 0 g pot 1 and subjected to three different irrigation regimes fi di and pri during flowering to fruiting stages it was hypothesized that both e co2 and reduced irrigation would improve wue from leaf to plant level simultaneously moreover e co2 would increase c and decrease n concentration whilst pri and greater n fertilization could improve plant nutrients uptake and may further enhance plant n nutrition and nue at e co2 the objective was to investigate whether the interactive effects of e co2 and reduced irrigation could synergistically improve wue at leaf and plant scales and nue simultaneously of tomato under increased n fertilization in a future drier and co2 enriched environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in a climate controlled greenhouse at the experimental farm of the faculty of science university of copenhagen taastrup denmark the tomato seeds solanum lycopersicum l cv elin were sown on 26th sept 2016 the seedlings were transplanted into 1 5 l pots at the fourth leaf stage from sowing half of the plants 24 were grown in a greenhouse cell with ambient co2 concentration of 400 ppm a co2 and another half were grown in a cell with elevated co2 concentration of 800 ppm e co2 in both greenhouse cells the co2 was sustained or achieved by emission of pure co2 from a bottled tank released in one point and distributed evenly in the cells through internal ventilation the co2 in the glasshouse cells was monitored every 6 s by a co2 transmitter series gmt220 vaisala group helsinki finland the

by sunlight plus led lamps five weeks after sowing tomato seedlings were transplanted into 10 l pots 17 cm diameter and 50 cm depth in the greenhouse filled with 14 5 kg of air dried soil the pots were divided vertically into two equal sized compartments with plastic sheets such that the water exchange between the two compartments was prevented the soil used was classified as sandy loam with a ph of 6 7 total c 10 3 g kg 1 total n 1 0 g kg 1 nh4 n 0 1 mg kg 1 no3 n 5 3 mg kg 1 the soil was sieved through 5 mm mesh before filling the pots the soil had a volumetric soil water content vol of 18 0 and 5 0 at pot water holding capacity and permanent wilting point respectively 0 7 g p and 0 88 g k fertilizers were applied as kh2po4 into the soil of each pot in each co2 greenhouse cell 1 5 g n was applied as nh4no3 per plant into half of the pots and 3 0 g n per plant was applied into the other half 2 2 treatments the experiment was conducted in two co2 concentration greenhouse cells one with ambient co2 concentration a co2 400 ppm and the other with elevated co2 concentration e co2 800 ppm two n fertilizer rates in each cell that is n1 1 5 g n pot 1 and n2 3 0 g n pot 1 the tomato plants were well watered in the first three weeks after transplanting thereafter the plants were subjected to three irrigation treatments 1 full irrigation fi where both soil compartments were watered daily at 15 00 h to water content of 18 to compensate the full evapotranspiration water loss during the previous day 2 alternative partial root zone irrigation pri where half of the root system was watered to 70 of the fi irrigation volume while the other half was allowed to dry to ca 6 then the irrigation was shifted between the two soil compartments and 3 deficit irrigation di where the same amount of water for pri was evenly irrigated to the two soil compartments the experiment was a complete randomized design with four replicates in each treatment the water used for the irrigation was tap water with negligible concentrations of nutrients the irrigation treatments lasted 40 days and each soil compartment of the pri plants had experienced five drying wetting cycles the average soil water content in the pot was monitored by a time domain reflectometer tdr trase soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara usa with probes 35 m in length installed in the middle of each soil compartment the changes of soil water content in the pots were presented elsewhere wei et al unpublished 2 3 measurements on days 1 4 8 12 16 24 28 and 40 after initiation of the irrigation treatment

trend in wuep as compared with fi across co2 and n treatments though the increase was not statistically significant n use efficiency nue was notably affected by n and n irri fig 7d table 2 plants grown at n1 had 34 06 higher nue than those grown at n2 treatment the e co2 plants showed a 4 77 enhanced trend in nue in relation to a co2 plants though the improvement was not statistically significant 4 discussion it is widely believed that reduced irrigation improves leaf wue by equivalent or slight decreased photosynthetic rate pn but significant declined stomatal conductance gs along with transpiration rate tr at leaf scale as compared with fi kang and zhang 2004 moreover pri plants normally bring about greater leaf wue than di plants due to the alternately stimulate the higher aba signaling of drying soil transported up to the leaf inducing stomatal closure and reducing transpiration rate while sustaining plant water relation and photosynthesis davies et al 2002 loveys et al 2000 wang et al 2010a in the present study this was clearly illustrated in fig 1a e table 1 where reduced irrigation especially pri strategy could enhance both leaf intrinsic and instantaneous wue wuei and wuen as a result of maintained pn coupled with lowered gs and tr in tomato leaf throughout the treatment period which was in good agreement with the earlier studies du et al 2006 liu et al 2006 wei et al 2016 additionally low n supply could limit leaf photosynthetic capacity and have an impact on the control of stomatal closure and plant growth bouranis et al 2014 here it was found that lower n n1 led to significantly decreased pn larger than gs and tr thereby resulting in reduced leaf wue when compared to higher n n2 applied fig 1a e table 1 it is well known that an enhancement in leaf pn accompanied with reduction in gs and tr are generally achieved by plants grown at e co2 da silva et al 2017 kang et al 2002 pazzagli et al 2016 the higher photosynthesis is driven by the acceleration of carboxylation and inhibition of oxygenation reaction through the modulation of rubisco activity at the chloroplast ainsworth and long 2005 while the reduction in stomatal aperture is mainly attributed to the increase in intercellular co2 concentration ci and depolarization in the guard cells ainsworth and rogers 2007 leading to declined leaf transpiration consistent with this here a remarkable increased leaf wue was found in plants grown under e co2 fig 1a e table 1 accordingly the results in this study explicitly demonstrated that in spite of the disparate mechanism of different treatment factor on modulation of leaf wue the reduced irrigation particularly pri combined with greater n fertilizer had the ability to synergistically improve wue at leaf scale under e co2 environment it has been reported that e co2 plants would conserve water and improve plant water relation resulted from decreased leaf gs wullschleger et al 2002 whereas reduced irrigation commonly induced lower leaf water potential ψl as compared to full irrigation dodd et al 2006 sun et al 2013b in good consensus with this in the current study plants grown in e co2 together with fi normally had enhanced ψl less negative than those grown in a co2 with reduced irrigation fig 2a table 1 here there was similar osmotic potential ψπ among all treatments fig 2b table 1 which may imply an equivalent solutes accumulation in the leaf cells furthermore irrespective of irrigation and n treatments a greater leaf turgor pressure ψp was noticed in the e co2 treated plants fig 2c table 1 in line with previous findings yan et al 2017 dry matter of stem sdm leaf ldm and fruit fdm as well as total above ground tdm was higher at e co2 than a co2 figs figure 3a c and figure 6a table 2 and fi plants commonly possessed greater ldm and tdm than the plants with reduced irrigation strategy figs figure 3b figure 6a table 2 meanwhile plants harvested from n1 had lower ldm fdm tdm and harvest index hi than those from n2 figs figure 3b c figure 6a and figure 7a table 2 consistently as mentioned previously either e co2 and or associated with high n supply could improve leaf photosynthetic capacity thereby motivating translocation of photosynthates into the fruit and further enhancing tdm of plants bénard et al 2009 li et al 2017 moretti et al 2010 moreover low n fertilization would have a strong influence on the magnitude of primary and secondary metabolites due to the source sink balance hypothesis bénard et al 2009 hence decreasing the allocation to fruit and reduce the hi of plant the results indicated increased n fertilization could enhance the allocation of biomass into fruit the e co2 environment has been suggested to result in lower plant water use pwu induced by the decline in leaf gs leakey et al 2009 nonetheless decreased gs could increase leaf temperature and conversely enhance the rates of leaf transpiration reddy et al 2010 on the other hand greater ldm of e co2 plants most probably coincided with larger leaf area thus promoting the transpiration of whole plant along with pwu fleisher et al 2008 li et al 2017 in addition the increased root system of plant at e co2 resulted from the improved fraction of assimilates allocated to roots enabled to exploit more water from surrounding soil ameliorating the water stress wullschleger et al 2002 thereby plants grown at e co2 might totally offset the effect of lowered gs and ultimately bring about an increase in transpiration at plant level in the present study pwu was equivalent between e co2 and a co2 treatment fig 7b table 2 which could be interpreted by the aforementioned findings moreover the significant lower pwu in n1 as compared with n2 plant fig 7b table 2 would be ascribed to the smaller leaf area of the plants in this study plants grown under n1 had remarkably higher plant wue wuep than those grown under n2 treatment fig 7c table 2 whilst accumulated evidence has shown that reduced irrigation particularly pri strategy has a predominant advantage on improving wue at plant level related to fi or di treatment due to the larger decrease in water consumption than plant production da silva et al 2017 kaminski et al 2014 pazzagli et al 2016 wang et al 2010a similarly here we found that irrespective of co2 and n treatments reduced irrigation presented an increased wuep trend as compared to fi although the increase was not statistically significant fig 7c table 2 as the same pwu was found in plants grown under e co2 and a co2 environment there was no notable enhancement in wuep of e co2 plants it is well documented that n status plays an important role in modulating c metabolism of plants as n is an essential ingredient for all of the enzymes involving in carbohydrate transport metabolism and utilization in the plants nunes nesi et al 2010 the relative lower plant matter and maintained photosysthesis in the reduced irrigation would account mainly for the greater c fixation and concentration in the plant wang et al 2010b this was clearly illustrated in fig 4a c table 2 where c concentration of stem and leaf scc and lcc was higher under n2 fertilization together with reduced irrigation despite having no effect on fruit c concentration most interestingly across irrigation strategy plants grown under e co2 and n2 treatment generally had greater c accumulation of fruit and total dry matter tc especially under n2 fertilization figs figure 3c figure 4c and figure 6b table 2 as a result of obvious increased dry matter in n2 treatment under e co2 environment indicating that e co2 along with sufficient n applied could be beneficial for c partitioning to fruit and attenuate the detrimental effect of water deficit on c accumulation in tomato plants as mentioned above adequate n supply could predominantly improve plant development and n nutrition in plants bénard et al 2009 here the greater n concentration of stem leaf and fruit snc lnc and fnc as well as plant total n uptake tn were found in n2 than n1 plants figs figure 5a c and figure 6c table 2 while reduced irrigation especially pri generally possessed higher lnc fnc and tn than fi treatment figs figure 5a c and figure 6c table 2 it has been suggested that pri induced spatially and temporally heterogeneous distribution of soil moisture could stimulate root growth improve nutrients availability in the soil and facilitate uptake of water and nutrients from the wetting soils wang et al 2012 moreover a decreased leaf gs and tr in pri plants might reduce the hydrostatic tension in xylem and enhance xylem connection to the fruit hence allowing more water and nutrients movement into the fruit davies et al 2000 sun et al 2013b besides e co2 environment had notably lower lnc and no influence on snc fnc and tnu figs figure 5a c and figure 6c table 2 it is well known that there is generally a reduction in n concentration of plants grown under e co2 which is mainly ascribed to the dilution of n in the greater biomass li et al 2016 loladze 2002 mcgrath and lobell 2013 myers et al 2014 nevertheless the increased dry matter and identical water use at e co2 as compared to a co2 condition would enhance n requirement from the root system and contribute to the no reduction in tn of e co2 plants therefore the reduced irrigation especially pri associated with sufficient n supply had the capacity to enhance plant n status simultaneously under e co2 environment the n use efficiency nue has been used as a long term indicator on availability of n utilization for c acquisition in plants wang et al 2010a grown in lower n condition would exacerbate the shortage of leaf n relative to c in plant stitt and krapp 1999 in accordance with this the present study observed that nue was greater in n1 than n2 fertilizer fig 7d table 2 additionally there was normally an improvement in nue under e co2 environment reddy et al 2010 however such response could be affected by diverse plant species growing and nutrients circumstance gifford et al 2000 here regardless of n and irrigation treatment the e co2 revealed an increasing tendency in nue as compared with a co2 plants despite the enhancement was not statistically significant fig 7d table 2 which was mostly resulted from the more improvement in uptake of c than n in the plants accompanied with the similar n uptake from a co2 to e co2 environment 5 conclusions conclusively e co2 coupled with higher n supply had the capacity to improve pn and reduce gs and tr resulting in the greatest wue at leaf level particularly plants grown under pri strategy associated with e co2 environment simultaneously possessed the lower gs and tr without decreased leaf water status and pn contributing to the enhanced wue of tomato leaf plants grown in e co2 combined with greater n fertilizer could increase the plant biomass c accumulation and n uptake under reduced irrigation regimes disregarding co2 environment both wue and nue at plant scale were only higher in low n fertilization these findings will be considerably conducive to guide fertilization and irrigation strategies to utilize water and n more efficiently in a future drier and co2 enriched environment acknowledgements this work was partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51725904 51439006 51621061 and

11513,the interactive effects of co2 concentration elevation n fertilization and reduced irrigation regimes on water and nitrogen use efficiency wue and nue of tomato solanum lycopersicum l plants at both leaf and whole plant scales were investigated in a split root pot experiment the plants were grown in two separate climate controlled greenhouse cells at atmospheric co2 of 400 a co2 and 800 e co2 ppm respectively in each cell plants were fertilized at either 1 5 or 3 g n per pot the leaf physiological parameters c and n content in stem leaf and fruit were determined and both wue and nue were evaluated plants harvested from 3 g n per pot associated with e co2 environment possessed the greatest photosynthetic rate pn and lowest stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr resulting in the highest wue at stomatal and leaf levels especially alternate partial root zone irrigation pri strategy coupled with e co2 had the potential to synergistically reduce gs and tr while sustain pn and leaf water status and further improve tomato leaf wue e co2 combined with sufficient n fertilization enhanced the biomass c accumulation and n uptake of plants under reduced irrigation yet the wue and nue at whole plant scale were affected solely by the n supply being greater in low n fertilizer these findings provide useful knowledge on efficient irrigation and n management for adapting to the future water limited and co2 enriched environment keywords co2 concentration nitrogen reduced irrigation water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration has been constantly increasing and is predicted to reach nearly 800 ppm at the end of this century ipcc 2013 the elevated co2 concentration e co2 in atmosphere could stimulate global warming induce severe declining freshwater resources in agricultural regions around the world pazzagli et al 2016 this has led to increased attention into the research of developing novel irrigation strategies for improved crop water use efficiency wue wang et al 2010a on the other hand e co2 could decrease mineral contents particularly nitrogen n in plants li et al 2016 mostly due to dilution effect and potentially exacerbate the prevalence of hidden hunger loladze 2002 myers et al 2014 therefore it is of great interest to understand the influences of reduced irrigation and limited n fertilizer on plant physiological response and nutrient status in e co2 condition which may provide further insights into the regulatory mechanisms of water and n availability as well as co2 environment effects on water and n use efficiency wue and nue of plants it is widely accepted that alternate partial root zone irrigation pri and deficit irrigation di are effective irrigation techniques which have been extensively studied throughout the world davies et al 2002 du et al 2015 di is a method that irrigates the entire root zone with an amount of water less than the potential evapotranspiration and the mild stress that develops minimal effects on the yield dodd 2009 pri is a further refinement of di which has been demonstrated to maintain crop product quality and allows considerable water savings the underlying mechanisms for the improved wue from leaf to plant scale under pri are to alternately allow one part of the root system to be irrigated to keep the leaves hydrated while the other part is exposed to soil drying triggering stronger root to shoot abscisic acid aba hormonal signaling inducing partial closure of stomata and reduction in leaf expansion growth thereby curtailing the transpirational water loss larger than photosynthesis davies et al 2002 kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 loveys et al 2000 wang et al 2010a wei et al 2016 in addition to enhancing crop wue recent studies have indicated that pri could improve n nutrition as well as nue as compared to di with the same degree of water saving hu et al 2009 shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2009 2010a b c 2012 2013 the greater accumulated n nutrient accompanied with modified dry matter and n allocation of the plant might have increased leaf photosynthetic capacity contributing to the higher wue in the pri plants wang et al 2009 2010a b c the improved plant n nutrition of pri treatment could be predominantly ascribed to an enhanced root n uptake capacity associated with an increased mineral n availability caused by the intensive drying and wetting cycles of the soil sun et al 2013a wang et al 2010a c 2012 previous evidence has demonstrated that e co2 could increase leaf photosynthetic rate pn but decrease stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2009 as well as modify the morphology of stomata haworth et al 2016 hereby maintaining a better leaf water status tausz posch et al 2015 wullschleger et al 2002 and resulting in an improvement of wue at leaf scale da silva et al 2017 li et al 2017 kang et al 2002 pazzagli et al 2016 yan et al 2017 the higher photosynthesis and lower stomatal aperture are predominantly induced by stronger rubisco activity and depolarization of guard cell membrane potential respectively ainsworth and rogers 2007 probably leading to declined leaf transpiration and plant water consumption therefore further enhancing wue of plant da silva et al 2017 kaminski et al 2014 pazzagli et al 2016 despite improving wue at both leaf and plant scale at e co2 there is generally a reduction in n concentration of plant partly having an impact on the leaf photosynthetic and carbohydrate metabolic process da silva et al 2017 li et al 2016 sanz sáez et al 2010 and such phenomenon has been proposed to attribute primarily to the dilution of n by increased biomass altered root architecture and physiology and changed requirement for n as protein cofactors or in other organic complexes as well as reduced root n uptake due to limited transpiration mass flow of plant resulting from partial stomatal closure taub and wang 2008 loladze 2002 mcgrath and lobell 2013 myers et al 2014 furthermore nue is commonly observed to enhance in plant harvested from e co2 environment resulted from the increased c and decreased n content in dry matter reddy et al 2010 nevertheless to date no studies are available to elucidate the mechanism and response of combined effects of n fertilization and reduced irrigation regimes on plant wue and nue under e co2 environment in this study tomato plants were grown in two atmospheric co2 concentrations 400 and 800 ppm combined with two n fertilizer rates 1 5 and 3 0 g pot 1 and subjected to three different irrigation regimes fi di and pri during flowering to fruiting stages it was hypothesized that both e co2 and reduced irrigation would improve wue from leaf to plant level simultaneously moreover e co2 would increase c and decrease n concentration whilst pri and greater n fertilization could improve plant nutrients uptake and may further enhance plant n nutrition and nue at e co2 the objective was to investigate whether the interactive effects of e co2 and reduced irrigation could synergistically improve wue at leaf and plant scales and nue simultaneously of tomato under increased n fertilization in a future drier and co2 enriched environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in a climate controlled greenhouse at the experimental farm of the faculty of science university of copenhagen taastrup denmark the tomato seeds solanum lycopersicum l cv elin were sown on 26th sept

18 0 and 5 0 at pot water holding capacity and permanent wilting point respectively 0 7 g p and 0 88 g k fertilizers were applied as kh2po4 into the soil of each pot in each co2 greenhouse cell 1 5 g n was applied as nh4no3 per plant into half of the pots and 3 0 g n per plant was applied into the other half 2 2 treatments the experiment was conducted in two co2 concentration greenhouse cells one with ambient co2 concentration a co2 400 ppm and the other with elevated co2 concentration e co2 800 ppm two n fertilizer rates in each cell that is n1 1 5 g n pot 1 and n2 3 0 g n pot 1 the tomato plants were well watered in the first three weeks after transplanting thereafter the plants were subjected to three irrigation treatments 1 full irrigation fi where both soil compartments were watered daily at 15 00 h to water content of 18 to compensate the full evapotranspiration water loss during the previous day 2 alternative partial root zone irrigation pri where half of the root system was watered to 70 of the fi irrigation volume while the other half was allowed to dry to ca 6 then the irrigation was shifted between the two soil compartments and 3 deficit irrigation di where the same amount of water for pri was evenly irrigated to the two soil compartments the experiment was a complete randomized design with four replicates in each treatment the water used for the irrigation was tap water with negligible concentrations of nutrients the irrigation treatments lasted 40 days and each soil compartment of the pri plants had experienced five drying wetting cycles the average soil

trend in wuep as compared with fi across co2 and n treatments though the increase was not statistically significant n use efficiency nue was notably affected by n and n irri fig 7d table 2 plants grown at n1 had 34 06 higher nue than those grown at n2 treatment the e co2 plants showed a 4 77 enhanced trend in nue in relation to a co2 plants though the improvement was not statistically significant 4 discussion it is widely believed that reduced irrigation improves leaf wue by equivalent or slight decreased photosynthetic rate pn but significant declined stomatal conductance gs along with transpiration rate tr at leaf scale as compared with fi kang and zhang 2004 moreover pri plants normally bring about greater leaf wue than di plants due to the alternately stimulate the higher aba signaling of drying soil transported up to the leaf inducing stomatal closure and reducing transpiration rate while sustaining plant water relation and photosynthesis davies et al 2002 loveys et al 2000 wang et al 2010a in the present study this was clearly illustrated in fig 1a e table 1 where reduced irrigation especially pri strategy could enhance both leaf intrinsic and instantaneous wue wuei and wuen as a result of maintained pn coupled with lowered gs and tr in tomato leaf throughout the treatment period which was in good agreement with the earlier studies du et al 2006 liu et al 2006 wei et al 2016 additionally low n supply could limit leaf photosynthetic capacity and have an impact on the control of stomatal closure and plant growth bouranis et al 2014 here it was found that lower n n1 led to significantly decreased pn larger than gs and tr thereby resulting in reduced leaf wue when compared to higher n n2 applied fig 1a e table 1 it is well known that an enhancement in leaf pn accompanied with reduction in gs and tr are generally achieved by plants grown at e co2 da silva et al 2017 kang et al 2002 pazzagli et al 2016 the higher photosynthesis is driven by the acceleration of carboxylation and inhibition of oxygenation reaction through the modulation of rubisco activity at the chloroplast ainsworth and long 2005 while the reduction in stomatal aperture is mainly attributed to the increase in intercellular co2 concentration ci and depolarization in the guard cells ainsworth and rogers 2007 leading to declined leaf transpiration consistent with this here a remarkable increased leaf wue was found in plants grown under e co2 fig 1a e table 1 accordingly the results in this study explicitly demonstrated that in spite of the disparate mechanism of different treatment factor on modulation of leaf wue the reduced irrigation particularly pri combined with greater n fertilizer had the ability to synergistically improve wue at leaf scale under e co2 environment it has been reported that e co2 plants would conserve water and improve plant water relation resulted from decreased leaf gs wullschleger et al 2002 whereas reduced irrigation commonly induced lower leaf water potential ψl as compared to full irrigation dodd et al 2006 sun et al 2013b in good consensus with this in the current study plants grown in e co2 together with fi normally had enhanced ψl less negative than those grown in a co2 with reduced irrigation fig 2a table 1 here there was similar osmotic potential ψπ among all treatments fig 2b table 1 which may imply an equivalent solutes accumulation in the leaf cells furthermore irrespective of irrigation and n treatments a greater leaf turgor pressure ψp was noticed in the e co2 treated plants fig 2c table 1 in line with previous findings yan et al 2017 dry matter of stem sdm leaf ldm and fruit fdm as well as total above ground tdm was higher at e co2 than a co2 figs figure 3a c and figure 6a table 2 and fi plants commonly possessed greater ldm and tdm than the plants with reduced irrigation strategy figs figure 3b figure 6a table 2 meanwhile plants harvested from n1 had lower ldm fdm tdm and harvest index hi than those from n2 figs figure 3b c figure 6a and figure 7a table 2 consistently as mentioned previously either e co2 and or associated with high n supply could improve leaf photosynthetic capacity thereby motivating translocation of photosynthates into the fruit and further enhancing tdm of plants bénard et al 2009 li et al 2017 moretti et al 2010 moreover low n fertilization would have a strong influence on the magnitude of primary and secondary metabolites due to the source sink balance hypothesis bénard et al 2009 hence decreasing the allocation to fruit and reduce the hi of plant the results indicated increased n fertilization could enhance the allocation of biomass into fruit the e co2 environment has been suggested to result in lower plant water use pwu induced by the decline in leaf gs leakey et al 2009 nonetheless decreased gs could increase leaf temperature and conversely enhance the rates of leaf transpiration reddy et al 2010 on the other hand greater ldm of e co2 plants most probably coincided with larger leaf area thus promoting the transpiration of whole plant along with pwu fleisher et al 2008 li et al 2017 in addition the increased root system of plant at e co2 resulted from the improved fraction of assimilates allocated to roots enabled to exploit more water from surrounding soil ameliorating the water stress wullschleger et al 2002 thereby plants grown at e co2 might totally offset the effect of lowered gs and ultimately bring about an increase in transpiration at plant level in the present study pwu was equivalent between e co2 and a co2 treatment fig 7b table 2 which could be interpreted by the aforementioned findings moreover the significant lower pwu in n1 as compared with n2 plant fig 7b table 2 would be ascribed to the smaller leaf area of the plants in this study plants grown under n1 had remarkably higher plant wue wuep than those grown under n2 treatment fig 7c table 2 whilst accumulated evidence has shown that reduced irrigation particularly pri strategy has a predominant advantage on improving wue at plant level related to fi or di treatment due to the larger decrease in water consumption than plant production da silva et al 2017 kaminski et al 2014 pazzagli et al 2016 wang et al 2010a similarly here we found that irrespective of co2 and n treatments reduced irrigation presented an increased wuep trend as compared to fi although the increase was not statistically significant fig 7c table 2 as the same pwu was found in plants grown under e co2 and a co2 environment there was no notable enhancement in wuep of e co2 plants it is well documented that n status plays an important role in modulating c metabolism of plants as n is an essential ingredient for all of the enzymes involving in carbohydrate transport metabolism and utilization in the plants nunes nesi et al 2010 the relative lower plant matter and maintained photosysthesis in the reduced irrigation would account mainly for the greater c fixation and concentration in the plant wang et al 2010b this was clearly illustrated in fig 4a c table 2 where c concentration of stem and leaf scc and lcc was higher under n2 fertilization together with reduced irrigation despite having no effect on fruit c concentration most interestingly across irrigation strategy plants grown under e co2 and n2 treatment generally had greater c accumulation of fruit and total dry matter tc especially under n2 fertilization figs figure 3c figure 4c and figure 6b table 2 as a result of obvious increased dry matter in n2 treatment under e co2 environment indicating that e co2 along with sufficient n applied could be beneficial for c partitioning to fruit and attenuate the detrimental effect of water deficit on c accumulation in tomato plants as mentioned above adequate n supply could predominantly improve plant development and n nutrition in plants bénard et al 2009 here the greater n concentration of stem leaf and fruit snc lnc and fnc as well as plant total n uptake tn were found in n2 than n1 plants figs figure 5a c and figure 6c table 2 while reduced irrigation especially pri generally possessed higher lnc fnc and tn than fi treatment figs figure 5a c and figure 6c table 2 it has been suggested that pri induced spatially and temporally heterogeneous distribution of soil moisture could stimulate root growth improve nutrients availability in the soil and facilitate uptake of water and nutrients from the wetting soils wang et al 2012 moreover a decreased leaf gs and tr in pri plants might reduce the hydrostatic tension in xylem and enhance xylem connection to the fruit hence allowing more water and nutrients movement into the fruit davies et al 2000 sun et al 2013b besides e co2 environment had notably lower lnc and no influence on snc fnc and tnu figs figure 5a c and figure 6c table 2 it is well known that there is generally a reduction in n concentration of plants grown under e co2 which is mainly ascribed to the dilution of n in the greater biomass li et al 2016 loladze 2002 mcgrath and lobell 2013 myers et al 2014 nevertheless the increased dry matter and identical water use at e co2 as compared to a co2 condition would enhance n requirement from the root system and contribute to the no reduction in tn of e co2 plants therefore the reduced irrigation especially pri associated with sufficient n supply had the capacity to enhance plant n status simultaneously under e co2 environment the n use efficiency nue has been used as a long term indicator on availability of n utilization for c acquisition in plants wang et al 2010a grown in lower n condition would exacerbate the shortage of leaf n relative to c in plant stitt and krapp 1999 in accordance with this the present study observed that nue was greater in n1 than n2 fertilizer fig 7d table 2 additionally there was normally an improvement in nue under e co2 environment reddy et al 2010 however such response could be affected by diverse plant species growing and nutrients circumstance gifford et al 2000 here regardless of n and irrigation treatment the e co2 revealed an increasing tendency in nue as compared with a co2 plants despite the enhancement was not statistically significant fig 7d table 2 which was mostly resulted from the more improvement in uptake of c than n in the plants accompanied with the similar n uptake from a co2 to e co2 environment 5 conclusions conclusively e co2 coupled with higher n supply had the capacity to improve pn and reduce gs and tr resulting in the greatest wue at leaf level particularly plants grown under pri strategy associated with e co2 environment simultaneously possessed the lower gs and tr without decreased leaf water status and pn contributing to the enhanced wue of tomato leaf plants grown in e co2 combined with greater n fertilizer could increase the plant biomass c accumulation and n uptake under reduced irrigation regimes disregarding co2 environment both wue and nue at plant scale were only higher in low n fertilization these findings will be considerably conducive to guide fertilization and irrigation strategies to utilize water and n more efficiently in a future drier and co2 enriched environment acknowledgements this work was partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51725904 51439006 51621061 and

corresponding author at water engineering dept faculty of agricultural sciences university of guilan iran water engineering dept faculty of agricultural sciences university of guilan iran the economic value of irrigation water is not considered as a highly affective criterion in water tariff system in iran to this end proper measures and viable scientific and management solutions are very important for the optimal use of this input this study aims to determine the economic value of irrigation water used in rice agriculture in guilan province for this purpose production functional forms were utilized in addition determining the marginal product and its value led us to achieve economic value of irrigation water for farms with different mechanization levels it is noted that the cross section data used in this study were derived from questionnaires in the production cost plan of iranian ministry of agriculture during 2013 2014 crop years generalized leontief functional form was selected as the favorable form for the farms with high mechanization level the economic value of irrigation water considered in these farms is 0 5108 m3 for the farms with low mechanization level translog functional form is chosen as the superior form whose final water economic value equals 0 5054 m3 reviews of the statistical difference between the two groups showed significant differences between the economic values of water considering water scarcity in iran and the existing difference between its tariff system and economic value it is recommended that the present tariff system be reformed and economic value of irrigation water be considered in the corresponding tariff system keywords translog function generalized leontief function econometric criteria marginal product 1 introduction in iran the ministry of energy announces irrigation water tariffs and communicates them to regional water companies the tariffs in the agricultural sector are determined by a definite and simple method to prioritize the plain types of irrigation system performances of agricultural products and their price efficiency of water production in developing countries such as iran is very inefficient compared with other developed countries and determined tariffs are handled based on financial considerations rather than economic considerations furthermore only minor amount of all financial costs of water supply is considered consequently the determined tariffs for water are too cheap therefore the value of water as a scarce source is not completely given priority thus farmers do not find any convincing incentive to economize water use for this reason water is considered as a free input among water users paying low irrigation water fee bills by farmers has only led to inefficient water allocations and frequent consumption of this scarce input in producing relatively high water requirement crops which are called non strategic crops sometimes sadeghi et al 2012 now in iran irrigation and drainage network of sefidroud supplies water requirement of about 180 thousand hectares of paddy fields in guilan province based on the facilities of each unit payable tariff concerning irrigation water in the territory covered by the network is estimated to be between 1 3 percent of the rice cultivation income in each year about 65 of farmers are not willing to pay more there are those who do not even pay their annual water costs the highest payable cost of water is specified to be less than 5 of the total input costs in a crop season therefore farmers need to become more aware of the actual value of water determination of water tariff encourages farmers to save water intelligently resulting in improving water productivity mitigating environmental degradation funding a part of repair and maintenance costs and finally maintaining the rights of future generations tahamipour et al 2015 in the asian humid tropics it is too early to apply water pricing because there is seldom a right concept of water or any practical organization of water management in this region it is important to facilitate the establishment of sound management organizations of irrigation water before introducing a strict water pricing mechanism to levy the charge fujimoto and tomosho 2003 there are a number of studies on water economic valuation in agriculture such as those of he et al 2004 abernethy 2000 and tahamipour et al 2015 singh 2007 and al karablieh et al 2012 proposed that the existence of water subsidies is a sure factor in the low level of water productivity and the concealment of water value as a rare input from the eyes of farmers and the possibility of using more than required for this valuable input singh 2007 reported that there is a big gap between supply cost as water price and economic value of water therefore in this study irrigation water pricing is determined by the production function method chowdhury 2005 khajeh roshanayi et al 2010 and sadeghi et al 2012 measured the economic values of irrigation water in bangladesh iran and pakistan respectively in this regard ehsani et al 2012 chowdhury 2005 and khajeh roshanayi et al 2010 used the production function method to determine the economic value of irrigation water khajeh roshanayi et al 2010 calculated the economic value of water for wheat as 0 5 m3 cheng et al 2016 emphasized that the amount of water affects the rice yield and they conducted a study in jilin province china they used five common production functions and the water sensitivity index of each model was calculated based on the evapotranspiration and yield comparison of the calculated results with observed data showed that jensen model is the most suitable production function for this region ashfaq et al 2005 in pakistan calculated the economic value of water for different crops the economic value of irrigation water for rice was 0 01 m3 in india ashfaq et al 2005 0 002 0 015 m3 in bengladesh chowdhury 2005 and the average tariff of water was 124 per hectare for a 4 year study in nigeria abernethy 2000 michael et al 2014 used the relationship between the yield of rice and water consumption to reformulate and establish a new policy in water consumption in tanzania they found that an increase of 6 in water consumption made an increase of 10 in yield furthermore the coefficient of water price was negative meaning that an increase of 1 of the water price reduces the water demand by 0 03 therefore we can conclude that pricing is an important factor in reducing water consumption for irrigated crops the proposed solution of this study is improving the irrigation efficiency using modern management practices and irrigation methods literature reviews show the dependence of agricultural production on irrigation water lack of water necessitates the efficient and judicious use of this input research into economics and economic valuation of water can provide optimum allocation of water to agricultural production and the factor in preventing water loss in order to optimize the allocation of irrigation water residual entropy production function and linear optimization methods were used for the valuation of irrigation water in parametric method parameters estimation is based on the assumption of linearity model parameters as a result when this assumption is not correct fitted surface response cannot be a precise function based on input and output variables of the system in those situations where there is uncertainty over the non linear model parameters the non parametric optimization function is proposed where both the mean and variance are assumed unknown in this method in the present study for the first time the amount of irrigation water per hectare was estimated using the water yield function derived from davatgar 2010 and it was considered in the production function furthermore this research was carried out on a large scale aiming to estimate the economic value of irrigation water in rice production the best production function was selected using the parametric methods and was compared with other functions to estimate the value of irrigation in the farm with different levels of mechanization a grouping of fields has been done to evaluate the impact of production technology on the economic value of water in this study the priorities with respect to the allocation of limited water stored in sefidroud dam have been determined this has been done to achieve higher productivity per water unit and prevent water loss as a valuable input the volume of water allocated to guilan province is declining constantly due to increasing water demands in the upstream section and it has been reduced from 4000 to 850 million cubic meters according to the new policy of the government increasing the price of water is a correct policy and an effective step to reduce the gap between the economic value of irrigation water and payable tariff of irrigation and this effective measure should be taken with caution along with considering other aspects this research has attempted to clarify the importance of water use in the agricultural section of guilan province compared with similar studies done in the rival provinces in the upstream section of sefidroud river the results of this study can be helpful for planners and policy makers concerning the appropriate allocation of water resources in the watershed of sefidroud river 2 materials and methods estimating the value of water as a production input was done using two methods parametric and non parametric methods the production function method is a parametric method which is commonly used for determining the economic value of irrigation water linear programming is one of the most popular non parametric methods used to determine the economic value of water decaluwe et al 1999 in this study the production function method is preferred for estimating the economic value of irrigation water because the used data is cross sectional and there were no significant changes in the price of inputs and the product during this study production function is a technical relationship between the factors of production and the product value while assuming that other conditions are constant in this method the production function in which water is used as independent variables is estimated and the marginal value of water is determined as its economic value debertin 1997 1 y y x 1 x 2 x n 1 w a t 2 v m p w a t p y m p w a t p y y w a t where y and w at represent the production and water consumption respectively x1 to xn 1 are the other production inputs py is the output price mpwater is the marginal product of irrigation water and vmpwater is the value of marginal product of irrigation water or its economic value regarding relations 1 and 2 it is clear that the obtained value is a function of the marginal product and the marginal product is derived from the production function thus the initial production function is effective in determining the economic value and any change in the initial production function changes the estimated parameters in the final production and the economic value calculated for the input with this description in mind accuracy in the process of selecting the correct functional form is an important step to determine the economic values of each input in this study flexible and inflexible functional forms are fitted and compared by eviews econometric software to select the superior one through inflexible functions the cobb douglas and the transcendental functions were fitted through flexible functions the generalized quadratic the translog and the generalized leontief forms were fitted for the determination of irrigation water s economic value variables in the mentioned functional forms include production quantity y consumption of irrigation water in cubic meter w labor in a day work l cost of machinery m pesticides consumption in liter p and fertilizers consumption in kg f seed consumption in kg s and α and β as the regression coefficients the reason for choosing these inputs is their importance for rice production in the study area because the most important task in defining an empirical model is determining the factors or inputs that are included as independent variables into the model of production consumed water using a quadratic relationship between the yield and irrigation water was calculated as follows 3 y 0 0095 x 2 14 551 x 1136 where y is the yield in kg ha and x is irrigation water in millimeters in eq 3 water consumption was calculated in the two groups of farms using the eq 3 because there is no precise device for measuring the amount of irrigation water in each farm this equation mentioned in davatgar 2010 which aimed to determine the correlation between irrigation water consumption and yield rate of hashemi variety of rice the functional forms in this research are as follows 1 cobb douglas functional form the cobb douglas type of production function has been estimated by agricultural economists for virtually any production process involving the transformation of inputs into outputs in an agricultural setting economists have used a cobb douglas type of specification for virtually every conceivable type of production process to review specific applications of the cobb douglas type of function would be to review a large share of the literature in which empirical attempts have been made to estimate production functions this function has the characteristics of necessity homogeneity uniformity concavity continuity derivability non negative and non nullity but the cobb douglas could represent only one stage of production at a time

but its value depends only on the amount of consumption of the input another desirable characteristic of this function is that the elasticity are not fixed to the scale but depends on the amount of inputs the transcendental function is a modified form of the cobb douglas function with the difference that it can show the unstable final output and the negative output marginal product of the final production in each of the three production regions halter et al 1957 transcendental functional form can be specified as in eq 6 halter et al 1957 6 y α 0 w α w a t l α l a b m α m a c f α f e r p α p

features of the neoclassical function except the condition of necessity the first derivative does not have a sign limitation and shows three production regions in this function if all inputs would be

test of residuals jb statistics to detect heterogeneity of variance and glejser test are reported in tables 2 and 5 in this study cross sectional data derived from the questionnaires of production cost plan in the crop years of 2013 2014 were used which were prepared by the ministry of agriculture the study was conducted with 373 questionnaires for paddy fields in this study classification of farms is done based on the ratio of machinery cost to the labor force cost per hectare hence they are divided into high mechanization level and low mechanization level groups with 186 farms in the former group and 187 farms in the latter one this division was made with the assumption that the economic values of production inputs are different in various production technologies t test was used with spss 21 software to check the accuracy of the grouping and the existence of a statistical difference between the two groups of farms it is obvious that there is meaningful difference between two mentioned groups according to results there is an average difference of 1259 units between all farms of the high mechanization level group and the low mechanization level group 3 results and discussion 3 1 category results of high level of mechanization the average grain yield in paddy fields with the high level of mechanization was 3772 kg ha among different inputs water and pesticide consumptions had the lowest and the highest variations respectively the seed consumption ranged from 40 to 133 kg ha and the average of day labor was 54 labor day ha in different rice cultivation stages the lowest and highest fertilizer consumptions were 100 and 454 54 kg ha respectively the cost of machinery was calculated as 411 621 ha in average the results are presented in table 1 in order to select the superior form of production function cobb douglas transcendental generalized quadratic translog and generalized leontief functional forms were fitted the results are presented in table 2 in the next stage based on explicit criterion having meaningful ratio and considering the conditions of classical regression the superior functional form of production was selected given the calculated amount of jb the assumption of normality of components was rejected in the form of cobb douglas and transcendental functions therefore the two mentioned forms were excluded in the second stage the three remaining flexible form factors were compared based on the coefficient of determination and the ratio of meaningful coefficients accordingly the generalized leontief form was chosen as the superior functional form for calculating the economic value of irrigation water in paddy fields with the high level of mechanization table 3 represents the results of fitting the form of the generalized leontief the results showed that the α0 αwat βwat and βferpes were significant at the probability level of 1 p 0 01 also the αlab βwatlab βwatmac and βmacpes were significant at the probability level of 5 p 0 05 and the αmac was significant at the probability level of 10 p 0 1 values of the coefficient of determination and adjusted coefficient of determination for the generalized leontief production form in the farms with the high mechanization level are 98 4 and 98 1 respectively indicating the ability of this functional form in explaining changes in the dependent variable of yield these values show good fit of the model and the reliability of the generalized leontief production function for farms with the high level of mechanization according to the obtained results for farms with the high level of mechanization regarding the median value of marginal product of irrigation water 0 481 in the evaluated category and with the value of 1 07 kg of paddy production in the crop years of 2013 2014 the economic value of irrigation water was 0 5108 m3 3 2 category results of low level of mechanization the average grain yield in the farms with the low level of mechanization was 3759 kg ha the average of labor was 76 person day ha which is higher than the other category evaluation of the variation coefficient of inputs used in the production system showed that pesticides and irrigation water had the highest and lowest variations in the low level of mechanization category respectively the lowest and highest pesticides being consumed were zero and 34 kg ha respectively the results are presented in table 4 in order to select the superior form of production function the five functional forms i e the cobb douglas transcendental generalized quadratic translog and generalized leontief were fitted the results are presented in table 5 in the next stage the superior functional form of production was selected based on the explicit criterion having meaningful ratio and considering the conditions of classical regression given the amount of jb the assumption of normality in the form of cobb douglas was rejected after discarding this form in the second stage the remaining forms were compared based on the coefficient of determination and the ratio of meaningful coefficients on that basis the translog form was chosen as the superior functional form to calculate the economic value of irrigation water in paddy fields with low level of mechanization table 6 shows the results of fitting the translog form the results showed that the α0 αwat βwat βsed and βfersed were significant at 1 probability level p 0 01 also the βlab was significant at the probability level of 5 p 0 05 and the βwatpes βlabsed βmacpes βmacsed and βpessed were significant at the probability level of 10 p 0 1 values of the coefficient of determination and the adjusted coefficient of determination were 98 5 and 98 3 respectively for the translog production function in the farms with the low level of mechanization representing the ability of this functional form in explaining the changes in the dependent variable of yield these values show good fitting and reliability of the translog production function for the farms with the low level of mechanization based on the results for farms with the low mechanization level regarding the median of final production 0 473 of irrigation water in this category and the economic value of 1 07 kg of paddy production in the crop years of 2013 2014 the economic value of irrigation water was calculated as 0 5054 m3 the presented results in table 7 can be used as guidelines for proper water allocation in case of water resources deficiency priority is given to those farms that create higher economic value for example according to the results of tables 7 and 8 roodbar city in the high mechanization level category has a priority by creating more economic value per cubic meters of water however this priority can be the allocation of irrigation water resource development or repair reclamation and modernization of irrigation networks based on the obtained results water will be allocated to the farms with high mechanization level first and then to the farms with low mechanization because 0 481 kg of rice can be harvested with each cubic meter of water in highly mechanized farms thereafter the economic value of water for this group is 0 0054 m3 more than the other group to verify the existence of statistic differences in the calculation of the economic value of irrigation water for two groups of farms independent t test was employed in this regard in the first step the homogeneity of variance was studied in two groups according to calculated f 0 06 and the related significant level 0 81 the null hypothesis of equality of variances in the two groups was accepted the value of calculated t statistic in comparison to the mean of the economic value of irrigation water was estimated to be equal to 15 68 in addition regarding the significant level for an alternative hypothesis the existence of a statistically significant difference between high and low levels of mechanization was acceptable i e the statistical average is different in the two groups of farms there is a statistical difference between all farms of the two groups being roughly equal to 0 011 m3 in order to calculate the value of irrigation water in each place calculations were conducted for each city table 8 priority allocation water supply and resource development can be determined for the two groups of farms by comparing the calculated economic values based on the economic values of irrigation water in different cities based on the obtained results for the fields with a high mechanization level three priorities are as follows roodbar shafts and talesh cities if resource development and infrastructure irrigation systems are desired for the farms with low level mechanization three priorities will be as follows roodbar siahkal and rezvanshahr cities the average economic values in high and low mechanization categories are 0 52 and 0 51 m3 respectively changes in the economic value of cities in the low level of mechanization farms is 5 6 which is lower compared to the high level of mechanization farms with a coefficient of variation of 7 2 in the city of astara low level of mechanization suffices for rice cultivation the highest economic value of irrigation water was obtained by the city of roodbar in the fields with high level of mechanization and the lowest economic value was obtained by the city of anzali in the same group rudbar city is the closest city to the sefidroud dam and amount of water loss is lower than those of the other cities in the transmission path furthermore the soil is lightly textured similarly the highest economic value of irrigation water for the farms with low mechanization level belongs to the city of roodbar and fooman city has the lowest economic value the results demonstrate that the economic values of irrigation water in both high and low levels of mechanization of farms are 0 5108 and 0 5054 m3 respectively the difference of calculated values reflects the impact of technology on the economic value of water while farmers pay about 0 012 m3 for irrigation water in the modern networks 0 008 m3 in the semi modern networks and 0 004 m3 in the traditional networks in the province of guilan nabizadeh zolpirani et al 2015 calculated the economic value of water for crops cultivated in the irrigation network of the alborz dam iran equal to 0 411 m3 in 2014 being in agreement with the results of this study in that study the transcendent function was the superior function and the results showed that there was a significant difference between the calculated value and the price paid by farmers farmers paid 0 006 m3 in the semi modern networks the economic value of irrigation water in a study in foumanat guilan province iran was 0 25 m3 sefati et al 2014 the results of the present study showed that the economic value of irrigation water is higher than those estimated in the guilan province and foumanat county the difference in the estimated economic values is due to different reasons the main reasons are lack of data concurrency in the both studies and the high rate of inflation in iran in addition the surface area and the selected function to estimate the economic value of irrigation water in the two studies were different foumanat county was classified in one category of mechanization and the effect of different levels of technology was not studied comparison of the results with those of kavoosi kalashami and peykani machiyani 2015 showed that the estimated value is higher than those of previous studies are this difference can be explained by the location of study area being in the upstream thus excluding the conveyance loss of water khajeh roshanayi et al 2010 calculated the economic value of irrigation water for wheat equal to 0 051 m3 in the city of mashhad which has a large difference with the highest local exchange price 0 011 m3 different product types and their characteristics such as tolerance of wheat and rice to water stress cropping system and the climate of studied area can justify the differences in the estimated values of studies the results of other studies confirmed the difference between the real value of water and the tariff based value of water paid by farmers e g michael et al 2014 studied on rice in tanzania chowdhury 2005 studied on the ganges river watershed in bangladesh using translog function for rice and ehsani et al 2012 did similarly in qazvin iran in order to estimate the economic value of irrigation water for barley 4 conclusion considering the economic valuation of irrigation water we can reduce water loss and move towards more efficient use of this valuable resource despite the fact that it is difficult to effectively and fairly allocate water resources it can be partly achieved by applying the water pricing mechanism in each country according to the different backgrounds geophysical or historical characteristics developing various types of water pricing mechanisms and the ability of farmers to pay the tariffs should also be considered in this study the economic value of irrigation water was calculated using the production function method for rice in guilan province iran in the present study the paddy fields were divided into two groups the purpose of this grouping is to valuate irrigation water and clarify the effect of new technology on the economic value of inputs such as irrigation water after fitting different forms of production function the economic value of irrigation water was calculated with the best functional form the economic value of irrigation water was calculated for the high level of mechanization group with the generalized leontief function of 0 5108 m3 a similar procedure was done for the low level of mechanization group with the translog function of 0 5054 m3 by performing independent t test a significant statistical difference was confirmed to exist between the two groups based on the results the following suggestions are put forward to improve irrigation system effectively in guilan province 1 the gap between the economic value of irrigation water and the tariff paid by farmers should be gradually reduced so as to increase water productivity in the agricultural sector and appreciate the scarce inputs by effective usage 2 using new managerial practices such as water user associations can be an effective step to improve water management application of modern methods of irrigation in rice cultivation such as the intermittent irrigation as an alternative to permanent flooding irrigation or reusing drain water can improve water productivity in the province 3 another way to reduce water consumption is changing the cultivation patterns in some areas so that equal benefit of rice can be earned with less water consumption consumption such as pine plantation in somehsara city according to local reports 4 a pilot program can be realized under which tradable water rights could be established 5 establishing companies or public institutions to manage irrigation systems at the level of the second and third ducts and supplying economically valuable water to them such as a pilot project should be considered as significant due to the scarcity of water in iran an increase in irrigation water price is reasonable of course determined prices by the marginal cost are high for low income farmers therefore it is recommended to adopt and implement new policies that take into account the financial living conditions of farmers and increase water efficiency

corresponding author at water engineering dept faculty of agricultural sciences university of guilan iran water engineering dept faculty of agricultural sciences university of guilan iran the economic value of irrigation water is not considered as a highly affective criterion in water tariff system in iran to this end proper measures and viable scientific and management solutions are very important for the optimal use of this input this study aims to determine the economic value of irrigation water used in rice agriculture in guilan province for this purpose production functional forms were utilized in addition determining the marginal product and its value led us to achieve economic value of irrigation water for farms with different mechanization levels it is noted that the cross section data used in this study were derived from questionnaires in the production cost plan of iranian ministry of agriculture during 2013 2014 crop years generalized leontief functional form was selected as the favorable form for the farms with high mechanization level the economic value of irrigation water considered in these farms is 0 5108 m3 for the farms with low mechanization level translog functional form is chosen as the superior form whose final water economic value equals 0 5054 m3 reviews of the statistical difference between the two groups showed significant differences between the economic values of water considering water scarcity in iran and the existing difference between its tariff system and economic value it is recommended that the present tariff system be reformed and economic value of irrigation water be considered in the corresponding tariff system keywords translog function generalized leontief function econometric criteria marginal product 1 introduction in iran the ministry of energy announces irrigation water tariffs and communicates them to regional water companies the tariffs in the agricultural sector are determined by a definite and simple method to prioritize the plain types of irrigation system performances of agricultural products and their price efficiency of water production in developing countries such as iran is very inefficient compared with other developed countries and determined tariffs are handled based on financial considerations rather than economic considerations furthermore only minor amount of all financial costs of water supply is considered consequently the determined tariffs for water are too cheap therefore the value of water as a scarce source is not completely given priority thus farmers do not find any convincing incentive to economize water use for this reason water is considered as a free input among water users paying low irrigation water fee bills by farmers has only led to inefficient water allocations and frequent consumption of this scarce input in producing relatively high water requirement crops which are called non strategic crops sometimes sadeghi et al 2012 now in iran irrigation and drainage network of sefidroud supplies water requirement of about 180 thousand hectares of paddy fields in guilan province based on the facilities of each unit payable tariff concerning irrigation water in the territory covered by the network is estimated to be between 1 3 percent of the rice cultivation income in each year about 65 of farmers are not willing to pay more there are those who do not even pay their annual water costs the highest payable cost of water is specified to be less than 5 of the total input costs in a crop season therefore farmers need to become more aware of the actual value of water determination of water tariff encourages farmers to save water intelligently resulting in improving water productivity mitigating environmental degradation funding a part of repair and maintenance costs and finally maintaining the rights of future generations tahamipour et al 2015 in the asian humid tropics it is too early to apply water pricing because there is seldom a right concept of water or any practical organization of water management in this region it is important to facilitate the establishment of sound management organizations of irrigation water before introducing a strict water pricing mechanism to levy the charge fujimoto and tomosho 2003 there are a number of studies on water economic valuation in agriculture such as those of he et al 2004 abernethy 2000 and tahamipour et al 2015 singh 2007 and al karablieh et al 2012 proposed that the existence of water subsidies is a sure factor in the low level of water productivity and the concealment of water value as a rare input from the eyes of farmers and the possibility of using more than required for this valuable input singh 2007 reported that there is a big gap between supply cost as water price and economic value of water therefore in this study irrigation water pricing is determined by the production function method chowdhury 2005 khajeh roshanayi et al 2010 and sadeghi et al 2012 measured the economic values of irrigation water in bangladesh iran and pakistan respectively in this regard ehsani et al 2012 chowdhury 2005 and khajeh roshanayi et al 2010 used the production function method to determine the economic value of irrigation water khajeh roshanayi et al 2010 calculated the economic value of water for wheat as 0 5 m3 cheng et al 2016 emphasized that the amount of water affects the rice yield and they conducted a study in jilin province china they used five common production functions and the water sensitivity index of each model was calculated based on the evapotranspiration and yield comparison of the calculated results with observed data showed that jensen model is the most suitable production function for this region ashfaq et al 2005 in pakistan calculated the economic value of water for different crops the economic value of irrigation water for rice was 0 01 m3 in india ashfaq et al 2005 0 002 0 015 m3 in bengladesh chowdhury 2005 and the average tariff of water was 124 per hectare for a 4 year study in nigeria abernethy 2000 michael et al 2014 used the relationship between the yield of rice and water consumption to reformulate and establish a new policy in water consumption in tanzania they found that an increase of 6 in water consumption made an increase of 10 in yield furthermore the coefficient of water price was negative meaning that an increase of 1 of the water price reduces the water demand by 0 03 therefore we can conclude that pricing is an important factor in reducing water consumption for irrigated crops the proposed solution of this study is improving the irrigation efficiency using modern management practices and irrigation methods literature reviews show the dependence of agricultural production on irrigation water lack of water necessitates the efficient and judicious use of this input research into economics and economic valuation of water can provide optimum allocation of water to agricultural production and the factor in preventing water loss in order to optimize the allocation of irrigation water residual entropy production function and linear optimization methods were used for the valuation of irrigation water in parametric method parameters estimation is based on the assumption of linearity model parameters as a result when this assumption is not correct fitted surface response cannot be a precise function based on input and output variables of the system in those situations where there is uncertainty over the non linear model parameters the non parametric optimization function is proposed where both the mean and variance are assumed unknown in this method in the present study for the first time the amount of irrigation water per hectare was estimated using the water yield function derived from davatgar 2010 and it was considered in the production function furthermore this research was carried out on a large scale aiming to estimate the economic value of irrigation water in rice production the best production function was selected using the parametric methods and was compared with other functions to estimate the value of irrigation in the farm with different levels of mechanization a grouping of fields has been done to evaluate the impact of production technology on the economic value of water in this study the priorities with respect to the allocation of limited water stored in sefidroud dam have been determined this has been done to achieve higher productivity per water unit and prevent water loss as a valuable input the volume of water allocated to guilan province is declining constantly due to increasing water demands in the upstream section and it has been reduced from 4000 to 850 million cubic meters according to the new policy of the government increasing the price of water is a correct policy and an effective step to reduce the gap between the economic value of irrigation water and payable tariff of irrigation and this effective measure should be taken with caution along with considering other aspects this research has attempted to clarify the importance of water use in the agricultural section of guilan province compared with similar studies done in the rival provinces in the upstream section of sefidroud river the results of this study can be helpful for planners and policy makers concerning the appropriate allocation of water resources in the watershed of sefidroud river 2 materials and methods estimating the value of water as a production input was done using two methods parametric and non parametric methods the production function method is a parametric method which is commonly used for determining the economic value of irrigation water linear programming is one of the most popular non parametric methods used to determine the economic value of water decaluwe et al 1999 in this study the production function method is preferred for estimating the economic value of irrigation water because the used data is cross sectional and there were no significant changes in the price of inputs and the product during this study production function is a technical relationship between the factors of production and the product value while assuming that other conditions are constant in this method the production function in which water is used as independent variables is estimated and the marginal value of water is determined as its economic value debertin 1997 1 y y x 1 x 2 x n 1 w a t 2 v m p w a t p y m p w a t p y y w a t where y and w at represent the production and water consumption respectively x1 to xn 1 are the other production inputs py is the output price mpwater is the marginal product of irrigation water and vmpwater is the value of marginal product of irrigation water or its economic value regarding relations 1 and 2 it is clear that the obtained value is a function of the marginal product and the marginal product is derived from the production function thus the initial production function is effective in determining the economic value and any change in the initial production function changes the estimated parameters in the final production and the economic value calculated for the input with this description in mind accuracy in the process of selecting the correct functional form is an important step to determine the economic values of each input in this study flexible and inflexible functional forms are fitted and compared by eviews econometric software to select the superior one through inflexible functions the cobb douglas and the transcendental functions were fitted through flexible functions the generalized quadratic the translog and the generalized leontief forms were fitted for the determination of irrigation water s economic value variables in the mentioned functional forms include production quantity y consumption of irrigation water in cubic meter w labor in a day work l cost of machinery m pesticides consumption in liter p and fertilizers consumption in kg f seed consumption in kg s and α and β as the regression coefficients the reason for choosing these inputs is their importance for rice production in the study area because the most important task in defining an empirical model is determining the factors or inputs that are included as independent variables into the model of production consumed water using a quadratic relationship between the yield and irrigation water was calculated as follows 3 y 0 0095 x 2 14 551 x 1136 where y is the yield in kg ha and x is irrigation water in millimeters in eq 3 water consumption was calculated in the two groups of farms using the eq 3 because there is no precise device for measuring the amount of irrigation water in each farm this equation mentioned in davatgar 2010 which aimed to determine the correlation between irrigation water consumption and yield rate of hashemi variety of rice the functional forms in this research are as follows 1 cobb douglas functional form the cobb douglas type of production function has been estimated by agricultural economists for virtually any production process involving the transformation of inputs into outputs in an agricultural setting economists have used a cobb douglas type of specification for virtually every conceivable type of production process to review specific applications of the cobb douglas type of function would be to review a large share of the literature in which empirical attempts have been made to estimate production functions this function has the characteristics of necessity homogeneity uniformity concavity continuity derivability non negative and non nullity but the cobb douglas could represent only one stage of production at a time

but its value depends only on the amount of consumption of the input another desirable characteristic of this function is that the elasticity are not fixed to the scale but depends on the amount of inputs the transcendental function is a modified form of the cobb douglas function with the difference that it can show the unstable final output and the negative output marginal product of the final production in each of the three production regions halter et al 1957 transcendental functional form can be specified as in eq 6 halter et al 1957 6 y α 0 w α w a t l α l a b m α m a c f α f e r p α p

features of the neoclassical function except the condition of necessity the first derivative does not have a sign limitation and shows three production regions in this function if all inputs would be

test of residuals jb statistics to detect heterogeneity of variance and glejser test are reported in tables 2 and 5 in this study cross sectional data derived from the questionnaires of production cost plan in the crop years of 2013 2014 were used which were prepared by the ministry of agriculture the study was conducted with 373 questionnaires for paddy fields in this study classification of farms is done based on the ratio of machinery cost to the labor force cost per hectare hence they are divided into high mechanization level and low mechanization level groups with 186 farms in the former group and 187 farms in the latter one this division was made with the assumption that the economic values of production inputs are different in various production technologies t test was used with spss 21 software to check the accuracy of the grouping and the existence of a statistical difference between the two groups of farms it is obvious that there is meaningful difference between two mentioned groups according to results there is an average difference of 1259 units between all farms of the high mechanization level group and the low mechanization level group 3 results and discussion 3 1 category results of high level of mechanization the average grain yield in paddy fields with the high level of mechanization was 3772 kg ha among different inputs water and pesticide consumptions had the lowest and the highest variations respectively the seed consumption ranged from 40 to 133 kg ha and the average of day labor was 54 labor day ha in different rice cultivation stages the lowest and highest fertilizer consumptions were 100 and 454 54 kg ha respectively the cost of machinery was calculated as 411 621 ha in average the results are presented in table 1 in order to select the superior form of production function cobb douglas transcendental generalized quadratic translog and generalized leontief functional forms were fitted the results are presented in table 2 in the next stage based on explicit criterion having meaningful ratio and considering the conditions of classical regression the superior functional form of production was selected given the calculated amount of jb the assumption of normality of components was rejected in the form of cobb douglas and transcendental functions therefore the two mentioned forms were excluded in the second stage the three remaining flexible form factors were compared based on the coefficient of determination and the ratio of meaningful coefficients accordingly the generalized leontief form was chosen as the superior functional form for calculating the economic value of irrigation water in paddy fields with the high level of mechanization table 3 represents the results of fitting the form of the generalized leontief the results showed that the α0 αwat βwat and βferpes were significant at the probability level of 1 p 0 01 also the αlab βwatlab βwatmac and βmacpes were significant at the probability level of 5 p 0 05 and the αmac was significant at the probability level of 10 p 0 1 values of the coefficient of determination and adjusted coefficient of determination for the generalized leontief production form in the farms with the high mechanization level are 98 4 and 98 1 respectively indicating the ability of this functional form in explaining changes in the dependent variable of yield these values show good fit of the model and the reliability of the generalized leontief production function for farms with the high level of mechanization according to the obtained results for farms with the high level of mechanization regarding the median value of marginal product of irrigation water 0 481 in the evaluated category and with the value of 1 07 kg of paddy production in the crop years of 2013 2014 the economic value of irrigation water was 0 5108 m3 3 2 category results of low level of mechanization the average grain yield in the farms with the low level of mechanization was 3759 kg ha the average of labor was 76 person day ha which is higher than the other category evaluation of the variation coefficient of inputs used in the production system showed that pesticides and irrigation water had the highest and lowest variations in the low level of mechanization category respectively the lowest and highest pesticides being consumed were zero and 34 kg ha respectively the results are presented in table 4 in order to select the superior form of production function the five functional forms i e the cobb douglas transcendental generalized quadratic translog and generalized leontief were fitted the results are presented in table 5 in the next stage the superior functional form of production was selected based on the explicit criterion having meaningful ratio and considering the conditions of classical regression given the amount of jb the assumption of normality in the form of cobb douglas was rejected after discarding this form in the second stage the remaining forms were compared based on the coefficient of determination and the ratio of meaningful coefficients on that basis the translog form was chosen as the superior functional form to calculate the economic value of irrigation water in paddy fields with low level of mechanization table 6 shows the results of fitting the translog form the results showed that the α0 αwat βwat βsed and βfersed were significant at 1 probability level p 0 01 also the βlab was significant at the probability level of 5 p 0 05 and the βwatpes βlabsed βmacpes βmacsed and βpessed were significant at the probability level of 10 p 0 1 values of the coefficient of determination and the adjusted coefficient of determination were 98 5 and 98 3 respectively for the translog production function in the farms with the low level of mechanization representing the ability of this functional form in explaining the changes in the dependent variable of yield these values show good fitting and reliability of the translog production function for the farms with the low level of mechanization based on the results for farms with the low mechanization level regarding the median of final production 0 473 of irrigation water in this category and the economic value of 1 07 kg of paddy production in the crop years of 2013 2014 the economic value of irrigation water was calculated as 0 5054 m3 the presented results in table 7 can be used as guidelines for proper water allocation in case of water resources deficiency priority is given to those farms that create higher economic value for example according to the results of tables 7 and 8 roodbar city in the high mechanization level category has a priority by creating more economic value per cubic meters of water however this priority can be the allocation of irrigation water resource development or repair reclamation and modernization of irrigation networks based on the obtained results water will be allocated to the farms with high mechanization level first and then to the farms with low mechanization because 0 481 kg of rice can be harvested with each cubic meter of water in highly mechanized farms thereafter the economic value of water for this group is 0 0054 m3 more than the other group to verify the existence of statistic differences in the calculation of the economic value of irrigation water for two groups of farms independent t test was employed in this regard in the first step the homogeneity of variance was studied in two groups according to calculated f 0 06 and the related significant level 0 81 the null hypothesis of equality of variances in the two groups was accepted the value of calculated t statistic in comparison to the mean of the economic value of irrigation water was estimated to be equal to 15 68 in addition regarding the significant level for an alternative hypothesis the existence of a statistically significant difference between high and low levels of mechanization was acceptable i e the statistical average is different in the two groups of farms there is a statistical difference between all farms of the two groups being roughly equal to 0 011 m3 in order to calculate the value of irrigation water in each place calculations were conducted for each city table 8 priority allocation water supply and resource development can be determined for the two groups of farms by comparing the calculated economic values based on the economic values of irrigation water in different cities based on the obtained results for the fields with a high mechanization level three priorities are as follows roodbar shafts and talesh cities if resource development and infrastructure irrigation systems are desired for the farms with low level mechanization three priorities will be as follows roodbar siahkal and rezvanshahr cities the average economic values in high and low mechanization categories are 0 52 and 0 51 m3 respectively changes in the economic value of cities in the low level of mechanization farms is 5 6 which is lower compared to the high level of mechanization farms with a coefficient of variation of 7 2 in the city of astara low level of mechanization suffices for rice cultivation the highest economic value of irrigation water was obtained by the city of roodbar in the fields with high level of mechanization and the lowest economic value was obtained by the city of anzali in the same group rudbar city is the closest city to the sefidroud dam and amount of water loss is lower than those of the other cities in the transmission path furthermore the soil is lightly textured similarly the highest economic value of irrigation water for the farms with low mechanization level belongs to the city of roodbar and fooman city has the lowest economic value the results demonstrate that the economic values of irrigation water in both high and low levels of mechanization of farms are 0 5108 and 0 5054 m3 respectively the difference of calculated values reflects the impact of technology on the economic value of water while farmers pay about 0 012 m3 for irrigation water in the modern networks 0 008 m3 in the semi modern networks and 0 004 m3 in the traditional networks in the province of guilan nabizadeh zolpirani et al 2015 calculated the economic value of water for crops cultivated in the irrigation network of the alborz dam iran equal to 0 411 m3 in 2014 being in agreement with the results of this study in that study the transcendent function was the superior function and the results showed that there was a significant difference between the calculated value and the price paid by farmers farmers paid 0 006 m3 in the semi modern networks the economic value of irrigation water in a study in foumanat guilan province iran was 0 25 m3 sefati et al 2014 the results of the present study showed that the economic value of irrigation water is higher than those estimated in the guilan province and foumanat county the difference in the estimated economic values is due to different reasons the main reasons are lack of data concurrency in the both studies and the high rate of inflation in iran in addition the surface area and the selected function to estimate the economic value of irrigation water in the two studies were different foumanat county was classified in one category of mechanization and the effect of different levels of technology was not studied comparison of the results with those of kavoosi kalashami and peykani machiyani 2015 showed that the estimated value is higher than those of previous studies are this difference can be explained by the location of study area being in the upstream thus excluding the conveyance loss of water khajeh roshanayi et al 2010 calculated the economic value of irrigation water for wheat equal to 0 051 m3 in the city of mashhad which has a large difference with the highest local exchange price 0 011 m3 different product types and their characteristics such as tolerance of wheat and rice to water stress cropping system and the climate of studied area can justify the differences in the estimated values of studies the results of other studies confirmed the difference between the real value of water and the tariff based value of water paid by farmers e g michael et al 2014 studied on rice in tanzania chowdhury 2005 studied on the ganges river watershed in bangladesh using translog function for rice and ehsani et al 2012 did similarly in qazvin iran in order to estimate the economic value of irrigation water for barley 4 conclusion considering the economic valuation of irrigation water we can reduce water loss and move towards more efficient use of this valuable resource despite the fact that it is difficult to effectively and fairly allocate water resources it can be partly achieved by applying the water pricing mechanism in each country according to the different backgrounds geophysical or historical characteristics developing various types of water pricing mechanisms and the ability of farmers to pay the tariffs should also be considered in this study the economic value of irrigation water was calculated using the production function method for rice in guilan province iran in the present study the paddy fields were divided into two groups the purpose of this grouping is to valuate irrigation water and clarify the effect of new technology on the economic value of inputs such as irrigation water after fitting different forms of production function the economic value of irrigation water was calculated with the best functional form the economic value of irrigation water was calculated for the high level of mechanization group with the generalized leontief function of 0 5108 m3 a similar procedure was done for the low level of mechanization group with the translog function of 0 5054 m3 by performing independent t test a significant statistical difference was confirmed to exist between the two groups based on the results the following suggestions are put forward to improve irrigation system effectively in guilan province 1 the gap between the economic value of irrigation water and the tariff paid by farmers should be gradually reduced so as to increase water productivity in the agricultural sector and appreciate the scarce inputs by effective usage 2 using new managerial practices such as water user associations can be an effective step to improve water management application of modern methods of irrigation in rice cultivation such as the intermittent irrigation as an alternative to permanent flooding irrigation or reusing drain water can improve water productivity in the province 3 another way to reduce water consumption is changing the cultivation patterns in some areas so that equal benefit of rice can be earned with less water consumption consumption such as pine plantation in somehsara city according to local reports 4 a pilot program can be realized under which tradable water rights could be established 5 establishing companies or public institutions to manage irrigation systems at the level of the second and third ducts and supplying economically valuable water to them such as a pilot project should be considered as significant due to the scarcity of water in iran an increase in irrigation water price is reasonable of course determined prices by the marginal cost are high for low income farmers therefore it is recommended to adopt and implement new policies that take into account the financial living conditions of farmers and increase water efficiency
