18890,the organic matter present in wastewater effluents efom is likely to have different properties than the organic matter present in the receiving water the properties of efom will affect the fate of contaminants of emerging concern because efom is a source of photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris capable of transforming contaminants effluent water samples were taken seasonally from sixteen wastewater treatment plants in minnesota and two effluent dominated rivers in california and arizona samples n 94 were tested for water chemistry light absorption characteristics and excited state triplet organic matter 3efom and singlet oxygen 1o2 production based on analysis of spectral parameters efom had higher molecular weight and lower aromatic content than organic matter present in stormwaters from minnesota which are representative of human impacted natural organic matter nom containing waters the second order rate constant for the reaction of the 3efom probe 2 4 6 trimethylephenol k t tmp for the effluents was 7 79 3 03 108 m 1s 1 and this value was used to calculate apparent quantum yields for 3efom production which ranged from 0 006 to 0 114 the quantum yield for the production of singlet oxygen ranged from 0 007 to 0 064 processes in the wastewater treatment train season and water chemistry parameters did not serve as predictors of 3efom or 1o2 production among the parameters measured spearman rank correlations were strongest between quantum yields of 1o2 and 3efom and e2 e3 absorption at 250 nm absorption at 365 nm this relationship however is weaker than that previously observed for nom the efficiency of 1o2 production from 3efom was 54 results indicate that 2 4 6 trimethylphenol samples nearly all of the triplets in efom that have sufficient energy to produce 1o2 which may not be the case for nom graphical abstract image 1 keywords effluent organic matter triplet organic matter singlet oxygen wastewater effluent 2 4 6 trimethylphenol 1 introduction as populations continue to grow flows in and out of wastewater treatment plants wwtps will increase as will the percentages of wastewater effluent present in surface waters in some regions effluent already dominates the flow in riverine systems bradley et al 1995 kim et al 2002 luthy et al 2015 reilly et al 2000 westerhoff and anning 2000 thus studying the organic matter composition and its impact on the photochemical degradation of pollutants in these impacted waters is increasing in importance shon et al 2006 the organic matter contained in effluent waters is effluent organic matter efom efom contains a mixture of influent natural organic matter nom remaining after water treatment soluble microbial products smps from the wastewater treatment process organic contaminants and various degradation products chen et al 2003 gonsior et al 2011 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 nam and amy 2008 shon et al 2006 while efom is the organic matter from effluent water nom is the organic matter present in natural environments and waters while some similarities have been found between nom and efom there are key differences nam and amy 2008 efom is primarily autochthonous and largely comprised of smps and macromolecules whereas nom is more often allochthonous in origin and comprised of humic and fulvic acids nam and amy 2008 because efom is a mixture of numerous chemical compounds and full characterization of all its components is infeasible parameters such as light absorption and organic carbon levels may serve as means to estimate efom composition maizel and remucal 2017a suva254 absorbance at 254 nm normalized by the dissolved organic carbon content doc is a surrogate for aromatic content with higher suva254 corresponding to higher aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 reported suva254 values range from 2 58 l m 1 mg c 1 to 6 33 l m 1 mg c 1 for efom and 2 67 l m 1 mg c 1 to 13 10 l m 1 mg c 1 for nom on a napierian scale cho et al 1998 fabris et al 2008 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 this indicates that efom is generally lower in aromatic content compared to nom another spectral parameter e2 e3 the ratio of the absorbance at 250 nm to the absorbance at 365 nm has also been used to gather information about efom maizel and remucal 2017b e2 e3 increases with decreasing molecular weight maizel and remucal 2017a peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 thus if the e2 e3 is lower 3 5 5 0 the molecules are larger and mostly likely allochthonous organic matter maizel and remucal 2017b peterson et al 2012 if the e2 e3 is higher 7 10 the molecules are smaller and likely autochthonous organic matter helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017b efom e2 e3 ratios are reported as within a range of 5 0 7 0 consistent with material partially derived from microorganisms as well as allochthonous sources bodhipaksha et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017b mckay et al 2016 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 there are also differences in the specific chemicals that comprise efom and nom efom has a higher protein content than nom nam and amy 2008 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has shown that efom has much narrower ranges of mass distribution than nom 250 400 m z for efom compared to 150 600 m z for nom gonsior et al 2011 maizel and remucal 2017a the largest abundance of molecules in efom was found to correspond to surfactants and degradation products of those surfactants the surfactants are high in sulfur which results in efom having higher sulfur content than nom gonsior et al 2011 maizel and remucal 2017b shon et al 2006 efom also contains more chlorine likely from disinfection of the effluent nitrogen and phosphorus than nom maizel and remucal 2017b nam and amy 2008 indirect photolysis reactions driven by production of photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris have been shown to be important loss processes for many contaminants of emerging concern cecs an et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 canonica 2007 canonica et al 1995a canonica and hoigne 1995 filipe et al 2017 guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 zepp et al 1987 because wastewater effluent contains cecs as well as efom ppri production from efom rather than nom may drive photochemical reactions in sunlit effluent receiving waters and thus persistence of cecs in effluent dominated systems because cecs may have adverse effects on aquatic life and their presence in drinking water sources is undesirable accurate prediction of cec fate is needed thus it is critical to have information about both the production rates of ppris and reaction rates for cecs with ppris ppri production rates are not readily available in regards to effluent impacted systems the source and composition of the organic matter allochthonous or autochthonous will influence its photo reactivity the photoexcitation of organic matter both natural and effluent leads to the formation of various ppris these species include triplet excited state organic matter 3om singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radical oh and carbonate radical co3 canonica et al 1995a canonica and hoigne 1995 faust and hoigne 1987 garg et al 2011 mill et al 1980 minella et al 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2003 vione et al 2014 zepp et al 1977 zhang et al 2014 once formed ppris degrade pollutants found in aquatic systems through indirect photolysis an et al 2016 li et al 2016 ryan et al 2011 yan et al 2017 ppris have low steady state concentrations in surface waters 10 12 m 10 18 m al housari et al 2010 haag and hoigne 1986 mill et al 1980 mopper and zhou 1990 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 peterson et al 2012 zepp et al 1987 1985 and thus reactions with probe molecules are often used to quantify ppris and calculate quantum yields for their production i e the fraction of light absorption events that lead to production of a given ppri common probes are 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp and sorbic acid for 3om faust and hoigne 1987 grebel et al 2011 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 vione et al 2018 furfuryl alcohol ffa for 1o2 appiani et al 2017 haag et al 1984 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 and terephthalic acid tpa for oh lin et al 2017 page et al 2010 in general the formation of 3om is a key step in the production of other downstream ppris whereby species such as 1o2 and oh are formed from subsequent reaction of energy transfer from 3om bodhipaksha et al 2015 latch 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 zepp et al 1985 1977 in addition to producing downstream ppris triplet organic matter is itself an important ppri in the degradation of pollutants 3om reacts with contaminants through oxidation and it is known to be particularly reactive with phenols and aromatic amines an et al 2016 arnold 2014 arnold et al 2017 ryan et al 2011 schmitt et al 2017 vione et al 2018 triplet organic matter is not one molecule but rather a combination of various triplet state compounds with a range of excited state energies and reduction potentials which makes it difficult to characterize arnold et al 2017 mcneill and canonica 2016 schmitt et al 2017 sharpless 2012 thus triplets with different energies will react with different chemicals functional groups depending on their energies and redox potentials arnold et al 2017 mcneill and canonica 2016 evidence suggests ppri production is related to molecular weight of the om with increasing molecular weight resulting in decreased quantum yield of 3om and 1o2 maizel and remucal 2017a this is illustrated with the e2 e3 ratio with decreasing e2 e3 and thus increasing molecular weight resulting in decreasing quantum yields maizel and remucal 2017a thus the processing of nom and production of smps to give the final efom composition may impact ppri production via the changes in the om molecular structure maizel and remucal 2017a preliminary evidence shows that efom photochemical behavior deviates from that of nom silva et al 2017 found that efom from pinerolo italy more efficiently produced 3om than suwannee river nom srnom other studies have indicated that efom has lower molecular weight and produces 3om and 1o2 more efficiently than nom and thus efom may lead to more rapid indirect photochemical degradation of cecs bodhipaksha et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017a this may be due to efom being a more efficient photosensitizer than nom ryan et al 2011 more rapid indirect photolysis of a number of pollutants in the presence of efom has been observed ryan et al 2011 found more rapid photo decay of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in efom containing waters than in nom containing waters in samples when comparing two wastewater plant effluents with a local lake guerard et al 2009 found that sulfadimethoxine photochemically degraded faster in the presence of autochthonous om than in allochthonous om meaning that sulfadimethoxine will likely decay faster in efom containing waters than in surface waters dominated by allochthonous nom bodhipaksha et al 2017 determined that indirect photolysis rates were greater in the presence of efom than in natural waters for various contaminants including caffeine cimetidine sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethoxazole commonly found in wastewater effluents contaminant photolysis in natural waters mixed with effluent waters resulted in greater degradation rates with a greater proportion of effluent bodhipaksha et al 2017 previous results however found that effluent waters may lead to decreased degradation rates for pollutants when mixed with nom bodhipaksha et al 2015 an explanation for these contradicting results is the potential quenching of reactive efom ppris by the nom when combined bodhipaksha et al 2017 unless the quantum yield of the ppri in this case oh involved in the degradation reaction is much higher in effluent than natural water large amounts of effluent water are needed to overcome the quenching by nom to yield an increased total ppri quantum yield when effluent water is mixed with the natural waters bodhipaksha et al 2017 in this study the formation of 3efom and 1o2 production from 3efom was analyzed effluents were taken seasonally from sixteen wastewater treatment plants in minnesota which use various treatment processes as well as two effluent dominated rivers the santa cruz river in arizona and the santa ana river in california the set of 94 efom samples used herein to assess ppri production is the largest studied to date ppri production for each sample was quantified using tmp and ffa as probe compounds for 3efom and 1o2 respectively in laboratory irradiation experiments the kinetic data and light absorption rates of the water samples were used to calculate quantum yields for production of 3efom and 1o2 any effects of wastewater treatment processes season in which the samples were collected or location were explored using a one way anova statistical test relationships between ppri production and efom spectral properties were also explored and the suitability of tmp and ffa as ppri probes for efom was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources and purity tmp 99 was purchased from acros organics 4 nitroanisole pna 97 ffa 98 phosphoric acid 85 wt

sampling locations are shown in fig a1 1 of the supplementary material sm sampling of wastewater treatment plants in minnesota was performed quarterly from march 2015 to march 2017 with 84 samples taken in all samples were also collected from two effluent dominated rivers eight were collected from arizona santa cruz river january 2015 april 2015 february 2016 and april 2016 and two were collected from california santa ana river march 2015 august 2015 by dr patrick brezonik and dr haizhou liu respectively the complete list of samples 94 in total is given in section a1 of the sm six samples were collected from each of the five metro area plants blue lake empire metro seneca and st croix valley five samples from cannon falls kasson faribault northfield st cloud wanamingo and zumbrota plants four samples from the owatonna plant seven samples from the rochester and becker plants which have two treatment streams that were sampled both combined and separately and one sample was taken from the big lake plant among the sixteen wastewater treatment plants across the state of minnesota nine plants use activated sludge five use extended aeration activated sludge one uses a biological aerated filter and one uses rotating biological surfaces seven plants use chemical phosphorus removal two use biological phosphorus removal three use both and four had no specific phosphorus removal step eight plants use uv to disinfect the effluent seven use chlorine disinfection and one plant uses both treatment processes for each plant are listed in section a2 of the sm samples were collected in 1 l polycarbonate bottles purchased from fisher scientific all bottles were soaked overnight in alcanox rinsed three times with tap and di water soaked in a 1 m hcl acid bath overnight rinsed three times with tap di and ultrapure water and sterilized using an autoclave before sample collection once collected samples from minnesota were stored on ice until returned the same day to the laboratory california and arizona samples were shipped within two days of collection and refridgerated upon arrival in the laboratory samples were filtered with an emd millipore ap4004700 microfiber glass filter pre combusted at 550 c and then filtered with an emd millipore omnipore hydrophilic ptfe membrane filter jgwp04700 0 2 μm to filter sterilize the samples within 72 h of collection samples were then stored at 4 c for the duration of the study 2 3 analysis of water quality water quality parameters were measured for each water sample the ph was measured using a wtw 340i ph meter equipped with a sensorex s200c probe specific conductance was measured using a model 72 engineered systems and design conductivity meter doc levels and dissolved inorganic carbon dic were measured using a shimadzu toc l analyzer once measured ph and dic were used to calculate alkalinity alk of each sample assuming all dic in the sample was due to the carbonate system dissolved feii and feiii levels were measured using the ferrozine method described by stookey 1970 ion concentrations were measured using a metrohm 761 compact ion chromatograph the water quality data are provided in section a3 of the sm 2 4 measurement of spectral parameters uv visible spectra of the waters were taken with a shimadzu uv 1601pc spectrophotometer in 1 cm quartz cuvettes parameters derived from the uv visible spectra include e2 e3 suva254 suva280 absorbance at 280 nm normalized by the doc and spectral slope ss the slopes of the absorbance spectra from 275 to 295 nm and 350 to 400 nm detailed explanations of e2 e3 suva254 suva280 ss 275 295 nm and ss 350 400 nm are given in section a4 of the sm spectral parameters for each sample are shown in section a5 of the sm the excitation emission matrix eem of each sample was taken using a horiba aqualog spectrophotometer in a 1 cm quartz cuvette the matrices were corrected for inner filter effects and normalized by raman scattering area at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm these matrices were used to determine the humic index hix for each sample hix is calculated using equation 1 1 h i x e m 435 n m 480 n m i e x 254 n m e m 435 n m 480 n m i e x 254 n m e m 300 n m 345 n m i e x 254 n m where the integrals are summed emission spectra over the stated wavelength ranges at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm i ex 254nm β α the emission intensity at 380 nm over the maximum emission intensity from 420 to 435 nm both at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm was also calculated hansen et al 2016 parlanti et al 2000 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 other information collected included a peak how humic like b peak how protein or phenol like c peak how humic like m peak marine or algal like t peak protein or phenol like and fluorescence index fi which are listed in section a6 of the sm coble 1996 rosario ortiz and korak 2017 2 5 photolysis experiments with tmp tmp was used as a probe to measure 3efom tmp does not degrade via direct photolysis and has limited reactivity with other ppris including 1o2 aguer et al 2005 canonica et al 1995b maizel and remucal 2017a wenk et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 aliquots of each water sample 25 ml were spiked with 50 μl of an aqueous stock of 2 5 mm tmp to give 5 μm initial tmp concentrations which has been shown to be an appropriate concentration for studying 3om mccabe and arnold 2017 the tmp containing solutions were then split into triplicate quartz test tubes capped and placed in an atlas suntest cps solar simulator using a xenon arc lamp a 290 nm cutoff filter was used and the lamp intensity was set to 350 w m2 between 300 and 800 nm tmp samples were irradiated for 50 min and samples were taken over time for analysis all samples were analyzed via high pressure liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 series ascentis rp amide column or eclipse xdb c18 column using the methods from section a7 of the sm to determine tmp concentration as a function of time one of the parameters needed to determine the quantum yield of triplet production is the second order rate constant of tmp with 3om k t tmp values reported in the literature range from 0 81 109 m 1s 1 to 10 109 m 1 s 1 and recent work has shown variation in k t tmp among different water samples and nom isolates al housari et al 2010 canonica et al 2000 erickson et al 2018 golanoski et al 2012 mccabe and arnold 2017 2016 zepp et al 1985 thus experiments were performed to determine k t tmp in a subset of collected wastewater samples and it was assumed this value would apply to all collected samples five different target concentrations of tmp 50 100 200 500 and 750 μm were dissolved in four wastewater samples that represented a span of pseudo first order rate constant k obs tmp values and stirred continuously for five days solutions were then centrifuged to separate any undissolved tmp and the remaining solution 25 ml was added to quartz test tubes in triplicate samples were then irradiated following the method described above analysis of samples by hplc and kinetic modeling assuming pseudo first order kinetics yields a tmp 0 and k obs tmp for each sample this allowed for the rate of triplet formation r f t and k t tmp to be estimated using equation 2 mccabe and arnold 2017 2 1 k o b s t m p 1 r f t t m p 0 k q r f t k t t m p a linear regression of 1 k obs tmp vs tmp 0 values yielded a slope of 1 r f t the value for the rate constant for quenching of triplets k q is 3 13 0 43 105 s 1 erickson et al 2018 the intercept of the linear regression together with r f t and k q were used to determine an estimate of k t tmp mccabe and arnold 2017 2 6 photolysis experiments with ffa ffa was used as a probe to measure 1o2 production a 50 μl aliquot of an aqueous stock of 5 mm ffa was added to aliquots of 25 ml effluent samples to reach an initial concentration of 10 μm these solutions were then divided into triplicate quartz test tubes capped and placed in the solar simulator using the same irradiation conditions as in the tmp experiments ffa experiments were irradiated for 2 h and sampled periodically to quantify ffa concentrations all samples were analyzed via hplc using the method from section a7 of the sm 2 7 chemical actinometry actinometery experiments were performed in parallel with tmp and ffa experiments using p nitroanisole pna pyridine as the actinometer the pna concentrations were monitored using hplc section a7 of the sm the actinometer is required to estimate the photon output of the lamp during tmp and ffa experiments which yields an estimate of the rate of light absorption of the effluent water samples r a and thus allows estimation of quantum yields the actinometer experimental procedure is described in detail in laszakovits et al 2017 and the relevant equations are given in section a8 in the sm 2 8 calculation of apparent quantum yields tmp decay was assumed to follow pseudo first order kinetics assuming that the 3efom concentration remains constant during the irradiation process and that the tmp decay is due exclusively to the reaction with 3efom the loss of tmp is given by 3 d t m p d t k o b s t m p t m p k t t m p e 3 f o m s s t m p the quantum yield coefficient for triplets f tmp is calculated using equation 4 4 f t m p k o b s t m p r a where r a is the light absorption rate of the sample see sm section a8 the apparent quantum yield of triplets a q y e 3 f o m was calculated using equation 5 erickson et al 2018 mccabe and arnold 2016 5 a q y e 3 f o m f t m p k q k t t m p ffa loss was also modeled assuming pseudo first order kinetics to obtain the rate constant k obs ffa the steady state concentration of singlet oxygen was calculated using equation 6 6 o 2 1 s s k o b s f f a k s f f a where k s ffa is the second order rate constant of singlet oxygen with ffa dalrymple et al 2010 mccabe and arnold 2016 this rate constant is temperature dependent and with an average temperature inside the solar simulator of 33 c the rate constant used for this analysis was 1 22 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 the quantum yield of 1o2 q y o 2 1 was calculated using the following equation 7 q y o 2 1 o 2 1 s s k d s r a where k d s is the decay rate of 1o2 which was assumed to be 2 81 105 s 1 erickson et al 2018 mccabe and arnold 2016 2 9 data analysis the slopes of linear regression modeling of the natural log of tmp or ffa concentration versus irradiation time were used to estimate pseudo first order rate constants spearman correlation values and p values were estimated using the cor tes function in the software package r version 3 4 1 set to the spearman method one way anova tests were run using the aov function in r anova is a statistical method to test if the variably within a data set is greater than the variability between data sets i e if that data group is truly different from other groups or if the differences can be explained by large variability within data sets data were separated into groups spring summer fall or winter sampling or by plant disinfection method etc a data group was defined as statistically different from other groups by an anova output of less than 0 05 which corresponds to a significance level of greater than 95 pearson correlations were calculated using the linear regression function in microsoft excel 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality and spectral parameters with 94 different water samples this is the largest set of efom samples studied to date before any analysis of ppri production was completed comparisons of water chemistry data and spectral parameters were performed to determine if samples could be distinguished from others based on their season or location of collection or treatment processes used in their plant of origin the samples from the becker wastewater treatment plant were consistent outliers in the majority of analyses this may be due to the waste from a local cardboard plant that the becker wwtp treats resulting in visibly yellow effluent these samples therefore were removed from all subsequent analyses the data from this particular effluent are provided in the sm a summary of water quality parameters including ph conductivity total dissolved solids total organic carbon total inorganic carbon alkalinity anion concentrations and ferrous and ferric iron levels for all samples is provided in section a3 of the sm parameters likely to correlate with the production of ppris nitrate concentration nitrite concentration doc alkalinity e2 e3 hix and β α were sorted by season during which the effluent was collected a one way anova test was performed to see if any grouping of data occurred based on season of sampling a similar anova analysis was repeated where grouping of data was based on the presence of a specific operation in the wastewater treatment train biological treatment phosphorus removal disinfection method and any combinations thereof a final anova test was completed on groupings based on sampling location results from the one way anova tests are listed in section a9 of the sm none of these analyses yielded any consistent separation of data when grouped by season location or treatment train this indicates that all of the effluent waters have similar properties even though they have different treatment trains and come from different locations given that wastewater treatment plants use similar treatment processes with similar treatment goals it is not surprising that effluent waters have overall similar chemical and spectral characteristics because anova analysis did not demonstrate statistical differences in the measured spectral e2 e3 hix β α or chemical nitrate concentration nitrite concentration doc alkalinity parameters of the efom samples all samples were treated as a single data set specific efom parameters most likely to predict the production of ppris are doc and spectral features a summary of these data is provided in table 1 included are samples taken from the two effluent dominated rivers which have little effect on the range and average of parameters shown for comparison data from stormwater and surface waters during storm events across the minneapolis st paul metro region is also provided in table 1 mccabe and arnold 2017 these anthropogenically impacted samples were collected from areas having land uses ranging from open water to highly developed urban and were previously analyzed for ppri production mccabe and arnold 2017 overall the effluent samples have lower average values and less variation in doc e2 e3 suva254 and hix than the stormwaters the difference in doc variability range between the effluent and stormwater data could be expected given that organic matter in wastewater effluent has experienced similar treatment conditions whereas stormwater sample were collected from a variety of land uses effluent samples also contained lower doc concentrations on average than stormwater samples this indicates that within a given region the organic matter concentration of effluent waters may be lower than in stormwaters the spectral results indicate that the studied efom has higher molecular weight is less aromatic and has less variation in spectral parameters than the minnesota stormwaters the e2 e3 of effluent was lower on average than that of stormwaters and efom also had a tighter range of e2 e3 values this indicates the efom might be comprised of larger molecules than the om in the stormwaters the e2 e3 values determined for the effluent receiving rivers by bodhipaksha et al 2015 4 4 for hockanum river 5 2 for miami river and 4 3 for pomperaug river were within the range observed for effluent here suva254 values also fell within a narrow range for effluent samples standard deviation of 1 0 l m 1 mg c 1 for effluents compared to 2 6 l m 1 mg c 1 for stormwaters and 3 4 l m 1 mg c 1 for urban stormwaters and the values for efom were lower than suva254 values reported for the urban stormwaters mccabe and arnold 2017 this higher suva254 for natural waters relative to effluent has been observed previously bodhipaksha et al 2017 found suva254 values of 5 1 2 8 and 3 9 l m 1 mg c 1 for three effluent receiving waters which is within the range observed here the effluent samples show slightly lower hix values indicative of lower aromatic content for efom mckay et al 2017 the hix comparison thus reinforces the suva254 results thus efom appears to be less aromatic than the stormwater om from the same area with little variation in aromaticity across effluent waters from different treatment plants 3 2 quantum yield coefficient of 3efom the kinetic data from tmp experiments was used to find k obs tmp for each sample example plots and k obs tmp values for each sample are found in section a10 of the sm the ph was found to be unchanged over the course of the photolysis experiments high levels of doc above 10 mg l have been shown to cause inhibition of tmp photolysis due to self quenching mccabe and arnold 2017 this appears as a leveling off in a plot of k obs tmp versus doc because doc values of almost all samples in the collected data set are below 10 mg l inhibition of tmp was thought to be unlikely based on previous analyses mccabe and arnold 2017 this is demonstrated in fig 1 where the k obs tmp of the effluent increases with doc over the entire concentration range and no clear evidence of inhibition was observed whereas inhibition was seen at doc 10 mg l for stormwaters mccabe and arnold 2017 thus the effluent data were not adjusted for inhibition of tmp reaction by organic matter interestingly from the data in fig 1 it appears that the wastewater samples behave as a subset of the stormwater samples specifically urban stormwaters i e highly anthropogenically impacted waters and the overall magnitudes of k obs tmp for a given doc level are similar between the two data sets the spearman rank correlation for the wastewater effluents is weaker but this may be due to the smaller size of the data set and narrower range in doc the measured k obs tmp values were used to estimate f tmp for each sample eq 4 it is important to note that r a which is used in the calculation of f tmp is dependent upon the wavelength range over which r a is integrated canonica et al 1995a thus comparisons of f tmp values between studies are only valid if the same integration range for r a is used the integration range chosen here is 275 to 600 nm this captures the full light absorption spectrum of the efom over the emission range of the lamp used which has some bleed below 290 nm even with the filter a table of r a values both from 275 to 600 nm and the 275 to 400 nm range used in other studies mccabe and arnold 2017 2016 mckay et al 2017 is provided in section a5 of the sm the f tmp value has been previously shown to increase with increasing e2 e3 bodhipaksha et al 2017 cawley et al 2015 mccabe and arnold 2017 2016 mckay et al 2017 indicating that om smaller in molecular size leads to a greater yield of 3om mccabe and arnold 2017 mckay et al 2016 this relationship for the effluent samples is shown in fig 2 although the spearman rank correlation constant is low e2 e3 was found to be the best predictor of f tmp in effluent waters out of all the spectral and water characteristics tested this range of e2 e3 is narrow compared to other studies for example mckay et al 2017 integrated r a from 290 to 400 nm and found e2 e3 values for florida everglades waters ranging from 5 to 17 with f tmp values of 30 300 l mol photon 1 in the study by bodhipaksha et al 2015 for which r a was determined at 365 nm or integrated from 350 to 400 nm found f tmp values for three effluent receiving rivers of 60 l mol photon 1 for hockanum river 100 l mol photon 1 for miami river and 40 l mol photon 1 for pomperaug river and an f tmp for an effluent sample of 340 l mol photon 1 these fall within the range of f tmp values determined here this study also found an upward trend between e2 e3 and f tmp bodhipaksha et al 2015 a comparison of f tmp values for r a integrated from 275 to 400 nm to the values for stormwaters table 1 and fig 1 that also used this narrower r a range is shown in section a11 of the sm again the effluents appear to be a subset of stormwater data and are most similar to urban stormwaters the trend of increasing f tmp with increasing e2 e3 indicates that decreasing om size leads to more efficient production of 3efom consistent with previous reports for nom lin et al 2017 mccabe and arnold 2018 3 3 determination of kt tmp for effluent waters to convert from quantum yield coefficient f tmp to apparent triplet quantum yield a q y 3 e f o m a value of k t tmp has to be determined for the water samples studied this k t tmp estimate also depends on the choice of k q because r f t and aqy depend on k t tmp eqs 2 and 5 which in turn depends on k q care must be taken when choosing a k q value there is some uncertainty regarding the value of k q it has been suggested this value may be unique to each water and cannot be assumed to be constant for all waters maizel and remucal 2017c the commonly used value of k q is 5 2 5 105 s 1 mccabe and arnold 2016 2017 whereas a more recent value measured with laser flash photolysis was estimated as 3 13 0 43 105 s 1 erickson et al 2018 this newer value is used herein the plot of 1 k obs tmp versus tmp 0 used to calculate k t tmp using eq 2 is shown in fig 3 this analysis yields a k t tmp of 7 79 3 03 108 m 1s 1 for the tested effluent waters this is at the lower end of the range of reported values determined or estimated for other organic matter samples but is consistent with the 8 1 2 2 108 m 1s 1 for organic matter isolates and natural water samples and a value previously reported for natural organic matter in wetlands 1 8 0 4 109 m 1s 1 erickson et al 2018 mccabe and arnold 2016 the choice of k q directly impacts the value of k t tmp when obtaining the desired parameters from the y intercept i e both k q and k t tmp are included in the y intercept of equation 2 the value returned when solving for k t tmp thus varies depending on the value of k q ultimately however the impact on the calculation of a q y 3 e f o m is small because changes in the magnitude of the two variables co vary and cancel in subsequent analyses i e when using equation 5 but only if k t tmp values are measured for the specific sample set in question rather than using a literature value in any case direct comparison of a q y e 3 f o m should only be made to previous values if similar protocols and wavelength ranges for r a and k q values are used once a value of k t tmp is determined estimations of the rate of formation of triplets r f t for each water sample were made using equation 2 the initial concentration of tmp 5 μm and the k obs tmp values measured for each sample table a10 1 r f t has previously been shown to increase with increasing doc mccabe and arnold 2017 the r f t and r a for each sample are plotted in fig 4 as a function of doc while both r a and r f t increase with doc there is significantly more scatter with r f t than with r a and thus the relationship with r a is stronger this could mean that while the doc in the effluent waters samples is chromophoric only a portion of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom contributes to 3efom formation there is also a large amount of scatter in the r f t versus r a relationship as described above the effluent waters had very similar spectral characteristics this plot however shows that the range of a q y 3 e f o m is large and the values are consistent with those determined using eq 5 and shown in fig 2 this means that while the waters may have similar bulk spectral characteristics they may have either different available pools of efom capable of forming 3efom or different pools of doc capable of quenching 3efom given that increasing doc does not appreciably inhibit 3efom over the concentration range of the effluent samples fig 1 it is likely that different pools of 3efom precursors exist within the range of effluent samples studied further study across different waters is needed to confirm this conclusion the 3efom data were also sorted by plant season sampled and wastewater plant treatment train and a series of one way anova tests was performed as with the bulk spectral and water quality properties no significant separation of sample groups was observed for f tmp k obs tmp r f t and a q y 3 e f o m section a9 this means that neither location season nor treatment method predict 3efom production for these effluent samples 3 4 production of singlet oxygen from efom a table of k obs ffa for each sample is found in section a12 of the sm these values of k obs ffa were used along with k s ffa and equation 6 to determine o 2 1 s s which in turn was used with equation 7 and r a integrated over the range 275 to 600 nm to calculate q y o 2 1 the q y o 2 1 values from the effluent water samples analyzed ranged from 0 007 to 0 035 with one higher value of 0 064 the q y o 2 1 is dependent on r a and the wavelength range over which r a is calculated impacts its final estimate if we reduce the integration range of r a to 275 to 400 nm the range of q y o 2 1 is 0 022 to 0 159 this is higher than the range previously reported for several nom samples and isolates 0 0059 0 045 with an r a integrated from 290 to 400 nm dalrymple et al 2010 the authors indicated this captures 65 of the r a and is dominated by the light absorption at 365 nm dalrymple et al 2010 bodhipaksha et al 2015 estimated a q y o 2 1 of 0 022 0 034 and 0 029 for three effluent receiving rivers the r a for this study was either the r a at 365 nm or the r a integrated from 350 to 400 nm mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 estimated q y o 2 1 of 0 0277 0 0318 and 0 0466 for three effluent samples with an r a integrated from 290 to 400 nm this again is on the lower end of the values for efom in the present work mckay et al 2017 estimated a range of q y o 2 1 of 0 02 to 0 10 for samples taken from the florida everglades with r a also integrated from 290 to 400 nm these comparisons show that a smaller r a integration range results in a larger estimate of q y o 2 1 therefore studies that integrate only up to 400 nm may represent overestimates of q y o 2 1 based on the data presented below we propose that q y o 2 1 determined when integrating from 275 to 600 nm are closer to the true range of q y o 2 1 in effluent waters e2 e3 has been reported to be a predictor of the yield of 1o2 production bodhipaksha et al 2017 2015 cawley et al 2015 dalrymple et al 2010 mckay et al 2017 sharpless 2012 and this relationship is assessed for the efom samples in fig 5 though the number of samples analyzed for q y o 2 1 is smaller than the number analyzed for a q y 3 e f o m greater e2 e3 ratios again lead to greater q y o 2 1 because 1o2 is produced by reaction of 3efom with dissolved oxygen this matches expectations the efficiency of 1o2 production from 3efom is seen in a plot of q y o 2 1 versus a q y 3 e f o m as shown in fig 6 the efficiency of the conversion of 3efom to 1o2 is 54 as given by the slope an efficiency of 100 is expected for this process given the other known decay processes for triplet excited states such as reactions with other molecules in the effluent thermal relaxation quenching by dissolved oxygen that does not produce 1o2 and other non radiative decay pathways mcneill and canonica 2016 the relationship between q y o 2 1 and a q y 3 e f o m provides insight into the range of triplets sampled by the tmp in effluent samples mcneill and canonica 2016 recently published a comprehensive review on the formation energetics reactivity and approaches used to model and quantify excited state triplet chromophoric dissolved organic matter 3cdom their review highlights mechanistic and energetic differences between energy and electron transfer probes with dissolved oxygen and the subsequent formation of 1o2 an example of the former and tmp an example of the latter the energy requirement to produce 1o2 from dissolved ground state oxygen is 94 kj mol while tmp has a one electron oxidation potential of 1 22 v mcneill and canonica 2016 the relatively low energy gap between ground state o2 and 1o2 means that 1o2 is capable of sampling essentially all 3cdom while lower energy triplets may not be capable of oxidizing tmp in this scenario tmp samples a smaller more energetic subset of 3cdom than is represented by 1o2 measurements this hypothesis has also been presented by maizel and remucal 2017c because o2 reacts with a larger pool of 3cdom this manifests as higher q y o 2 1 values than a q y e 3 f o m values i e q y o 2 1 to a q y e 3 f o m ratios greater than 1 and such differences have been reported maizel and remucal 2017c mccabe and arnold 2016 in contrast the results reported herein show q y o 2 1 values that are lower by about a factor of 2 than a q y e 3 f o m values measured by tmp the results of this work suggest that tmp samples a larger fraction of available triplets in the studied effluents than did past studies that employed dual 1o2 and tmp approaches to quantify 3cdom a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that a greater fraction of 3efom in the effluents may be of higher energy than of the 3cdom used in past studies in this case most or all of the 3efom is energetic enough to both excite o2 to 1o2 and to oxidize tmp and that the differences in q y o 2 1 and a q y e 3 f o m values reflect the fraction of 3efom decay processes that produce 1o2 another possibility is that the 3efom used in this study may have a lower efficiency of 1o2 production when quenched by o2 the f δ term described by mcneill and canonica 2016 in this scenario o2 may still be sampling a greater fraction of excited triplet states but with a lower fraction of 1o2 produced from the results of this study we cannot distinguish between these different possibilities but if the former case is operative i e 3efom has a larger fraction of higher energy triplets capable of oxidizing tmp than does 3nom this may explain why previous studies have shown that 3efom reacts with a broader range of pollutants and or more efficiently with pollutants than does 3nom for the samples studied complicating factors due to self quenching are unlikely to be important because the doc levels are below those where inhibition has been shown doc 10 mg l the reactivity of 3efom with aquatic pollutants compared to 3nom needs additional attention especially because this work indicates the average energy of 3efom may be greater than that of 3nom 4 conclusions municipal wastewater effluents have similar chemical and spectral properties thus as effluent flows become larger portions of surface waters over natural flows it is likely that surface waters receiving effluent will become more similar in spectral characteristics water chemistry and photo reactivity increasing e2 e3 and doc are associated with increasing production yields of 3efom and 1o2 there are uncertainties up to 10 fold however associated with using these measurements as predictors of the quantum yields for these ppris specific quantum yields are dependent on the parameters used specifically k t tmp and k q which may be unique to each water and r a which is dependent on wavelength integration range this must be considered when evaluating uncertainties and when comparing values obtained from different studies tmp appears to be an appropriate probe for quantifying 3efom because it reacts with the vast majority of triplets excited states produced in efom this allows production of 1o2 to also be accurately determined based on the 50 expected yield of 1o2 from 3efom while this is true for the 94 samples in this study further work is needed to evaluate if this is generally representative of efom samples and how effective tmp is in measuring triplet excited states in a variety of nom samples efom produces 3om and 1o2 more efficiently than nom and the 3om produced may have higher energy than that produced by nom as surface waters become more effluent dominated water chemistry spectral characteristics and photoreactivity may become more similar and distinct from nom containing waters more work is needed to see if this holds for other ppris such as superoxide or hydroxyl radical as well acknowledgements this work was primarily supported by the

18890,the organic matter present in wastewater effluents efom is likely to have different properties than the organic matter present in the receiving water the properties of efom will affect the fate of contaminants of emerging concern because efom is a source of photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris capable of transforming contaminants effluent water samples were taken seasonally from sixteen wastewater treatment plants in minnesota and two effluent dominated rivers in california and arizona samples n 94 were tested for water chemistry light absorption characteristics and excited state triplet organic matter 3efom and singlet oxygen 1o2 production based on analysis of spectral parameters efom had higher molecular weight and lower aromatic content than organic matter present in stormwaters from minnesota which are representative of human impacted natural organic matter nom containing waters the second order rate constant for the reaction of the 3efom probe 2 4 6 trimethylephenol k t tmp for the effluents was 7 79 3 03 108 m 1s 1 and this value was used to calculate apparent quantum yields for 3efom production which ranged from 0 006 to 0 114 the quantum yield for the production of singlet oxygen ranged from 0 007 to 0 064 processes in the wastewater treatment train season and water chemistry parameters did not serve as predictors of 3efom or 1o2 production among the parameters measured spearman rank correlations were strongest between quantum yields of 1o2 and 3efom and e2 e3 absorption at 250 nm absorption at 365 nm this relationship however is weaker than that previously observed for nom the efficiency of 1o2 production from 3efom was 54 results indicate that 2 4 6 trimethylphenol samples nearly all of the triplets in efom that have sufficient energy to produce 1o2 which may not be the case for nom graphical abstract image 1 keywords effluent organic matter triplet organic matter singlet oxygen wastewater effluent 2 4 6 trimethylphenol 1 introduction as populations continue to grow flows in and out of wastewater treatment plants wwtps will increase as will the percentages of wastewater effluent present in surface waters in some regions effluent already dominates the flow in riverine systems bradley et al 1995 kim et al 2002 luthy et al 2015 reilly et al 2000 westerhoff and anning 2000 thus studying the organic matter composition and its impact on the photochemical degradation of pollutants in these impacted waters is increasing in importance shon et al 2006 the organic matter contained in effluent waters is effluent organic matter efom efom contains a mixture of influent natural organic matter nom remaining after water treatment soluble microbial products smps from the wastewater treatment process organic contaminants and various degradation products chen et al 2003 gonsior et al 2011 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 nam and amy 2008 shon et al 2006 while efom is the organic matter from effluent water nom is the organic matter present in natural environments and waters while some similarities have been found between nom and efom there are key differences nam and amy 2008 efom is primarily autochthonous and largely comprised of smps and macromolecules whereas nom is more often allochthonous in origin and comprised of humic and fulvic acids nam and amy 2008 because efom is a mixture of numerous chemical compounds and full characterization of all its components is infeasible parameters such as light absorption and organic carbon levels may serve as means to estimate efom composition maizel and remucal 2017a suva254 absorbance at 254 nm normalized by the dissolved organic carbon content doc is a surrogate for aromatic content with higher suva254 corresponding to higher aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 reported suva254 values range from 2 58 l m 1 mg c 1 to 6 33 l m 1 mg c 1 for efom and 2 67 l m 1 mg c 1 to 13 10 l m 1 mg c 1 for nom on a napierian scale cho et al 1998 fabris et al 2008 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 this indicates that efom is generally lower in aromatic content compared to nom another spectral parameter e2 e3 the ratio of the absorbance at 250 nm to the absorbance at 365 nm has also been used to gather information about efom maizel and remucal 2017b e2 e3 increases with decreasing molecular weight maizel and remucal 2017a peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 thus if the e2 e3 is lower 3 5 5 0 the molecules are larger and mostly likely allochthonous organic matter maizel and remucal 2017b peterson et al 2012 if the e2 e3 is higher 7 10 the molecules are smaller and likely autochthonous organic matter helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017b efom e2 e3 ratios are reported as within a range of 5 0 7 0 consistent with material partially derived from microorganisms as well as allochthonous sources bodhipaksha et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017b mckay et al 2016 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 there are also differences in the specific chemicals that comprise efom and nom efom has a higher protein content than nom nam and amy 2008 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has shown that efom has much narrower ranges of mass distribution than nom 250 400 m z for efom compared to 150 600 m z for nom gonsior et al 2011 maizel and remucal 2017a the largest abundance of molecules in efom was found to correspond to surfactants and degradation products of those surfactants the surfactants are high in sulfur which results in efom having higher sulfur content than nom gonsior et al 2011 maizel and remucal 2017b shon et al 2006 efom also contains more chlorine likely from disinfection of the effluent nitrogen and phosphorus than nom maizel and remucal 2017b nam and amy 2008 indirect photolysis reactions driven by production of photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris have been shown to be important loss processes for many contaminants of emerging concern cecs an et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 canonica 2007 canonica et al 1995a canonica and hoigne 1995 filipe et al 2017 guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 zepp et al 1987 because wastewater effluent contains cecs as well as efom ppri production from efom rather than nom may drive photochemical reactions in sunlit effluent receiving waters and thus persistence of cecs in effluent dominated systems because cecs may have adverse effects on aquatic life and their presence in drinking water sources is undesirable accurate prediction of cec fate is needed thus it is critical to have information about both the production rates of ppris and reaction rates for cecs with ppris ppri production rates are not readily available in regards to effluent impacted systems the source and composition of the organic matter allochthonous or autochthonous will influence its photo reactivity the photoexcitation of organic matter both natural and effluent leads to the formation of various ppris these species include triplet excited state organic matter 3om singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radical oh and carbonate radical co3 canonica et al 1995a canonica and hoigne 1995 faust and hoigne 1987 garg et al 2011 mill et al 1980 minella et al 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2003 vione et al 2014 zepp et al 1977 zhang et al 2014 once formed ppris degrade pollutants found in aquatic systems through indirect photolysis an et al 2016 li et al 2016 ryan et al 2011 yan et al 2017 ppris have low steady state concentrations in surface waters 10 12 m 10 18 m al housari et al 2010 haag and hoigne 1986 mill et al 1980 mopper and zhou 1990 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 peterson et al 2012 zepp et al 1987 1985 and thus reactions with probe molecules are often used to quantify ppris and calculate quantum yields for their production i e the fraction of light absorption events that lead to production of a given ppri common probes are 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp and sorbic acid for 3om faust and hoigne 1987 grebel et al 2011 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 vione et al 2018 furfuryl alcohol ffa for 1o2 appiani et al 2017 haag et al 1984 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 and terephthalic acid tpa for oh lin et al 2017 page et al 2010 in general the formation of 3om is a key step in the production of other downstream ppris whereby species such as 1o2 and oh are formed from subsequent reaction of energy transfer from 3om bodhipaksha et al 2015 latch 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 zepp et al 1985 1977 in addition to producing downstream ppris triplet organic matter is itself an important ppri in the degradation of pollutants 3om reacts with contaminants through oxidation and it is known to be particularly reactive with phenols and aromatic amines an et al 2016 arnold 2014 arnold et al 2017 ryan et al 2011 schmitt et al 2017 vione et al 2018 triplet organic matter is not one molecule but rather a combination of various triplet state compounds with a range of excited state energies and reduction potentials which makes it difficult to characterize arnold et al 2017 mcneill and canonica 2016 schmitt et al 2017 sharpless 2012 thus triplets with different energies will react with different chemicals functional groups depending on their energies and redox potentials arnold et al 2017 mcneill and canonica 2016 evidence suggests ppri production is related to molecular weight of the om with increasing molecular weight resulting in decreased quantum yield of 3om and 1o2 maizel and remucal 2017a this is illustrated with the e2 e3 ratio with decreasing e2 e3 and thus increasing molecular weight resulting in decreasing quantum yields maizel and remucal 2017a thus the processing of nom and production of smps to give the final efom composition may impact ppri production via the changes in the om molecular structure maizel and remucal 2017a preliminary evidence shows that efom photochemical behavior deviates from that of nom silva et al 2017 found that efom from pinerolo italy more efficiently produced 3om than suwannee river nom srnom other studies have indicated that efom has lower molecular weight and produces 3om and 1o2 more efficiently than nom and thus efom may lead to more rapid indirect photochemical degradation of cecs bodhipaksha et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017a this may be due to efom being a more efficient photosensitizer than nom ryan et al 2011 more rapid indirect photolysis of a number of pollutants in the presence of efom has been observed ryan et al 2011 found more rapid photo decay of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in efom containing waters than in nom containing waters in samples when comparing two wastewater plant effluents with a local lake guerard et al 2009 found that sulfadimethoxine photochemically degraded faster in the presence of autochthonous om than in allochthonous om meaning that sulfadimethoxine will likely decay faster in efom containing waters than in surface waters dominated by allochthonous nom bodhipaksha et al 2017 determined that indirect photolysis rates were greater in the presence of efom than in natural waters for various contaminants including caffeine cimetidine sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethoxazole commonly found in wastewater effluents contaminant photolysis in natural waters mixed with effluent waters resulted in greater degradation rates with a greater proportion of effluent bodhipaksha et al 2017 previous results however found that effluent waters may lead to decreased degradation rates for pollutants when mixed with nom bodhipaksha et al 2015 an explanation for these contradicting results is the potential quenching of reactive efom ppris by the nom when combined bodhipaksha et al 2017 unless the quantum yield of the ppri in this case oh involved in the degradation reaction is much higher in effluent than natural water large amounts of effluent water are needed to overcome the quenching by nom to yield an increased total ppri quantum yield when effluent water is mixed with the natural waters bodhipaksha et al 2017 in this study the formation of 3efom and 1o2 production from 3efom was analyzed effluents were taken seasonally from sixteen wastewater treatment plants in minnesota which use various treatment processes as well as two effluent dominated rivers the santa cruz river in arizona and the santa ana river in california the set of 94 efom samples used herein to assess ppri production is the largest studied to date ppri production for each sample was quantified using tmp and ffa as probe compounds for 3efom and 1o2 respectively in laboratory irradiation experiments the kinetic data and light absorption rates of the water samples were used to calculate quantum yields for production of 3efom and 1o2 any effects of wastewater treatment processes season in which the samples were collected or location were explored using a one way anova statistical test relationships between ppri production and efom spectral properties were also explored and the suitability of tmp

fi which are listed in section a6 of the sm coble 1996 rosario ortiz and korak 2017 2 5 photolysis experiments with tmp tmp was used as a probe to measure 3efom tmp does not degrade via direct photolysis and has limited reactivity with other ppris including 1o2 aguer et al 2005 canonica et al 1995b maizel and remucal 2017a wenk et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 aliquots of each water sample 25 ml were spiked with 50 μl of an aqueous stock of 2 5 mm tmp to give 5 μm initial tmp concentrations which has been shown to be an appropriate concentration for studying 3om mccabe and arnold 2017 the tmp containing solutions were then split into triplicate quartz test tubes capped and placed in an atlas suntest cps solar simulator using a xenon arc lamp a 290 nm cutoff filter was used and the lamp intensity was set to 350 w m2 between 300 and 800 nm tmp samples were irradiated for 50 min and samples were taken over time for analysis all samples were analyzed via high pressure liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 series ascentis rp amide column or eclipse xdb c18 column using the methods from section a7 of the sm to determine tmp concentration as a function of time one of the parameters needed to determine the quantum yield of triplet production is the second order rate constant of tmp with 3om k t tmp values reported in the literature range from 0 81 109 m 1s 1 to 10 109 m 1 s 1 and recent work has shown variation in k t tmp among different water samples and nom isolates al housari et al 2010 canonica et al 2000 erickson et al 2018 golanoski et al 2012 mccabe and arnold 2017 2016 zepp et al 1985 thus experiments were performed to determine k t tmp in a subset of collected wastewater samples and it was assumed this value would apply to all collected samples five different target concentrations of tmp 50 100 200 500 and 750 μm were dissolved in four wastewater samples that represented a span of pseudo first order rate constant k obs tmp values and stirred continuously for five days solutions were then centrifuged to separate any undissolved tmp and the remaining solution 25 ml was added to quartz test tubes in triplicate samples were then irradiated following the method described above analysis of samples by hplc and kinetic modeling assuming pseudo first order kinetics yields a tmp 0 and k obs tmp for each sample this allowed for the rate of triplet formation r f t and k t tmp to be estimated using equation 2 mccabe and arnold 2017 2 1 k o b s t m p 1 r f t t m p 0 k q r f t k t t m p a linear regression of 1 k obs tmp vs tmp 0 values yielded a slope of 1 r f t the value for the rate constant for quenching of triplets k q is 3 13 0 43 105 s 1 erickson et al 2018 the intercept of the linear regression together with r f t and k q were used to determine an estimate of k t tmp mccabe and arnold 2017 2 6 photolysis experiments with ffa ffa was used as a probe to measure 1o2 production a 50 μl aliquot of an aqueous stock of 5 mm ffa was added to aliquots of 25 ml effluent samples to reach an initial concentration of 10 μm these solutions were then divided into triplicate quartz test tubes capped and placed in the solar simulator using the same irradiation conditions as in the tmp experiments ffa experiments were irradiated for 2 h and sampled periodically to quantify ffa concentrations all samples were analyzed via hplc using the method from section a7 of the sm 2 7 chemical actinometry actinometery experiments were performed in parallel with tmp and ffa experiments using p nitroanisole pna pyridine as the actinometer the pna concentrations were monitored using hplc section a7 of the sm the actinometer is required to estimate the photon output of the lamp during tmp and ffa experiments which yields an estimate of the rate of light absorption of the effluent water samples r a and thus allows estimation of quantum yields the actinometer experimental procedure is described in detail in laszakovits et al 2017 and the relevant equations are given in section a8 in the sm 2 8 calculation of apparent quantum yields tmp decay was assumed to follow pseudo first order kinetics assuming that the 3efom concentration remains constant during the irradiation process and that the tmp decay is due exclusively to the reaction with 3efom the loss of tmp is given by 3 d t m p d t k o b s t m p t m p k t t m p e 3 f o m s s t m p the quantum yield coefficient for triplets f tmp is calculated using equation 4 4 f t m p k o b s t m p r a where r a is the light absorption rate of the sample see sm section a8 the apparent quantum yield of triplets a q y e 3 f o m was calculated using equation 5 erickson et al 2018 mccabe and arnold 2016 5 a q y e 3 f o m f t m p k q k t t m p ffa loss was also modeled assuming pseudo first order kinetics to obtain the rate constant k obs ffa the steady state concentration of singlet oxygen was calculated using equation 6 6 o 2 1 s s k o b s f f a k s f f a where k s ffa is the second order rate constant of singlet oxygen with ffa dalrymple et al 2010 mccabe and arnold 2016 this rate constant is temperature dependent and with an average temperature inside the solar simulator of 33 c the rate constant used for this analysis was 1 22 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 the quantum yield of 1o2 q y o 2 1 was calculated using the following equation 7 q y o 2 1 o 2 1 s s k d s r a where k d s is the decay rate of 1o2 which was assumed to be 2 81 105 s 1 erickson et al 2018 mccabe and arnold 2016 2 9 data analysis the slopes of linear regression modeling of the natural log of tmp or ffa concentration versus irradiation time were used to estimate pseudo first order rate constants spearman correlation values and p values were estimated using the cor tes function in the software package r version 3 4 1 set to the spearman method one way anova tests were run using the aov function in r anova is a statistical method to test if the variably within a data set is greater than the variability between data sets i e if that data group is truly different from other groups or if the differences can be explained by large variability within data sets data were separated into groups spring summer fall or winter sampling or by plant disinfection method etc a data group was defined as statistically different from other groups by an anova output of less than 0 05 which corresponds to a significance level of greater than 95 pearson correlations were calculated using the linear regression function in microsoft excel 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality and spectral parameters with 94 different water samples this is the largest set of efom samples studied to date before any analysis of ppri production was completed comparisons of water chemistry data and spectral parameters were performed to determine if samples could be distinguished from others based on their season or location of collection or treatment processes used in their plant of origin the samples from the becker wastewater treatment plant were consistent outliers in the majority of analyses this may be due to the waste from a local cardboard plant that the becker wwtp treats resulting in visibly yellow effluent these samples therefore were removed from all subsequent analyses the data from this particular effluent are provided in the sm a summary of water quality parameters including ph conductivity total dissolved solids total organic carbon total inorganic carbon alkalinity anion concentrations and ferrous and ferric iron levels for all samples is provided in section a3 of the sm parameters likely to correlate with the production of ppris nitrate concentration nitrite concentration doc alkalinity e2 e3 hix and β α were sorted by season during which the effluent was collected a one way anova test was performed to see if any grouping of data occurred based on season of sampling a similar anova analysis was repeated where grouping of data was based on the presence of a specific operation in the wastewater treatment train biological treatment phosphorus removal disinfection method and any combinations thereof a final anova test was completed on groupings based on sampling location results from the one way anova tests are listed in section a9 of the sm none of these analyses yielded any consistent separation of data when grouped by season location or treatment train this indicates that all of the effluent waters have similar properties even though they have different treatment trains and come from different locations given that wastewater treatment plants use similar treatment processes with similar treatment goals it is not surprising that effluent waters have overall similar chemical and spectral characteristics because anova analysis did not demonstrate statistical differences in the measured spectral e2 e3 hix β α or chemical nitrate concentration nitrite concentration doc alkalinity parameters of the efom samples all samples were treated as a single data set specific efom parameters most likely to predict the production of ppris are doc and spectral features a summary of these data is provided in table 1 included are samples taken from the two effluent dominated rivers which have little effect on the range and average of parameters shown for comparison data from stormwater and surface waters during storm events across the minneapolis st paul metro region is also provided in table 1 mccabe and arnold 2017 these anthropogenically impacted samples were collected from areas having land uses ranging from open water to highly developed urban and were previously analyzed for ppri production mccabe and arnold 2017 overall the effluent samples have lower average values and less variation in doc e2 e3 suva254 and hix than the stormwaters the difference in doc variability range between the effluent and stormwater data could be expected given that organic matter in wastewater effluent has experienced similar treatment conditions whereas stormwater sample were collected from a variety of land uses effluent samples also contained lower doc concentrations on average than stormwater samples this indicates that within a given region the organic matter concentration of effluent waters may be lower than in stormwaters the spectral results indicate that the studied efom has higher molecular weight is less aromatic and has less variation in spectral parameters than the minnesota stormwaters the e2 e3 of effluent was lower on average than that of stormwaters and efom also had a tighter range of e2 e3 values this indicates the efom might be comprised of larger molecules than the om in the stormwaters the e2 e3 values determined for the effluent receiving rivers by bodhipaksha et al 2015 4 4 for hockanum river 5 2 for miami river and 4 3 for pomperaug river were within the range observed for effluent here suva254 values also fell within a narrow range for effluent samples standard deviation of 1 0 l m 1 mg c 1 for effluents compared to 2 6 l m 1 mg c 1 for stormwaters and 3 4 l m 1 mg c 1 for urban stormwaters and the values for efom were lower than suva254 values reported for the urban stormwaters mccabe and arnold 2017 this higher suva254 for natural waters relative to effluent has been observed previously bodhipaksha et al 2017 found suva254 values of 5 1 2 8 and 3 9 l m 1 mg c 1 for three effluent receiving waters which is within the range observed here the effluent samples show slightly lower hix values indicative of lower aromatic content for efom mckay et al 2017 the hix comparison thus reinforces the suva254 results thus efom appears to be less aromatic than the stormwater om from the same area with little variation in aromaticity across effluent waters from different treatment plants 3 2 quantum yield coefficient of 3efom the kinetic data from tmp experiments was used to find k obs tmp for each sample example plots and k obs tmp values for each sample are found in section a10 of the sm the ph was found to be unchanged over the course of the photolysis experiments high levels of doc above 10 mg l have been shown to cause inhibition of tmp photolysis due to self quenching mccabe and arnold 2017 this appears as a leveling off in a plot of k obs tmp versus doc because doc values of almost all samples in the collected data set are below 10 mg l inhibition of tmp was thought to be unlikely based on previous analyses mccabe and arnold 2017 this is demonstrated in fig 1 where the k obs tmp of the effluent increases with doc over the entire concentration range and no clear evidence of inhibition was observed whereas inhibition was seen at doc 10 mg l for stormwaters mccabe and arnold 2017 thus the effluent data were not adjusted for inhibition of tmp reaction by organic matter interestingly from the data in fig 1 it appears that the wastewater samples behave as a subset of the stormwater samples specifically urban stormwaters i e highly anthropogenically impacted waters and the overall magnitudes of k obs tmp for a given doc level are similar between the two data sets the spearman rank correlation for the wastewater effluents is weaker but this may be due to the smaller size of the data set and narrower range in doc the measured k obs tmp values were used to estimate f tmp for each sample eq 4 it is important to note that r a which is used in the calculation of f tmp is dependent upon the wavelength range over which r a is integrated canonica et al 1995a thus comparisons of f tmp values between studies are only valid if the same integration range for r a is used the integration range chosen here is 275 to 600 nm this captures the full light absorption spectrum of the efom over the emission range of the lamp used which has some bleed below 290 nm even with the filter a table of r a values both from 275 to 600 nm and the 275 to 400 nm range used in other studies mccabe and arnold 2017 2016 mckay et al 2017 is provided in section a5 of the sm the f tmp value has been previously shown to increase with increasing e2 e3 bodhipaksha et al 2017 cawley et al 2015 mccabe and arnold 2017 2016 mckay et al 2017 indicating that om smaller in molecular size leads to a greater yield of 3om mccabe and arnold 2017 mckay et al 2016 this relationship for the effluent samples is shown in fig 2 although the spearman rank correlation constant is low e2 e3 was found to be the best predictor of f tmp in effluent waters out of all the spectral and water characteristics tested this range of e2 e3 is narrow compared to other studies for example mckay et al 2017 integrated r a from 290 to 400 nm and found e2 e3 values for florida everglades waters ranging from 5 to 17 with f tmp values of 30 300 l mol photon 1 in the study by bodhipaksha et al 2015 for which r a was determined at 365 nm or integrated from 350 to 400 nm found f tmp values for three effluent receiving rivers of 60 l mol photon 1 for hockanum river 100 l mol photon 1 for miami river and 40 l mol photon 1 for pomperaug river and an f tmp for an effluent sample of 340 l mol photon 1 these fall within the range of f tmp values determined here this study also found an upward trend between e2 e3 and f tmp bodhipaksha et al 2015 a comparison of f tmp values for r a integrated from 275 to 400 nm to the values for stormwaters table 1 and fig 1 that also used this narrower r a range is shown in section a11 of the sm again the effluents appear to be a subset of stormwater data and are most similar to urban stormwaters the trend of increasing f tmp with increasing e2 e3 indicates that decreasing om size leads to more efficient production of 3efom consistent with previous reports for nom lin et al 2017 mccabe and arnold 2018 3 3 determination of kt tmp for effluent waters to convert from quantum yield coefficient f tmp to apparent triplet quantum yield a q y 3 e f o m a value of k t tmp has to be determined for the water samples studied this k t tmp estimate also depends on the choice of k q because r f t and aqy depend on k t tmp eqs 2 and 5 which in turn depends on k q care must be taken when choosing a k q value there is some uncertainty regarding the value of k q it has been suggested this value may be unique to each water and cannot be assumed to be constant for all waters maizel and remucal 2017c the commonly used value of k q is 5 2 5 105 s 1 mccabe and arnold 2016 2017 whereas a more recent value measured with laser flash photolysis was estimated as 3 13 0 43 105 s 1 erickson et al 2018 this newer value is used herein the plot of 1 k obs tmp versus tmp 0 used to calculate k t tmp using eq 2 is shown in fig 3 this analysis yields a k t tmp of 7 79 3 03 108 m 1s 1 for the tested effluent waters this is at the lower end of the range of reported values determined or estimated for other organic matter samples but is consistent with the 8 1 2 2 108 m 1s 1 for organic matter isolates and natural water samples and a value previously reported for natural organic matter in wetlands 1 8 0 4 109 m 1s 1 erickson et al 2018 mccabe and arnold 2016 the choice of k q directly impacts the value of k t tmp when obtaining the desired parameters from the y intercept i e both k q and k t tmp are included in the y intercept of equation 2 the value returned when solving for k t tmp thus varies depending on the value of k q ultimately however the impact on the calculation of a q y 3 e f o m is small because changes in the magnitude of the two variables co vary and cancel in subsequent analyses i e when using equation 5 but only if k t tmp values are measured for the specific sample set in question rather than using a literature value in any case direct comparison of a q y e 3 f o m should only be made to previous values if similar protocols and wavelength ranges for r a and k q values are used once a value of k t tmp is determined estimations of the rate of formation of triplets r f t for each water sample were made using equation 2 the initial concentration of tmp 5 μm and the k obs tmp values measured for each sample table a10 1 r f t has previously been shown to increase with increasing doc mccabe and arnold 2017 the r f t and r a for each sample are plotted in fig 4 as a function of doc while both r a and r f t increase with doc there is significantly more scatter with r f t than with r a and thus the relationship with r a is stronger this could mean that while the doc in the effluent waters samples is chromophoric only a portion of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom contributes to 3efom formation there is also a large amount of scatter in the r f t versus r a relationship as described above the effluent waters had very similar spectral characteristics this plot however shows that the range of a q y 3 e f o m is large and the values are consistent with those determined using eq 5 and shown in fig 2 this means that while the waters may have similar bulk spectral characteristics they may have either different available pools of efom capable of forming 3efom or different pools of doc capable of quenching 3efom given that increasing doc does not appreciably inhibit 3efom over the concentration range of the effluent samples fig 1 it is likely that different pools of 3efom precursors exist within the range of effluent samples studied further study across different waters is needed to confirm this conclusion the 3efom data were also sorted by plant season sampled and wastewater plant treatment train and a series of one way anova tests was performed as with the bulk spectral and water quality properties no significant separation of sample groups was observed for f tmp k obs tmp r f t and a q y 3 e f o m section a9 this means that neither location season nor treatment method predict 3efom production for these effluent samples 3 4 production of singlet oxygen from efom a table of k obs ffa for each sample is found in section a12 of the sm these values of k obs ffa were used along with k s ffa and equation 6 to determine o 2 1 s s which in turn was used with equation 7 and r a integrated over the range 275 to 600 nm to calculate q y o 2 1 the q y o 2 1 values from the effluent water samples analyzed ranged from 0 007 to 0 035 with one higher value of 0 064 the q y o 2 1 is dependent on r a and the wavelength range over which r a is calculated impacts its final estimate if we reduce the integration range of r a to 275 to 400 nm the range of q y o 2 1 is 0 022 to 0 159 this is higher than the range previously reported for several nom samples and isolates 0 0059 0 045 with an r a integrated from 290 to 400 nm dalrymple et al 2010 the authors indicated this captures 65 of the r a and is dominated by the light absorption at 365 nm dalrymple et al 2010 bodhipaksha et al 2015 estimated a q y o 2 1 of 0 022 0 034 and 0 029 for three effluent receiving rivers the r a for this study was either the r a at 365 nm or the r a integrated from 350 to 400 nm mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 estimated q y o 2 1 of 0 0277 0 0318 and 0 0466 for three effluent samples with an r a integrated from 290 to 400 nm this again is on the lower end of the values for efom in the present work mckay et al 2017 estimated a range of q y o 2 1 of 0 02 to 0 10 for samples taken from the florida everglades with r a also integrated from 290 to 400 nm these comparisons show that a smaller r a integration range results in a larger estimate of q y o 2 1 therefore studies that integrate only up to 400 nm may represent overestimates of q y o 2 1 based on the data presented below we propose that q y o 2 1 determined when integrating from 275 to 600 nm are closer to the true range of q y o 2 1 in effluent waters e2 e3 has been reported to be a predictor of the yield of 1o2 production bodhipaksha et al 2017 2015 cawley et al 2015 dalrymple et al 2010 mckay et al 2017 sharpless 2012 and this relationship is assessed for the efom samples in fig 5 though the number of samples analyzed for q y o 2 1 is smaller than the number analyzed for a q y 3 e f o m greater e2 e3 ratios again lead to greater q y o 2 1 because 1o2 is produced by reaction of 3efom with dissolved oxygen this matches expectations the efficiency of 1o2 production from 3efom is seen in a plot of q y o 2 1 versus a q y 3 e f o m as shown in fig 6 the efficiency of the conversion of 3efom to 1o2 is 54 as given by the slope an efficiency of 100 is expected for this process given the other known decay processes for triplet excited states such as reactions with other molecules in the effluent thermal relaxation quenching by dissolved oxygen that does not produce 1o2 and other non radiative decay pathways mcneill and canonica 2016 the relationship between q y o 2 1 and a q y 3 e f o m provides insight into the range of triplets sampled by the tmp in effluent samples mcneill and canonica 2016 recently published a comprehensive review on the formation energetics reactivity and approaches used to model and quantify excited state triplet chromophoric dissolved organic matter 3cdom their review highlights mechanistic and energetic differences between energy and electron transfer probes with dissolved oxygen and the subsequent formation of 1o2 an example of the former and tmp an example of the latter the energy requirement to produce 1o2 from dissolved ground state oxygen is 94 kj mol while tmp has a one electron oxidation potential of 1 22 v mcneill and canonica 2016 the relatively low energy gap between ground state o2 and 1o2 means that 1o2 is capable of sampling essentially all 3cdom while lower energy triplets may not be capable of oxidizing tmp in this scenario tmp samples a smaller more energetic subset of 3cdom than is represented by 1o2 measurements this hypothesis has also been presented by maizel and remucal 2017c because o2 reacts with a larger pool of 3cdom this manifests as higher q y o 2 1 values than a q y e 3 f o m values i e q y o 2 1 to a q y e 3 f o m ratios greater than 1 and such differences have been reported maizel and remucal 2017c mccabe and arnold 2016 in contrast the results reported herein show q y o 2 1 values that are lower by about a factor of 2 than a q y e 3 f o m values measured by tmp the results of this work suggest that tmp samples a larger fraction of available triplets in the studied effluents than did past studies that employed dual 1o2 and tmp approaches to quantify 3cdom a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that a greater fraction of 3efom in the effluents may be of higher energy than of the 3cdom used in past studies in this case most or all of the 3efom is energetic enough to both excite o2 to 1o2 and to oxidize tmp and that the differences in q y o 2 1 and a q y e 3 f o m values reflect the fraction of 3efom decay processes that produce 1o2 another possibility is that the 3efom used in this study may have a lower efficiency of 1o2 production when quenched by o2 the f δ term described by mcneill and canonica 2016 in this scenario o2 may still be sampling a greater fraction of excited triplet states but with a lower fraction of 1o2 produced from the results of this study we cannot distinguish between these different possibilities but if the former case is operative i e 3efom has a larger fraction of higher energy triplets capable of oxidizing tmp than does 3nom this may explain why previous studies have shown that 3efom reacts with a broader range of pollutants and or more efficiently with pollutants than does 3nom for the samples studied complicating factors due to self quenching are unlikely to be important because the doc levels are below those where inhibition has been shown doc 10 mg l the reactivity of 3efom with aquatic pollutants compared to 3nom needs additional attention especially because this work indicates the average energy of 3efom may be greater than that of 3nom 4 conclusions municipal wastewater effluents have similar chemical and spectral properties thus as effluent flows become larger portions of surface waters over natural flows it is likely that surface waters receiving effluent will become more similar in spectral characteristics water chemistry and photo reactivity increasing e2 e3 and doc are associated with increasing production yields of 3efom and 1o2 there are uncertainties up to 10 fold however associated with using these measurements as predictors of the quantum yields for these ppris specific quantum yields are dependent on the parameters used specifically k t tmp and k q which may be unique to each water and r a which is dependent on wavelength integration range this must be considered when evaluating uncertainties and when comparing values obtained from different studies tmp appears to be an appropriate probe for quantifying 3efom because it reacts with the vast majority of triplets excited states produced in efom this allows production of 1o2 to also be accurately determined based on the 50 expected yield of 1o2 from 3efom while this is true for the 94 samples in this study further work is needed to evaluate if this is generally representative of efom samples and how effective tmp is in measuring triplet excited states in a variety of nom samples efom produces 3om and 1o2 more efficiently than nom and the 3om produced may have higher energy than that produced by nom as surface waters become more effluent dominated water chemistry spectral characteristics and photoreactivity may become more similar and distinct from nom containing waters more work is needed to see if this holds for other ppris such as superoxide or hydroxyl radical as well acknowledgements this work was primarily supported by the

18891,nitrification and denitrification the key biological processes for thermophilic nitrogen removal have separately been established in bioreactors at 50 c a well characterized set of kinetic

extreme conditions compared to the bilayer membranes with ester bound fatty acid chains present in aob schouten et al 2013 as opposed to ammonia oxidation thermophilic nitrite oxidation remains attributed to bacteria with all detected or enriched cultures related to nitrospira calida courtens et al 2016a edwards et al 2013 lebedeva et al 2011 marks et al 2012 one moderate thermophilic nob related to the phylum chloroflexi nitrolancea hollandica was isolated and described as well sorokin et al 2014 to establish thermophilic nitrifying bioreactors two distinct strategies were recently developed a first strategy called constant temperature enrichment involved the enrichment of a thermophilic compost derived inoculum in a high performing bioreactor at 50 c courtens et al 2016a its time consuming nature 350 days batch wise enrichment 560 days reactor enrichment would impede the start up of a full scale wastewater treatment facility being orders of magnitude larger than a lab scale bioreactor upgrading existing mesophilic facilities using a temperature increase strategy may be more convenient first attempts to use this strategy were unsuccessful to reach temperatures 45 c by using a stepwise increase higher than 2 5 c d 1 courtens et al 2014a shore et al 2012 the key to a successful upgrade was a gradual temperature increase of 0 08 c d 1 providing sufficient time for a selection towards appropriate thermophiles 49 5 c courtens et al 2016b both strategies for the cultivation of thermophilic nitrifiers thus resulted in bioreactors with high nitrification rates the thriving nitrifying communities consisted of nitrososphaera gargensis related aoa and nitrospira calida related nob yet the respective functional phylotypes of both reactors revealed distinctly different players courtens et al 2016b the key biotechnological processes for nitrogen removal are at hand the next step is to conceive an efficient thermophilic nitrogen removal process by integrating heterotrophic conversions with nitrification or nitritation compared to nitrifiers heterotrophs are characterized by a higher biomass yield 0 47 g vss g 1 cod vs 0 17 g vss g 1 n and growth rate 6 vs 0 8 d 1 compared to nitrifiers henze et al 2000 as the biomass concentration in a treatment facility is usually fixed changing organic loading rate relative to the nitrogen load can result in excessive growth of heterotrophs possibly lowering the sludge retention time srt below the nitrifier growth rate and thus resulting in the washout of nitrifiers to safely integrate these processes and set the boundaries safeguarding nitrification an elaborate set of kinetic parameters is essential knowledge on thermophilic nitrifying kinetics is scarce and only available for isolated or highly enriched batch cultures which do not reproduce the conditions thriving in bioreactors in this study two thermophilic nitrifying mixed cultures were kinetically and physiologically characterized furthermore full length smrt amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene pacific biosciences sequel smrt bell sequencing allowed us to precisely determine the phylogeny of the different thermophilic nitrifying organisms present 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two previously acquired thermophilic nitrifying sequencing batch reactors sbr were transformed to membrane bioreactors mbr and are further mentioned as mbrt constant courtens et al 2016a and mbrt increase courtens et al 2016b referring to the applied development strategy being the constant temperature enrichment and temperature increase strategy respectively as mentioned in the introduction submerged hollow fiber microfiltration membrane units with a pore size of 100 nm were constructed for in situ effluent extraction the fibers originated from a full scale pall microza installation asahi kasei chemicals corporation japan level controllers velleman belgium were used to regulate the reactor volume around 2l the reactor vessels were jacketed and controlled at a temperature of 50 c by use of circulating thermostatic water baths julabo ma 4 overhead stirrers provided mixing and aquarium pumps were connected to diffuser stones for aeration dissolved oxygen concentration do was controlled at 2 mg o2 l 1 liquiline m cm442 the ph was controlled between 7 2 and 7 5 by dosing 0 2 m naoh hcl both reactors were continuously fed with synthetic medium consisting of nh4 2so4 150 mg n l 1 12 g nahco3 g 1 n kh2po4 10 mg p l 1 and 0 1 ml l 1 trace elements kuai and verstraete 1998 to change the nitrogen loading rate the flow rate was adjusted mbrt constant was characterized by robust and stable operation despite several technical issues yielding short term lower performance fig s5 in mbrt increase after transforming from sbr to mbr the temperature was successfully increased from 48 5 to 50 c fig s6 based on the nitrogen balance nitrogen loss through ammonia stripping or biomass assimilation was limited to 8 12 and 7 10 of total influent nitrogen in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively indicating that nitrification was the main process of ammonia removal experiments with both reactors were only conducted during stable volumetric operation as indicated in fig s5 and s6 the two reactors were mainly operated for redundancy as to the author s knowledge these were the only thermophilic nitrifying bioreactors in the world a technical issue resulting in reactor failure would endanger the research on thermophilic nitrogen removal having two reactors at hand allows for more certainty of active biomass for other experiments outside this study it was thus not the main goal to see differences between both reactors even though both had a different development strategy 2 2 biokinetics 2 2 1 biomass yield maximum specific activity and maximum growth rate the maximum biomass yield of the thermophilic aoa and nob ymax aoa and ymax nob were determined based on stable isotope incorporation during activity measurements as previously described vandekerckhove et al 2019 the maximum biomass specific ammonium q m a x n h 4 n and nitrite oxidation rates q m a x n o 2 n were derived during these incubations as well taking into account the relative abundance of aoa and nob at the time of the experiment the group specific rates of aoa qmax aoa and nob qmax nob could be derived moreover the maximum aoa and nob growth rate μmax aoa and μmax nob was calculated as the product of ymax and qmax propagation of uncertainty was used to derive the 95 confidence interval 2 2 3 decay rate to determine the decay rate kd 400 ml of sludge was transferred to a temperature controlled respirometry setup continuous aeration was applied in the absence of substrate on a daily basis aeration was stopped to determine the endogenous oxygen uptake rate ourend subsequently the maximum oxygen uptake rate ourmax in the presence of 5 mg no2 n l 1 was obtained after subtracting the ourend a measure of the nob activity was acquired finally as a measure of the aoa activity the nob activity was subtracted from the ourmax considering ourend after dosing 5 mg nh4 n l 1 these measurements lasted between 0 2 and 0 7 h the decreasing ourmax aoa and ourmax nob with time was exponential and equation 1 was fitted to the data 1 o u r m a x t o u r m a x t 0 e k d t with ourmax t and ourmax t0 the maximum oxygen uptake rate at time point t and at the beginning of the experiment t0 respectively the kd was estimated in python using the pyideas package van daele et al 2015 using the nelder mead algorithm for parameter optimization to estimate the 95 confidence intervals the inverse of the fisher information matrix was calculated to obtain a linear approximation of the covariance matrix omlin and reichert 1999 2 2 4 apparent substrate affinity index for both communities the apparent affinity index for ammonium ks n aoa nitrite ks n nob and oxygen ks o aoa and ks o nob was determined using ex situ respirometric measurements details can be found in supplementary material section s 2 the particle size distribution psd was determined using the video channel of an eyetech particle size analyzer ankersmid netherlands as it can influence the apparent affinity index through diffusion limitation 2 3 susceptibility towards environmental factors the susceptibility of the aoa and nob of both thermophilic communities towards ph temperature salt ammonium free ammonia nh3 fa nitrite and free nitrous acid hno2 fna was determined using ex situ batch activity measurements in 96 well plates with a working volume of 250 μl similar as previously described courtens et al 2016a plates were incubated at 50 c and shaken at 600 rpm in a thermoshaker hangzhou allsheng instruments hangzhou china the buffer solution contained a final concentration of 0 3 0 6 g p l 1 kh2po4 k2hpo4 0 5 g nahco3 l 1 0 2 g mgso4x7h2o l 1 0 1 g cacl2 0 1 ml l 1 trace elements and nh4 2so4 or nano2 operational parameters such as ph temperature and substrate concentration varied depending on the investigated parameter all three parameters were measured in the tests to enable the calculation of fa and fna concentrations using their chemical equilibrium anthonisen et al 1976 a combination of different tests uncoupled the effect of different parameters table s1 and s2 all treatments were performed in quadruple or sextuple liquid samples 2 μl were taken over time for nh4 and no2 analysis biomass concentration was determined using the concentration in the homogenized inoculum sample executed in triplicate and the imposed dilution in the well plate 2 4 molecular analysis samples for full length 16s rrna gene smrt amplicon sequencing were taken on day 1403 and 729 of operation in the mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively samples for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were taken at the time of the stable isotope experiment 2 2 1 being day of operation 1905 and 1230 in the mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively samples were taken and stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction in parallel with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing total bacteria and archaea were quantitatively determined by qpcr more information on the dna extraction amplicon sequencing and data processing and qpcr analysis can be found in supplementary material section s 3 and s 4 the qpcr results and the biomass concentration of the samples were combined to yield total bacteria and archaea in copies g 1 vss together they quantitatively represented the total community when considering the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the bacterial community and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa in the archaeal community as determined by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing an estimation was made of the relative abundance of each microbial group recent research combining flow cytometry and sequencing has proven the significance of combining absolute and relative abundances and proposed the tandem qpcr and sequencing as valuable alternative to flow cytometry props et al 2017 2 5 chemical analyses details on methods applied to determine ammonium nitrite nitrate biomass concentration and bulk 13c abundance can be found in supplementary material section s 5 2 6 statistical analyses statistical analysis was applied to check for significant differences in the obtained yield details can be found in supplementary material section s 6 3 results discussion 3 1 microbial community a phylogenetic tree was constructed for the aoa containing the abundance based representative full 16s rrna gene sequences of all otus present in mbrt constant and mbrt increase with more than one read over both reactors and 410 sequences from the nitrososphaera and nitrosopumilales according to embl taxonomy in silva release 132 fig 1 the most abundant otu otu 1 comprising 89 87 and 77 24 of the archaeal community in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively was related to the nitrososphaera genus but clustered relatively far from the closest known species nitrososphaera gargensis on average 95 5 identity in the trimmed alignment this might hint at the presence of a new species however genome resolved shotgun metagenomics is required to attribute the necessary functional genes to this otu to validate that it is responsible for the observed ammonia oxidation nonetheless given the high abundance and the classification within the nitrososphaera genus known to oxidize ammonia it is likely that this otu is responsible for the conversion and thus represents a novel nitrososphaera species the closest uncultured relative 100 sequence identity in the trimmed alignment space was a nitrososphaera species jx047156 found in a marine hot spring 58 5 68 5 c from kalianda island indonesia xu et al 2013 the phylogenetic tree for nob contained abundance based representative sequences of all otus classified as either in the phylum chloroflexi or the phylum nitrospira and 105 reference sequences of the phyla chloroflexi and nitrospira fig 2 the two most abundant otus were classified as nitrospira spp and were closely related to nitrospira calida 97 identity as opposed to 87 3 identity to the next closest related cultivated nitrospira nitrospira defluvii on day 1905 and 1230 of operation in mbrt constant and mbrt increase amplicon sequencing and qpcr were used to estimate the absolute and relative abundance of aoa and nob the absolute and relative abundance of bacteria and archaea in mbrt constant determined by qpcr was found to be 3 1x1013 7 9x1012 copies 43 16 and 4 1x1013 1 0x1013 copies 57 21 respectively in mbrt increase this was 2 1x1013 6 3x1012 copies 24 16 and 6 4x1013 3 7x1013 copies 76 49 respectively in both cultures no aob were found based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the bacterial community consisted of 26 and 22 nitrospira related nob mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively the archaeal community in mbrt constant comprised of 95 nitrososphaera related and 5 nitrosocosmicus related aoa whereas in mbrt increase 100 of the archaeal community was related to nitrososphaera applying the bacterial and archaeal community composition on the qpcr based relative abundance of bacteria and archaea rendered an aoa relative abundance of 56 8 17 9 and 75 5 55 0 and a nob relative abundance of 11 2 4 1 and 5 4 3 5 in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively these communities were highly enriched in aoa whereas less enriched in nob compared to previous studies on thermophilic nitrification in a bioreactor courtens et al 2016a 2016b 3 2 thermophilic biomass yield to the authors best knowledge only one study reported an observed yield of 0 067 g vss g 1 n at 48 c courtens et al 2016b the observed yield yobs takes into account both growth and decay maintenance whereas the maximum yield only includes growth instantly obtained from oxidizing ammonia or nitrite metcalf and eddy 2003 a new method was developed based on 13c incorporation vandekerckhove et al 2019 it enables a fast determination of the maximum yield of a specific group of organisms in a mixed culture and renders the work intensive isolation or enrichment unnecessary no significant difference in ymax aoa and ymax nob was observed when comparing both communities p 0 05 with aoa values of 0 16 0 01 and 0 20 0 02 g vss g 1 n and nob values of 0 040 0 005 and 0 043 0 002 g vss g 1 n for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively the maximum aoa yield was remarkably higher than a reported mesophilic aoa yield of 0 09 g dry mass g 1 n könneke et al 2014 furthermore lower mesophilic aob yields 0 06 0 11 g vss g 1 n were obtained using the same method based on 13c incorporation vandekerckhove et al 2019 linked to a more efficient pathway for co2 incorporation of aoa compared to aob könneke et al 2014 compared to other aob yields in literature the thermophilic aoa yield is within the range of 0 03 0 3 g vss g 1 n table s5 the thermophilic nitrospira yield was in the same range of its mesophilic counterpart 0 048 0 051 g vss g 1 n when determined based on 13c incorporation it was however higher than the thermophilic nitrospira yield determined previously 0 025 0 028 g vss g 1 n by the same method vandekerckhove et al 2019 it is also in the same range of other reported mesophilic yields for nitrospira 0 049 0 15 g vss g 1 n or nitrobacter 0 040 072 g vss g 1 n table s6 the discrepancy between the aoa and nob yield in the studied mixed cultures is reflected in the community enrichment as aoa were far more abundant than nob the overall nitrification yield was 0 20 0 24 g vss g 1 n which is in the same order of magnitude as previously determined 0 24 0 25 g vss g 1 n and exceeded the mesophilic yield 0 16 and 0 10 g vss g 1 n at 15 and 28 c respectively determined using 13c incorporation vandekerckhove et al 2019 3 3 growth kinetics the q m a x n h 4 n amounted up to 517 43 and 455 30 mg n g 1 vsstot d 1 and a q m a x n o 2 n of 358 6 and 417 20 mg n g 1 vsstot d 1 was obtained for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively taking into account the relative abundance of aoa 56 8 and 75 5 and nob 11 2 and 5 4 aoa specific rates of 0 91 0 30 and 0 61 0 44 g n g 1 vss d 1 and nob specific rates of 3 2 1 0 and 7 7 4 2 g n g 1 vss d 1 were estimated for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively the qmax aoa were low compared to reported literature values 0 67 6 85 g n g 1 vss d 1 whereas the qmax nob were similar to mesophilic nitrospira 3 3 8 9 g n g 1 vss d 1 and low compared to nitrobacter 9 6 72 g n g 1 vss d 1 table s4 and s6 multiplying qmax and ymax yielded estimated μmax values of 0 15 0 05 and 0 12 0 09 d 1 for nitrososphaera and 0 13 0 05 and 0 33 0 22 d 1 for nitrospira in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively the μmax aoa was similar to the growth rate of candidatus nitrosocaldus islandicus of 0 128 d 1 daebeler et al 2018 but lower than other described aoa 0 32 0 8 d 1 table s4 the thermophilic nitrospira growth rate was lower than literature values for mesophilic nitrospira 0 38 0 52 d 1 and nitrobacter 0 23 2 6 d 1 table s6 until this study the decay rate for thermophilic aoa and nob has not been determined yet the kd aoa in mbrt constant and mbrt increase was 0 231 0 002 and 0 285 0 002 d 1 respectively and the kd nob was 0 315 0 002 and 0 429 0 003 d 1 respectively fig s8 these values were within the range reported in literature of mesophilic aob 0 03 0 43 d 1 and nob 0 03 1 7 d 1 table s5 and s6 as sludge proliferated in the bioreactors kd could not be higher than μmax a rough calculation based on a vss and n balance in the mbr reactors demonstrated biomass growth yobs 0 028 0 035 g vss g 1 n at very high srt 88 182 days yielding estimated decay rates between 0 026 and 0 078 d 1 this indicates that the experimentally determined kd values were overestimated it is known that kd can vary depending on the conditions in a reactor system and comprises maintenance energy real decay of cells protozoa grazing salem et al 2006 it is possible that the transfer from continuous feeding in the reactors to prolonged 17 days stressful starvation induced a faster decay or that the inactivation rate was determined rather than the actual decay rate the decay rate from batch experiments was measured indirectly via the oxygen uptake rate in the presence of substrate instead of directly using biomass concentration measurements a potential lag phase in maximum activity was not taken into account a clear distinction was noticeable between endogenous respiration nitrite oxidation and ammonia oxidation so there was active oxidation measured fig s9 whether actual death of micro organisms occurred or if a transitions to starvation conditions with lower metabolic activity took place remains uncertain biochemical adjustments in a cell under starvation are called the stringent response process in which energy is redirected to maintenance and overall activity is slowed down resulting in a lower oxygen uptake rate mason et al 1986 in addition to the overestimated kd an underestimation of μmax was possible as well the loading rate in the mbr reactors was only 28 6 and 35 12 of q m a x n h 4 n in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively meaning growth conditions were not optimal and in situ growth rates μ were smaller than μmax as biomass growth was observed in the mbrs μ is bound to be higher than kd and thus so must μmax be the obtained values for μmax were possibly underestimated by the fact that vss includes other particulate matter in addition to biomass metcalf and eddy 2003 molecular tools as qpcr and illumina sequencing might have introduced a bias as well in literature the simultaneous determination of nitrifier μmax and kd mostly involved model fitting to steady state reactor data batch test data or respirometry assays as opposed to experimental determination as performed in this study ahn et al 2008 hanaki et al 1990 kappeler and brodmann 1995 munz et al 2008 nowak et al 1995 park and noguera 2007 despite the possible underestimation of μmax it might be that the obtained thermophiles were slow growing issues of experimentally determined kd values being higher than μmax were not reported for faster growing aerobic heterotrophs converting organic carbon but it was shown that in situ versus batch wise determination of μmax and kd yielded different results with an overestimation of kd in batch experiments it was suggested to use the in situ estimated decay and the intrinsic μmax as obtained batch wise vogelaar et al 2003 3 4 apparent substrate affinity index substrate affinity plays an important role in niche differentiation and in the attainable effluent nitrogen concentration in wastewater treatment facilities the apparent affinity index of aoa for ammonium and oxygen in both reactors were similar with ks n aoa of 0 36 0 04 and 0 32 0 02 mg n l 1 and ks o aoa of 0 13 0 09 and 0 21 0 15 mg o2 l 1 for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively fig 3 a and b and fig 4 a and b the obtained apparent aoa affinity indices for ammonium were remarkably higher than previously reported for aoa 0 002 0 030 mg n l 1 and for comammox table s7 the thriving reactor conditions in this study as opposed to planktonic conditions in aoa enrichment studies elicits the influence of advectional and diffusional factors such as floc size oxygen substrate gradient mixing intensity reactor hydraulics on the apparent affinity indices arnaldos et al 2015 although mixing was intensive floc size was relatively small d90 33 24 35 28 μm fig s7 and biomass concentration was not unusually high in this study it cannot be excluded that these factors had an influence it has even been shown that microcolonies 16 μm within flocs affect the apparent affinity index picioreanu et al 2016 the biomass concentration during these experiments was higher in mbrt increase 4 45 4 85 g vss l 1 than in mbrt constant 2 95 3 85 g vss l 1 meaning that more diffusional and advectional resistance might have occurred to properly reflect actual conditions in practical applications the determination of substrate affinity under the influence of these physical resistances in bioreactors is essential the obtained apparent affinity indices are thus more likely to prevail in real life applications rather than the indices derived from single cell cultures compared to aob affinities 0 07 46 2 mg n l 1 determined in bioreactors these apparent affinity indices are quite low table s7 low ks n aoa is in accordance with literature as aoa are often found in oligotrophic environments erguder et al 2009 the ks o aoa 0 13 0 21 mg o2 l 1 was in the range of previously reported values 0 06 0 33 mg o2 l 1 table s7 considering possible advectional and diffusional resistances in this study compared to literature the actual affinity index could be higher compared to aob 0 18 5 95 mg o2 l 1 table s7 the obtained apparent affinity index is low indicative of literature statements on aoa niche differentiation and presence in oxygen limited habitats erguder et al 2009 the nob in mbrt increase had a slightly lower apparent affinity index for nitrite and oxygen 0 27 0 05 mg n l 1 and 0 15 0 05 mg o2 l 1 than the nob of mbrt constant 1 23 0 3 mg n l 1 and 0 55 0 27 mg o2 l 1 fig 3c and d and fig 4c and d the ks n nob and ks o nob values were within the range of reported affinity indices of mesophilic nitrospira 0 11 0 9 mg n l 1 and 0 13 0 54 mg o2 l 1 and nitrobacter 0 009 9 59 mg n l 1 and 0 25 1 66 mg o2 l 1 apparent affinity indices table s8 3 5 robustness of thermophilic nitrification when developing biotechnological solutions for nitrogen in wastewater it is important to acknowledge that abiotic factors are not stable practical application requires a robust community that can deal with stress situations however a properly controlled system prevents the occurrence of conditions to which the process is sensitive meaning the sensitivity of a microbial process should not hinder its application as nitrification can be regarded as the most vulnerable process in common nitrification denitrification or nitritation denitritation this study evaluated the capacity of the thermophilic cultures to deal with differences in substrate concentration ph temperature and salts to properly assess the susceptibility it must also be tested in long term experiments as opposed to the short term batch experiments performed in this study with regard to substrate inhibition it is important to distinguish between the chemical forms in equilibrium being ammonium ammonia and nitrite free nitrous acid fluctuations in temperature ph and substrate concentration in wastewater treatment facilities affect the substrate speciation and thus the possible inhibition of nitrification the aoa in both reactors were not susceptible to ammonium and fa concentrations up to 300 and 16 mg n l 1 fig 5 a which is in accordance with two previous studies on aoa courtens et al 2016a sauder et al 2017 however they were more tolerant than other aoa enrichments reporting full inhibition in the range of 14 280 mg nh4 n l 1 and 0 252 10 5 mg nh3 n l 1 hatzenpichler 2012 substrate accumulation might have a different effect on various species as substrate concentration has been hypothesized to drive niche differentiation within thaumarchaeota sauder et al 2017 the concentrations in a bioreactor can be considered higher than most oligotrophic environments from which aoa have been isolated and characterized thus selecting for more tolerant species in addition although biomass flocs were small in this study diffusional and advectional resistance might have been higher compared to cellular batch enrichments of the previous studies this resistance could yield lower substrate concentrations on a planktonic level thus rendering the organisms more tolerant to higher bulk concentrations furthermore both thermophilic communities were highly tolerant to salts with an ic50 for aoa of about 40 g nacl l 1 of added salinity 92 3 ms cm 1 and for nob of about 20 g nacl l 1 of added salinity 50 5 ms cm 1 the limited effect of salt on nitrification activity expands the application possibilities to salty nitrogenous streams fig s10 temperatures down to 40 c retained more than 70 of the nitrification activity fig 6 biomass from mbrt increase which was originally derived from mesophilic nitrifying sludge courtens et al 2016b could cope best with lower temperatures retaining 100 aoa and more than 85 nob activity as problems with nitrification often arise when temperatures exceed 40 c henze 1997 these findings are promising and suggest that the presence of the correct nitrifying species can expand the boundaries of current practices and enable nitrogen removal at a broad temperature range increasing temperatures on the other hand have proven to be detrimental to nitrite oxidation from 55 c and to ammonia oxidation from 60 c onwards 3 6 opportunities for short cut nitrogen removal in case nitratation could be prevented via smart process control short cut nitrogen removal could be established via nitritation denitritation or partial nitrification anammox rendering economic and ecological benefits peng et al 2017 vlaeminck et al 2012 besides nob suppression thermophilic anammox should be established as well recently anammox activity was reported for 2 weeks at 50 c in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb zhang et al 2018 several strategies for nob suppression have been proposed agrawal et al 2018 vlaeminck et al 2012 they involve fa or fna shock therapy nob are more susceptible to fa fna anthonisen et al 1976 working at decreased oxygen concentrations aob have a lower apparent oxygen affinity index than nob blackburne et al 2008 and decreasing the srt to wash out nob while retaining aob due to lower growth rate of nob at sidestream conditions hellinga et al 1998 the tolerance of nitrite oxidation towards fa and nh4 in this study ic50 16 mg nh3 n l 1 and 250 mg nh4 n l 1 fig 5 b was much higher than the reported range of 0 1 1 mg nh3 n l 1 anthonisen et al 1976 and the previously described ic50 of 5 mg nh3 n l 1 courtens et al 2016a the use of a fa shock therapy to suppress nitratation will thus be challenging at thermophilic temperatures the communities in this study were clearly inhibited by nitrite whereas free nitrous acid is usually depicted as inhibiting rather than nitrite fig 5 b and d fna acts as a protonophore which increases proton permeability through cell membranes this counteracts the proton pumping effect of atpase thus inhibiting atp synthesis furthermore fna may force bacteria to turn on or off particular enzymes to defend against its toxicity may affect gene transcriptional processes and mislead the enzyme assemblage and may directly react with enzymes involved in the metabolic processes zhou et al 2011 the inhibitory effect of nitrite to the thermophilic aoa and nob remains to be investigated especially the nob were highly susceptible to nitrite with an ic50 of 40 mg no2 n l 1 compared to 1 5 2 g no2 n l 1 for aoa opening up opportunities if nitrite accumulation can be established as nob in the studied bioreactor communities were more resilient to changing ph than aoa fig 6c and d changing the ph to mediate nitrite accumulation is difficult the optimum ph for aoa of both reactors was 6 9 retaining more than 60 of the activity in the range of 6 5 7 9 fig 6 a the nob proved to withstand ph changes better with an optimum of 6 7 in both reactors and over 80 and 90 remaining activity in the range of 6 4 7 8 for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively fig 6 c increasing the temperature on the other hand could facilitate the inhibition of nitratation as the nob activity was severely declined at 55 c whereas the aoa activity remained unaffected fig 6a and b the nob apparent oxygen affinity index in mbrt increase was similar to the aoa apparent oxygen affinity 0 21 0 15 and 0 15 0 05 mg o2 l 1 respectively whereas in mbrt constant the aoa displayed a lower apparent oxygen affinity index compared to nob affinity 0 13 0 09 and 0 55 0 27 mg o2 l 1 respectively mediating nob out selection by aeration control would thus only be possible in mbrt constant this renders the need for kinetic characterization of every nitrifying community before qualifying for aeration control to enable short cut nitrogen removal finally the strategy of aggressive srt control does not seem feasible at thermophilic temperatures as the nob maximum growth rate 0 13 0 33 d 1 was higher when compared to aoa 0 12 0 15 d 1 overall this study shows that current strategies for nob suppression might prove difficult at thermophilic temperatures 4 conclusions this study characterized the stoichiometry and kinetics of two thermophilic nitrifying bioreactor communities the most abundant archaeal otu was related to the nitrososphaera genus but clustered relatively far from the known species nitrososphaera gargensis 95 5 identity the most abundant nob were related to nitrospira calida 97 identity thermophilic nitrification yield was 0 20 0 24 g vss g 1 n

18891,nitrification and denitrification the key biological processes for thermophilic nitrogen removal have separately been established in bioreactors at 50 c a well characterized set of kinetic parameters is essential to integrate these processes while safeguarding the autotrophs performing nitrification knowledge on thermophilic nitrifying kinetics is restricted to isolated or highly enriched batch cultures which do not represent bioreactor conditions this study characterized the stoichiometry and kinetics of two thermophilic 50 c nitrifying communities the most abundant ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were related to the nitrososphaera genus clustering relatively far from known species nitrososphaera gargensis 95 5 16s rrna gene sequence identity the most abundant nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were related to nitrospira calida 97 16s rrna gene sequence identity the nitrification biomass yield was 0 20 0 24 g vss g 1 n resulting mainly from a high aoa yield 0 16 0 20 g vss g 1 n which was reflected in a high aoa abundance in the community 57 76 compared to nob 5 11 batch wise determination of decay rates aoa 0 23 0 29 d 1 nob 0 32 0 43 d 1 rendered an overestimation

abstract image 1 keywords biological nitrogen removal nitrososphaera nitrospira substrate affinity archaea 1 introduction the discharge of wastewater contributes significantly to the accumulation of reactive nitrogen species coppens et al 2016 which can elicit major environmental burdens in receiving water bodies including eutrophication and fish mortality camargo and alonso 2006 biological nitrogen removal is applied to convert toxic ammonia to harmless nitrogen gas and is usually operated at temperatures between 5 and 35 c henze et al 2008 thermophilic treatment might be a viable alternative for specific applications such as warm wastewaters or industries with excess heat available thermophilic aerobic carbon removal has been extensively reviewed and is reported to be more stable with a higher level of decontamination and lower production of biological sludge when compared to mesophilic treatment lapara and alleman 1999 thermophilic denitrification was found to be fast in start up 1 week accompanied by improved settling reduced carbon requirement and lower sludge production courtens et al 2014b to compose an integrated treatment solution for nitrogen the development of thermophilic nitrification is essential thermophilic ammonia oxidation in nature is mainly an archaeal feature so far only some ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob representatives of the nitrosomonas genus and some unknown ammonia oxidizing bacteria have been reported to grow optimally up to 46 50 c lebedeva et al 2005 on the other hand thermophilic ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were widely found using the ammonia monooxygenase subunit a amoa in deep sea hydrothermal vents baker et al 2012 wang et al 2009 subsurface thermal springs spear et al 2007 weidler et al 2008 terrestrial hot springs dodsworth et al 2011 reigstad et al 2008 and composting facilities zeng et al 2011 besides the genomic detection some representatives with an optimum temperature 45 c have been isolated and described namely candidatus nitrosocaldus yellowstonii candidatus nitrososphaera gargensis candidatus nitrosotenius uzonensis and candidatus nitrosocaldus islandicus daebeler et al 2018 de la torre et al 2008 hatzenpichler et al 2008 lebedeva et al 2013 the apparent dominion of aoa over aob at high temperatures is likely related to a higher substrate affinity and the oligotrophic nature of most natural habitats investigated martens habbena et al 2009 in addition aoa are distinguished from aob by robust monolayer membranes with ether bound isoprenoid units making them better equipped to survive extreme conditions compared to the bilayer membranes with ester bound fatty acid chains present in aob schouten et al 2013 as opposed to ammonia oxidation thermophilic nitrite oxidation remains attributed to bacteria with all detected or enriched cultures related to nitrospira calida courtens et al 2016a edwards et al 2013 lebedeva et al 2011 marks et al 2012 one moderate thermophilic nob related to the phylum chloroflexi nitrolancea hollandica was isolated and described as well sorokin et al 2014 to establish thermophilic nitrifying bioreactors two distinct strategies were recently developed a first strategy called constant temperature enrichment involved the enrichment of a thermophilic compost derived inoculum in a high performing bioreactor at 50 c courtens et al 2016a its time consuming nature 350 days batch wise enrichment 560 days reactor enrichment would impede the start up of a full scale wastewater treatment facility being orders of magnitude larger than a lab scale bioreactor upgrading existing mesophilic facilities using a temperature increase strategy may be more convenient first attempts to use this strategy were unsuccessful to reach temperatures 45 c by using a stepwise increase higher than 2 5 c d 1 courtens et al 2014a shore et al 2012 the key to a successful upgrade was a gradual temperature increase of 0 08 c d 1 providing sufficient time for a selection towards appropriate thermophiles 49 5 c courtens et al 2016b both strategies for the cultivation of thermophilic nitrifiers thus resulted in bioreactors with high nitrification rates the thriving nitrifying communities consisted of nitrososphaera gargensis related aoa and nitrospira calida related nob yet the respective functional phylotypes of both reactors revealed distinctly different players courtens et al 2016b the key biotechnological processes for nitrogen removal are at hand the next step is to conceive an efficient thermophilic nitrogen removal process by integrating heterotrophic conversions with nitrification or nitritation compared to nitrifiers heterotrophs are characterized by a higher biomass yield 0 47 g vss g 1 cod vs 0 17 g vss g 1 n and growth rate 6 vs 0 8 d 1 compared to nitrifiers henze et al 2000 as the biomass concentration in a treatment facility is usually fixed changing organic loading rate relative to the nitrogen load can result in excessive growth of heterotrophs possibly lowering the sludge retention time srt below the nitrifier growth rate and thus resulting in the washout of nitrifiers to safely integrate these processes and set the boundaries safeguarding nitrification an elaborate set of kinetic parameters is essential knowledge on thermophilic nitrifying kinetics is scarce and only available for isolated or highly enriched batch cultures which do not reproduce the conditions thriving in bioreactors in this study two thermophilic nitrifying mixed cultures were kinetically and physiologically characterized furthermore full length smrt amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene pacific biosciences sequel smrt bell sequencing allowed us to precisely determine the phylogeny of the different thermophilic nitrifying organisms present 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two previously acquired thermophilic nitrifying sequencing batch reactors sbr were transformed to membrane bioreactors mbr and are further mentioned as mbrt constant courtens et al 2016a and mbrt increase courtens et al 2016b referring to the applied development strategy being the constant temperature enrichment and temperature increase strategy respectively as mentioned in the introduction submerged hollow fiber microfiltration membrane units with a pore size of 100 nm were constructed for in situ effluent extraction the fibers originated from a full scale pall microza installation asahi kasei chemicals corporation japan level controllers velleman belgium were used to regulate the reactor volume around 2l the reactor vessels were jacketed and controlled at a temperature of 50 c by use of circulating thermostatic water baths julabo ma 4 overhead stirrers provided mixing and aquarium pumps were connected to diffuser stones for aeration dissolved oxygen concentration do was controlled at 2 mg o2 l 1 liquiline m cm442 the ph was controlled between 7 2 and 7 5 by dosing 0 2 m naoh hcl both reactors were continuously fed with synthetic medium consisting of nh4 2so4 150 mg n l 1 12 g nahco3 g 1 n kh2po4 10 mg p l 1 and 0 1 ml l 1 trace elements kuai and verstraete 1998 to change the nitrogen loading rate the flow rate was adjusted mbrt constant was characterized by robust and stable operation despite several technical issues yielding short term lower performance fig s5 in mbrt increase after transforming from sbr to mbr the temperature was successfully increased from 48 5 to 50 c fig s6 based on the nitrogen balance nitrogen loss through ammonia stripping or biomass assimilation was limited to 8 12 and 7 10 of total influent nitrogen in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively indicating that nitrification was the main process of ammonia removal experiments with both reactors were only conducted during stable volumetric operation as indicated in fig s5 and s6 the two reactors were mainly operated for redundancy as to the author s knowledge these were the only thermophilic nitrifying bioreactors in the world a technical issue resulting in reactor failure would endanger the research on thermophilic nitrogen removal having two reactors at hand allows for more certainty of active biomass for other experiments outside this study it was thus not the main goal to see differences between both reactors even though both had a different development strategy 2 2 biokinetics 2 2 1 biomass yield maximum specific activity and maximum growth rate the maximum biomass yield of the thermophilic aoa and nob ymax aoa and ymax nob were determined based on stable isotope incorporation during activity measurements as previously described vandekerckhove et al 2019 the maximum biomass specific ammonium q m a x n h 4 n and nitrite oxidation rates q m a x n o 2 n were derived during these incubations as well taking into account the relative abundance of aoa and nob at the time of the experiment the group specific rates of aoa qmax aoa and nob qmax nob could be derived moreover the maximum aoa and nob growth rate μmax aoa and μmax nob was calculated as the product of ymax and qmax propagation of uncertainty was used to derive the 95 confidence interval 2 2 3 decay rate to determine the decay rate kd 400 ml of sludge was transferred to a temperature controlled respirometry setup continuous aeration was applied in the absence of substrate on a daily basis aeration was stopped to determine the endogenous oxygen uptake rate ourend subsequently the maximum oxygen uptake rate ourmax in the presence of 5 mg no2 n l 1 was obtained after subtracting the ourend a measure of the nob activity was acquired finally as a measure of the aoa activity the nob activity was subtracted from the ourmax considering ourend after dosing 5 mg nh4 n l 1 these measurements lasted between 0 2 and 0 7 h the decreasing ourmax aoa and ourmax nob with time was exponential and equation 1 was fitted to the data 1 o u r m a x t o u r m a x t 0 e k d t with ourmax t and ourmax t0 the maximum oxygen uptake rate at time point t and at the beginning of the experiment t0 respectively the kd was estimated in python using the pyideas package van daele et al 2015 using the nelder mead algorithm for parameter optimization to estimate the 95 confidence intervals the inverse of the fisher information matrix was calculated to obtain a linear approximation of the covariance matrix omlin and reichert 1999 2 2 4 apparent substrate affinity index for both communities the apparent affinity index for ammonium ks n aoa nitrite ks n nob and oxygen ks o aoa and ks o nob was determined using ex situ respirometric measurements details can be found in supplementary material section s 2 the particle size distribution psd was determined using the video channel of an eyetech particle size analyzer ankersmid netherlands as it can influence the apparent affinity index through diffusion limitation 2 3 susceptibility towards environmental factors the susceptibility of the aoa and nob of both thermophilic communities towards ph temperature salt ammonium free ammonia nh3 fa nitrite and free nitrous acid hno2 fna was determined using ex situ batch activity measurements in 96 well plates with a working volume of 250 μl similar as previously described courtens et al 2016a plates were incubated at 50 c and shaken at 600 rpm in a thermoshaker hangzhou allsheng instruments hangzhou china the buffer solution contained a final concentration of 0 3 0 6 g p l 1 kh2po4 k2hpo4 0 5 g nahco3 l 1 0 2 g mgso4x7h2o l 1 0 1 g cacl2 0 1 ml l 1 trace elements and nh4 2so4 or nano2 operational parameters such as ph temperature and substrate concentration varied depending on the investigated parameter all three parameters were measured in the tests to enable the calculation of fa and fna concentrations using their chemical equilibrium anthonisen et al 1976 a combination of different tests uncoupled the effect of different parameters table s1 and s2 all treatments were performed in quadruple or sextuple liquid samples 2 μl were taken over time for nh4 and no2 analysis biomass concentration was determined using the concentration in the homogenized inoculum sample executed in triplicate and the imposed dilution in the well plate 2 4 molecular analysis samples for full length 16s rrna gene smrt amplicon sequencing were taken on day 1403 and 729 of operation in the mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively samples for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were taken at the time of the stable isotope experiment 2 2 1 being day of operation 1905 and 1230 in the mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively samples were taken and stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction in parallel with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing total bacteria and archaea were quantitatively determined by qpcr more information on the dna extraction amplicon sequencing and data processing and qpcr analysis can be found in supplementary material section s 3 and s 4 the qpcr results and the biomass concentration of the samples were combined to yield total bacteria and archaea in copies g 1 vss together they quantitatively represented the total community when considering the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the bacterial community and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa in the archaeal community as determined by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing an estimation was made of the relative abundance of each microbial group recent research combining flow cytometry and sequencing has proven the significance of combining absolute and relative abundances and proposed the tandem qpcr and sequencing as valuable alternative to flow cytometry props et al 2017 2 5 chemical analyses details on methods applied to determine ammonium nitrite nitrate biomass concentration and bulk 13c abundance can be found in supplementary material section s 5 2 6 statistical analyses statistical analysis was applied to check for significant differences in the obtained yield details can be found in supplementary material section s 6 3 results discussion 3 1 microbial community a phylogenetic tree was constructed for the aoa containing the abundance based representative full 16s rrna gene sequences of all otus present in mbrt constant and mbrt increase with more than one read over both reactors and 410 sequences from the nitrososphaera and nitrosopumilales according to embl taxonomy in silva release 132 fig 1 the most abundant otu otu 1 comprising 89 87 and 77 24 of the archaeal community in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively was related to the nitrososphaera genus but clustered relatively far from the closest known species nitrososphaera gargensis on average 95 5 identity in the trimmed alignment this might hint at the presence of a new species however genome resolved shotgun metagenomics is required to attribute the necessary functional genes to this otu to validate that it is responsible for the observed ammonia oxidation nonetheless given the high abundance and the classification within the nitrososphaera genus known to oxidize ammonia it is likely that this otu is responsible for the conversion and thus represents a novel nitrososphaera species the closest uncultured relative 100 sequence identity in the trimmed alignment space was a nitrososphaera species jx047156 found in a marine hot spring 58 5 68 5 c from kalianda island indonesia xu et al 2013 the phylogenetic tree for nob contained abundance based representative sequences of all otus classified as either in the phylum chloroflexi or the phylum nitrospira and 105 reference sequences of the phyla chloroflexi and nitrospira fig 2 the two most abundant otus were classified as nitrospira spp and were closely related to nitrospira calida 97 identity as opposed to 87 3 identity to the next closest related cultivated nitrospira nitrospira defluvii on day 1905 and 1230 of operation in mbrt constant and mbrt increase amplicon sequencing and qpcr were used to estimate the absolute and relative abundance of aoa and nob the absolute and relative abundance of bacteria and archaea in mbrt constant determined by qpcr was found to be 3 1x1013 7 9x1012 copies 43 16 and 4 1x1013 1 0x1013 copies 57 21 respectively in mbrt increase this was 2 1x1013 6 3x1012 copies 24 16 and 6 4x1013 3 7x1013 copies 76 49 respectively in both cultures no aob were found based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the bacterial community consisted of 26 and 22 nitrospira related nob mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively the archaeal community in mbrt constant comprised of 95 nitrososphaera related and 5 nitrosocosmicus related aoa whereas in mbrt increase 100 of the archaeal community was related to nitrososphaera applying the bacterial and archaeal community composition on the qpcr based relative abundance of bacteria and archaea rendered an aoa relative abundance of 56 8 17 9 and 75 5 55 0 and a nob relative abundance of 11 2 4 1 and 5 4 3 5 in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively these communities were highly enriched in aoa whereas less enriched in nob compared to previous studies on thermophilic nitrification in a bioreactor courtens et al 2016a 2016b 3 2 thermophilic biomass yield to the authors best knowledge only one study reported an observed yield of 0 067 g vss g 1 n at 48 c courtens et al 2016b the observed yield yobs takes into account both growth and decay maintenance whereas the maximum yield only includes growth instantly obtained from oxidizing ammonia or nitrite metcalf and eddy 2003 a new method was developed based on 13c incorporation vandekerckhove et al 2019 it enables a fast determination of the maximum yield of a specific group of organisms in a mixed culture and renders the work intensive isolation or enrichment unnecessary no significant difference in ymax aoa and ymax nob was observed when comparing both communities p 0 05 with aoa values of 0 16 0 01 and 0 20 0 02 g vss g 1 n and nob values of 0 040 0 005 and 0 043 0 002 g vss g 1 n for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively the maximum aoa yield was remarkably higher than a reported mesophilic aoa yield of 0 09 g dry mass g 1 n könneke et al 2014 furthermore lower mesophilic aob yields 0 06 0 11 g vss g 1 n were obtained using the same method based on 13c incorporation vandekerckhove et al 2019 linked to a more efficient pathway for co2 incorporation of aoa compared to aob könneke et al 2014 compared to other aob yields in literature the thermophilic aoa yield is within the range of 0 03 0 3 g vss g 1 n table s5 the thermophilic nitrospira yield was in the same range of its mesophilic counterpart 0 048 0 051 g vss g 1 n when determined based on 13c incorporation it was however higher than the thermophilic nitrospira yield determined previously 0 025 0 028 g vss g 1 n by the same method vandekerckhove et al 2019 it is also in the same range of other reported mesophilic yields for nitrospira 0 049 0 15 g vss g 1 n or nitrobacter 0 040 072 g vss g 1 n table s6 the discrepancy between the aoa and nob yield in the studied mixed cultures is reflected in the community enrichment as aoa were far more abundant than nob the overall nitrification yield was 0 20 0 24 g vss g 1 n which is in the same order of magnitude as previously determined 0 24 0 25 g vss g 1 n and exceeded the mesophilic yield 0 16 and 0 10 g vss g 1 n at 15 and 28 c respectively determined using 13c incorporation vandekerckhove et al 2019 3 3 growth kinetics the q m a x n h 4 n amounted up to 517 43 and 455 30 mg n g 1 vsstot d 1 and a q m a x n o 2 n of 358 6 and 417 20 mg n g 1 vsstot d 1 was obtained for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively taking into account the relative abundance of aoa 56 8 and 75 5 and nob 11 2 and 5 4 aoa specific rates of 0 91 0 30 and 0 61 0 44 g n g 1 vss d 1 and nob specific rates of 3 2 1 0 and 7 7 4 2 g n g 1 vss d 1 were estimated for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively the qmax aoa were low compared to reported literature values 0 67 6 85 g n g 1 vss d 1 whereas the qmax nob were similar to mesophilic nitrospira 3 3 8 9 g n g 1 vss d 1 and low compared to nitrobacter 9 6 72 g n g 1 vss d 1 table s4 and s6 multiplying qmax and ymax yielded estimated μmax values of 0 15 0 05 and 0 12 0 09 d 1 for nitrososphaera and 0 13 0 05 and 0 33 0 22 d 1 for nitrospira in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively the μmax aoa was similar to the growth rate of candidatus nitrosocaldus islandicus of 0 128 d 1 daebeler et al 2018 but lower than other described aoa 0 32 0 8 d 1 table s4 the thermophilic nitrospira growth rate was lower than literature values for mesophilic nitrospira 0 38 0 52 d 1 and nitrobacter 0 23 2 6 d 1 table s6 until this study the decay rate for thermophilic aoa and nob has not been determined yet the kd aoa in mbrt constant and mbrt increase was 0 231 0 002 and 0 285 0 002 d 1 respectively and the kd nob was 0 315 0 002 and 0 429 0 003 d 1 respectively fig s8 these values were within the range reported in literature of mesophilic aob 0 03 0 43 d 1 and nob 0 03 1 7 d 1 table s5 and s6 as sludge proliferated in the bioreactors kd could not be higher than μmax a rough calculation based on a vss and n balance in the mbr reactors demonstrated biomass growth yobs 0 028 0 035 g vss g 1 n at very high srt 88 182 days yielding estimated decay rates between 0 026 and 0 078 d 1 this indicates that the experimentally determined kd values were overestimated it is known that kd can vary depending on the conditions in a reactor system and comprises maintenance energy real decay of cells protozoa grazing salem et al 2006 it is possible that the transfer from continuous feeding in the reactors to prolonged 17 days stressful starvation induced a faster decay or that the inactivation rate was determined rather than the actual decay rate the decay rate from batch experiments was measured indirectly via the oxygen uptake rate in the presence of substrate instead of directly using biomass concentration measurements a potential lag phase in maximum activity was not taken into account a clear distinction was noticeable between endogenous respiration nitrite oxidation and ammonia oxidation so there was active oxidation measured fig s9 whether actual death of micro organisms occurred or if a transitions to starvation conditions with lower metabolic activity took place remains uncertain biochemical adjustments in a cell under starvation are called the stringent response process in which energy is redirected to maintenance and overall activity is slowed down resulting in a lower oxygen uptake rate mason et al 1986 in addition to the overestimated kd an underestimation of μmax was possible as well the loading rate in the mbr reactors was only 28 6 and 35 12 of q m a x n h 4 n in mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively meaning growth conditions were not optimal and in situ growth rates μ were smaller than μmax as biomass growth was observed in the mbrs μ is bound to be higher than kd and thus so must μmax be the obtained values for μmax were possibly underestimated by the fact that vss includes other particulate matter in addition to biomass metcalf and eddy 2003 molecular tools as qpcr and illumina sequencing might have introduced a bias as well in literature the simultaneous determination of nitrifier μmax and kd mostly involved model fitting to steady state reactor data batch test data or respirometry assays as opposed to experimental determination as performed in this study ahn et al 2008 hanaki et al 1990 kappeler and brodmann 1995 munz et al 2008 nowak et al 1995 park and noguera 2007 despite the possible underestimation of μmax it might be that the obtained thermophiles were slow growing issues of experimentally determined kd values being higher than μmax were not reported for faster growing aerobic heterotrophs converting organic carbon but it was shown that in situ versus batch wise determination of μmax and kd yielded different results with an overestimation of kd in batch experiments it was suggested to use the in situ estimated decay and the intrinsic μmax as obtained batch wise vogelaar et al 2003 3 4 apparent substrate affinity index substrate affinity plays an important role in niche differentiation and in the attainable effluent nitrogen concentration in wastewater treatment facilities the apparent affinity index of aoa for ammonium and oxygen in both reactors were similar with ks n aoa of 0 36 0 04 and 0 32 0 02 mg n l 1 and ks o aoa of 0 13 0 09 and 0 21 0 15 mg o2 l 1 for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively fig 3 a and b and fig 4 a and b the obtained apparent aoa affinity indices for ammonium were remarkably higher than previously reported for aoa 0 002 0 030 mg n l 1 and for comammox table s7 the thriving reactor conditions in this study as opposed to planktonic conditions in aoa enrichment studies elicits the influence of advectional and diffusional factors such as floc size oxygen substrate gradient mixing intensity reactor hydraulics on the apparent affinity indices arnaldos et al 2015 although mixing was intensive floc size was relatively small d90 33 24 35 28 μm fig s7 and biomass concentration was not unusually high in this study it cannot be excluded that these factors had an influence it has even been shown that microcolonies 16 μm within flocs affect the apparent affinity index picioreanu et al 2016 the biomass concentration during these experiments was higher in mbrt increase 4 45 4 85 g vss l 1 than in mbrt constant 2 95 3 85 g vss l 1 meaning that more diffusional and advectional resistance might have occurred to properly reflect actual conditions in practical applications the determination of substrate affinity under the influence of these physical resistances in bioreactors is essential the obtained apparent affinity indices are thus more likely to prevail in real life applications rather than the indices derived from single cell cultures compared to aob affinities 0 07 46 2 mg n l 1 determined in bioreactors these apparent affinity indices are quite low table s7 low ks n aoa is in accordance with literature as aoa are often found in oligotrophic environments erguder et al 2009 the ks o aoa 0 13 0 21 mg o2 l 1 was in the range of previously reported values 0 06 0 33 mg o2 l 1 table s7 considering possible advectional and diffusional resistances in this study compared to literature the actual affinity index could be higher compared to aob 0 18 5 95 mg o2 l 1 table s7 the obtained apparent affinity index is low indicative of literature statements on aoa niche differentiation and presence in oxygen limited habitats erguder et al 2009 the nob in mbrt increase had a slightly lower apparent affinity index for nitrite and oxygen 0 27 0 05 mg n l 1 and 0 15 0 05 mg o2 l 1 than the nob of mbrt constant 1 23 0 3 mg n l 1 and 0 55 0 27 mg o2 l 1 fig 3c and d and fig 4c and d the ks n nob and ks o nob values were within the range of reported affinity indices of mesophilic nitrospira 0 11 0 9 mg n l 1 and 0 13 0 54 mg o2 l 1 and nitrobacter 0 009 9 59 mg n l 1 and 0 25 1 66 mg o2 l 1 apparent affinity indices table s8 3 5 robustness of thermophilic nitrification when developing biotechnological solutions for nitrogen in wastewater it is important to acknowledge that abiotic factors are not stable practical application requires a robust community that can deal with stress situations however a properly controlled system prevents the occurrence of conditions to which the process is sensitive meaning the sensitivity of a microbial process should not hinder its application as nitrification can be regarded as the most vulnerable process in common nitrification denitrification or nitritation denitritation this study evaluated the capacity of the thermophilic cultures to deal with differences in substrate concentration ph temperature and salts to properly assess the susceptibility it must also be tested in long term experiments as opposed to the short term batch experiments performed in this study with regard to substrate inhibition it is important to distinguish between the chemical forms in equilibrium being ammonium ammonia and nitrite free nitrous acid fluctuations in temperature ph and substrate concentration in wastewater treatment facilities affect the substrate speciation and thus the possible inhibition of nitrification the aoa in both reactors were not susceptible to ammonium and fa concentrations up to 300 and 16 mg n l 1 fig 5 a which is in accordance with two previous studies on aoa courtens et al 2016a sauder et al 2017 however they were more tolerant than other aoa enrichments reporting full inhibition in the range of 14 280 mg nh4 n l 1 and 0 252 10 5 mg nh3 n l 1 hatzenpichler 2012 substrate accumulation might have a different effect on various species as substrate concentration has been hypothesized to drive niche differentiation within thaumarchaeota sauder et al 2017 the concentrations in a bioreactor can be considered higher than most oligotrophic environments from which aoa have been isolated and characterized thus selecting for more tolerant species in addition although biomass flocs were small in this study diffusional and advectional resistance might have been higher compared to cellular batch enrichments of the previous studies this resistance could yield lower substrate concentrations on a planktonic level thus rendering the organisms more tolerant to higher bulk concentrations furthermore both thermophilic communities were highly tolerant to salts with an ic50 for aoa of about 40 g nacl l 1 of added salinity 92 3 ms cm 1 and for nob of about 20 g nacl l 1 of added salinity 50 5 ms cm 1 the limited effect of salt on nitrification activity expands the application possibilities to salty nitrogenous streams fig s10 temperatures down to 40 c retained more than 70 of the nitrification activity fig 6 biomass from mbrt increase which was originally derived from mesophilic nitrifying sludge courtens et al 2016b could cope best with lower temperatures retaining 100 aoa and more than 85 nob activity as problems with nitrification often arise when temperatures exceed 40 c henze 1997 these findings are promising and suggest that the presence of the correct nitrifying species can expand the boundaries of current practices and enable nitrogen removal at a broad temperature range increasing temperatures on the other hand have proven to be detrimental to nitrite oxidation from 55 c and to ammonia oxidation from 60 c onwards 3 6 opportunities for short cut nitrogen removal in case nitratation could be prevented via smart process control short cut nitrogen removal could be established via nitritation denitritation or partial nitrification anammox rendering economic and ecological benefits peng et al 2017 vlaeminck et al 2012 besides nob suppression thermophilic anammox should be established as well recently anammox activity was reported for 2 weeks at 50 c in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb zhang et al 2018 several strategies for nob suppression have been proposed agrawal et al 2018 vlaeminck et al 2012 they involve fa or fna shock therapy nob are more susceptible to fa fna anthonisen et al 1976 working at decreased oxygen concentrations aob have a lower apparent oxygen affinity index than nob blackburne et al 2008 and decreasing the srt to wash out nob while retaining aob due to lower growth rate of nob at sidestream conditions hellinga et al 1998 the tolerance of nitrite oxidation towards fa and nh4 in this study ic50 16 mg nh3 n l 1 and 250 mg nh4 n l 1 fig 5 b was much higher than the reported range of 0 1 1 mg nh3 n l 1 anthonisen et al 1976 and the previously described ic50 of 5 mg nh3 n l 1 courtens et al 2016a the use of a fa shock therapy to suppress nitratation will thus be challenging at thermophilic temperatures the communities in this study were clearly inhibited by nitrite whereas free nitrous acid is usually depicted as inhibiting rather than nitrite fig 5 b and d fna acts as a protonophore which increases proton permeability through cell membranes this counteracts the proton pumping effect of atpase thus inhibiting atp synthesis furthermore fna may force bacteria to turn on or off particular enzymes to defend against its toxicity may affect gene transcriptional processes and mislead the enzyme assemblage and may directly react with enzymes involved in the metabolic processes zhou et al 2011 the inhibitory effect of nitrite to the thermophilic aoa and nob remains to be investigated especially the nob were highly susceptible to nitrite with an ic50 of 40 mg no2 n l 1 compared to 1 5 2 g no2 n l 1 for aoa opening up opportunities if nitrite accumulation can be established as nob in the studied bioreactor communities were more resilient to changing ph than aoa fig 6c and d changing the ph to mediate nitrite accumulation is difficult the optimum ph for aoa of both reactors was 6 9 retaining more than 60 of the activity in the range of 6 5 7 9 fig 6 a the nob proved to withstand ph changes better with an optimum of 6 7 in both reactors and over 80 and 90 remaining activity in the range of 6 4 7 8 for mbrt constant and mbrt increase respectively fig 6 c increasing the temperature on the other hand could facilitate the inhibition of nitratation as the nob activity was severely declined at 55 c whereas the aoa activity remained unaffected fig 6a and b the nob apparent oxygen affinity index in mbrt increase was similar to the aoa apparent oxygen affinity 0 21 0 15 and 0 15 0 05 mg o2 l 1 respectively whereas in mbrt constant the aoa displayed a lower apparent oxygen affinity index compared to nob affinity 0 13 0 09 and 0 55 0 27 mg o2 l 1 respectively mediating nob out selection by aeration control would thus only be possible in mbrt constant this renders the need for kinetic characterization of every nitrifying community before qualifying for aeration control to enable short cut nitrogen removal finally the strategy of aggressive srt control does not seem feasible at thermophilic temperatures as the nob maximum growth rate 0 13 0 33 d 1 was higher when compared to aoa 0 12 0 15 d 1 overall this study shows that current strategies for nob suppression might prove difficult at thermophilic temperatures 4 conclusions this study characterized the stoichiometry and kinetics of two thermophilic nitrifying bioreactor communities the most abundant archaeal otu was related to the nitrososphaera genus but clustered relatively far from the known species nitrososphaera gargensis 95 5 identity the most abundant nob were related to nitrospira calida 97 identity thermophilic nitrification yield was 0 20 0 24 g vss g 1 n resulting mainly from a high aoa yield 0 16 0 20 g vss g 1 n which was reflected in a higher aoa abundance 57 76 compared to nob 5 11 batch wise determination of decay rates aoa 0 23 0 29 d 1 nob 0 32 0 43 d 1 rendered overestimated values compared to in situ estimation of the total decay rate 0 026 0 078 d 1 possibly because the inactivation rate was determined in the batch experiments rather than the actual decay rate estimations of maximum growth rates aoa 0 12 0 15 d 1 nob 0 13 0 33 d 1 were low and possibly underestimated apparent substrate affinity indices were low as is indicative of thermophilic nitrifying organisms a high nob susceptibility towards nitrite accumulation ic50 40 mgno2 n l 1 is favorable for developing shortcut nitrogen removal however nob had a high growth rate and low apparent oxygen affinity index 0 15 0 55 mg o2 l 1 and were resilience towards free ammonia ic50 16 mg nh3 n l 1 this might complicate nob outselection using common practices srt control aeration control free ammonia shocks overall the obtained insights in thermophilic nitrification can assist in integrating thermophilic conversions to facilitate single sludge nitrification

18892,over the past few decades seawater desalination has become a necessity for freshwater supply in many countries worldwide particularly in arid and semi arid regions one potentially high quality feed water for desalination is saline groundwater sgw from coastal aquifers which has lower fouling propensity than seawater this study examines the effect of pumping sgw from a phreatic coastal aquifer on fresh groundwater particularly on the dynamics of the fresh saline water interface fsi initially we constructed a 3d finite element model of a phreatic coastal aquifer by using the feflow software which solves the coupled variable density groundwater flow and solute transport equations then we compared and validated the results of the model to those of a field scale pumping test the model indicates that pumping sgw from a coastal aquifer freshens the aquifer and rehabilitates parts that were salinized due to seawater intrusion an effect that increases with increasing pumping rate in addition when simultaneously pumping fresh groundwater further inland and sgw from below the fsi the freshening effect is less pronounced and the salinity of the aquifer is more stable in line with the results of the model the field experiment revealed that salinity in the observation well decreases over the course of pumping taken together our findings demonstrate that in addition to providing a high quality source feed water for desalination pumping sgw does not salinize the aquifer and even rehabilitates it by negating the effect of seawater intrusion these findings are important for planning shoreline desalination facilities and for managing arid coastal regions with lack of water supply and over exploited aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater intrusion desalination saline groundwater coastal aquifers management 1 introduction over the past few decades the increasing population in coastal areas has led to higher water demand and overexploitation of water resources especially in arid and semi arid regions vorosmarty 2000 several technological solutions have been presented to help cope with the shortage of freshwater fw seawater desalination by reverse osmosis ro is a promising method for dealing with water scarcity in israel which has experienced frequent drought years in the past decades around 600 million cubic meters a year mm3 year of fw about 60 of the country s water domestic demand comes from seawater reverse osmosis desalination becker and ward 2015 an alternative source for desalination in coastal aquifers is the saline groundwater sgw found beneath the fresh saline water interface fsi which originates from the sea intrusion dehwah et al 2015 dehwah and missimer 2016 missimer et al 2013 as compared with seawater the main advantage of using sgw as feed is the low fouling propensity of the water which greatly reduces the amount of chemicals required during the pretreatment stein et al 2016 its low fouling propensity results not only from the natural filtration of sgw through the porous media missimer et al 2013 riolo 2001 but also from its low levels of organic carbon alshahri et al 2017 dehwah and missimer 2016 and dissolved oxygen and from its low turbidity and silt density index sdi sola et al 2013 in addition sgw presents advantages as feed for desalination over seawater because its temperature unlike that of seawater is constant throughout the year sola et al 2013 finally although the initial investment in a sgw intake system is higher than that of a seawater intake system the operational costs of desalination plants that feed from sgw are lower over longer operation times missimer et al 2013 shahabi et al 2015 therefore it is potentially more economical to use sgw than seawater as feed for desalination to date several ro desalination plants are located next to the shoreline and take their feed from the sgw body beneath the fsi the largest desalination plant that utilizes sgw as feed is located in sur oman where a set of 28 beach wells located 30 250 m from the shoreline pump approximately 60 mm3 year of sgw from the karstic aquifer rachman et al 2014 another desalination plant that feeds from sgw is located in almeria spain and produces around 16 mm3 year of potable water pulido bosch et al 2004 rodríguez estrella and pulido bosch 2009 several other desalination plant use sgw as their feed water for example in malta riolo 2001 saudi arabia the caribbean rachman et al 2014 the canary islands california and belize missimer et al 2013 in many arid areas the coastal aquifer is the traditional and main freshwater source the water quality in these aquifers has continuously deteriorated mainly due to anthropogenic activities konikow and kendy 2005 in these coastal systems sgw with salinity of seawater flows inland below the fw and when it meets the fw in the mixing zone the flow shifts naturally up and back to the ocean with the fw gradient oz et al 2015 the phenomenon of fw discharging to the sea is called submarine groundwater discharge sgd this phenomenon is responsible for transporting large amounts of potentially useable fresh potable water to the sea in some cases the discharge is 40 of some rivers water flux moore 1996 adequate knowledge on salt water intrusion distribution is important to predict the future behavior of the salinity field in time and space under different natural and man made e g pumping scenarios for proper coastal aquifer management werner et al 2013 to this end numerical simulations are used as a common tool by hydrogeologists for investigating and managing coastal aquifers dispersive solute transport and interface models are the two approaches that track saltwater movement in seawater intrusion models bakker et al 2013 the use of these models is widespread when dealing with problems of pumping from a coastal aquifer models with sharp interface have abrupt behavior near a pumping well and thus may give skewed results park and hong 2006 park et al 2008 kopsiaftis et al 2017 however it should be taken into account that all numerical approaches have some uncertainty with their input parameters making them more complex rajabi et al 2015 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2014 and high computational time is required few studies investigated and developed multi objective models for dealing with seawater intrusion while pumping fw and using barrier wells of sgw with a purpose of minimizing the sgw pumping and maximizing the fw pumping dhar and datta 2009 sreekanth and datta 2011 also under parameter uncertainty sreekanth and datta 2014 2 d numerical model showed that pumping of brackish water from the interface can restrain seawater intrusion sherif and kacimov 2003 another study that used a numerical model showed that pumping saline water at a low rate of 5 mm3 year for the use of a small desalination plant can freshen the aquifer in the vicinity of the pumping well mogheir 2016 numerical modeling studies of seawater intrusion in qatar baalousha 2016 and oman kacimov et al 2009 have shown that pumping sgw may decrease and even reverse seawater intrusion however in these studies the results were site specific and limited to the information gathered from the field in addition these studies treated this issue as a sharp interface problem instead of a dispersive transition zone kacimov et al 2009 mehdizadeh et al 2015 kopsiaftis et al 2017 there are very few studies that have investigated the effect of pumping sgw below the fsi from coastal aquifers on the aquifer to the best of our knowledge the present study shows for the first time the fsi dynamics corresponding to high intensities of sgw pumping and the capacities of high quality feed water that can be pumped below the fsi without detrimental effects on the fresh water body the general aim of the current study was to investigate the fsi dynamics at different pumping rates and location of the sgw wells from the shore in a phreatic aquifer and furthermore to examine the potential of pumping sgw and freshwater further inland simultaneously using a numerical model we demonstrated the fsi response to sgw pumping in three dimensional 3d scenarios this research explains for the first time in high resolution the hydrological effects of sgw pumping for desalination plants and its consequences for restraint of seawater intrusion 2 methods 2 1 numerical model a 3d phreatic coastal aquifer model was first constructed to simulate the shape and location of the fsi in a steady state mode without pumping the model was then used to test the effects of pumping sgw below the fsi of the mediterranean coastal aquifer in israel the purpose of the model was to simulate the dynamics of the fsi under various pumping scenarios at different rates and distances from the shore the aquifer model code used in this study was the feflow code diersch 2014 which employs a finite element solution of the coupled variable density flow and solute transport equations the 3d model was constructed as 13 vertical layers with dimensions of 30 km in length 6 km in width and 250 m in depth fig 1 further information about the constructed model layers number and the mesh can be found in the supplementary information it is important to mention that the model was constructed with homogeneous and anisotropic hydraulic properties it is well known that salt water intrusion processes are sensitive to preferential flow paths and heterogeneity of the porous media however the model was simplified in order to prevent numerical errors and enable realistic computational time the boundary conditions applied to the model are as follows fig 1 the mediterranean seawater boundary west of the shore was represented by the equivalent fw head using the following equation 1 h f w h s w α h s w z where hfw represents the equivalent fw head hsw represents the saltwater head α represents the density ratio and z represents the elevation with respect to sea level the saltwater head was set to 0 because it is the mean sea level the density ratio α was defined by the following equation 2 α ρ m a x ρ 0 ρ 0 where ρmax is the seawater density 1 025 g cm3 and ρ0 is the fw density 1 g cm3 the salt concentration of the seawater at this boundary is 35 000 mg l of total dissolved solids tds the top boundary east of the coast has a fw recharge rate of 200 mm year representing rainfall replenishment 600 mm of annual rain and a recharge rate of 1 3 the eastern vertical boundary and the bottom boundary of the model were impervious the other initial parameters were set as described in table 1 and represent the coastal aquifer of israel yechieli et al 2010 despite the fact that the hydrological parameters are of the calcareous sandstone in israel this study represents the situation in many other coastal aquifers around the world which possesses similar hydraulic properties 2 2 sensitivity analysis a systematic series of simulations was applied to examine the fsi dynamics resulting from pumping sgw below it in these simulations one pumping well was introduced at a depth of 200 250 m and a distance of 30 m from the shore and in a different set of simulations the pumping well was placed at a distance of 100 m from the shore for each simulation eight scenarios were tested with pumping rates of 2 5 7 5 10 12 5 15 20 or 30 mm3 year in addition the same sets of scenarios were tested for pumping sgw and fw further inland simultaneously in order to study the phenomenon of abstraction these two water types therefore five new pumping wells were introduced to the model 3 km perpendicular from the shore each with perforation at a depth of 10 60 m fig 1 these wells pumped fw for 50 years without sgw pumping until a new steady state was reached with enhanced seawater intrusion the same set of simulations was then applied for the new steady state with a continuous pumping of fw at 5 mm3 year next we simulated scenarios with 50 less recharge at the top boundary 100 compared to 200 mm year at steady state in order to conceptualize an intensely pumped aquifer that yields a lower hydraulic gradient towards the sea in some coastal aquifers pumping from shallower depths is more realistic therefore two additional scenarios were tested with a shallower perforation area at a depth of 100 150 m which is 100 m shallower than the previous scenarios shown before one comprising only sgw pumping and the other comprising both sgw and fw pumping all simulations were conducted in a transient mode for 20 years table 2 summarizes the different simulations that were conducted in the framework of this study further descriptive sensitivity analysis was carried out where different hydraulic parameters namely hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity storativity and recharge were changed separately and compared to the generic model siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 in these simulations the model ran with pumping of 10 mm3 year and the results were compared see table 3 at the results section this sensitivity analysis allows to have a better comprehension about the parameters effecting the interface dynamics due to sgw pumping a volumetric box was set as a domain of interest doi below the land side of the aquifer fig 1 and had dimensions of 20 km in length 1 km in width and the depth of the aquifer below the land side 250 m the dissolved mass in the doi box was compared between the different scenarios for each scenario the salinity ratio ɸ was calculated as the mass of dissolved solids after 20 years of pumping mt divided by the initial mass m0 which quantitatively reflects the amount of seawater intrusion ɸ 1 or aquifer freshening ɸ 1 the single pumping well that was simulated in this study conceptualizes an area that is subjected to pumping which may include wellfield and not necessarily only one well see supplementary information 2 3 the field experimental settings a field scale pumping test was conducted at the nitzanim natural reserve located in the southern coastal plain of israel the aquifer investigated in the test is phreatic with a depth of 70 m and is composed of sand and calcareous sandstone to determine the fsi shape and location in the area salinity profiles were conducted for five deep wells situated linearly perpendicular to the shore in regular intervals over 900 m these wells were previously drilled to monitor the fsi fig 2 the salinity profiles in the wells were generated using a 100 m cable connected to an electrical conductivity ec and temperature sensing electrode wtw 1970i germany water was pumped from a well p well fig 2 located 70 m from the shore at a depth of 50 m 37 m below the water table an air lift pump atlas copco xas45 sweden was used to continuously extract 2 5 m3 h of sgw for 4 days which was monitored for ec frequently using an ec meter wtw ks multi 3xxi the pumping well is perforated through its entire length and the depth of the fsi in the well 50 salinity in ec was measured at a depth of 33 5 m 16 5 m below the water table the fsi was monitored in an observation well ob fig 2 located 13 m south of the pumping well at a depth of 27 m 16 m below the water table this observation well is perforated only in its lower 1 m allowing reliable monitoring of the change in the fsi without tide influence levanon et al 2013 to monitor the fsi at steady state ec and pressure data logger sensors solinst 3001 ltc junior were inserted into the well 6 days before pumping had started the data logger recorded the ec every 15 min throughout the pumping period and was taken out 1 h after pumping stopped overall the data logger was in the well for 10 days storing data 2 4 3d simulations of the field scale pumping test a feflow 3d model of the aquifer at the nitzanim natural reserve was built in order to simulate the field scale pumping test the transition zone position and width were calibrated in a 2d transient mode using a trial and error method until a reasonable match between the fsi location in the model and that measured in the field was obtained next the model was expanded into a 3d domain with dimensions of 7 km in length 60 m in width and 100 m in depth the pumping well was located 70 m from the shore in the middle of the domain and the observation well was placed accordingly the parameters that were used in the model after calibration are summarized in the results section the field results were obtained using an ec diver placed in the well ms cm units while the model results are given in ppm units to account for the different salinity units a relative salinity reduction was calculated in relation to the specific salinity point in space as the diver measured in the aquifer a 2 error is met in regard to the location in space of the exact salinity point due to the mesh density of the model 3 results and discussion two aspects of the simulations results were quantified 1 the salt balance of the aquifer after 20 years of sgw pumping and 2 the change in water salinity in the pumping well in response to sgw pumping 3 1 aquifer reaction to sgw pumping a series of simulations were conducted to examine the fsi response to different pumping rates of sgw below the fsi the results indicated that pumping sgw below the fsi changes the position and shape of the fsi causing it to descend and move toward the well fig 3 this phenomenon was observed by electrical conductivity profiles in the andarax delta in spain while a desalination plant is pumping for 7 months in a rate of 12 mm3 year jorreto et al 2009 the model shows that the shape of the fsi remains largely constant at relatively low pumping rates of 2 mm3 year whereas higher pumping rates of 5 mm3 year cause the dispersion zone of the fsi to become wider fig 3 b and c a somewhat similar phenomenon was reported in a previous study in which pumping fw above the fsi caused the dispersive zone to become wider mehdizadeh et al 2015 our model shows that as the sgw pumping rate increases fw replaces the former location of the saline water as the fsi location is lowered and moves toward the sea pumping sgw below the fsi creates a conic shape of the interface or a salinity cone of depression in the direction of the well fig 4 as the pumping rate increases the radius of the cone increases and vice versa a case study in gaza showed the same phenomena of a salinity cone of depression due to sgw pumping to a desalination plant using 2d map view and cross section view mogheir 2016 the salinity ratio ɸ in the doi is shown in fig 5 a in all scenarios and simulation sets examined a general trend of decreasing ɸ values can be seen as pumping rates increase therefore even a single well that pumps sgw at a normal rate of 2 mm3 year 200 m3 h can freshen the aquifer in its vicinity observation of aquifer freshening were also reported by javadi et al 2015 with sgw pumping and fw injection system in a 2 d model to further quantify the aquifer response and the fsi dynamics to sgw pumping the fsi toe location measured where the 50 salinity iso line meets the aquifer bottom was normalized to its initial location xt x0 1 and compared between the different scenarios the simulations showed that pumping of sgw shifts the fsi toe toward the well and that this effect becomes more prominent when pumping rates are increased fig 5b a significant change in the location of the fsi toe can be seen at higher pumping rates 20 30 mm3 year such that the toe location ratio value decreases below 0 8 and reaches 0 2 at a pumping rate of 30 mm3 year 100 m from the shore fig 5b these results imply that most of the dissolved salts and therefore most of the sgw that flows to the well originate from the sea side rather than the land side otherwise a greater reduction of the fsi toe location ratio and the disappearance of sgw below the land side would have been observed a research on the tordera aquifer in spain showed with an isotopic and geochemical approach that most of saline water that is being pumped for a desalination plant comes from the sea otero et al 2011 another finding of the model is that the distance of the pumping well from shore affects the amount of dissolved mass that is pumped out of the aquifer pumping wells that are located further inland 100 m from the shore exert greater effects on aquifer freshening possibly due to the closer initial distance between the well and the fsi toe moreover due to the natural shape of the fsi wedge sgw wells of similar depths but that are drilled further inland will be closer to the fsi zone and therefore easily draw more dissolved salts and replace this volume with less saline water the fw discharge to the sea darcy flux was compared between the different scenarios in one node directly above the pumping well perforation in order to further examine the aquifer response to sgw pumping this is an indicator of the submarine groundwater discharge sgd flux which generally appears to decrease with increasing pumping rates fig 5c the distance of the sgw pumping well from the shore does not significantly influence the sgd flux for example the natural darcy flux to the sea without pumping was 0 55 m d while after 20 years of pumping sgw at a rate of 30 mm3 year the darcy flux declined to 0 4 m d in most coastal aquifers sgd occurs naturally the sgd rate in coastal aquifers is estimated to be between 1 2 105 and 1 7 1011 m3 year depending on the basin scale burnett et al 2006 limiting the sgd rate is desirable to preserve the amount of fw available for use within the coastal aquifer in the israeli coastal aquifer south of the city of ashdod there is a series of wells termed coastal collectors bear et al 1999 which are located parallel to and at distance of 0 5 1 km from the shore and pump the shallow fw above the interface in order to restrain the water from being discharged to the sea nevertheless this method is not 100 efficient and water is still discharged to the ocean the method proposed here for pumping sgw harnesses the sgd water freshens the well and thereby allows for the use of this valuable water and the reduction of the osmotic pressure in the desalination process which in turn reduces the operational costs stein et al 2016 one potential way to manage the pumping more efficiently near the shoreline without affecting the salinity field more than necessary and without pumping fw together with the saline water is to pump sgw while simultaneously pumping fw further inland this method enables a continuous use of fw pumping wells and it provides a supplementary source of water through sgw desalination the scenarios in which pumping sgw and fw simultaneously is applied results in shifting the fsi towards the saline well fig 6 b and c in this case as in the previous scenario in which only sgw was pumped an increase in pumping rate results in more dissolved salt shown as salinity contours being drawn into the sgw pumping well the simulation results indicate a freshening of the aquifer similar to the set of simulations shown in fig 3 but this freshening is less pronounced due to fw withdrawal further inland for example the 50 salinity contours were closer to the well when fw was not pumped further inland fig s1 pumping only sgw had a greater freshening effect on the aquifer than pumping fw simultaneously freshening it up to ɸ 0 35 at a pumping rate of 30 mm3 year while with fw pumping a higher value of ɸ 0 47 was observed for the same pumping rate fig 5a indicating less freshening another expression of the aquifer freshening was found in the fsi toe location which in this case was lower than in the case of pumping only sgw fig 5b moreover the aquifer demonstrated lower sgd rates with fw pumping further inland as compared with pumping sgw alone fig 5c this combined pumping method has great potential as a tool for coastal aquifer management as pumping sgw for desalination prevents further seawater intrusion while fresh groundwater pumping still provides high quality water and prevents the wasting of fresh groundwater by limiting sgd in the scenarios of shallower perforation where pumping is initially closer to the fsi where the top part of the well touches the 75 salinity iso line the results were somewhat different than that of the previous scenarios in that the aquifer undergoes less freshening fig 7 b and c in these scenarios the fsi stabilizes at the depth of the perforation the pumping rate is a crucial factor that shifts the fsi location and in some cases the fsi stabilizes at the perforation depth at lower pumping rates from wells with deeper perforation the fsi does not reach the perforation depth at steady state however when the perforation is initially closer to the fsi lower pumping rates are required to reach steady state in which the fsi stabilizes at the perforation depth and therefore the salinity in the well is lower a similar trend has been observed in a laboratory experiment noorabadi et al 2017 however pumping in the aforementioned experiment was only from fw instead of sgw additionally when the perforation area was closer to the fsi lower pumping rates were needed to pump higher salinity water in the present study when fw pumping was applied together with sgw the fsi stabilized at a shallower depth than without fw pumping and the transition zone became wider fig 7c all of the above scenarios represent the flow domain of the aquifer assuming no intensive fw pumping had occurred however presently intensive fw pumping is applied throughout most parts of the israeli coastal aquifer and other coastal aquifers worldwide which substantially lowers the amount of fw flowing to the sea and lowers the hydraulic gradient when less fw is recharging the aquifer while sgw is being pumped the sgd is decreased fig 5c and the aquifer experiences less freshening the value of ɸ is higher than the above scenarios which means less freshening and there is no change in the fsi toe location as the pumping rate increases fig 5a and b blue diamonds this is due to the natural lower hydraulic gradient that usually pushes the fsi seawards and changes its location along with the sgw pumping previous studies suggested somewhat different approaches of pumping fresh and more brackish groundwater simultaneously to mitigate seawater intrusion one approach suggests the pumping of brackish and saline groundwater 300 10 000 mg cl l from underneath the fresh well to the desalination plant in order to maintain the well s freshness while other study used this concept in a complex aquifer combined with fw injection khadra et al 2017 although this concept is different from the one suggested in the current study it represents a similar idea of pumping the unwanted water for a different use and consequently reaching a desirable equilibrium in the aquifer which is sustainable over long durations our approach in contrast suggests pumping higher salinity water 18 000 21 000 mg cl l close to shore and fw further inland prevent the saline well to become fresher and extract sgw for ro desalination which is with higher quality compare to seawater 3 2 water salinity in the sgw pumping well as shown above pumping water from sgw wells pushes the fsi toward the well and a notable freshening of the well containing a mix of fresh and saline water is often observed at equilibrium this phenomenon has been noted in sand tanks shi et al 2011 and in pumping wells adjacent to a desalination plant otero et al 2011 to analyze the salinity of the groundwater pumped from the aquifer the salinity in the well was calculated for each scenario after 20 years of pumping according to the final salinity the fw content in the sgw well was calculated according to the following equation 3 f w c o n t e n t 1 s s s e a where s mg l is the salinity in the well after 20 years of pumping and ssea mg l is the sea salinity 35 000 mg l sgw pumping reduces the water salinity of the pumping well when the pumping rate is relatively high 2 mm3 year increasing the pumping rate decreases the pumping well salinity fig 8 a this result coincides with the reduction in the dissolved mass ɸ ratio in the aquifer fig 5a which decreases the salinity of the aquifer when the pumping well is located further inland the ultimate salinity at steady state is lower due to the proximity of the well to the fsi toe as the pumping rate increases the fw component in the well increases as well fig 8b reaching up to 30 of fw content at a distance of 100 m from the shoreline at a pumping rate of 30 mm3 year fig 8b shows the fw pumping rate dashed lines in the sgw pumping well as two end members as an absolute value according to the following equation 4 q f q t f w c o n t e n t where qf m3 d is the fw fraction pumping rate and qt m3 d is the total pumping rate the fw component results coincide with those shown in fig 5c where the sgd decreases as the fw pumping rate to the saline pumping well increases which implies the shifting of fw velocity vectors toward the well the water velocity vectors in the vicinity of the pumping well are changing as a factor of the distance from the well and its salinity as fw tends to flow ultimately to the sea and be relatively slow in comparison to the saline water fig 9 for example the water velocity vector in one node 20 m from the pumping well with salinity of 33 300 mg l is 1 2 m d while the water velocity in a different node at the same distance from the well at salinity of 7 000 mg l is 0 35 m d this along with the fact that the well remains mostly saline leads to the conclusion that most of the water that flows to the well originated from the sea no significant water level drawdown was noticed in any of the tested scenarios even when the perforation zone was high the drawdown of the water table above the deep perforation at a depth of 200 250 m at a pumping rate of 10 mm3 year was 5 cm while the drawdown in the case of a shallower perforation 100 150 m at the same pumping rate was 14 cm when a 30 mm3 year pumping rate was used the drawdown of the deeper perforated well remained 5 cm while that of the shallower perforated well increased to 50 cm the rate of fw recharge is 200 mm year which when considering the model s dimensions results in 24 mm3 year of fw recharge in the entire model in the extreme case of pumping 30 mm3 year of sgw the rate of fw pumping in the sgw well is 9 mm3 year fig 8b however when pumping both sgw and fw at 30 and 5 mm3 year respectively the total fw pumping is 12 mm3 year 7 mm3 year at the sgw well although this value 12 mm3 year is 50 of the recharge rate 24 mm3 year no substantial drawdown was observed these phenomena of lower salinity in the well have significant implications for operating desalination plants a lower salinity of the feed water compared to seawater enables higher recoveries in the reverse osmosis process due to the reduced osmotic pressure and may thus reduce the operational costs stein et al 2016 furthermore to obtain the same yield of desalinated water less energy is used to desalinate sgw in comparison to seawater as a result of the lower pressure required and therefore less greenhouse gasses are emitted an economic and environmental assessment that took place in australia showed that it is more cost efficient to desalinate sgw than open source seawater mostly due to a reduced pretreatment demand and that greenhouse gas emissions are lower when desalinating sgw than seawater shahabi et al 2015 the impact of the freshening of the sgw wells with time leading to reduced operational costs was not mentioned in the aforementioned assessment which may further enhance the economic and environmental benefits of desalination of sgw it is interesting to note that despite the high pumping rate 60 mm3 year km employed by the desalination plant in oman no impact on the aquifer was reported david et al 2009 a possible explanation is that the local aquifer is comprised of carbonate rocks with large karst features of very high transmissivity the model in the current study in contrast represents a sandstone aquifer such as the coastal aquifer of israel which may explain this discrepancy on the other hand the desalination plant in blanes spain pumps 14 mm3 year km for its feed water from 10 beach wells the wells are located on a sedimentary material of the tordera delta which mainly comprises sand sandstone and gravel with some variations of silt and clay layers otero et al 2011 reported that after three years of pumping a freshening of the aquifer had occurred and was observed in three wells whose ec values dropped from 50 to 42 ms cm our results are in line with these findings as the wells in blanes were freshened by 16 while the same pumping rate caused a freshening of the well of 11 in our simulations 3 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to study and compare the weight of each parameter on the fsi dynamics corresponding to sgw pumping table 3 summarizes these results the compared parameters were the pumping well salinity ɸ ratio relative sgd flux and the normalized fsi toe location the sgd flux and the toe location are presented here as relative numbers due to the fact that the initial value was not equal in all steady state scenarios with the change in one parameter the results show that the model is mostly sensitive to the hydrological conductivity and the recharge rate similar results were found in recent studies in china zeng et al 2018 and in italy filippis et al 2016 this sensitivity analysis can be of use for predicting the effect of sgw pumping on the fsi dynamics in different aquifers in the world with similar hydraulic parameters 3 4 field scale pumping test to experimentally test some of the numerical results described above a preliminary field scale pumping test was conducted in the nitzanim natural reserve in israel a cross section of the fsi in the nitzanim natural reserve constructed through salinity profiles is shown in fig 10 in addition a full scale 3d model was constructed for this area and was calibrated by using the trial and error method matching the field salinity data of the fsi location to its location in the model red line in fig 10 the parameters that were used in the model after calibration are summarized in table 4 the conditions used in the model correlated with the conditions measured in the field experiment a decrease in groundwater salinity was observed as pumping started followed by a constant linear decrease in salinity until the pumping stopped fig 11 the initial value of the measured ec was 0 815 ms cm while the final ec value was 0 74 ms cm reflecting a 10 reduction in salinity by the end of the pumping test the field measurement showed a relative salinity reduction to 0 9 from the initial value similar to the result at the end of the model run where the relative salinity reduction was 0 92 of the initial salinity despite the low initial salinity in the well 0 815 ms cm this freshening trend of up to 90 from the initial salinity implies a displacement of the fsi downward and toward the sea the salinity in the pumping well was 49 5 0 2 ms cm and was unchanged throughout the four days of pumping probably due to the low pumping rate 2 5 m3 h the results of the field scale experiment show similar trend of freshening surrounding the pumping well at the nitzanin model and at the general model results implying that the model results in this work are valid 4 summary and conclusions a series of 3d phreatic aquifer model simulations were conducted by using the feflow code in order to estimate the fsi dynamics in response to sgw pumping beneath it the results of these simulations clearly indicate that pumping sgw beneath the fsi pushes the fsi toward the sea and freshens both the aquifer and the pumping well in addition as the pumping rate increases the freshening effect is intensified and the fw content in the well increases the distance of the well from the shore is an important factor determining the extent of the freshening effect as pumping closer to the shore attenuates the freshening effect and the salinity in the well remains more stable a different approach is pumping simultaneously fw further inland to stabilize the fsi between the wells and keep the sgw well saline and the fw well fresh in such cases both the aquifer and the pumping well undergo less freshening it is important to mention that the model was simplified and that in reality the fsi may behave somewhat differently due to heterogeneity and anisotropy of the specific aquifer hydraulic parameters the amount of sgw that can be pumped for desalination is subjected to regional municipal and governmental laws and perspectives about coastal aquifer management furthermore the amount of sgw that can be pumped depends on the hydrogeological formation and the initial situation of the aquifer whereas in aquifers where seawater intrusion stretches deep inland higher amounts of sgw can be pumped with little change of the well salinity in addition the sensitivity analysis shows that aquifer with lower hydraulic conductivity and higher recharge are prone to have higher changes in the salinity field which is expressed by intensive aquifer freshening this approach can provide an alternative source of feed water for desalination while simultaneously pumping fw for domestic or agricultural use without enhancing sea water intrusion moreover it can help to cope with seawater intrusion issues in overexploited aquifers by reversing this process thereby we can use the two water types in the aquifer as individual resources without a detrimental environmental effect this

18892,over the past few decades seawater desalination has become a necessity for freshwater supply in many countries worldwide particularly in arid and semi arid regions one potentially high quality feed water for desalination is saline groundwater sgw from coastal aquifers which has lower fouling propensity than seawater this study examines the effect of pumping sgw from a phreatic coastal aquifer on fresh groundwater particularly on the dynamics of the fresh saline water interface fsi initially we constructed a 3d finite element model of a phreatic coastal aquifer by using the feflow software which solves the coupled variable density groundwater flow and solute transport equations then we compared and validated the results of the model to those of a field scale pumping test the model indicates that pumping sgw from a coastal aquifer freshens the aquifer and rehabilitates parts that were salinized due to seawater intrusion an effect that increases with increasing pumping rate in addition when simultaneously pumping fresh groundwater further inland and sgw from below the fsi the freshening effect is less pronounced and the salinity of the aquifer is more stable in line with the results of the model the field experiment revealed that salinity in the observation well decreases over the course of pumping taken together our findings demonstrate that in addition to providing a high quality source feed water for desalination pumping sgw does not salinize the aquifer and even rehabilitates it by negating the effect of seawater intrusion these findings are important for planning shoreline desalination facilities and for managing arid coastal regions with lack of water supply and over exploited aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater intrusion desalination saline groundwater coastal aquifers management 1 introduction over the past few decades the increasing population in coastal areas has led to higher water demand and overexploitation of water resources especially in arid and semi arid regions vorosmarty 2000 several technological solutions have been presented to help cope with the shortage of freshwater fw seawater desalination by reverse osmosis ro is a promising method for dealing with water scarcity in israel which has experienced frequent drought years in the past decades around 600 million cubic meters a year mm3 year of fw about 60 of the country s water domestic demand comes from seawater reverse osmosis desalination becker and ward 2015 an alternative source for desalination in coastal aquifers is the saline groundwater sgw found beneath the fresh saline water interface fsi which originates from the sea intrusion dehwah et al 2015 dehwah and missimer 2016 missimer et al 2013 as compared with seawater the main advantage of using sgw as feed is the low fouling propensity of the water which greatly reduces the amount of chemicals required during the pretreatment stein et al 2016 its low fouling propensity results not only from the natural filtration of sgw through the porous media missimer et al 2013 riolo 2001 but also from its low levels of organic carbon alshahri et al 2017 dehwah and missimer 2016 and dissolved oxygen and from its low turbidity and silt density index sdi sola et al 2013 in addition sgw presents advantages as feed for desalination over seawater because its temperature unlike that of seawater is constant throughout the year sola et al 2013 finally although the initial investment in a sgw intake system is higher than that of a seawater intake system the operational costs of desalination plants that feed from sgw are lower over longer operation times missimer et al 2013 shahabi et al 2015 therefore it is potentially more economical to use sgw than seawater as feed for desalination to date several ro desalination plants are located next to the shoreline and take their feed from the sgw body beneath the fsi the largest desalination plant that utilizes sgw as feed is located in sur oman where a set of 28 beach wells located 30 250 m from the shoreline pump approximately 60 mm3 year of sgw from the karstic aquifer rachman et al 2014 another desalination plant that feeds from sgw is located in almeria spain and produces around 16 mm3 year of potable water pulido bosch et al 2004 rodríguez estrella and pulido bosch 2009 several other desalination plant use sgw as their feed water for example in malta riolo 2001 saudi arabia the caribbean rachman et al 2014 the canary islands california and belize missimer et al 2013 in many arid areas the coastal aquifer is the traditional and main freshwater source the water quality in these aquifers has continuously deteriorated mainly due to anthropogenic activities konikow and kendy 2005 in these coastal systems sgw with salinity of seawater flows inland below the fw and when it meets the fw in the mixing zone the flow shifts naturally up and back to the ocean with the fw gradient oz et al 2015 the phenomenon of fw discharging to the sea is called submarine groundwater discharge sgd this phenomenon is responsible for transporting large amounts of potentially useable fresh potable water to the sea in some cases the discharge is 40 of some rivers water flux moore 1996 adequate knowledge on salt water intrusion distribution is important to predict the future behavior of the salinity field in time and space under different natural and man made e g pumping scenarios for proper coastal aquifer management werner et al 2013 to this end numerical simulations are used as a common tool by hydrogeologists for investigating and managing coastal aquifers dispersive solute transport and interface models are the two approaches that track saltwater movement in seawater intrusion models bakker et al 2013 the use of these models is widespread when dealing with problems of pumping from a coastal aquifer models with sharp interface have abrupt behavior near a pumping well and thus may give skewed results park and hong 2006 park et al 2008 kopsiaftis et al 2017 however it should be taken into account that all numerical approaches have some uncertainty with their input parameters making them more complex rajabi et al 2015 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2014 and high computational time is required few studies investigated and developed multi objective models for dealing with seawater intrusion while pumping fw and using barrier wells of sgw with a purpose of minimizing the sgw pumping and maximizing the fw pumping dhar and datta 2009 sreekanth and datta 2011 also under parameter uncertainty sreekanth and datta 2014 2 d numerical model showed that pumping of brackish water from the interface can restrain seawater intrusion sherif and kacimov 2003 another study that used a numerical model showed that pumping saline water at a low rate of 5 mm3 year for the use of a small desalination plant can freshen the aquifer in the vicinity of the pumping well mogheir 2016 numerical modeling studies of seawater intrusion in qatar baalousha 2016 and oman kacimov et al 2009 have shown that pumping sgw may decrease and even reverse seawater intrusion however in these studies the results were site specific and limited to the information gathered from the field in addition these studies treated this issue as a sharp interface problem instead of a dispersive transition zone kacimov et al 2009 mehdizadeh et al 2015 kopsiaftis et al 2017 there are very few studies that have investigated the effect of pumping sgw below the fsi from coastal aquifers on the aquifer to the best of our knowledge the present study shows for the first time the fsi dynamics corresponding to high intensities of sgw pumping and the capacities of high quality feed water that can be pumped below the fsi without detrimental effects on the fresh water body the general aim of the current study was to investigate the fsi dynamics at different pumping rates and location of the sgw wells from the shore in a phreatic aquifer and furthermore to examine the potential of pumping sgw and freshwater further inland simultaneously using a numerical model we demonstrated the fsi response to sgw pumping in three dimensional 3d scenarios this research explains for the first time in high resolution the hydrological effects of sgw pumping for desalination plants and its consequences for restraint of seawater intrusion 2 methods 2 1 numerical model a 3d phreatic coastal aquifer model was first constructed to simulate the shape and location of the fsi in a steady state mode without pumping the model was then used to test the effects of pumping sgw below the fsi of the mediterranean coastal aquifer in israel the purpose of the model was to simulate the dynamics of the fsi under various pumping scenarios at different rates and distances from the shore the aquifer model code used in this study was the feflow code diersch 2014 which employs a finite element solution of the coupled variable density flow and solute transport equations the 3d model was constructed as 13 vertical layers with dimensions of 30 km in length 6 km in width and 250 m in depth fig 1 further information about the constructed model layers number and the mesh can be found in the supplementary information it is important to mention that the model was constructed with homogeneous and anisotropic hydraulic properties it is well known that salt water intrusion processes are sensitive to preferential flow paths and heterogeneity of the porous media however the model was simplified in order to prevent numerical errors and enable realistic computational time the boundary conditions applied to the model are as follows fig 1 the mediterranean seawater boundary west of the shore was represented by the equivalent fw head using the following equation 1 h f w h s w α h s w z where hfw represents the equivalent fw head hsw represents the saltwater head α represents the density ratio and z represents the elevation with respect to sea level the saltwater head was set to 0 because it is the mean sea level the density ratio α was defined by the following equation 2 α ρ m a x ρ 0 ρ 0 where ρmax is the seawater density 1 025 g cm3 and ρ0 is the fw density 1 g cm3 the salt concentration of the seawater at this boundary is 35 000 mg l of total dissolved solids tds the top boundary east of the coast has a fw recharge rate of 200 mm year representing rainfall replenishment 600 mm of annual rain and a recharge rate of 1 3 the eastern vertical boundary and the bottom boundary of the model were impervious the other initial parameters were set as described in table 1 and represent the coastal aquifer of israel yechieli et al 2010 despite the fact that the hydrological parameters are of the calcareous sandstone in israel this study represents the situation in many other coastal aquifers around the world which possesses similar hydraulic properties 2 2 sensitivity analysis a systematic series of simulations was applied to examine the fsi dynamics resulting from pumping sgw below it in these simulations one pumping well was introduced at a depth of 200 250 m and a distance of 30 m from the shore and in a different set of simulations the pumping well was placed at a distance of 100 m from the shore for each simulation eight scenarios were tested with pumping rates of 2 5 7 5 10 12 5 15 20 or 30 mm3 year in addition the same sets of scenarios were tested for pumping sgw and fw further inland simultaneously in order to study the phenomenon of abstraction these two water types therefore five new pumping wells were introduced to the model 3 km perpendicular from the shore each with perforation at a depth of 10 60 m fig 1 these wells pumped fw for 50 years without sgw pumping until a new steady state was reached with enhanced seawater intrusion the same set of simulations was then applied for the new steady state with a continuous pumping of fw at 5 mm3 year next we simulated scenarios with 50 less recharge at the top boundary 100 compared to 200 mm year at steady state in order to conceptualize an intensely pumped aquifer that yields a lower hydraulic gradient towards the sea in some coastal aquifers pumping from shallower depths is more realistic therefore two additional scenarios were tested with a shallower perforation area at a depth of 100 150 m which is 100 m shallower than the previous scenarios shown before one comprising only sgw pumping and the other comprising both sgw and fw pumping all simulations were conducted in a transient mode for 20 years table 2 summarizes the different simulations that were conducted in the framework of this study further descriptive sensitivity analysis was carried out where different hydraulic parameters namely hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity storativity and recharge were changed separately and compared to the generic model siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 in these simulations the model ran with pumping of 10 mm3 year and the results were compared see table 3 at the results section this sensitivity analysis allows to have a better comprehension about the parameters effecting the interface dynamics due to sgw pumping a volumetric box was set as a domain of interest doi below the land side of the aquifer fig 1 and had dimensions of 20 km in length 1 km in width and the depth of the aquifer below the land side 250 m the dissolved mass in the doi box was compared between the different scenarios for each scenario the salinity ratio ɸ was calculated as the mass of dissolved solids after 20 years of pumping mt divided by the initial mass m0 which quantitatively reflects the amount of seawater intrusion ɸ 1 or aquifer freshening ɸ 1 the single pumping well that was simulated in this study conceptualizes an area that is subjected to pumping which may include wellfield and not necessarily only one well see supplementary information 2 3 the field experimental settings a field scale pumping test was conducted at the nitzanim natural reserve located in the southern coastal plain of israel the aquifer investigated in the test is phreatic with a depth of 70 m and is composed of sand and calcareous sandstone to determine the fsi shape and location in the area salinity profiles were conducted for five deep wells situated linearly perpendicular to the shore in regular intervals over 900 m these wells were previously drilled to monitor the fsi fig 2 the salinity profiles in the wells were generated using a 100 m cable connected to an electrical conductivity ec and temperature sensing electrode wtw 1970i germany water was pumped from a well p well fig 2 located 70 m from the shore at a depth of 50 m 37 m below the water table an air lift pump atlas copco xas45 sweden was used to continuously extract 2 5 m3 h of sgw for 4 days which was monitored for ec frequently using an ec meter wtw ks multi 3xxi the pumping well is perforated through its entire length and the depth of the fsi in the well 50 salinity in ec was measured at a depth of 33 5 m 16 5 m below the water table the fsi was monitored in an observation well ob fig 2 located 13 m south of the pumping well at a depth of 27 m 16 m below the water table this observation well is perforated only in its lower 1 m allowing reliable monitoring of the change in the fsi without tide influence levanon et al 2013 to monitor the fsi at steady state ec and pressure data logger sensors solinst 3001 ltc junior were inserted into the well 6 days before pumping had started the data logger recorded the ec every 15 min throughout the pumping period and was taken out 1 h after pumping stopped overall the data logger was in the well for 10 days storing data 2 4 3d simulations of the field scale pumping test a feflow 3d model of the aquifer at the nitzanim natural reserve was built in order to simulate the field scale pumping test the transition zone position and width were calibrated in a 2d transient mode using a trial and error method until a reasonable match between the fsi location in the model and that measured in the field was obtained next the model was expanded into a 3d domain with dimensions of 7 km in length 60 m in width and 100 m in depth the pumping well was located 70 m from the shore in the middle of the domain and the observation well was placed accordingly the parameters that were used in the model after calibration are summarized in the results section the field results were obtained using an ec diver placed in the well ms cm units while the model results are given in ppm units to account for the different salinity units a relative salinity reduction was calculated in relation to the specific salinity point in space as the diver measured in the aquifer a 2 error is met in regard to the location in space of the exact salinity point due to the mesh density of the model 3 results and discussion two aspects of the simulations results were quantified 1 the salt balance of the aquifer after 20 years of sgw pumping and 2 the change in water salinity in the pumping well in response to sgw pumping 3 1 aquifer reaction to sgw pumping a series of simulations were conducted to examine the fsi response to different pumping rates of sgw below the fsi the results indicated that pumping sgw below the fsi changes the position and shape of the fsi causing it to descend and move toward the well fig 3 this phenomenon was observed by electrical conductivity profiles in the andarax delta in spain while a desalination plant is pumping for 7 months in a rate of 12 mm3 year jorreto et al 2009 the model shows that the shape of the fsi remains largely constant at relatively low pumping rates of 2 mm3 year whereas higher pumping rates of 5 mm3 year cause the dispersion zone of the fsi to become wider fig 3 b and c a somewhat similar phenomenon was reported in a previous study in which pumping fw above the fsi caused the dispersive zone to become wider mehdizadeh et al 2015 our model shows that as the sgw pumping rate increases fw replaces the former location of the saline water as the fsi location is lowered and moves toward the sea pumping sgw below the fsi creates a conic shape of the interface or a salinity cone of depression in the direction of the well fig 4 as the pumping rate increases the radius of the cone increases and vice versa a case study in gaza showed the same phenomena of a salinity cone of depression due to sgw pumping to a desalination plant using 2d map view and cross section view mogheir 2016 the salinity ratio ɸ in the doi is shown in fig 5 a in all scenarios and simulation sets examined a general trend of decreasing ɸ values can be seen as pumping rates increase therefore even a single well that pumps sgw at a normal rate of 2 mm3 year 200 m3 h can freshen the aquifer in its vicinity observation of aquifer freshening were also reported by javadi et al 2015 with sgw pumping and fw injection system in a 2 d model to further quantify the aquifer response and the fsi dynamics to sgw pumping the fsi toe location measured where the 50 salinity iso line meets the aquifer bottom was normalized to its initial location xt x0 1 and compared between the different scenarios the simulations showed that pumping of sgw shifts the fsi toe toward the well and that this effect becomes more prominent when pumping rates are increased fig 5b a significant change in the location of the fsi toe can be seen at higher pumping rates 20 30 mm3 year such that the toe location ratio value decreases below 0 8 and reaches 0 2 at a pumping rate of 30 mm3 year 100 m from the shore fig 5b these results imply that most of the dissolved salts and therefore most of the sgw that flows to the well originate from the sea side rather than the land side otherwise a greater reduction of the fsi toe location ratio and the disappearance of sgw below the land side would have been observed a research on the tordera aquifer in spain showed with an isotopic and geochemical approach that most of saline water that is being pumped for a desalination plant comes from the sea otero et al 2011 another finding of the model is that the distance of the pumping well from shore affects the amount of dissolved mass that is pumped out of the aquifer pumping wells that are located further inland 100 m from the shore exert greater effects on aquifer freshening possibly due to the closer initial distance between the well and the fsi toe moreover due to the natural shape of the fsi wedge sgw wells of similar depths but that are drilled further inland will be closer to the fsi zone and therefore easily draw more dissolved salts and replace this volume with less saline water the fw discharge to the sea darcy flux was compared between the different scenarios in one node directly above the pumping well perforation in order to further examine the aquifer response to sgw pumping this is an indicator of the submarine groundwater discharge sgd flux which generally appears to decrease with increasing pumping rates fig 5c the distance of the sgw pumping well from the shore does not significantly influence the sgd flux for example the natural darcy flux to the sea without pumping was 0 55 m d while after 20 years of pumping sgw at a rate of 30 mm3 year the darcy flux declined to 0 4 m d in most coastal aquifers sgd occurs naturally the sgd rate in coastal aquifers is estimated to be between 1 2 105 and 1 7 1011 m3 year depending on the basin scale burnett et al 2006 limiting the sgd rate is desirable to preserve the amount of fw available for use within the coastal aquifer in the israeli coastal aquifer south of the city of ashdod there is a series of wells termed coastal collectors bear et al 1999 which are located parallel to and at distance of 0 5 1 km from the shore and pump the shallow fw above the interface in order to restrain the water from being discharged to the sea nevertheless this method is not 100 efficient and water is still discharged to the ocean the method proposed here for pumping sgw harnesses the sgd water freshens the well and thereby allows for the use of this valuable water and the reduction of the osmotic pressure in the desalination process which in turn reduces the operational costs stein et al 2016 one potential way to manage the pumping more efficiently near the shoreline without affecting the salinity field more than necessary and without pumping fw together with the saline water is to pump sgw while simultaneously pumping fw further inland this method enables a continuous use of fw pumping wells and it provides a supplementary source of water through sgw desalination the scenarios in which pumping sgw and fw simultaneously is applied results in shifting the fsi towards the saline well fig 6 b and c in this case as in the previous scenario in which only sgw was pumped an increase in pumping rate results in more dissolved salt shown as salinity contours being drawn into the sgw pumping well the simulation results indicate a freshening of the aquifer similar to the set of simulations shown in fig 3 but this freshening is less pronounced due to fw withdrawal further inland for example the 50 salinity contours were closer to the well when fw was not pumped further inland fig s1 pumping only sgw had a greater freshening effect on the aquifer than pumping fw simultaneously freshening it up to ɸ 0 35 at a pumping rate of 30 mm3 year while with fw pumping a higher value of ɸ 0 47 was observed for the same pumping rate fig 5a indicating less freshening another expression of the aquifer freshening was found in the fsi toe location which in this case was lower than in the case of pumping only sgw fig 5b moreover the aquifer demonstrated lower sgd rates with fw pumping further inland as compared with pumping sgw alone fig 5c this combined pumping method has great potential as a tool for coastal aquifer management as pumping sgw for desalination prevents further seawater intrusion while fresh groundwater pumping still provides high quality water and prevents the wasting of fresh groundwater by limiting sgd in the scenarios of shallower perforation where pumping is initially closer to the fsi where the top part of the well touches the 75 salinity iso line the results were somewhat different than that of the previous scenarios in that the aquifer undergoes less freshening fig 7 b and c in these scenarios the fsi stabilizes at the depth of the perforation the pumping rate is a crucial factor that shifts the fsi location and in some cases the fsi stabilizes at the perforation depth at lower pumping rates from wells with deeper perforation the fsi does not reach the perforation depth at steady state however when the perforation is initially closer to the fsi lower pumping rates are required to reach steady state in which the fsi stabilizes at the perforation depth and therefore the salinity in the well is lower a similar trend has been observed in a laboratory experiment noorabadi et al 2017 however pumping in the aforementioned experiment was only from fw instead of sgw additionally when the perforation area was closer to the fsi lower pumping rates were needed to pump higher salinity water in the present study when fw pumping was applied together with sgw the fsi stabilized at a shallower depth than without fw pumping and the transition zone became wider fig 7c all of the above scenarios represent the flow domain of the aquifer assuming no intensive fw pumping had occurred however presently intensive fw pumping is applied throughout most parts of the israeli coastal aquifer and other coastal aquifers worldwide which substantially lowers the amount of fw flowing to the sea and lowers the hydraulic gradient when less fw is recharging the aquifer while sgw is being pumped the sgd is decreased fig 5c and the aquifer experiences less freshening the value of ɸ is higher than the above scenarios which means less freshening and there is no change in the fsi toe location as the pumping rate increases fig 5a and b blue diamonds this is due to the natural lower hydraulic gradient that usually pushes the fsi seawards and changes its location along with the sgw pumping previous studies suggested somewhat different approaches of pumping fresh and more brackish groundwater simultaneously to mitigate seawater intrusion one approach suggests the pumping of brackish and saline groundwater 300 10 000 mg cl l from underneath the fresh well to the desalination plant in order to maintain the well s freshness while other study used this concept in a complex aquifer combined with fw injection khadra et al 2017 although this concept is different from the one suggested in the current study it represents a similar idea of pumping the unwanted water for a different use and consequently reaching a desirable equilibrium in the aquifer which is sustainable over long durations our approach in contrast suggests pumping higher salinity water 18 000 21 000 mg cl l close to shore and fw further inland prevent the saline well to become fresher and extract sgw for ro desalination which is with higher quality compare to seawater 3 2 water salinity in the sgw pumping well as shown above pumping water from sgw wells pushes the fsi toward the well and a notable freshening of the well containing a mix of fresh and saline water is often observed at equilibrium this phenomenon has been noted in sand tanks shi et al 2011 and in pumping wells adjacent to a desalination plant otero et al 2011 to analyze the salinity of the groundwater pumped from the aquifer the salinity in the well was calculated for each scenario after 20 years of pumping according to the final salinity the fw content in the sgw well was calculated according to the following equation 3 f w c o n t e n t 1 s s s e a where s mg l is the salinity in the well after 20 years of pumping and ssea mg l is the sea salinity 35 000 mg l sgw pumping reduces the water salinity of the pumping well when the pumping rate is relatively high 2 mm3 year increasing the pumping rate decreases the pumping well salinity fig 8 a this result coincides with the reduction in the dissolved mass ɸ ratio in the aquifer fig 5a which decreases the salinity of the aquifer when the pumping well is located further inland the ultimate salinity at steady state is lower due to the proximity of the well to the fsi toe as the pumping rate increases the fw component in the well increases as well fig 8b reaching up to 30 of fw content at a distance of 100 m from the shoreline at a pumping rate of 30 mm3 year fig 8b shows the fw pumping rate dashed lines in the sgw pumping well as two end members as an absolute value according to the following equation 4 q f q t f w c o n t e n t where qf m3 d is the fw fraction pumping rate and qt m3 d is the total pumping rate the fw component results coincide with those shown in fig 5c where the sgd decreases as the fw pumping rate to the saline pumping well increases which implies the shifting of fw velocity vectors toward the well the water velocity vectors in the vicinity of the pumping well are changing as a factor of the distance from the well and its salinity as fw tends to flow ultimately to the sea and be relatively slow in comparison to the saline water fig 9 for example the water velocity vector in one node 20 m from the pumping well with salinity of 33 300 mg l is 1 2 m d while the water velocity in a different node at the same distance from the well at salinity of 7 000 mg l is 0 35 m d this along with the fact that the well remains mostly saline leads to the conclusion that most of the water that flows to the well originated from the sea no significant water level drawdown was noticed in any of the tested scenarios even when the perforation zone was high the drawdown of the water table above the deep perforation at a depth of 200 250 m at a pumping rate of 10 mm3 year was 5 cm while the drawdown in the case of a shallower perforation 100 150 m at the same pumping rate was 14 cm when a 30 mm3 year pumping rate was used the drawdown of the deeper perforated well remained 5 cm while that of the shallower perforated well increased to 50 cm the rate of fw recharge is 200 mm year which when considering the model s dimensions results in 24 mm3 year of fw recharge in the entire model in the extreme case of pumping 30 mm3 year of sgw the rate of fw pumping in the sgw well is 9 mm3 year fig 8b however when pumping both sgw and fw at 30 and 5 mm3 year respectively the total fw pumping is 12 mm3 year 7 mm3 year at the sgw well although this value 12 mm3 year is 50 of the recharge rate 24 mm3 year no substantial drawdown was observed these phenomena of lower salinity in the well have significant implications for operating desalination plants a lower salinity of the feed water compared to seawater enables higher recoveries in the reverse osmosis process due to the reduced osmotic pressure and may thus reduce the operational costs stein et al 2016 furthermore to obtain the same yield of desalinated water less energy is used to desalinate sgw in comparison to seawater as a result of the lower pressure required and therefore less greenhouse gasses are emitted an economic and environmental assessment that took place in australia showed that it is more cost efficient to desalinate sgw than open source seawater mostly due to a reduced pretreatment demand and that greenhouse gas emissions are lower when desalinating sgw than seawater shahabi et al 2015 the impact of the freshening of the sgw wells with time leading to reduced operational costs was not mentioned in the aforementioned assessment which may further enhance the economic and environmental benefits of desalination of sgw it is interesting to note that despite the high pumping rate 60 mm3 year km employed by the desalination plant in oman no impact on the aquifer was reported david et al 2009 a possible explanation is that the local aquifer is comprised of carbonate rocks with large karst features of very high transmissivity the model in the current study in contrast represents a sandstone aquifer such as the coastal aquifer of israel which may explain this discrepancy on the other hand the desalination plant in blanes spain pumps 14 mm3 year km for its feed water from 10 beach wells the wells are located on a sedimentary material of the tordera delta which mainly comprises sand sandstone and gravel with some variations of silt and clay layers otero et al 2011 reported that after three years of pumping a freshening of the aquifer had occurred and was observed in three wells whose ec values dropped from 50 to 42 ms cm our results are in line with these findings as the wells in blanes were freshened by 16 while the same pumping rate caused a freshening of the well of 11 in our simulations 3 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to study and compare the weight of each parameter on the fsi dynamics corresponding to sgw pumping table 3 summarizes these results the compared parameters were the pumping well salinity ɸ ratio relative sgd flux and the normalized fsi toe location the sgd flux and the toe location are presented here as relative numbers due to the fact that the initial value was not equal in all steady state scenarios with the change in one parameter the results show that the model is mostly sensitive to the hydrological conductivity and the recharge rate similar results were found in recent studies in china zeng et al 2018 and in italy filippis et al 2016 this sensitivity analysis can be of use for predicting the effect of sgw pumping on the fsi dynamics in different aquifers in the world with similar hydraulic parameters 3 4 field scale pumping test to experimentally test some of the numerical results described above a preliminary field scale pumping test was conducted in the nitzanim natural reserve in israel a cross section of the fsi in the nitzanim natural reserve constructed through salinity profiles is shown in fig 10 in addition a full scale 3d model was constructed for this area and was calibrated by using the trial and error method matching the field salinity data of the fsi location to its location in the model red line in fig 10 the parameters that were used in the model after calibration are summarized in table 4 the conditions used in the model correlated with the conditions measured in the field experiment a decrease in groundwater salinity was observed as pumping started followed by a constant linear decrease in salinity until the pumping stopped fig 11 the initial value of the measured ec was 0 815 ms cm while the final ec value was 0 74 ms cm reflecting a 10 reduction in salinity by the end of the pumping test the field measurement showed a relative salinity reduction to 0 9 from the initial value similar to the result at the end of the model run where the relative salinity reduction was 0 92 of the initial salinity despite the low initial salinity in the well 0 815 ms cm this freshening trend of up to 90 from the initial salinity implies a displacement of the fsi downward and toward the sea the salinity in the pumping well was 49 5 0 2 ms cm and was unchanged throughout the four days of pumping probably due to the low pumping rate 2 5 m3 h the results of the field scale experiment show similar trend of freshening surrounding the pumping well at the nitzanin model and at the general model results implying that the model results in this work are valid 4 summary and conclusions a series of 3d phreatic aquifer model simulations were conducted by using the feflow code in order to estimate the fsi dynamics in response to sgw pumping beneath it the results of these simulations clearly indicate that pumping sgw beneath the fsi pushes the fsi toward the sea and freshens both the aquifer and the pumping well in addition as the pumping rate increases the freshening effect is intensified and the fw content in the well increases the distance of the well from the shore is an important factor determining the extent of the freshening effect as pumping closer to the shore attenuates the freshening effect and the salinity in the well remains more stable a different approach is pumping simultaneously fw further inland to stabilize the fsi between the wells and keep the sgw well saline and the fw well fresh in such cases both the aquifer and the pumping well undergo less freshening it is important to mention that the model was simplified and that in reality the fsi may behave somewhat differently due to heterogeneity and anisotropy of the specific aquifer hydraulic parameters the amount of sgw that can be pumped for desalination is subjected to regional municipal and governmental laws and perspectives about coastal aquifer management furthermore the amount of sgw that can be pumped depends on the hydrogeological formation and the initial situation of the aquifer whereas in aquifers where seawater intrusion stretches deep inland higher amounts of sgw can be pumped with little change of the well salinity in addition the sensitivity analysis shows that aquifer with lower hydraulic conductivity and higher recharge are prone to have higher changes in the salinity field which is expressed by intensive aquifer freshening this approach can provide an alternative source of feed water for desalination while simultaneously pumping fw for domestic or agricultural use without enhancing sea water intrusion moreover it can help to cope with seawater intrusion issues in overexploited aquifers by reversing this process thereby we can use the two water types in the aquifer as individual resources without a detrimental environmental effect this method is highly important in regions with extensive seawater intrusion where many pumping wells were salinized acknowledgments we would like first to thank and honor mr haim hemo from the geological

18893,because of its energy efficiency the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process has been recognized as the most promising biological nitrogen removal process but its implementation in mainstream wastewater treatment plants is limited by its relatively high optimal temperature 30 c recently it was shown that during short term batch experiments reduced graphene oxide rgo displayed accelerated reaction activity at low temperatures 10 15 c in this study the long term effects of rgo on the low temperature anammox process in a sequencing batch reactor sbr are studied for the first time including different methods of interaction the results presented here show that rgo can stimulate anammox activity up to 17 through two factors bacterial growth stimulation which was especially significant at higher temperatures 15 c and an increase of the anammox reaction rate which occurred only below 15 c the bacterial community structure was not influenced by addition of rgo moreover after incubation in an anammox bioreactor rgo showed signs of degradation and chemical changes as evidenced by the presence of oxygen and calcium on its surface according to the literature and the obtained results it is proposed that rgo is oxidized and oxygen is reduced by the organic mediator that is involved in the enzymatic reactions however activated sludge is a very complex structure created by numerous undefined microorganisms which makes it difficult to determine the exact oxidation mechanism graphical abstract image 10750 keywords anammox reduced graphene oxide 16s rrna amplicon sequencing tem eels raman spectroscopy 1 introduction the anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation process is often recognized as the most promising biological nitrogen removal process because it is both energy efficient and cost effective garrido et al 2013 during the anammox process ammonia nitrogen is anaerobically oxidized to molecular nitrogen by nitrites which act as electron acceptors by a unique bacterial phylum planctomycetes there are currently more than two hundred full scale applications of anammox based technologies lackner et al 2014 ali and okabe 2015 cao et al 2017 generally most of the systems reported to date are used to treat streams with high nitrogen loads such as landfill leachate reject water industrial wastewaters from glutamate and amino acids industries or slaughterhouses ali and okabe 2015 generally at temperatures exceeding 25 c lotti et al 2015 widespread use of this technology and its application in mainstream municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp characterized by lower nitrogen loads and lower temperatures could help achieve energy neutral positive wastewater treatment siegrist et al 2008 lotti et al 2015 cao et al 2017 however the application of the anammox process in mainstream wwtps faces the challenges of needing a drastic decrease in the anammox bacteria growth rate and activity at temperatures below 15 c and additionally of seasonal temperature variations of municipal wastewater therefore the intensification of the anammox activity has been the focus of recent investigations cao et al 2017 in addition numerous studies have reported methods to improve its efficiency for example by using manganese oxide qiao et al 2012 ultrasound irradiation yu et al 2013 quinoid redox mediators qiao et al 2014 or divalent ferrous ions liu et al 2015 several recent studies have also demonstrated that graphene nanomaterials such as graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are also able to enhance the efficiency of the anammox process wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 2016 qiao et al 2016 graphene is an atom thick sheet consisting of carbon atoms arranged in a closely packed honeycomb lattice its derivate go contains functional groups such as carboxyls hydroxyls and epoxides while its rgo counterpart mainly possesses carboxyl groups at the periphery dreyer et al 2010 it was reported that addition of 100 mg l go at 35 c increased the total nitrogen removal rate by 10 wang et al 2013 and 17 yin et al 2015 and shortened the anammox process start up from 67 to 49 days yin et al 2016 the same concentration of rgo was also shown to increase anammox activity by 21 in a long term experiment conducted at 35 c qiao et al 2016 despite these promising results most of these studies wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 2016 qiao et al 2016 were conducted at high temperatures in order to achieve an optimum rate while in mainstream wwtps the anammox process is desired to work at lower temperatures the short term effects of rgo on the anammox process at lower temperatures 10 30 c were investigated in a previous study tomaszewski et al 2019 which revealed that stimulation effects tend to be stronger at lower temperatures 20 c and that activity could be enhanced by up to 28 at 13 c when 15 mg l of rgo is added the optimal dose for the anammox stimulation was evaluated between 20 and 45 mg rgo g vss tomaszewski et al 2019 to summarize all mentioned studies wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 2016 qiao et al 2016 were performed with high temperatures close to the optimum one 35 c in a previous study tomaszewski et al 2019 short term effects of rgo on the anammox process at lower temperatures 10 30 c were investigated for the first time and the present study was designed to determine the long term effects of rgo on the low temperature anammox process in a lab scale technological system presenting a more thorough investigation of interaction mechanisms some previous studies have attempted to identify the mechanism by which go and rgo can enhance bacterial activity and growth it has been reported that nanomaterials can influence the catalytic properties of biomolecules which affects their conformational states pavlidis et al 2014 yin et al 2015 2016 demonstrated that an increase in anammox activity was associated with an enhancement in key anammox enzymes namely hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh nitrite reductase nir and nitrate reductase nar moreover nanomaterials in the graphene family have also been shown to act as attachment surfaces which can induce cell growth aggregation and secretion of extracellular polymeric substances ruiz et al 2011 wang et al 2013 observed that anammox bacteria could attach to rgo sheets yet despite this body of work there are still many gaps in knowledge about other interactions that occur between anammox biomass and graphene family nanomaterials for example it is still unknown what happens to a nanomaterial after incubation in a bioreactor or how the nanomaterial affects the microbial composition of a very complex community of anammox biomass that is rich in uncultured species thus it is especially important to take into account the antimicrobial properties of graphene and its derivatives rani et al 2017 considering this information the main objective of this study was to investigate the long term effects of rgo on the low temperature anammox process including different aspects of interaction rgo was shown to influence nitrogen removal during synthetic wastewater treatment bacterial community structure composition as well as bacterial impact on the structure of the nanomaterial 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequence batch reactors characteristics the anammox suspended biomass was

taxonomic differences between metagenomes were analyzed using statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp v 2 1 3 parks and beiko 2010 significant differences between metagenomes were

from the bioreactor at day 150 109 days after incubation were analyzed by transmission electron microscope using a s tem titan 80 300 fei company fitted with an electron energy loss spectrometer eels after incubation free suspended particles of rgo were taken from the reactor medium using a pipette the samples used for electron microscopy investigations were prepared by dispersing the rgo before

3200 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 biotransformation of reduced graphene oxide after 109 days of incubation in the anammox reactor rgo showed signs of degradation and significant changes were observed in the tem images and in the eels spectrum presented in fig 2 as illustrated in the tem image fig 2b the edges of the sheets after cultivation with bacteria were irregular and ragged in contrast to the material before the experiment fig 2a a similar observation was made by liu et al 2015 using naphthalene degrading pseudomonas bacteria which were able to degrade graphite go and rgo to explain the degradation of rgo sheets eels and raman spectroscopy were applied to study the chemical changes of the nanomaterial the eels spectra of rgo before the experiment fig 2c contain two peaks near 285 ev and 293 ev which are characteristic of graphene layers li et al 2014 majumder et al 2018 the broad peak centered at 328 ev can be attributed to the interlayer bridges which link the rgo layers majumder et al 2018 the eels spectra after 109 days fig 2d does not contain this peak suggesting that a reduction in the number of layers has occurred leyva porras et al 2014 bacterial induced exfoliation of graphite sheets has been observed in past literature reports using acidithiobacillus ferroxidans zhu et al 2014 and naphthalene degrading pseudomonas bacteria liu et al 2015 moreover the peaks located near 535 ev and 350 ev fig 2d are respectively assigned to the presence of oxygen and calcium atoms the disordering structure of rgo was confirmed by examining the raman spectra fig 3 which contain four characteristic bands for disordered graphene based materials g a characteristic feature of the graphitic layers corresponding to in plane stretching of the c c bond d related to the disordered carbon or defective graphitic structures 2d sensitive to the π bond in the structure d g associated with a high degree of disorder radoń et al 2018 also the ratio of intensity of the d and g peaks id ig can be used to measure the defects present on the structure of the carbon nanomaterials the ratio of id ig after incubation in the reactor increases from 0 97 to 1 02 which indicates an increase in the disorder of the material additionally the increased intensity of the spectra and 2d bands shift to higher wavenumber in the raman analysis of the rgo after experiments confirming that oxidation had occurred iqbal et al 2012 hu et al 2014 radoń et al 2018 the presence of oxygen and the oxidation of rgo by bacteria is a previously reported phenomenon zhu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 guo et al 2017 rgo possesses oxygen functional groups which are typically located at the edges of the graphene sheets including epoxy groups that are located at the basal plane of the graphene sheets creating in plane defects and disorder dreyer et al 2010 because of the presence of these functional groups the defects and edges of the surface possess a higher reactivity and are susceptible to oxidation contact between the surface of graphene based materials and bacteria allows electron transfer but rgo is likely oxidized by the mediators because liu et al 2015 demonstrated that oxygen does not participate in bacteria rgo interactions on the other hand the ability of rgo to participate in enzymatic reactions has been reported including anammox enzymes yin et al 2015 2016 chen et al 2017 thus according to the literature zhu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 guo et al 2017 it can be suspected that rgo is oxidized and oxygen is reduced by the organic mediator involved in the enzymatic reactions performed by bacteria the rgo oxidation breaks the bonds of the carbon structure which results in the disintegration and exfoliation of the rgo sheets zhu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 however activated sludge is a very complex microbial community rich in undefined species thus their biochemical potential is not fully recognized yet which is regarded to be an obstacle in understanding the precise oxidation mechanisms in contrast to oxygen the effect of the presence of calcium on graphitic materials after incubation with bacteria has never been reported it has been recognized that divalent calcium cations promote adsorption between bacteria cells peeters et al 2011 whose surfaces are typically negatively charged rgo sheets are negatively charged as well because of the numerous oxygen containing groups dreyer et al 2010 while the electrostatic forces promote adsorption between particulate matter and bacteria hassard et al 2016 it can be suspected that divalent calcium cations can also act as cell rgo coupler bacterial induced degradation and transformation of carbon nanomaterials has been described in several reports that have primarily used monocultures lowry et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 guo et al 2017 herein the biodegradation of rgo exposed to an activated sludge mixed culture during synthetic wastewater treatment was demonstrated for the first time unfortunately direct measurement of rgo concentration in the reactor and effluent was impossible because there is a lack of techniques for graphene nanomaterials detection in complex environmental media and biological systems goodwin et al 2018 nonetheless since a greater concentration of graphene based nanomaterials is expected to be needed in the wastewater treatment plants suárez iglesias et al 2017 this observation is very promising and requires further investigation regarding the biodegradation of these materials in this environment 3 2 nitrogen removal performance the course of the experiment fig 1 can be divided into seven phases i 1 41 d stable operation without rgo addition ii 42 120 d first rgo addition 15 mg l to r reactor and adaptation to the low temperature iii 121 182 d operation at 13 c iv 183 220 d temperature decrease to 10 c v 221 230 d process deterioration in r reactor vi 231 245 d second rgo addition 15 mg l to r reactor and process recovery vii 246 316 d stable operation at 13 c the overall performance of the reactors is presented in fig 4 and table 1 after the first 41 days of stable operation in phase i 15 mg rgo l was added to the r reactor while the k reactor was operated as a control without addition of rgo during phase ii the temperature was gradually decreased from 30 c to 15 c the average nitrogen removal rate nrr remained stable and similar in both reactors at 0 139 0 025 kg n m3d standard deviation sd and 0 143 0 028 kg n m3d in the k and r reactor respectively however the specific anammox activity saa exhibited 23 lower activity of the anammox biomass in the r reactor table 1 indicating that rgo has a negative effect on the activity of the anammox bacteria inhibition of bacterial activity by rgo was previously reported in several studies wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 tomaszewski et al 2019 and the inhibitory dose in short term studies was evaluated above ca 45 mg g vss tomaszewski et al 2019 herein in a long term study the inhibitory dose was ca 18 mg g vss a common belief is that physical interactions and oxidative stresses are assumed to be responsible for the rgo toxicity against bacteria guo et al 2017 and a three step mechanism is proposed initial cell deposition on nanomaterials physical membrane stress caused by sharp nanosheets and the ensuing superoxide anion independent oxidation liu et al 2011 on the other hand similar nrrs during phase ii were caused by the higher biomass concentration in the r reactor table 1 despite both reactors being inoculated with a similar amount of activated sludge the concentrations were comparable during phase i differences between vss in the reactors during phase ii is statistically insignificant p 0 32 thus observed enhancement of growth could be burdened with vss measurement experimental error but in the longer run vss differences became statistically significant p 0 02 in phase iii confirming described observation this indicates that the rgo significantly enhances the growth rate of the anammox bacteria several studies have shown that graphene based nanomaterials can act as attachment surfaces inducing cell growth aggregation and secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps ruiz et al 2011 yin et al 2016 in activated sludge eps production is known to act as a bacterial protective agent against the influence of harmful compounds in wwtps wang et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 thus in this case such an explanation of effective bacterial performance despite the influence of a known bactericidal material seems reasonable herein it was shown that divalent cations like calcium could also act as cell rgo coupler section 3 1 enhancing the growth of anammox bacteria considering biodegradation of rgo with its inhibitory potential similar observations were made by guo et al 2019 with the zero valent iron after initial inhibition anammox bacteria adapted to the high zero valent iron concentration and was able to gradually consumed it during the experiment another and the simplest example regarding the anammox process is a well known substrate inhibition by free ammonia and nitrite then phase iii started and the temperature was decreased to 13 c and during the 61 days of this period the nrr of the reactors began to decrease but the r reactor exhibited a 15 higher average nrr compared with the k reactor p 0 05 table 1 similarly the saa demonstrated that the higher nrr was due to a higher biomass concentration that was present in phases ii and iii no signs of direct rgo influence during phase iii could produce these results for two reasons firstly the growth rate of anammox bacteria decreased when the temperature declined from 30 to 13 c making rgo induced cell growth a less significant factor secondly while rgo has weak sedimentation properties suárez iglesias et al 2017 it could be partially rinsed out of the reactor and or degraded as explained in section 3 1 however the experiment was continued and the temperature decreased to 10 c in phase iv to maintain a stable anammox process the nlr nitrogen loading rate was decreased to 0 145 0 012 kg n m3d during this period the nrr remained similar in both reactors at 0 053 0 010 kg n m3d and 0 058 0 010 kg n m3d in c and r reactor respectively after 30 days of operation at 10 c phase v started ammonium and nitrite began to accumulate in the r reactor and the nrr was gone on day 225 over the same amount of time efficiency of the k reactor was higher but still decreasing because 10 c was reported as extremely unfavorable conditions for the anammox bacteria tomaszewski et al 2017a b considering inhibitory potential of the rgo it can be suspected that the r reactor showed a higher sensitivity to such unfavorable conditions on the other hand if rgo can stimulate anammox activity it could also stimulate other types of bacteria the increase in the ratio of amounts of n no3 produced n nh4 removed fig 3 in phase v indicates the enhanced activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria which could dominate anammox bacteria in the competition for substrates nitrite and inorganic carbon source to restore the efficiency of the anammox process in the r reactor the temperature was immediately increased to 15 c process performance was recovered and a second dose of rgo was added to the r reactor 15 mg l on day 231 this decision was motivated by the awareness that rgo could be partially rinsed out of the reactor during 230 days of experiment or and degraded losing its properties during phase vi the nrr reached a level of 0 071 0 010 kg n m3d and 0 068 0 019 kg n m3d in c and r reactor respectively after 10 days temperature was decreased again to 13 c and phase vii started during the 70 days of this period the r reactor exhibited a 17 higher nrr p 0 05 table 1 compared to the k reactor these values are in range of the results obtained in phase iii when the nrr was 15 higher this time however the stimulation was also accompanied by a 16 higher saa p 0 05 table 1 which clearly shows that rgo can stimulate the anammox reaction rate this is consistent with the short term studies where similar stimulation was observed only below 20 c with a maximum of 28 activity stimulation at 13 c and 15 mg rgo l addition tomaszewski et al 2019 similar to the current study an activity stimulation of 10 and 17 was observed in short term experiments performed at 35 c by wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 qiao et al 2016 and yin et al 2016 found that addition of rgo led to a 21 and 27 increase of the nrr during their respective long term studies based on the rgo biotransformation analysis section 3 1 the applied stimulation may be strongly associated with the excellent electron transferability of rgo and its performance as a redox mediator yin et al 2015 2016 a comparison between the performance of the k reactor with the r reactor results showed that statistically significant stimulation occurred only in phase iii and phase vii when the temperature was 13 c this is especially evident during the shift from 15 c to 13 c between phases ii iii and vi vii this observation possibly results from the reaction steps of the anammox process which could include two rate determining enzymes with various temperature optima isaka et al 2008 some previous studies have reported a change in the kinetics of the anammox reaction near 15 c which results in a higher activation energy below this point lotti et al 2015 tomaszewski et al 2017b herein the same temperature 15 c was also revealed to be a turning point for the metabolism of the anammox bacteria according to previous reports the optimal stoichiometry of the anammox process n no2 removed n nh4 removed and n no3 produced n nh4 removed ratios should respectively be about 1 32 and 0 26 strous et al 1998 fig 5 presents the ratios measured during the experiment which shows that there are no significant differences between the k and r reactors in both cases a decrease in the temperature below 15 c resulted in an increase in the n no2 n nh4 ratio during phases iii and iv and an increase in the n no3 n nh4 ratio during phase iv this correlates with the decrease of the anammox activity fig 4 and results from the increasing activity of nitrification which is also reflected in the bacterial community structure composition where the relative abundance of nitrospira increased in the same time section 3 3 simultaneous growth of the n no2 n nh4 and n no3 n nh4 ratios indicates an increase in the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob small amounts of oxygen could enter into reactor during influent but it was used quickly and its observed concentration was still below 0 1 mg l several researches reported that anammox bacteria can be protected by aob which consume oxygen and produce nitrite pynaert et al 2003 liu et al 2012 ziembińska buczyńska et al 2019 the stable n no3 n nh4 ratio during phase iii was probably caused by endogenous denitrification which arose from products of cell death and lysis after the temperature decreased the enhanced rate of nitrite oxidation under a low nlr was expected because temperatures below 25 c promote the growth of nob van dongen et al 2001 however during last phase the nitrogen conversion ratios returned to their values before phase iii indicating successful restoration of a stable anammox process the results presented here show that different stimulating factors act in tandem with one another growth stimulation is especially significant at higher temperatures 15 c when the bacteria growth rate is not strongly affected by temperature the enhancement in the anammox reaction rate appears to occur only below 15 c in line with the short term research previously reported tomaszewski et al 2019 however the exact nature of the stimulation mechanism is still unclear and further investigation is still required to fully understand it considering practical approach of this study high production cost is definitely a disadvantage of graphene materials but they are relatively new materials with a lot of potential applications its price has been decreasing in last year s perreault et al 2015 the development of nanotechnology is enforced by a lot of fields such as medicine electronics physics and chemistry so it is reasonable to predict that graphene materials production will be improved and will become much cheaper and cheaper in the coming years 3 3 bacterial community structure graphene rgo and go each possess well documented antimicrobial properties goncalves et al 2016 guo et al 2017 most of the antimicrobial studies of nanoparticles are performed on pure cultures of bacteria including both planktonic and biofilms ahmend and rodrigues 2013 guo et al 2017 it was demonstrated that bacteria living in biofilms are more resistant towards negative rgo influence than free living bacteria olson et al 2002 guo et al 2017 which is likely due to the protective properties of extrapolimeric substances however the resistance of the biofilm bacteria depends on the concentration of the antimicrobial substance and the length of the exposure thus in this case it could be suspected that activated sludge flocs that are exposed to rgo produced a large amount of eps which decreased the bactericidal influence of this compound on the bacterial community in this study the structure of the bacterial community of activated sludge responsible for performing the nitrogen removal process was monitored in lab scale bioreactors also investigated was the microbial structure of the inoculating sludge for both experimental sbrs as it can be seen in figs 6 8 the inoculum in of the control k and the experimental r reactors differ in the composition of their respective bacterial communities the seeding sludge in derived from the communal wastewater from a full scale reactor could not be made entirely homogeneous despite constant mixing in a bioreactor the bacterial community of the lab scale bioreactor was composed of bacteria derived from the inoculum and also from the non sterile medium or the bioreactor surroundings these factors discounting the effect of the bioreactor volume and its technological performance are responsible for the community structure thus even though both the experimental and control bioreactors were inoculated with the same activated sludge and operated simultaneously the operation period until the first rgo addition was crucial for a new community to develop which was derived from the bacteria present in the inoculating sludge although the full scale bioreactors are regarded to be well mixed it is no possible to achieve a well mixed state in such a large volume the obtained results suggest the possibility that the sludge used for inoculation was not homogeneous and the community that developed from the seeding sludge differ in samples k 1 and r 1 the most abundant phyla of bacteria present in all samples in different proportions were planctomycetes nitrospirae and firmicutes and their numbers fluctuated during the experiment figs 6 and 7 in comparison to inoculum 18 03 the number of planctomycetes decreased in the experimental reactor 16 03 but increased in the control reactor 20 1 during the experiment the percentage of this bacterial group increased in both reactors from 16 03 to 17 8 and from 20 1 to 21 25 for the experimental and control bioreactors respectively in contrast to the conventional nitrification denitrification wastewater system where proteobacteria are the most abundant phylum cao et al 2017 in the case of anammox bioreactors firmicutes are much more prominent in all samples but their numbers decrease from 19 9 in inoculum to 14 84 in the control and increased to 21 15 in the experimental reactor before rgo addition these results lead to the suspicion that the rgo dosage negatively influenced this phylum because in both cases the number of these bacteria decreased at the end of the experiment to 13 4 and 11 in the control and experimental bioreactors respectively since 2015 when daims et al demonstrated that nitrospira sp was a bacteria that was able to perform both nitrification stages several researchers have worked with anammox bioreactors and have reported that this phylum is relatively abundant in anaerobic ammonia oxidizing systems ciesielski et al 2018 pinto et al 2015 ziembińska buczyńska et al 2019 it is suspected that not only does nitrospira not compete with the anammox bacteria but it instead supports anammox performance by providing extra nitrite ciesielski et al 2018 in both bioreactors in this experiment this phylum was represented in high numbers at the end of the experiments 23 4 and 25 3 control and experiment respectively in comparison to 16 8 of inoculum the same trend is visible at the class level fig 8 which shows the domination of plactomycetacia and nitrospira class bacilli phylum firmicutes was highly represented in the inoculum but their numbers decreased in both reactors during the experiment from 14 05 in inoculum to 5 58 and 3 78 in the control and experimental bioreactors at the end of the experiments respectively interestingly at the genus level there is no evidence of anammox bacteria identified such as candidatus brocadia jettenia or scalindua table 2 instead the most abundant group of sequences is represented by the unclassified planctomycetes 17 1 in inoculum 15 09 17 4 for the experimental and 18 35 20 8 for the control reactor the second most abundant group of sequences belongs to nitrospira 16 8 in inoculum 13 9 25 3 for the experimental and 14 36 23 4 for the control bioreactor obtained results support the notion that nitrospira can help the anammox bacteria in the nitrogen removal performance in anaerobic systems it could also be suspected that there are still many bacteria not identified at the genus level from the anammox group that is performing this process in the technological systems with high efficacy even though rgo is regarded as an antimicrobial agent rani et al 2017 in the case of the activated sludge community its negative influence is visible only in the case of the phylum firmicutes these results agree with previous research in which firmicutes were described as more sensitive towards the influence of antimicrobial nanoparticles than e coli when tested in pure cultures stoyanova et al 2017 these results highlight that the bacteria living in the communities seem to be more resistant towards the effects of antimicrobial agents such as rgo and further research is required for a better understanding of their resistance mechanisms 4 conclusions the long term effects of rgo on the low temperature anammox process including different aspects of interaction were studied the nitrogen removal performance showed that rgo can stimulate anammox activity by up to 17 with different stimulating factors firstly growth stimulation was especially significant at higher temperatures 15 c where the bacteria growth rate was not strongly affected by temperature secondly the increase in the anammox reaction rate occurred only below 15 c even though rgo is regarded as an antimicrobial agent for the anammox activated sludge community its negative influence is not visible in the bacterial community structure these results underscore that bacteria living in these communities seem to have a higher resistance towards antimicrobial agents such as rgo possibly due to the high eps production moreover after incubation in the anammox bioreactor rgo showed signs of degradation and chemical changes and the presence of oxygen and calcium was detected on its surface herein according to the literature and obtained results it was proposed that rgo is oxidized and oxygen is reduced by the organic mediator involved in the enzymatic reactions however the exact nature of the stimulation mechanism remains unclear and its elucidation requires further investigation in contrast to the monocultures microorganisms in the activated sludge created a very complex community rich in undefined species whose role in rgo oxidation is still unknown acknowledgements the study was financed by the national science centre poland umo 2017 25 n nz9 01159

18893,because of its energy efficiency the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process has been recognized as the most promising biological nitrogen removal process but its implementation in mainstream wastewater treatment plants is limited by its relatively high optimal temperature 30 c recently it was shown that during short term batch experiments reduced graphene oxide rgo displayed accelerated reaction activity at low temperatures 10 15 c in this study the long term effects of rgo on the low temperature anammox process in a sequencing batch reactor sbr are studied for the first time including different methods of interaction the results presented here show that rgo can stimulate anammox activity up to 17 through two factors bacterial growth stimulation which was especially significant at higher temperatures 15 c and an increase of the anammox reaction rate which occurred only below 15 c the bacterial community structure was not influenced by addition of rgo moreover after incubation in an anammox bioreactor rgo showed signs of degradation and chemical changes as evidenced by the presence of oxygen and calcium on its surface according to the literature and the obtained results it is proposed that rgo is oxidized and oxygen is reduced by the organic mediator that is involved in the enzymatic reactions however activated sludge is a very complex structure created by numerous undefined microorganisms which makes it difficult to determine the exact oxidation mechanism graphical abstract image 10750 keywords anammox reduced graphene oxide 16s rrna amplicon sequencing tem eels raman spectroscopy 1 introduction the anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation process is often recognized as the most promising biological nitrogen removal process because it is both energy efficient and cost effective garrido et al 2013 during the anammox process ammonia nitrogen is anaerobically oxidized to molecular nitrogen by nitrites which act as electron acceptors by a unique bacterial phylum planctomycetes there are currently more than two hundred full scale applications of anammox based technologies lackner et al 2014 ali and okabe 2015 cao et al 2017 generally most of the systems reported to date are used to treat streams with high nitrogen loads such as landfill leachate reject water industrial wastewaters from glutamate and amino acids industries or slaughterhouses ali and okabe 2015 generally at temperatures exceeding 25 c lotti et al 2015 widespread use of this technology and its application in mainstream municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp characterized by lower nitrogen loads and lower temperatures could help achieve energy neutral positive wastewater treatment siegrist et al 2008 lotti et al 2015 cao et al 2017 however the application of the anammox process in mainstream wwtps faces the challenges of needing a drastic decrease in the anammox bacteria growth rate and activity at temperatures below 15 c and additionally of seasonal temperature variations of municipal wastewater therefore the intensification of the anammox activity has been the focus of recent investigations cao et al 2017 in addition numerous studies have reported methods to improve its efficiency for example by using manganese oxide qiao et al 2012 ultrasound irradiation yu et al 2013 quinoid redox mediators qiao et al 2014 or divalent ferrous ions liu et al 2015 several recent studies have also demonstrated that graphene nanomaterials such as graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are also able to enhance the efficiency of the anammox process wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 2016 qiao et al 2016 graphene is an atom thick sheet consisting of carbon atoms arranged in a closely packed honeycomb lattice its derivate go contains functional groups such as carboxyls hydroxyls and epoxides while its rgo counterpart mainly possesses carboxyl groups at the periphery dreyer et al 2010 it was reported that addition of 100 mg l go at 35 c increased the total nitrogen removal rate by 10 wang et al 2013 and 17 yin et al 2015 and shortened the anammox process start up from 67 to 49 days yin et al 2016 the same concentration of rgo was also shown to increase anammox activity by 21 in a long term experiment conducted at 35 c qiao et al 2016 despite these promising results most of these studies wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 2016 qiao et al 2016 were conducted at high temperatures in order to achieve an optimum rate while in mainstream wwtps the anammox process is desired to work at lower temperatures the short term effects of rgo on the anammox process at lower temperatures 10 30 c were investigated in a previous study tomaszewski et al 2019 which revealed that stimulation effects tend to be stronger at lower temperatures 20 c and that activity could be enhanced by up to 28 at 13 c when 15 mg l of rgo is added the optimal dose for the anammox stimulation was evaluated between 20 and 45 mg rgo g vss tomaszewski et al 2019 to summarize all mentioned studies wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 2016 qiao et al 2016 were performed with high temperatures close to the optimum one 35 c in a previous study tomaszewski et al 2019 short term effects of rgo on the anammox process at lower temperatures 10 30 c were investigated for the first time and the present study was designed to determine the long term effects of rgo on the low temperature anammox process in a lab scale technological system presenting a more thorough investigation of interaction mechanisms some previous studies have attempted to identify the mechanism by which go and rgo can enhance bacterial activity and growth it has been reported that nanomaterials can influence the catalytic properties of biomolecules which affects their conformational states pavlidis et al 2014 yin et al 2015 2016 demonstrated that an increase in anammox activity was associated with an enhancement in key anammox enzymes namely hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh nitrite reductase nir and nitrate reductase nar moreover nanomaterials in the graphene family have also been shown to act as attachment surfaces which can induce cell growth aggregation and secretion of extracellular polymeric substances ruiz et al 2011 wang et al 2013 observed that anammox bacteria could attach to rgo sheets yet despite this body of work there are still many gaps in knowledge about other interactions that occur between anammox biomass and graphene family nanomaterials for example it is still unknown what happens to a nanomaterial after incubation in a bioreactor or how the nanomaterial affects the microbial composition of a very complex community of anammox biomass that is rich in uncultured species thus it is especially important to take into account the antimicrobial properties of graphene and its derivatives rani et al 2017 considering this information the main objective of this study was to investigate the long term effects of rgo on the low temperature anammox process including different aspects of interaction rgo was shown to influence nitrogen removal during synthetic wastewater treatment bacterial community structure composition as well as bacterial impact on the structure of the nanomaterial 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequence batch reactors characteristics the anammox suspended biomass was

after incubation free suspended particles of rgo were taken from the reactor medium using a pipette the samples used for electron microscopy investigations were prepared by dispersing the rgo before

reflected and passing light samples excitations were made using an ion argon laser with a beam with a wavelength λ 514 nm the synthesized material was studied over a wide range of wavelengths of 100 3200 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 biotransformation of reduced graphene oxide after 109 days of incubation in the anammox reactor rgo showed signs of degradation and significant changes were observed in the tem images and in the eels spectrum presented in fig 2 as illustrated in the tem image fig 2b the edges of the sheets after cultivation with bacteria were irregular and ragged in contrast to the material before the experiment fig 2a a similar observation was made by liu et al 2015 using naphthalene degrading pseudomonas bacteria which were able to degrade graphite go and rgo to explain the degradation of rgo sheets eels and raman spectroscopy were applied to study the chemical changes of the nanomaterial the eels spectra of rgo before the experiment fig 2c contain two peaks near 285 ev and 293 ev which are characteristic of graphene layers li et al 2014 majumder et al 2018 the broad peak centered at 328 ev can be attributed to the interlayer bridges which link the rgo layers majumder et al 2018 the eels spectra after 109 days fig 2d does not contain this peak suggesting that a reduction in the number of layers has occurred leyva porras et al 2014 bacterial induced exfoliation of graphite sheets has been observed in past literature reports using acidithiobacillus ferroxidans zhu et al 2014 and naphthalene degrading pseudomonas bacteria liu et al 2015 moreover the peaks located near 535 ev and 350 ev fig 2d are respectively assigned to the presence of oxygen and calcium atoms the disordering structure of rgo was confirmed by examining the raman spectra fig 3 which contain four characteristic bands for disordered graphene based materials g a characteristic feature of the graphitic layers corresponding to in plane stretching of the c c bond d related to the disordered carbon or defective graphitic structures 2d sensitive to the π bond in the structure d g associated with a high degree of disorder radoń et al 2018 also the ratio of intensity of the d and g peaks id ig can be used to measure the defects present on the structure of the carbon nanomaterials the ratio of id ig after incubation in the reactor increases from 0 97 to 1 02 which indicates an increase in the disorder of the material additionally the increased intensity of the spectra and 2d bands shift to higher wavenumber in the raman analysis of the rgo after experiments confirming that oxidation had occurred iqbal et al 2012 hu et al 2014 radoń et al 2018 the presence of oxygen and the oxidation of rgo by bacteria is a previously reported phenomenon zhu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 guo et al 2017 rgo possesses oxygen functional groups which are typically located at the edges of the graphene sheets including epoxy groups that are located at the basal plane of the graphene sheets creating in plane defects and disorder dreyer et al 2010 because of the presence of these functional groups the defects and edges of the surface possess a higher reactivity and are susceptible to oxidation contact between the surface of graphene based materials and bacteria allows electron transfer but rgo is likely oxidized by the mediators because liu et al 2015 demonstrated that oxygen does not participate in bacteria rgo interactions on the other hand the ability of rgo to participate in enzymatic reactions has been reported including anammox enzymes yin et al 2015 2016 chen et al 2017 thus according to the literature zhu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 guo et al 2017 it can be suspected that rgo is oxidized and oxygen is reduced by the organic mediator involved in the enzymatic reactions performed by bacteria the rgo oxidation breaks the bonds of the carbon structure which results in the disintegration and exfoliation of the rgo sheets zhu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 however activated sludge is a very complex microbial community rich in undefined species thus their biochemical potential is not fully recognized yet which is regarded to be an obstacle in understanding the precise oxidation mechanisms in contrast to oxygen the effect of the presence of calcium on graphitic materials after incubation with bacteria has never been reported it has been recognized that divalent calcium cations promote adsorption between bacteria cells peeters et al 2011 whose surfaces are typically negatively charged rgo sheets are negatively charged as well because of the numerous oxygen containing groups dreyer et al 2010 while the electrostatic forces promote adsorption between particulate matter and bacteria hassard et al 2016 it can be suspected that divalent calcium cations can also act as cell rgo coupler bacterial induced degradation and transformation of carbon nanomaterials has been described in several reports that have primarily used monocultures lowry et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 guo et al 2017 herein the biodegradation of rgo exposed to an activated sludge mixed culture during synthetic wastewater treatment was demonstrated for the first time unfortunately direct measurement of rgo concentration in the reactor and effluent was impossible because there is a lack of techniques for graphene nanomaterials detection in complex environmental media and biological systems goodwin et al 2018 nonetheless since a greater concentration of graphene based nanomaterials is expected to be needed in the wastewater treatment plants suárez iglesias et al 2017 this observation is very promising and requires further investigation regarding the biodegradation of these materials in this environment 3 2 nitrogen removal performance the course of the experiment fig 1 can be divided into seven phases i 1 41 d stable operation without rgo addition ii 42 120 d first rgo

of stable operation in phase i 15 mg rgo l was added to the r reactor while the k reactor was operated as a control without addition of rgo during phase ii the temperature was gradually decreased from 30 c to 15 c the average nitrogen removal rate nrr remained stable and similar in both reactors at 0 139 0 025 kg n m3d standard deviation sd and 0 143 0 028 kg n m3d in the k and r reactor respectively however the specific anammox activity saa exhibited 23 lower activity of the anammox biomass in the r reactor table 1 indicating that rgo has a negative effect on the activity of the anammox bacteria inhibition of bacterial activity by rgo was previously reported in several studies wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 tomaszewski et al 2019 and the inhibitory dose in short term studies was evaluated above ca 45 mg g vss tomaszewski et al 2019 herein in a long term study the inhibitory dose was ca 18 mg g vss a common belief is that physical interactions and oxidative stresses are assumed to be responsible for the rgo toxicity against bacteria guo et al 2017 and a three step mechanism is proposed initial cell deposition on nanomaterials physical membrane stress caused by sharp nanosheets and the ensuing superoxide anion independent oxidation liu et al 2011 on the other hand similar nrrs during phase ii were caused by the higher biomass concentration in the r reactor table 1 despite both reactors being inoculated with a similar amount of activated sludge the concentrations were comparable during phase i differences between vss in the reactors during phase ii is statistically insignificant p 0 32 thus observed enhancement of growth could be burdened with vss measurement experimental error but in the longer run vss differences became statistically significant p 0 02 in phase iii confirming described observation this indicates that the rgo significantly enhances the growth rate of the anammox bacteria several studies have shown that graphene based nanomaterials can act as attachment surfaces inducing cell growth aggregation and secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps ruiz et al 2011 yin et al 2016 in activated sludge eps production is known to act as a bacterial protective agent against the influence of harmful compounds in wwtps wang et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 thus in this case such an explanation of effective bacterial performance despite the influence of a known bactericidal material seems reasonable herein it was shown that divalent cations like calcium could also act as cell rgo coupler section 3 1 enhancing the growth of anammox bacteria considering biodegradation of rgo with its inhibitory potential similar observations were made by guo et al 2019 with the zero valent iron after initial inhibition anammox bacteria adapted to the high zero valent iron concentration and was able to gradually consumed it during the experiment another and the simplest example regarding the anammox process is a well known substrate inhibition by free ammonia and nitrite then phase iii started and the temperature was decreased to 13 c and during the 61 days of this period the nrr of the reactors began to decrease but the r reactor exhibited a 15 higher average nrr compared with the k reactor p 0 05 table 1 similarly the saa demonstrated that the higher nrr was due to a higher biomass concentration that was present in phases ii and iii no signs of direct rgo influence during phase iii could produce these results for two reasons firstly the growth rate of anammox bacteria decreased when the temperature declined from 30 to 13 c making rgo induced cell growth a less significant factor secondly while rgo has weak sedimentation properties suárez iglesias et al 2017 it could be partially rinsed out of the reactor and or degraded as explained in section 3 1 however the experiment was continued and the temperature decreased to 10 c in phase iv to maintain a stable anammox process the nlr nitrogen loading rate was decreased to 0 145 0 012 kg n m3d during this period the nrr remained similar in both reactors at 0 053 0 010 kg n m3d and 0 058 0 010 kg n m3d in c and r reactor respectively after 30 days of operation at 10 c phase v started ammonium and nitrite began to accumulate in the r reactor and the nrr was gone on day 225 over the same amount of time efficiency of the k reactor was higher but still decreasing because 10 c was reported as extremely unfavorable conditions for the anammox bacteria tomaszewski et al 2017a b considering inhibitory potential of the rgo it can be suspected that the r reactor showed a higher sensitivity to such unfavorable conditions on the other hand if rgo can stimulate anammox activity it could also stimulate other types of bacteria the increase in the ratio of amounts of n no3 produced n nh4 removed fig 3 in phase v indicates the enhanced activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria which could dominate anammox bacteria in the competition for substrates nitrite and inorganic carbon source to restore the efficiency of the anammox process in the r reactor the temperature was immediately increased to 15 c process performance was recovered and a second dose of rgo was added to the r reactor 15 mg l on day 231 this decision was motivated by the awareness that rgo could be partially rinsed out of the reactor during 230 days of experiment or and degraded losing its properties during phase vi the nrr reached a level of 0 071 0 010 kg n m3d and 0 068 0 019 kg n m3d in c and r reactor respectively after 10 days temperature was decreased again to 13 c and phase vii started during the 70 days of this period the r reactor exhibited a 17 higher nrr p 0 05 table 1 compared to the k reactor these values are in range of the results obtained in phase iii when the nrr was 15 higher this time however the stimulation was also accompanied by a 16 higher saa p 0 05 table 1 which clearly shows that rgo can stimulate the anammox reaction rate this is consistent with the short term studies where similar stimulation was observed only below 20 c with a maximum of 28 activity stimulation at 13 c and 15 mg rgo l addition tomaszewski et al 2019 similar to the current study an activity stimulation of 10 and 17 was observed in short term experiments performed at 35 c by wang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 qiao et al 2016 and yin et al 2016 found that addition of rgo led to a 21 and 27 increase of the nrr during their respective long term studies based on the rgo biotransformation analysis section 3 1 the applied stimulation may be strongly associated with the excellent electron transferability of rgo and its performance as a redox mediator yin et al 2015 2016 a comparison between the performance of the k reactor with the r reactor results showed that statistically significant stimulation occurred only in phase iii and phase vii when the temperature was 13 c this is especially evident during the shift from 15 c to 13 c between phases ii iii and vi vii this observation possibly results from the reaction steps of the anammox process which could include two rate determining enzymes with various temperature optima isaka et al 2008 some previous studies have reported a change in the kinetics of the anammox reaction near 15 c which results in a higher activation energy below this point lotti et al 2015 tomaszewski et al 2017b herein the same temperature 15 c was also revealed to be a turning point for the metabolism of the anammox bacteria according to previous reports the optimal stoichiometry of the anammox process n no2 removed n nh4 removed and n no3 produced n nh4 removed ratios should respectively be about 1 32 and 0 26 strous et al 1998 fig 5 presents the ratios measured during the experiment which shows that there are no significant differences between the k and r reactors in both cases a decrease in the temperature below 15 c resulted in an increase in the n no2 n nh4 ratio during phases iii and iv and an increase in the n no3 n nh4 ratio during phase iv this correlates with the decrease of the anammox activity fig 4 and results from the increasing activity of nitrification which is also reflected in the bacterial community structure composition where the relative abundance of nitrospira increased in the same time section 3 3 simultaneous growth of the n no2 n nh4 and n no3 n nh4 ratios indicates an increase in the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob small amounts of oxygen could enter into reactor during influent but it was used quickly and its observed concentration was still below 0 1 mg l several researches reported that anammox bacteria can be protected by aob which consume oxygen and produce nitrite pynaert et al 2003 liu et al 2012 ziembińska buczyńska et al 2019 the stable n no3 n nh4 ratio during phase iii was probably caused by endogenous denitrification which arose from products of cell death and lysis after the temperature decreased the enhanced rate of nitrite oxidation under a low nlr was expected because temperatures below 25 c promote the growth of nob van dongen et al 2001 however during last phase the nitrogen conversion ratios returned to their values before phase iii indicating successful restoration of a stable anammox process the results presented here show that different stimulating factors act in tandem with one another growth stimulation is especially significant at higher temperatures 15 c when the bacteria growth rate is not strongly affected by temperature the enhancement in the anammox reaction rate appears to occur only below 15 c in line with the short term research previously reported tomaszewski et al 2019 however the exact nature of the stimulation mechanism is still unclear and further investigation is still required to fully understand it considering practical approach of this study high production cost is definitely a disadvantage of graphene materials but they are relatively new materials with a lot of potential applications its price has been decreasing in last year s perreault et al 2015 the development of nanotechnology is enforced by a lot of fields such as medicine electronics physics and chemistry so it is reasonable to predict that graphene materials production will be improved and will become much cheaper and cheaper in the coming years 3 3 bacterial community structure graphene rgo and go each possess well documented antimicrobial properties goncalves et al 2016 guo et al 2017 most of the antimicrobial studies of nanoparticles are performed on pure cultures of bacteria including both planktonic and biofilms ahmend and rodrigues 2013 guo et al 2017 it was demonstrated that bacteria living in biofilms are more resistant towards negative rgo influence than free living bacteria olson et al 2002 guo et al 2017 which is likely due to the protective properties of extrapolimeric substances however the resistance of the biofilm bacteria depends on the concentration of the antimicrobial substance and the length of the exposure thus in this case it could be suspected that activated sludge flocs that are exposed to rgo produced a large amount of eps which decreased the bactericidal influence of this compound on the bacterial community in this study the structure of the bacterial community of activated sludge responsible for performing the nitrogen removal process was monitored in lab scale bioreactors also investigated was the microbial structure of the inoculating sludge for both experimental sbrs as it can be seen in figs 6 8 the inoculum in of the control k and the experimental r reactors differ in the composition of their respective bacterial communities the seeding sludge in derived from the communal wastewater from a full scale reactor could not be made entirely homogeneous despite constant mixing in a bioreactor the bacterial community of the lab scale bioreactor was composed of bacteria derived from the inoculum and also from the non sterile medium or the bioreactor surroundings these factors discounting the effect of the bioreactor volume and its technological performance are responsible for the community structure thus even though both the experimental and control bioreactors were inoculated with the same activated sludge and operated simultaneously the operation period until the first rgo addition was crucial for a new community to develop which was derived from the bacteria present in the inoculating sludge although the full scale bioreactors are regarded to be well mixed it is no possible to achieve a well mixed state in such a large volume the obtained results suggest the possibility that the sludge used for inoculation was not homogeneous and the community that developed from the seeding sludge differ in samples k 1 and r 1 the most abundant phyla of bacteria present in all samples in different proportions were planctomycetes nitrospirae and firmicutes and their numbers fluctuated during the experiment figs 6 and 7 in comparison to inoculum 18 03 the number of planctomycetes decreased in the experimental reactor 16 03 but increased in the control reactor 20 1 during the experiment the percentage of this bacterial group increased in both reactors from 16 03 to 17 8 and from 20 1 to 21 25 for the experimental and control bioreactors respectively in contrast to the conventional nitrification denitrification wastewater system where proteobacteria are the most abundant phylum cao et al 2017 in the case of anammox bioreactors firmicutes are much more prominent in all samples but their numbers decrease from 19 9 in inoculum to 14 84 in the control and increased to 21 15 in the experimental reactor before rgo addition these results lead to the suspicion that the rgo dosage negatively influenced this phylum because in both cases the number of these bacteria decreased at the end of the experiment to 13 4 and 11 in the control and experimental bioreactors respectively since 2015 when daims et al demonstrated that nitrospira sp was a bacteria that was able to perform both nitrification stages several researchers have worked with anammox bioreactors and have reported that this phylum is relatively abundant in anaerobic ammonia oxidizing systems ciesielski et al 2018 pinto et al 2015 ziembińska buczyńska et al 2019 it is suspected that not only does nitrospira not compete with the anammox bacteria but it instead supports anammox performance by providing extra nitrite ciesielski et al 2018 in both bioreactors in this experiment this phylum was represented in high numbers at the end of the experiments 23 4 and 25 3 control and experiment respectively in comparison to 16 8 of inoculum the same trend is visible at the class level fig 8 which shows the domination of plactomycetacia and nitrospira class bacilli phylum firmicutes was highly represented in the inoculum but their numbers decreased in both reactors during the experiment from 14 05 in inoculum to 5 58 and 3 78 in the control and experimental bioreactors at the end of the experiments respectively interestingly at the genus level there is no evidence of anammox bacteria identified such as candidatus brocadia jettenia or scalindua table 2 instead the most abundant group of sequences is represented by the unclassified planctomycetes 17 1 in inoculum 15 09 17 4 for the experimental and 18 35 20 8 for the control reactor the second most abundant group of sequences belongs to nitrospira 16 8 in inoculum 13 9 25 3 for the experimental and 14 36 23 4 for the control bioreactor obtained results support the notion that nitrospira can help the anammox bacteria in the nitrogen removal performance in anaerobic systems it could also be suspected that there are still many bacteria not identified at the genus level from the anammox group that is performing this process in the technological systems with high efficacy even though rgo is regarded as an antimicrobial agent rani et al 2017 in the case of the activated sludge community its negative influence is visible only in the case of the phylum firmicutes these results agree with previous research in which firmicutes were described as more sensitive towards the influence of antimicrobial nanoparticles than e coli when tested in pure cultures stoyanova et al 2017 these results highlight that the bacteria living in the communities seem to be more resistant towards the effects of antimicrobial agents such as rgo and further research is required for a better understanding of their resistance mechanisms 4 conclusions the long term effects of rgo on the low temperature anammox process including different aspects of interaction were studied the nitrogen removal performance showed that rgo can stimulate anammox activity by up to 17 with different stimulating factors firstly growth stimulation was especially significant at higher temperatures 15 c where the bacteria growth rate was not strongly affected by temperature secondly the increase in the anammox reaction rate occurred only below 15 c even though rgo is regarded as an antimicrobial agent for the anammox activated sludge community its negative influence is not visible in the bacterial community structure these results underscore that bacteria living in these communities seem to have a higher resistance towards antimicrobial agents such as rgo possibly due to the high eps production moreover after incubation in the anammox bioreactor rgo showed signs of degradation and chemical changes and the presence of oxygen and calcium was detected on its surface herein according to the literature and obtained results it was proposed that rgo is oxidized and oxygen is reduced by the organic mediator involved in the enzymatic reactions however the exact nature of the stimulation mechanism remains unclear and its elucidation requires further investigation in contrast to the monocultures microorganisms in the activated sludge created a very complex community rich in undefined species whose role in rgo oxidation is still unknown acknowledgements the study was financed by the national science centre poland umo 2017 25 n nz9 01159

18894,the unique properties of ionic liquids make them attractive for a wide range of industrial applications which makes it easy to be released into the environment and cause water or soil pollution phytoremediation of organic contaminants is a safe and important process for removing persistent pollutants from the environment however due to they are very chemically stable and potentially toxic to plants whether they can be removed assimilated and metabolized by plants remains unknown during phytoremediation process in this study ryegrass lolium perenne l was used for imidazolium ionic liquid 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium bromide c4mim removal from water the results show that c4mim could be taken up accumulated and metabolized by plants in vivo with a high removal efficiency most of the c4mim was accumulated in the root tissue with the root concentration fraction factors ranging from 4 9 to 51 5 two hydroxylated metabolites 1 4 hydroxybutyl 3 methylimidazolium and 1 n butyl 3 hydroxymethyl imidazolium and two secondary metabolites were detected in the ryegrass after c4mim uptake the metabolic mechanism was clarified using density functional theory calculations furthermore c4mim at a high concentration was found to be high toxic to inhibit the growth of ryegrass markedly in response some oxidative stress was observed in the metabolic process as indicated by increasing of catalase super dismutase and peroxidase activities our results suggested that phytoremediation was an efficient technique for ionic liquids treatment from water graphical abstract image 1 keywords density functional theory imidazolium ionic liquids metabolic mechanism phytoremediation 1 introduction ionic liquids are molten salts that have a negligible vapor pressure and relatively low melting point 100 c and have been classified as a green solvent to replace the traditional solvents that are used in many important chemical processes amde et al 2015 due to their numerous advantages such as chemical and thermal stability outstanding solvation potential high electric conductivity and high water solubility ionic liquids have been widely used for a broad range of applications including organic synthesis extraction catalysis electrochemistry and biotechnology petkovic et al 2011 however such a wide use of ionic liquids has a risk of leaking into the environment which may result in water or soil pollution the toxic effects of ionic liquids on plants and organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments have been recognized matzke et al 2008 yu et al 2009 markiewicz et al 2013 thamke et al 2017 from the currently available data on the toxicity of ionic liquids to different organisms ionic liquids are obviously not very green or environmentally friendly chemicals pham et al 2010 thamke et al 2017 owing to the high stability of ionic liquids the available treatment for removing ionic liquids from water are based on chemical processes such as advanced oxidation czerwicka et al 2009 spasiano et al 2016 electrochemical degradation stolte et al 2008 and photodegradation zhou et al 2013 calza et al 2017 the chemical treatment process can effectively convert non biodegradable and persistent ionic liquids into biodegradable organic or and inorganic compounds to eliminate them pan et al 2014 spasiano et al 2016 however once the ionic liquids enter the ecosystem it is difficult to remove ionic liquids from aquatic or terrestrial environments therefore it is important to develop an environmental nondestructive bioremediation technology to removal them from aquatic conditions phytoremediation of organic contaminants is a safe and important process for removing persistent pollutants from the environment van aken et al 2004 muthusaravanan et al 2018 however due to the specific properties of ionic liquids the removal aspects of ionic liquids by plants have rarely been studied to date previous studies show that ionic liquids have phytotoxic effects on plants matzke et al 2008 plants can assimilate and interact with organic compounds and thereby affect the fate of many organic pollutants the phytoremediation of organic contaminants is a safe and important process for removing persistent pollutants from the environment van aken et al 2004 however due to the specific properties of ionic liquids the removal aspects of ionic liquids by vegetative plants have rarely been studied to date thus it is necessary to investigate the possibility of the transport and metabolization of ionic liquids in plant tissues as well as their stability and susceptibility to the accumulation or degradation processes in plants for the phytoremediation of ionic liquids in fact in a theoretical study some imidazolium ionic liquids are predicted to have a tendency to be incorporated into the membrane and bio accumulated in cells and were subsequently broken down metabolically by cytochrome p450 cyp450 jastorff et al 2003 however the potential accumulation and metabolization of ionic liquids such as imidazolium in vegetative plants remain unrevealed lolium perenne l ryegrass a species of economical feed possesses a fibrous root system with thick main roots and thinner lateral branches this dense root system making it easily interwoven floating straw mats over surface of water due to the high biomass production rate relatively high tolerance to the adverse environmental stresses and most importantly its great potential for contaminant remediation duan et al 2017 ryegrass has been chosen as a candidate plant for wastewater treatment therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the phytoremediation of imidazolium ionic liquid 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium c4mim by ryegrass lolium perenne l the uptake of c4mim into ryegrass roots and its subsequent translocation and transformation in ryegrass were explored also the toxic effects of c4mim on the physiological characters of ryegrass were investigated in addition density functional theory dft calculations were performed to elucidate the possible transformation mechanism of c4mim by the active site of cyp450 in ryegrass 2 materials and methods 2 1 il and ryegrass cultivation an imidazolium c4mim br 99 was purchased from the chengjie chem co ltd shanghai china and used as the model ionic liquid in this study ryegrass lolium perenne l was used in this study for c4mim uptake the experiments were conducted in a greenhouse at 26 1 c the ryegrass seeds were germinated on a bed of sterilized cotton gauze with deionized water the photoperiod was 16 h per day and the light intensity was 2100 2500 lux the grasses were transferred into 150 ml of glass conical flasks with half strength hoagland nutrient solution when they grew to 5 cm high after that when the seedlings grew to 8 10 cm high excluding the roots the healthy and actively growing ryegrass plants with white color vigorous roots strait stem and dark green leaf shapes were utilized for further experiments 2 2 hydroponic exposure experiments to investigate the removal efficiency of c4mim by plants a final exposure concentration of c4mim of 5 mg l was dosed into each conical flask and each conical flask was planted with 15 ryegrass plants the deionized water the hoagland solution and the conical flasks were autoclaved to prevent any possible influence of microorganisms on the c4mim removal deionized water was added to the conical flasks every day to compensate for the transpiration losses according to the water level three replicated conical flasks planted with ryegrass grown in hoagland solution without c4mim were used as the untreated plant control three replicated conical flasks planted with only fresh roots without shoots acted as the excised ryegrass control and an additional three plants were air dried to act as the dead ryegrass control two replicated blank controls without plants were used to determine the contribution of biodegradation possibly occurring inside the hydroponic solution on c4mim removal all conical flasks were wrapped with aluminum foil to keep the root zone dark and to eliminate the photodegradation of c4mim four conical flasks were taken at 1 2 4 8 12 24 48 and 72 h after the dose of c4mim for plant exposure and the water samples were collected to analyze the residual c4mim concentrations the growth inhibition test experiments were performed in glass flasks with dosages of various concentrations of c4mim 0 1 2 5 10 and 15 mg l three replicates at each concentration were conducted after the ryegrass was planted the weights of the root leaf elongation and fresh ryegrass were recorded every 3 days at the end of the experiment all solutions were collected and the c4mim concentrations were analyzed to investigate the influence of c4mim concentration on its removal efficiency the c4mim concentrations in water samples from all treatments were quantified by hplc agilent 1260 with a c18 150 4 6 mm 5 μm column details shown in the supporting information 2 3 c4mim uptake kinetics by ryegrass the effects of ionic liquid initial concentrations on plant uptake were investigated the uptake kinetics were estimated by measuring c4mim depletion at various c4mim initial concentrations 0 5 1 2 5 10 15 and 20 mg l after 4 h of treatment the water samples were collected and analyzed and the plant root samples were weighed the experiments were replicated three times under each condition the uptake kinetic parameters v max and k m of c4mim of ryegrass could be estimated by fitting the experimental data during depletion to the modified michaelis menten model equation brix et al 2002 1 v v max c c min k c c min where c is the c4mim concentration in the medium v and v max are respectively the uptake rate and the maximum uptake rate at c4mim initial concentration c c min is c4mim concentration at which there is no net uptake and a low c min value implies a good uptake ability at low c4mim initial concentrations k and k m is the respective saturation and the half saturation constant and k m is the c4mim concentration where the uptake rate is the half of the maximum rate and k m k c min the phytoextraction ability of ryegrass for c4mim was assessed by the root concentration factor rcf and the translocation factor tf which could be calculated by eq 2 and eq 3 respectively felizeter et al

operation and development oecd guidelines 201 oecd 1984 the average specific growth rates μ of ryegrass at various c4mim concentrations were calculated as the logarithmic increase in biomass using eq 4 4 μ t ln b j ln b i t j t i where μ t is the average specific growth rate from time t i to t j and b i and b j are the weights of the biomass at time t i to t j respectively the percent inhibition ratio i of the ryegrass growth rate by c4mim was calculated using eq 5 5 i μ 0 μ t μ 0 100 where μ 0 is the mean value of μ for the untreated plant control 2 5 analysis of chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzyme activities biochemical tests were performed to evaluate the destruction by ionic liquids of photosynthetic activity and changes in antioxidative enzyme activities of ryegrass the chlorophyll in plants was extracted using 80 acetone and determined using a spectrophotometric method at 646 nm and 663 nm according to a previous study aibibu et al 2010 before antioxidative enzyme activity measurements the plant samples root or leaf were homogenized in 0 1 m kh2po4 buffer ph 7 0 under liquid nitrogen protection and then centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was collected as the crude extract for the enzyme assay the catalase enzyme activity cat was determined by monitoring the h2o2 degradation at 240 nm gallego et al 1996 a nitro blue tetrazorium nbt method was used to measure the super dismutase enzyme activity sod giannopolitis and ries 1977 the peroxidase enzyme activity pod was determined on the basis of guaiacol oxidation by hydrogen peroxide yin et al 2008 reactive oxygen species ros levels of the ryegrass tissues were detected by the 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate dcfh da method domey et al 2015 2 6 c4mim and its metabolite extraction from ryegrass prior to analysis the plants after c4mim uptake were separated into roots and leaves and then the samples were ground in liquid nitrogen with a ceramic mortar and pestle the plant samples were mixed and homogenized with 10 ml of phosphate buffer with 0 5 triethylamine and methanol 7 3 v v and were then shaken vigorously overnight to extract c4mim from plant samples the extracts containing c4mim were harvested after centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 20 min evaporated to dryness and then re dissolved in 1 ml of methanol subsequently the solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for subsequent hplc mass spectrometer ms analysis details shown in the supporting information 2 7 molecular models and computational methods because the crystal structure of cyp450 of lolium perenne l has not been experimentally solved homology modeling currently the most accurate computational method was used to build this three dimensional model from its amino acid sequence on the basis of alignment with a similar protein with known structure bordoli et al 2009 the cyp450 of bacillus megaterium girvan et al 2009 with a sequence identity of 40 78 was selected as the template on the basis of the target template alignment the cyp450 model of lolium perenne l was generated all the above steps were completed in swiss model workspace arnold et al 2006 and the molecular graphics program pymol the catalytically active heme group with a central iron atom is linked to the peptide chain by the thiolate sulphur atom of a cysteine residue the iron iv oxo porphyrin radical cation in cyp450 termed compound i cpd i is thought to be highly reactive a cluster model of cpd i is used to mimic the active center of cyp450 rittle and green 2010 for probing the mechanism of cyp dependent transformation of the cation of ionic liquids the energy changes in the metabolic pathways for c4mim biotransformation on the cpd i cluster in aqueous solution were studied using dft computations an all electron method within the perdew burke and ernzerhof pbe perdew et al 1996 functional form of generalized gradient approximation gga perdew et al 1992 for the exchange correlation term was employed in combination with the double precision numerical basis sets including p polarization dnp as implemented in the dmol3 code delley 2000 the grimme method grimme 2006 is adopted for dispersion corrections with the pbe functional methods the conductor like screening model cosmo was used to describe the solvent effect klamt and schuurmann 1993 where the solute molecule forms a cavity within the dielectric continuum of permittivity that represents the solvent the energy in each geometry optimization cycle the maximum displacement and the maximum force was converged to within 1 10 5 hartree 5 10 3 å and 2 10 3 hartree å respectively the transition state ts structure and the activation energy e a were acquired for the metabolic pathways of c4mim on cpd i by the linear synchronous transit quadratic synchronous transit methods halgren and lipscomb 1977 3 results and discussion 3 1 c4mim removal by ryegrass fig 1 shows the profiles of c4mim removal from water at various cultivation times no significant change in peak area corresponding to c4mim concentration was observed in the blank control indicating that the abiotic degradation of c4mim did not occur under our test conditions table 1 the adsorption of c4mim to the plant root surface was small because the dead root control showed a negligible removal of c4mim 5 from the solution table 1 only 7 6 of c4mim was removed from the excised ryegrass control reactor which indicated that only a small part of c4mim could be adsorbed or assimilated by the roots during the treatment however in the experiments with planted ryegrass c4mim assimilation occurred the concentration dropped from an initial 5 mg l to 0 18 mg l after 72 h uptake suggesting that approximately 96 5 of c4mim was removed by ryegrass fig 1a the c4mim removal by ryegrass was found to follow pseudo first order kinetics with a high coefficient of determination r 2 0 996 fig 1 the kinetic constant was 0 037 h and the average c4mim removal rate by ryegrass was 0 209 mg d during the experiment with 5 mg l of c4mim treatment the effect of c4mim initial concentration on its removal efficiency by ryegrass was also investigated at the c4mim initial concentration 2 mg l most of the c4mim could be assimilated by ryegrass and its removal efficiency was approximately 100 fig 1b however the removal efficiency decreased with increasing c4mim concentration and it decreased to approximately 66 from an initial c4mim concentration of 15 mg l fig 1b plant uptake kinetic parameters were estimated by a non linear regression parameter using the michaelis menten model eq 1 to estimate the values of v max and c min these constants can be considered important criteria for selecting plant species for pollutant removal from contaminated water the values of v max and c min for c4mim uptake by ryegrass were estimated to be 3 316 mg l h g fresh weight fw and 0 0001 mg l respectively fig 1c a good fit of the experimental data to eq 1 r2 0 99 suggested that the uptake of c4mim and transport into ryegrass was an active process such a low c mim indicates that the uptake of c4mim by ryegrass was more efficient even at a very low initial c4mim concentration therefore the uptake kinetic characteristics would be useful for selecting plant species for pollutant removal from contaminated water 3 2 c4mim uptake and translocation in ryegrass tissues after 15 day exposures of ryegrass to various concentrations of c4mim the plant samples were collected for c4mim analysis to investigate c4mim phytoaccumulation in different ryegrass tissues the results demonstrate that c4mim could be assimilated by ryegrass roots and transported to aboveground parts of the plants fig s1 table 2 c4mim accumulation in the root tissue was much higher than that in the leaf tissue for example it was found that approximately 85 5 of assimilated c4mim was accumulated in the roots of the plants exposed to 15 mg l c4mim but the translocation to the leaves was only 14 5 table 2 the c4mim contents in the roots and leaves of the plants were concentration dependent and increased with an increase in the dosage of c4mim rcf and tf can be utilized in phytoremediation studies to describe how many contaminants could be taken up by plants and translocated to foliage ryegrass exhibited a very high effectiveness to phyto extract the c4mim from water with a high root concentration factor table 2 however the average translocation factors at different initial c4mim concentrations were much less than 1 suggesting that the transfer of c4mim from root to leaves was not favored our results demonstrated that from a phytoremediation point of view the highest fraction of c4mim could be assimilated by ryegrass some of which was translocated to the leaves of the plants this resulted in a high removal efficiency of c4mim from contaminated water by ryegrass most of the c4mim was accumulated in the root tissue whose content in the roots was approximately 4 9 times higher than that in the leaves after a 15 day exposure to 15 mg l c4mim fig 1 table 2 these results suggested that the main process of c4mim removal by plants was root uptake and that the translocation of c4mim from roots to leaves was considerably less efficient based on the calculated root concentration factor rcf and the translocation factor tf data ryegrass had a high potential for successful phytoaccumulation to remove ionic liquids e g c4mim from contaminated water but their transfer from root to leaves was not favored in contrast to other neutral organics the ionizable characteristics of ionic liquids may affect their partitioning behaviors in terms of plant uptake accumulation and translocation carter et al 2014 after the ionic liquids are taken up into the plant roots their translocation from the roots to other parts of the plant may depend on two factors partitioning into xylem sap and cell membrane permeability hsu et al 1990 the negative electrical potential of the plasmalemma membrane could favor cation accumulation in the cell e g c4mim eggen et al 2011 resulting in a relatively high uptake rate by plants c4mim uptake was mainly driven by the water flow through the root apoplast to the casparian strip and subsequent transportation into xylem sap however because of its high hydrophilicity c4mim crosses the lipophilic cell membrane of the plant endodermis more slowly and its efficiency of translocation is consequently curtailed sicbaldi et al 1997 as consequence c4mim translocation to the aboveground tissues was decreased 3 3 metabolic pathway of c4mim in ryegrass once the contaminants are taken up the plant tissue will accumulate the chemicals and transform them to other new chemicals by lignification schnoor et al 1995 notably in this study the mass balance calculation of c4mim indicated that approximately 11 15 of assimilated c4mim might be metabolized in ryegrass tissues table 2 further analysis of metabolization intermediates of c4mim would be useful not only to characterize the mechanisms of uptake and metabolization but also to evaluate the secondary pollution and risk associated with c4mim uptake by plants identification of the metabolization intermediates of c4mim in ryegrass tissues was confirmed by the highly sensitive mass spectrum value m z fig s2 four metabolites were clearly identified in plant tissues table 3 the hydroxylated derivative m1 and or m2 c8h15n2o was observed in the root and leaf samples the exact mass spectrum was consistent with c8h12n2o2 fragment m3 as a secondary metabolite of 1 4 hydroxybutyl 3 methylimidazolium m1 the other two metabolic products m z 125 1073 m4 and m z 83 0599 m5 were respectively identified as butyl imidazole and methylimidazole based on the identified metabolization intermediates of c4mim the possible metabolic pathways of c4mim in ryegrass are proposed fig 2 hydroxylation products m1 and m2 preferentially occurred in ryegrass as a direct oxidative metabolism of c4mim a previous study also suggested that imidazolium ionic liquids could be oxidized by cyp450 in microorganisms to hydroxylation metabolites in different positions of the alkyl side chains and could be metabolically broken down to imidazole and biodegradable fatty acids neumann et al 2010 the observation of m3 might be due to the subsequent oxidation of the hydroxyl group at c4 of the butyl chain into a carbonyl group m1 methylimidazolium m5 was another oxidation product from 1 4 hydroxybutyl 3 methylimidazolium m1 the intermediate m4 would be generated by a secondary oxidation process from another hydroxylation product 1 n butyl 3 hydroxymethyl imidazolium m2 as no standard for the metabolization intermediates were available the quantification of these metabolites in ryegrass tissue extracts was not conducted although the obtained metabolic information for c4mim in ryegrass in this study is preliminary the identification of the intermediate supports that the ionic liquids could potentially be metabolized and transformed by plants during phytodegradation process to gain further insights into the possible transformation mechanism of c4mim by cyp450 in ryegrass the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of two metabolic scenarios fig 2 were calculated cyp450 belongs to the family of monooxygenase enzymes which catalyze hydrocarbon hydroxylation by inserting one oxygen atom into the carbon hydrogen bond of their substrates ortiz de montellano 2010 the intermediate products m1 and m2 were generated from hydroxylation of the butyl and methyl side chains of c4mim respectively the geometrical structures of the optimized initial reactants transition states and key intermediate products are illustrated in fig 3 c h for two proposed metabolic pathways because the active center is exposed to the solvent fig 3a the calculations are performed under aqueous conditions water ε 78 39 the cysteine ligand cys77 coordinated on the iron atom of the porphyrin ring determines the electron reduction potential of the active center fu et al 2016 in this cyp dependent transformation of the cation of ionic liquids the negative gibbs free energy δg ө values table s1 indicate that the formation of both m1 and m2 is thermodynamically favorable which promotes the following transformation in addition the hydroxylation of the methyl side chain to form m2 has a 4 times higher energy barrier e a than does the generation of m1 thus the m1 formation process in pathway 1 would have a higher reaction rate therefore the metabolic process of imidazolium cation with ryegrass cyp450 might tend to occur on the tail of the long saturated alkyl chain this theoretical study provided molecular level insights into the metabolic mechanisms of ionic liquids 3 4 inhibition of c4mim on ryegrass growth the toxicity of c4mim towards ryegrass was also investigated after a 15 day exposure plants that had been treated with 10 mg l c4mim or more showed severe toxicity symptoms i e yellow leaves brown roots and less fibrous roots fig 4 a high concentration e g 10 and 15 mg l of c4mim caused a significant growth inhibition of ryegrass however the plant root leaf elongation rates and the total plant biomass increase rate were not significantly affected by dosing c4mim at low e g 1 and 2 mg l concentrations fig 5 although the total root and leaf length and biomass increased over cultivation time in all treatments the growth rate of the total plant length decreased from 0 10 cm day to 0 04 cm day as c4mim concentrations increased from 0 to 15 mg l after a 15 day exposure to 15 mg l of c4mim the plants only increased approximately 119 in terms of fresh weight but the total fresh weight of control plants without c4mim exposure increased approximately 460 the inhibition of c4mim on ryegrass growth was also described using half maximal effective concentrations ec50 which was calculated as 8 29 mg l fig 5d the chlorophyll content of ryegrass decreased slightly after a 15 day exposure to low concentrations of c4mim however the content significantly decreased with increasing c4mim concentration fig 6 a the oxidative stress in the different parts of ryegrass after exposure to c4mim was assessed by measuring the levels of cat sod and pod fig 6b d compared to the control plants without exposure to c4mim the antioxidant enzyme activities in different parts of the ryegrass did not change after exposure to 1 mg l of c4mim consistent with the low ros level in the plant tissues fig 6e however the cat sod and pod activities progressively increased with increasing c4mim concentration which increased approximately 122 43 and 105 in the roots and approximately 23 60 and 181 in the leaves with an increase in c4mim concentration from 0 to 15 mg l meanwhile exposure to 15 mg l of c4mim resulted in a significant increase in ros level in the different ryegrass tissues fig 6e 3 5 c4mim toxicity to ryegrass the toxicity test is useful to understand plant tolerance to toxic chemicals and identify appropriate phytoremediation plants ionic liquids can exhibit toxicities to living organisms thuy pham et al 2010 such as inhibiting the plant growth rate reducing photosynthesis and inducing excessive ros generation and membrane deterioration as a consequence of oxidative stress the inhibition of plant growth under high c4mim concentration exposure decreased the ryegrass c4mim removal efficiency the ec50 value of c4mim for ryegrass was lower than that for duckweed obtained by matzke et al 2007 indicating that the toxicity of c4mim to ryegrass was relatively higher the color of ryegrass leaves after exposure to a high concentration of c4mim changed from green to pale white suggesting that the toxic effects of c4mim resulted in damage to the photosynthetic apparatus plant photosynthesis is inhibited as the plant chlorophyll content decreases because chlorophyll is responsible for the capture of sunlight this could be confirmed in this study by decreasing the chlorophyll content in the plant tissues due to excessive ros generation under exposure to a high c4mim concentration fig 6 due to the toxicity of ros plants would re upgrade the primarily antioxidant system to overcome ros mediated oxidative stress as biomarkers of the enzymatic antioxidant defense system of plants the sod cat and pod activities in ryegrass were found to increase markedly under various c4mim stresses suggesting that the antioxidative system might play an important role in protecting the plant cells from oxidative damage caused by c4mim the excess ros can t be scavenge effectively by damaged antioxidant system in the ryegrass which could further disrupt to cellular function as a result the plant growth rate decreased with respect to the design of an inherently safe c4mim concentration for phytoremediation the results of this study suggested that ryegrass could tolerate c4mim at a high concentration e g 5 mg l in an aquatic environment without significant influences on plant growth and uptake 4 conclusions the current studies demonstrated that ionic liquids are not so called environmentally friendly chemicals they might threaten the natural environment and should be removed or degraded after they are discharged into the environment in this study ryegrass was used for imidazolium removal from water results show that c4mim could be taken up accumulated and metabolized by plants in vivo with a high efficiency the phytoaccumulation and consequent metabolization of ionic liquid in the different parts of the plants were also confirmed two hydroxylated metabolites and two secondary metabolites were detected in the ryegrass after c4mim uptake these results may have important implications for the potential application of phytoremediation for removing ionic liquids from contaminated water or soil to validate this potential application field experiments will be needed to investigate the long term phytoaccumulation and phytodegradation of ionic liquids in plants under different environmental conditions from an application perspective after remediation the ionic liquid accumulated plants could be harvested and incinerated and then disposed safely such as landfill in future studies the disposal of the ionic liquid contaminated plants and

18894,the unique properties of ionic liquids make them attractive for a wide range of industrial applications which makes it easy to be released into the environment and cause water or soil pollution phytoremediation of organic contaminants is a safe and important process for removing persistent pollutants from the environment however due to they are very chemically stable and potentially toxic to plants whether they can be removed assimilated and metabolized by plants remains unknown during phytoremediation process in this study ryegrass lolium perenne l was used for imidazolium ionic liquid 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium bromide c4mim removal from water the results show that c4mim could be taken up accumulated and metabolized by plants in vivo with a high removal efficiency most of the c4mim was accumulated in the root tissue with the root concentration fraction factors ranging from 4 9 to 51 5 two hydroxylated metabolites 1 4 hydroxybutyl 3 methylimidazolium and 1 n butyl 3 hydroxymethyl imidazolium and two secondary metabolites were detected in the ryegrass after c4mim uptake the metabolic mechanism was clarified using density functional theory calculations furthermore c4mim at a high concentration was found to be high toxic to inhibit the growth of ryegrass markedly in response some oxidative stress was observed in the metabolic process as indicated by increasing of catalase super dismutase and peroxidase activities our results suggested that phytoremediation was an efficient technique for ionic liquids treatment from water graphical abstract image 1 keywords density functional theory imidazolium ionic liquids metabolic mechanism phytoremediation 1 introduction ionic liquids are molten salts that have a negligible vapor pressure and relatively low melting point 100 c and have been classified as a green solvent to replace the traditional solvents that are used in many important chemical processes amde et al 2015 due to their numerous advantages such as chemical and thermal stability outstanding solvation potential high electric conductivity and high water solubility ionic liquids have been widely used for a broad range of applications including organic synthesis extraction catalysis electrochemistry and biotechnology petkovic et al 2011 however such a wide use of ionic liquids has a risk of leaking into the environment which may result in water or soil pollution the toxic effects of ionic liquids on plants and organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments have been recognized matzke et al 2008 yu et al 2009 markiewicz et al 2013 thamke et al 2017 from the currently available data on the toxicity of ionic liquids to different organisms ionic liquids are obviously not very green or environmentally friendly chemicals pham et al 2010 thamke et al 2017 owing to the high stability of ionic liquids the available treatment for removing ionic liquids from water are based on chemical processes such as advanced oxidation czerwicka et al 2009 spasiano et al 2016 electrochemical degradation stolte et al 2008 and photodegradation zhou et al 2013 calza et al 2017 the chemical treatment process can effectively convert non biodegradable and persistent ionic liquids into biodegradable organic or and inorganic compounds to eliminate them pan et al 2014 spasiano et al 2016 however once the ionic liquids enter the ecosystem it is difficult to remove ionic liquids from aquatic or terrestrial environments therefore it is important to develop an environmental nondestructive bioremediation technology to removal them from aquatic conditions phytoremediation of organic contaminants is a safe and important process for removing persistent pollutants from the environment van aken et al 2004 muthusaravanan et al 2018 however due to the specific properties of ionic liquids the removal aspects of ionic liquids by plants have rarely been studied to date previous studies show that ionic liquids have phytotoxic effects on plants matzke et al 2008 plants can assimilate and interact with organic compounds and thereby affect the fate of many organic pollutants the phytoremediation of organic contaminants is a safe and important process for removing persistent pollutants from the environment van aken et al 2004 however due to the specific properties of ionic liquids the removal aspects of ionic liquids by vegetative plants have rarely been studied to date thus it is necessary to investigate the possibility of the transport and metabolization of ionic liquids in plant tissues as well as their stability and susceptibility to the accumulation or degradation processes in plants for the phytoremediation of ionic liquids in fact in a theoretical study some imidazolium ionic liquids are predicted to have a tendency to be incorporated into the membrane and bio accumulated in cells and were subsequently broken down metabolically by cytochrome p450 cyp450 jastorff et al 2003 however the potential accumulation and metabolization of ionic liquids such as imidazolium in vegetative plants remain unrevealed lolium perenne l ryegrass a species of economical feed possesses a fibrous root system with thick main roots and thinner lateral branches this dense root system making it easily interwoven floating straw mats over surface of water due to the high biomass production rate relatively high tolerance to the adverse environmental stresses and most importantly its great potential for contaminant remediation duan et al 2017 ryegrass has been chosen as a candidate plant for wastewater treatment therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the phytoremediation of imidazolium ionic liquid 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium c4mim by ryegrass lolium perenne l the uptake of c4mim into ryegrass roots and its subsequent translocation and transformation in ryegrass were explored also the toxic effects of c4mim on the physiological characters of ryegrass were investigated in addition density functional theory dft calculations were performed to elucidate the possible transformation mechanism of c4mim by the active site of cyp450 in ryegrass 2 materials and methods 2 1 il and ryegrass cultivation an imidazolium c4mim br 99 was purchased from the chengjie chem co ltd shanghai china and used as the model ionic liquid in this study ryegrass lolium perenne l was used in this study for c4mim uptake the experiments were conducted in a greenhouse at 26 1 c the ryegrass seeds were germinated on a bed of sterilized cotton gauze with deionized water the photoperiod was 16 h per day and the light intensity was 2100 2500 lux the grasses were transferred into 150 ml of glass conical flasks with half strength hoagland nutrient solution when they grew to 5 cm high after that when the seedlings grew to 8 10 cm high excluding the roots the healthy and actively growing ryegrass plants with white color vigorous roots strait stem and dark green leaf shapes were utilized for further experiments 2 2 hydroponic exposure experiments to investigate the removal efficiency of c4mim by plants a final exposure concentration of c4mim of 5 mg l was dosed into each conical flask and each conical flask was planted with 15 ryegrass plants the deionized water the hoagland solution and the conical flasks were autoclaved to prevent any possible influence of microorganisms on the c4mim removal deionized water was added to the conical flasks every day to compensate for the transpiration losses according to the water level three replicated conical flasks planted with ryegrass grown in hoagland solution without c4mim were used as the untreated plant control three replicated conical flasks planted with only fresh roots without shoots acted as the excised ryegrass control and an additional three plants were air dried to act as the dead ryegrass control two replicated blank controls without plants were used to determine the contribution of biodegradation possibly occurring inside the hydroponic solution on c4mim removal all conical flasks were wrapped with aluminum foil to keep the root zone dark and to eliminate the photodegradation of c4mim four conical flasks were taken at 1 2 4 8 12 24 48 and 72 h after the dose of c4mim for plant exposure and the water samples were collected to analyze the residual c4mim concentrations the growth inhibition test experiments were performed in glass flasks with dosages of various concentrations of c4mim 0 1 2 5 10 and 15 mg l three replicates at each concentration were conducted after the ryegrass was planted the weights of the root leaf elongation and fresh ryegrass were recorded every 3 days at the end of the experiment all solutions were collected and the c4mim concentrations were analyzed to investigate the influence of c4mim concentration on its removal efficiency the c4mim concentrations in water samples from all treatments were quantified by hplc agilent 1260 with a c18 150 4 6 mm 5 μm column details shown in the supporting information 2 3 c4mim uptake kinetics by ryegrass the effects of ionic liquid initial concentrations on plant uptake were investigated the uptake kinetics were estimated by measuring c4mim depletion at various c4mim initial concentrations 0 5 1 2 5 10 15 and 20 mg l after 4 h of treatment the water samples were collected and analyzed and the plant root samples were weighed the experiments were replicated three times under each condition the uptake kinetic parameters v max and k m of c4mim of ryegrass could be estimated by fitting the experimental data during depletion to the modified michaelis menten model equation brix et al 2002 1 v v max c c min k c c min where c is the c4mim concentration in the medium v and v max are respectively the uptake rate and the maximum uptake rate at c4mim initial concentration c c min is c4mim concentration at which there is no net uptake and a low c min value implies a good uptake ability at low c4mim initial concentrations k and k m is the respective saturation and the half saturation constant and k m is the c4mim concentration where the uptake rate is the half of the maximum rate and k m k c min the phytoextraction ability of ryegrass for c4mim was assessed by the root concentration factor rcf and the translocation factor tf which could be calculated by eq 2 and eq 3 respectively felizeter et al

operation and development oecd guidelines 201 oecd 1984 the average specific growth rates μ of ryegrass at various c4mim concentrations were calculated as the logarithmic increase in biomass using eq 4 4 μ t ln b j ln b i t j t i where μ t is the average specific growth rate from time t i to t j and b i and b j are the weights of the biomass at time t i to t j respectively the percent inhibition ratio i of the ryegrass growth rate by c4mim was calculated using eq 5 5 i μ 0 μ t μ 0 100 where μ 0 is the mean value of μ for the untreated plant control 2 5 analysis of chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzyme activities biochemical tests were performed to evaluate the destruction by ionic liquids of photosynthetic activity and changes in antioxidative enzyme activities of ryegrass the chlorophyll in plants was extracted using 80 acetone and determined using a spectrophotometric method at 646 nm and 663 nm according to a previous study aibibu et al 2010 before antioxidative enzyme activity measurements the plant samples root or leaf were homogenized in 0 1 m kh2po4 buffer ph 7 0 under liquid nitrogen protection and then centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was collected as the crude extract for the enzyme assay the catalase enzyme activity cat was determined by monitoring the h2o2 degradation at 240 nm gallego et al 1996 a nitro blue tetrazorium nbt method was used to measure the super dismutase enzyme activity sod giannopolitis and ries 1977 the peroxidase enzyme activity pod was determined on the basis of guaiacol oxidation by hydrogen peroxide yin et al 2008 reactive oxygen species ros levels of the ryegrass tissues were detected by the 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate dcfh da method domey et al 2015 2 6 c4mim and its metabolite extraction from ryegrass prior to analysis the plants after c4mim uptake were separated into roots and leaves and then the samples were ground in liquid nitrogen with a ceramic mortar and pestle the plant samples were mixed and homogenized with 10 ml of phosphate buffer with 0 5 triethylamine and methanol 7 3 v v and were then shaken vigorously overnight to extract c4mim from plant samples the extracts containing c4mim were harvested after centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 20 min evaporated to dryness and then re dissolved in 1 ml of methanol subsequently the solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for subsequent hplc mass spectrometer ms analysis details shown in the supporting information 2 7 molecular models and computational methods because the crystal structure of cyp450 of lolium perenne l has not been experimentally solved homology modeling currently the most accurate computational method was used to build this three dimensional model from its amino acid sequence on the basis of alignment with a similar protein with known structure bordoli et al 2009 the cyp450 of bacillus megaterium girvan et al 2009 with a sequence identity of 40 78 was selected as the template on the basis of the target template alignment the cyp450 model of lolium perenne l was generated all the above steps were completed in swiss model workspace arnold et al 2006 and the molecular graphics program pymol the catalytically active heme group with a central iron atom is linked to the peptide chain by the thiolate sulphur atom of a cysteine residue the iron iv oxo porphyrin radical cation in cyp450 termed compound i cpd i is thought to be highly reactive a cluster model of cpd i is used to mimic the active center of cyp450 rittle and green 2010 for probing the mechanism of cyp dependent transformation of the cation of ionic liquids the energy changes in the metabolic pathways for c4mim biotransformation on the cpd i cluster in aqueous solution were studied using dft computations an all electron method within the perdew burke and ernzerhof pbe perdew et al 1996 functional form of generalized gradient approximation gga perdew et al 1992 for the exchange correlation term was employed in combination with the double precision numerical basis sets including p polarization dnp as implemented in the dmol3 code delley 2000 the grimme method grimme 2006 is adopted for dispersion corrections with the pbe functional methods the conductor like screening model cosmo was used to describe the solvent effect klamt and schuurmann 1993 where the solute molecule forms a cavity within the dielectric continuum of permittivity that represents the solvent the energy in each geometry optimization cycle the maximum displacement and the maximum force was converged to within 1 10 5 hartree 5 10 3 å and 2 10 3 hartree å respectively the transition state ts structure and the activation energy e a were acquired for the metabolic pathways of c4mim on cpd i by the linear synchronous transit quadratic synchronous transit methods halgren and lipscomb 1977 3 results and discussion 3 1 c4mim removal by ryegrass fig 1 shows the profiles of c4mim removal from water at various cultivation times no significant change in peak area corresponding to c4mim concentration was observed in the blank control indicating that the abiotic degradation of c4mim did not occur under our test conditions table 1 the adsorption of c4mim to the plant root surface was small because the dead root control showed a negligible removal of c4mim 5 from the solution table 1 only 7 6 of c4mim was removed from the excised ryegrass control reactor which indicated that only a small part of c4mim could be adsorbed or assimilated by the roots during the treatment however in the experiments with planted ryegrass c4mim assimilation occurred the concentration dropped from an initial 5 mg l to 0 18 mg l after 72 h uptake suggesting that approximately 96 5 of c4mim was removed by ryegrass fig 1a the c4mim removal by ryegrass was found to follow pseudo first order kinetics with a high coefficient of determination r 2 0 996 fig 1 the kinetic constant was 0 037 h and the average c4mim removal rate by ryegrass was 0 209 mg d during the experiment with 5 mg l of c4mim treatment the effect of c4mim initial concentration on its removal efficiency by ryegrass was also investigated at the c4mim initial concentration 2 mg l most of the c4mim could be assimilated by ryegrass and its removal efficiency was approximately 100 fig 1b however the removal efficiency decreased with increasing c4mim concentration and it decreased to approximately 66 from an initial c4mim concentration of 15 mg l fig 1b plant uptake kinetic parameters were estimated by a non linear regression parameter using the michaelis menten model eq 1 to estimate the values of v max and c min these constants can be considered important criteria for selecting plant species for pollutant removal from contaminated water the values of v max and c min for c4mim uptake by ryegrass were estimated to be 3 316 mg l h g fresh weight fw and 0 0001 mg l respectively fig 1c a good fit of the experimental data to eq 1 r2 0 99 suggested that the uptake of c4mim and transport into ryegrass was an active process such a low c mim indicates that the uptake of c4mim by ryegrass was more efficient even at a very low initial c4mim concentration therefore the uptake kinetic characteristics would be useful for selecting plant species for pollutant removal from contaminated water 3 2 c4mim uptake and translocation in ryegrass tissues after 15 day exposures of ryegrass to various concentrations of c4mim the plant samples were collected for c4mim analysis to investigate c4mim phytoaccumulation in different ryegrass tissues the results demonstrate that c4mim could be assimilated by ryegrass roots and transported to aboveground parts of the plants fig s1 table 2 c4mim accumulation in the root tissue was much higher than that in the leaf tissue for example it was found that approximately 85 5 of assimilated c4mim was accumulated in the roots of the plants exposed to 15 mg l c4mim but the translocation to the leaves was only 14 5 table 2 the c4mim contents in the roots and leaves of the plants were concentration dependent and increased with an increase in the dosage of c4mim rcf and tf can be utilized in phytoremediation studies to describe how many contaminants could be taken up by plants and translocated to foliage ryegrass exhibited a very high effectiveness to phyto extract the c4mim from water with a high root concentration factor table 2 however the average translocation factors at different initial c4mim concentrations were much less than 1 suggesting that the transfer of c4mim from root to leaves was not favored our results demonstrated that from a phytoremediation point of view the highest fraction of c4mim could be assimilated by ryegrass some of which was translocated to the leaves of the plants this resulted in a high removal efficiency of c4mim from contaminated water by ryegrass most of the c4mim was accumulated in the root tissue whose content in the roots was approximately 4 9 times higher than that in the leaves after a 15 day exposure to 15 mg l c4mim fig 1 table 2 these results suggested that the main process of c4mim removal by plants was root uptake and that the translocation of c4mim from roots to leaves was considerably less efficient based on the calculated root concentration factor rcf and the translocation factor tf data ryegrass had a high potential for successful phytoaccumulation to remove ionic liquids e g c4mim from contaminated water but their transfer from root to leaves was not favored in contrast to other neutral organics the ionizable characteristics of ionic liquids may affect their partitioning behaviors in terms of plant uptake accumulation and translocation carter et al 2014 after the ionic liquids are taken up into the plant roots their translocation from the roots to other parts of the plant may depend on two factors partitioning into xylem sap and cell membrane permeability hsu et al 1990 the negative electrical potential of the plasmalemma membrane could favor cation accumulation in the cell e g c4mim eggen et al 2011 resulting in a relatively high uptake rate by plants c4mim uptake was mainly driven by the water flow through the root apoplast to the casparian strip and subsequent transportation into xylem sap however because of its high hydrophilicity c4mim crosses the lipophilic cell membrane of the plant endodermis more slowly and its efficiency of translocation is consequently curtailed sicbaldi et al 1997 as consequence c4mim translocation to the aboveground tissues was decreased 3 3 metabolic pathway of c4mim in ryegrass once the contaminants are taken up the plant tissue will accumulate the chemicals and transform them to other new chemicals by lignification schnoor et al 1995 notably in this study the mass balance calculation of c4mim indicated that approximately 11 15 of assimilated c4mim might be metabolized in ryegrass tissues table 2 further analysis of metabolization intermediates of c4mim would be useful not only to characterize the mechanisms of uptake and metabolization but also to evaluate the secondary pollution and risk associated with c4mim uptake by plants identification of the metabolization intermediates of c4mim in ryegrass tissues was confirmed by the highly sensitive mass spectrum value m z fig s2 four metabolites were clearly identified in plant tissues table 3 the hydroxylated derivative m1 and or m2 c8h15n2o was observed in the root and leaf samples the exact mass spectrum was consistent with c8h12n2o2 fragment m3 as a secondary metabolite of 1 4 hydroxybutyl 3 methylimidazolium m1 the other two metabolic products m z 125 1073 m4 and m z 83 0599 m5 were respectively identified as butyl imidazole and methylimidazole based on the identified metabolization intermediates of c4mim the possible metabolic pathways of c4mim in ryegrass are proposed fig 2 hydroxylation products m1 and m2 preferentially occurred in ryegrass as a direct oxidative metabolism of c4mim a previous study also suggested that imidazolium ionic liquids could be oxidized by cyp450 in microorganisms to hydroxylation metabolites in different positions of the alkyl side chains and could be metabolically broken down to imidazole and biodegradable fatty acids neumann et al 2010 the observation of m3 might be due to the subsequent oxidation of the hydroxyl group at c4 of the butyl chain into a carbonyl group m1 methylimidazolium m5 was another oxidation product from 1 4 hydroxybutyl 3 methylimidazolium m1 the intermediate m4 would be generated by a secondary oxidation process from another hydroxylation product 1 n butyl 3 hydroxymethyl imidazolium m2 as no standard for the metabolization intermediates were available the quantification of these metabolites in ryegrass tissue extracts was not conducted although the obtained metabolic information for c4mim in ryegrass in this study is preliminary the identification of the intermediate supports that the ionic liquids could potentially be metabolized and transformed by plants during phytodegradation process to gain further insights into the possible transformation mechanism of c4mim by cyp450 in ryegrass the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of two metabolic scenarios fig 2 were calculated cyp450 belongs to the family of monooxygenase enzymes which catalyze hydrocarbon hydroxylation by inserting one oxygen atom into the carbon hydrogen bond of their substrates ortiz de montellano 2010 the intermediate products m1 and m2 were generated from hydroxylation of the butyl and methyl side chains of c4mim respectively the geometrical structures of the optimized initial reactants transition states and key intermediate products are illustrated in fig 3 c h for two proposed metabolic pathways because the active center is exposed to the solvent fig 3a the calculations are performed under aqueous conditions water ε 78 39 the cysteine ligand cys77 coordinated on the iron atom of the porphyrin ring determines the electron reduction potential of the active center fu et al 2016 in this cyp dependent transformation of the cation of ionic liquids the negative gibbs free energy δg ө values table s1 indicate that the formation of both m1 and m2 is thermodynamically favorable which promotes the following transformation in addition the hydroxylation of the methyl side chain to form m2 has a 4 times higher energy barrier e a than does the generation of m1 thus the m1 formation process in pathway 1 would have a higher reaction rate therefore the metabolic process of imidazolium cation with ryegrass cyp450 might tend to occur on the tail of the long saturated alkyl chain this theoretical study provided molecular level insights into the metabolic mechanisms of ionic liquids 3 4 inhibition of c4mim on ryegrass growth the toxicity of c4mim towards ryegrass was also investigated after a 15 day exposure plants that had been treated with 10 mg l c4mim or more showed severe toxicity symptoms i e yellow leaves brown roots and less fibrous roots fig 4 a high concentration e g 10 and 15 mg l of c4mim caused a significant growth inhibition of ryegrass however the plant root leaf elongation rates and the total plant biomass increase rate were not significantly affected by dosing c4mim at low e g 1 and 2 mg l concentrations fig 5 although the total root and leaf length and biomass increased over cultivation time in all treatments the growth rate of the total plant length decreased from 0 10 cm day to 0 04 cm day as c4mim concentrations increased from 0 to 15 mg l after a 15 day exposure to 15 mg l of c4mim the plants only increased approximately 119 in terms of fresh weight but the total fresh weight of control plants without c4mim exposure increased approximately 460 the inhibition of c4mim on ryegrass growth was also described using half maximal effective concentrations ec50 which was calculated as 8 29 mg l fig 5d the chlorophyll content of ryegrass decreased slightly after a 15 day exposure to low concentrations of c4mim however the content significantly decreased with increasing c4mim concentration fig 6 a the oxidative stress in the different parts of ryegrass after exposure to c4mim was assessed by measuring the levels of cat sod and pod fig 6b d compared to the control plants without exposure to c4mim the antioxidant enzyme activities in different parts of the ryegrass did not change after exposure to 1 mg l of c4mim consistent with the low ros level in the plant tissues fig 6e however the cat sod and pod activities progressively increased with increasing c4mim concentration which increased approximately 122 43 and 105 in the roots and approximately 23 60 and 181 in the leaves with an increase in c4mim concentration from 0 to 15 mg l meanwhile exposure to 15 mg l of c4mim resulted in a significant increase in ros level in the different ryegrass tissues fig 6e 3 5 c4mim toxicity to ryegrass the toxicity test is useful to understand plant tolerance to toxic chemicals and identify appropriate phytoremediation plants ionic liquids can exhibit toxicities to living organisms thuy pham et al 2010 such as inhibiting the plant growth rate reducing photosynthesis and inducing excessive ros generation and membrane deterioration as a consequence of oxidative stress the inhibition of plant growth under high c4mim concentration exposure decreased the ryegrass c4mim removal efficiency the ec50 value of c4mim for ryegrass was lower than that for duckweed obtained by matzke et al 2007 indicating that the toxicity of c4mim to ryegrass was relatively higher the color of ryegrass leaves after exposure to a high concentration of c4mim changed from green to pale white suggesting that the toxic effects of c4mim resulted in damage to the photosynthetic apparatus plant photosynthesis is inhibited as the plant chlorophyll content decreases because chlorophyll is responsible for the capture of sunlight this could be confirmed in this study by decreasing the chlorophyll content in the plant tissues due to excessive ros generation under exposure to a high c4mim concentration fig 6 due to the toxicity of ros plants would re upgrade the primarily antioxidant system to overcome ros mediated oxidative stress as biomarkers of the enzymatic antioxidant defense system of plants the sod cat and pod activities in ryegrass were found to increase markedly under various c4mim stresses suggesting that the antioxidative system might play an important role in protecting the plant cells from oxidative damage caused by c4mim the excess ros can t be scavenge effectively by damaged antioxidant system in the ryegrass which could further disrupt to cellular function as a result the plant growth rate decreased with respect to the design of an inherently safe c4mim concentration for phytoremediation the results of this study suggested that ryegrass could tolerate c4mim at a high concentration e g 5 mg l in an aquatic environment without significant influences on plant growth and uptake 4 conclusions the current studies demonstrated that ionic liquids are not so called environmentally friendly chemicals they might threaten the natural environment and should be removed or degraded after they are discharged into the environment in this study ryegrass was used for imidazolium removal from water results show that c4mim could be taken up accumulated and metabolized by plants in vivo with a high efficiency the phytoaccumulation and consequent metabolization of ionic liquid in the different parts of the plants were also confirmed two hydroxylated metabolites and two secondary metabolites were detected in the ryegrass after c4mim uptake these results may have important implications for the potential application of phytoremediation for removing ionic liquids from contaminated water or soil to validate this potential application field experiments will be needed to investigate the long term phytoaccumulation and phytodegradation of ionic liquids in plants under different environmental conditions from an application perspective after remediation the ionic liquid accumulated plants could be harvested and incinerated and then disposed safely such as landfill in future studies the disposal of the ionic liquid contaminated plants and
