25030,this paper proposes a method for mathematical modeling and ecological risk assessment in marine ecosystems under the combined action of natural anthropogenic climatic and invasive factors the method is based on the combined use of dynamic models probabilistic eco screening risk assessments and observational data eero main advantage of the proposed approach in comparing with the already known methods lies in modeling the stressors effect on the ecosystem main components intra annual functioning mode this allows obtaining the ecological risk intra annual variations identifying the intra year intervals of increased danger and calculating the corresponding acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact risk simulation examples in regard to the temperate latitude regions northern caspian highly productive ecosystems and to the arctic area low productive ecosystems are provided results obtained brought to nontrivial conclusions on the ecosystems vulnerability and on the necessity to prioritize ecological risk calculation followed by assessment of the allowable exposure probability in the environmental and economic aspect the use of eero would help to minimize economic expenses in the development of shelf resources calculation of the intra annual ecological risk variations and the corresponding calculation of the anthropogenic impact allowable probability would make it possible to vary expenses on the ecological protection measures the volume of such measures would be determined by increasing or decreasing requirements to the acceptable anthropogenic load calculated in accordance with the model the paper substantiates the primacy nature of determining the acceptable ecological risk value and further the acceptable intensity of anthropogenic impact that opens a possibility to receive answers to questions on the basic acceptability of accidents of a certain scale the method is efficient in assessing the risk to ecosystems with varying degrees of vulnerability the proposed approach is important for practical coordination of ecological and economic requirements in safe development of shelf resources and in costs minimizing keywords mathematical modeling ecological risk ecosystem vulnerability 1 introduction requirement to assess the ecological risk simulation is due to reorientation in the ecological safety from the absolute safety concept to the allowable risk concept or combination thereof in case we are required to assess the ecological risk to marine ecosystems it is necessary to take into account not only the set of different genesis stressors their cumulative effect and impact modes but also to combine these factors with the dynamics of ecological systems functioning at the same time ecosystems themselves are within the continuous dynamics of functioning which is a characteristic feature for each of them and could possess a varying degree of vulnerability stressors action is being imposed upon the dynamics of the ecosystems natural functioning intra annual variations in the marine ecosystems main components in the stressors action context is causing variations in the degree of danger and consequently in the ecological risk annual variations the method proposed allows considering the combined stressors of different nature action on the marine ecosystems natural functioning process identifying the intervals of increased ecological risk in the course of modeling and calculating the acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact based on probabilistic models the method eero is based on the synthesis of the known dynamic ecosystem approach eco screening risk assessments and the use of observation data at the same time calculations using eero help to obtain non trivial conclusions on the acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact on ecosystems with varying degrees of vulnerability the need to develop ecological risk modeling methods for ecosystems with varying degree of vulnerability is based on the fact that the very degree of vulnerability is identified after causing practical damage to ecosystems it is hardly possible to recognize the trial and error method effective in the development of resources under such different geographic climatic biological hydrophysical and other conditions appearing on the arctic baltic caspian black seas and far east seas shelves ecosystem effects of the marine areas mineral hydrocarbon and biological resources development depend not only on the intensity of anthropogenic impact high productive and low productive ecosystems have different degrees of sensitivity and vulnerability under the cumulative effect of the factors different genesis thus the arctic shelf ecosystems are more vulnerable because of the low degree of biodiversity and lower temperatures affecting the pollutants decomposition rate such ecosystems response to external factors including climatic changes negative natural conditions anthropogenic and invasive effects would be different from the temperate latitudes ecosystems it is of special importance for the shelf marine ecosystems of varying sensitivity not only to obtain a forecast of their state but also to assess risks under probable scenarios of the external factors combination another eero method development direction lies in harmonization of ecological and economic requirements accompanied by minimization of the financial expenses combined achievement of ecological safety and minimization of expenses for these safety causes are arising significant difficulties this could be explained not only by contradictions between the tasks of ecology and economics but also by the established practice of independent approaches in each of these areas without taking into account holistic reflection of a real object under study in the technocratic practice adoption of business decisions is primarily oriented towards economic indicators in the absence of due ecological factor consideration primacy in determining the allowable ecological risk value and on its basis the allowable anthropogenic impact intensity in the risk simulation method eero would allow to coordinate ecological and economic requirements accompanied by probable safety expenses minimization in other words there is no requirement to permanently maintain a constant level of financing economic measures to ensure the ecological safety fleishman 1995 solovjova 1999 a more rational approach could be in coordinating the risk variation course and expenses required to prevent it it is clear that admissibility of anthropogenic impact should be considered within the framework of an allowable risk where complete risk elimination is either practically impossible or economically unjustified within the process of implementing large scale projects in the marine resources development for example oil and gas fields development errors in risk assessment could lead to serious ecologic and economic losses thus risk value overestimation for example when accepting the incredibly high probability of an accident could lead to spending non required large financial resources to prevent consequences which probability is insignificant patin 2004 at the same time risk assessment underestimation dangerous situation is concealed by external well being could lead to disastrous consequences patin 2017 the most important issue in obtaining risk assessments is the primacy of determining the allowable risk magnitude for ecological systems and not vice versa determining the anthropogenic impact allowable intensity fleishman 1995 this makes it possible to take into account specifics of the ecological safety tasks consisting in the asymmetry of requirements regarding elimination of 1st and 2nd kind errores if there is a 1st kind error i e a safe situation is taken as a situation posing a threat to an ecosystem safety then the excessive overcautiousness associated with a false alarm is not that dangerous although resulting in unjustified expenses as the 2nd kind error when a dangerous situation is hidden by external well being it is rather difficult to derive any regularity in the consequences of the entire variety of the human business activities scenarios in regard to ecosystems of different sensitivity at the same time it is still necessary to quantitatively assess the allowable level of anthropogenic impact on the environment taking into account the climatic response allowable impact probability on a shelf ecosystem implies preservation of the natural system its trophic structure functioning and components composition sustainability at the same time the area of dynamic systems sustainability which could include an ecosystem is not statically fixed but covers alterations within the limits of its basic parameters variations the very magnitude of an ecosystem critical state if formalization thereof is possible would not be permanent it nonlinearly depends on external natural conditions anthropogenic impact and ecosystem system itself at the current and previous points of time 2 study area substantiation on the risk assessment development method prospective is associated with overcoming the limitations in regard to the stressors nature diversity and their cumulative effect on marine ecosystems and with diversity of the ecosystem response to react to the external influences chen et al 2011 2013 van den brink et al 2016 the environmental protection agency framework proposed an integrated framework that covered both human health and ecological risk assessment era quantitative ecological risk assessment era methods are the tools for natural resource management chen et al 2006 dale et al 2008 environmental risk assessment includes the effects of chemical and non chemical stresses on various levels of biological organization and spatial scale ecological risk assessments era of marine systems are often only give broad guidance of how issues might be addressed in the form of strategies astles 2014 at the background of global ecological crisis regional ecological risk assessment is emphasized the fields human activities geological disasters and climate affairs in the regional ecological risk assessment relative risk assessment rra based on weight of evidence woe are used widely landis 2004 landis et al 2004 landis and wiegers 2007 the relative risk model rrm was applied to evaluate the ecological risk characterization of the marine and freshwater ecosystems landis et al 2004 landis and wiegers 2007 hayes and landis 2004 rra approaches vary broadly from qualitative to quantitative and include qualitative combination expert ranking consensus ranking semi quantitative ranking landis and wiegers 2007 chen et al 2006 this approaches could be used in retrospect assessment causation assessment and the whole process of ecological risk assessment regional ecological risk assessment has the potential of becoming quantitative tools of management decision if it integrated with economy chen et al 2011 rrm was used to analyze the pacific herring reduction causes and risks landis et al 2004 hayes and landis 2004 as well as risks associated with invasions of the alien species organisms colnar and landis 2007 miller et al 2010 the list of sources and stressors includes climate change noise shading from the piers recreation invasives from other sources water quality oil spills effluent outfalls ecological network analysis ena based on the network theory fath 2007 fath and borrett 2006 2019 ulanowicz 2004 was used to assess the ecological risk data requirements for the analysis include the inter compartmental flows compartmental storages and boundary input and output flows and have high potential to provide useful and practical information for the environmental decision makers and stakeholders fath et al 2019 method ecological network analysis was applying to the ecological risk assessment of river ecosystems after dam construction chen et al 2010 for establishing reference domain in functional assessment of an estuary christian et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2015 different approaches to assessing the risk originating from individual stressors are based both on quantitative methods and on ranking the stressors on risk level indexation mapping and preparation of risk matrices network utility matrices expert estimates and semi quantitative methods within this process stochastic monte carlo methods for example in the aquatic ecosystems toxicological risks assessment qu et al 2016 as well as the category estimation indexing methods bayesian estimates herring et al 2015 jons et al 2017 techniques from linear algebra are used ecological risk methodology assessment is most actively developed in regard to oil spill accidents kraly et al 2001 linkov and clark 2003 ly et al 2004 patin 2004 aurand et al 2005 stevens et al 2005 the risk in this case is defined as the result of an emergency situation probability and the severity of its consequences patin 2004 based on these estimates risk ranking matrices are compiled dixon and rath 1999 chen et al 2013 and they are used for a comprehensive risk analysis and danger prevention dragsund et al 2004 motroen and wentworth 2004 ly et al 2004 one of the well known approaches to risk assessment is construction of environmental risk matrices that reflect probability of a dangerous event and severity of possible consequences taking into consideration the known technologies in the shelf oil and gas production facilities patin 2017 using such matrices makes it possible to estimate the extent of damage to the shelf natural resources and the recovery time after a dangerous event for example oil spill drilling mud discharge etc this method takes into account the space time range of processes affecting the risk however dynamics of namely the ecological risk within the limits of basic ecosystem parameters variation remains unidentified the latter gains importance with combined action of climatic natural adverse factors and anthropogenic impact based on the precautionary principles patin 2004 2017 special attention should be paid to a combined action of the most unfavorable conditions impact on an ecosystem and to predicting consequences of cumulative effect thereof ecological risk assessment of anthropogenic and natural factors favorable and unfavorable consequences on ecosystems of varying vulnerability operation requires application of all available methods field and laboratory studies expert systems matrix analysis risk assessment methods etc including mathematical modelling the latter becomes especially important if within the spectrum all impacts and invasive processes are taken into account which consequences are manifested differently than anthropogenic consequences haak et al 2017 and quite often lead to restructuring the ecosystem as well as to significant economic and financial losses unfortunately a wide range of methods and efforts undertaken to create an effective tool for assessing the environmental risk prove to be in insignificant demand due to very general recommendations the models are restricted to instant cause effect computation of single factors and often ignore the systems effects therefore fail to implement a holistic assessment at an ecosystem scale chen et al 2011 ecological risk assessment has found relatively few applications outside that of managing chemicals landis 2009 this is in spite of its intrinsic cause effect modeling and its applicability to the management of invasive species aquaculture watersheds use change analysis of various approaches to ecological risk assessment demonstrates that in order to increase efficiency and methods demand the most preferable way is the synthesis of various approaches the assessing ecological risk by using system based models at different levels of organization in a combined way is an evolutionary step for the application of risk evaluation in environmental management chen et al 2013 however it is clear that it is not sufficient to consider only the stressors cumulative effect under the static ecosystem conditions it is necessary to combine the stressors dynamics with the ecosystem functioning dynamics this could be done by synthesizing dynamic models of ecosystems state with eco screening models of the probabilistic risk assessments under the stressors cumulative effect which is actually proposed in the present paper 3 materials and methods this paper suggests using the synthesis of ecosystem simulation belyaev 1984 belyaev and konduforova solovjova 1990 and ecoscreening risk assessments fleishman 1982 solovjova 1999 to evaluate the risk of marine ecosystems with varying vulnerability degrees the proposed approach makes it possible to move from a fixed shelf resources value introduced in project which ensures allowable impact on an ecosystem due to its variations during the year such alterations would be determined by the ecological risk variations for the ecosystems with varying vulnerability levels the proposed method scheme of matching the allowable anthropogenic impact and ecological risks is presented in fig 1 method structure involves the following sequence of actions ecoscreening risk assessments section 3 1 are calculated on the basis of field observations section 5 and ecosystem modeling sections 3 and 4 the risk assessment model input data are compiled based on the data from the biomass field observations of organisms shiganova et al 2003 2004 matishov et al 2006 sukhanova et al 2009 ilyash et al 2012 flint 2010 2015 demidov et al 2014 2017 or the results of simulating an ecosystem state using dynamic models

populations that are used as the input data to calculate the ecological risk probability which values are also undergoing alterations over the course of a year the ecological risk probability values allow to estimate probabilities of the allowable anthropogenic load on ecosystem and to coordinate ecological and economic requirements fig 1 3 1 risk modeling based on ecoscreening approach ecosystem and ecoscreening simulation synthesis method eero uses the concept of ecological risk as a probability of an individual or the organisms population death the intra annual risk variability model is based on the following in real conditions the number of individuals constituting a population is changing regularly throughout a year under the influence of natural factors i e changes in solar radiation nutrient substances amount internal relationships between components etc these changes could be obtained as a result of in situ measurements section 3 3 or ecosystem model numerical simulation section 3 2 moreover to assess the risk in the right direction from above fleishman 1982 it is necessary to take into account the most unfavorable natural conditions precautionary principle patin 2017 simulations using the ecosystem aggregated components model reflect the biomass quantity population natural peak and declines section 3 2 population quantity peak and decline periods do not coincide with the calendar seasons maximum numbers for each nmax m peak and nmax m decline at m 1 m and m are the numbers of peak declined periods during a year besides the average values obtained at ecosystem simulation section 3 2 are the input data for the risk ecoscreening model the m value could vary from a year to year under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors for a general

required on annual biomass variations of the ecosystems basic components with varying vulnerability this could be field observation averaged data section 3 3 or results of the annual biomass or concentration variations numerical modelling as an example the previously published results of simulating the annual variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass macrophytes biogenic elements suspended and dissolved organic matter and nekton for the north caspian ecosystem were taken into consideration solovjova 2016 the biological processes that are taken into account by the model of the shelf ecosystem include processes of transformation of substances when they pass through trophic levels the biomass of biological species describe biomass using first order differential equations the

results of calculations based on the dynamic model section 4 2 and observations data solovjova et al 2018 shiganova et al 2003 2004 ghabooli et al 2010 as far as the arctic ecosystem is concerned generalized observation data were used demidov et al 2014 2017 flint 2010 2015 ilyash et al 2012 matishov et al 2006 sukhanova et al 2009 the ecosystem of the northern caspian is highly productive observations in 2002 2010 and subsequent years revealed a wide range of quantitative indices of the spring development of phytoplankton in the northern caspian area according to the results of observations in august 2002 shiganova et al 2004 the total biomass of phytoplankton cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae varied from 79 9 to 280 7 30 7 to 208 2 6 2 to 46 and 0 33 to 52 4 mg m3 respectively the average biomass for the entire region was 180 73 mg m3 and the average abundance was 195 590 114 070 cells l which is characteristic of the lower limit of mesotrophic waters shiganova et al 2004 however the real biomass and abundance of phytoplankton was probably 20 to 30 higher owing to unaccounted fractions picoplankton 2 μm and small phytoflagellates 4 8 μm the invasion of ctenophore consuming zooplankton reduced the pressure on phytoplankton the quantitative indices of which have increased over the past decade shiganova et al 2004 the end of biological spring is observed in june which is due to changes in the species composition of phytoplankton in this period the total observed biomass decreases to 1 2 2 g m3 ivanov and sokolsky 2000 the decrease in temperature characteristic of autumn leads to a decrease in phytoplankton biomass according to long term data of field observations by 1 2 g m3 to 2 3 g m3 ivanov and sokolsky 2000 shiganova et al 2004 the observed autumn maximum of phytoplankton biomass is 2 3 times lower than the summer maximum the seasonal growth in zooplankton biomass lags behind the seasonal peak of phytoplankton biomass which reflects the trophic relationship between these components according to observations the quantitative characteristics of zooplankton development varied in a wide range of values in 2005 to 2010 the average zooplankton abundance in summer varied from 110 000 to 800 000 spec m3 and the biomass varied from 900 to 6000 mg m3 these indices were generally lower in autumn than in summer being 45 000 to 300 000 spec m3 and 350 1900 mg m3 respectively shiganova et al 2003 2004 observations showed a decrease in the abundance and biomass of zooplankton by 2 5 and 3 7 times respectively by autumn which indicates its grazing by ctenophore shiganova et al 2004 the maxima of the ctenophore biomass lag behind the peak values of zooplankton biomass observations showed two such maxima the summer maximum and autumn maximum which correspond to the intense development of ctenophore in the northern caspian ghabooli et al 2010 observations data were used in a comparative analysis accompanied by calculations in accordance with the model solovjova 2016 2018a b solovjova et al 2018 calculations based on the dynamic model of the north caspian ecosystem major components annual progress section 3

arctic shelf is concerned data was used originating from generalized field observations of annual variations in phytoplankton biomass with highly productive fig 2 a and low productive fig 2b ecosystems flint 2010 2015 ilyash et al 2012 matishov et al 2006 the larger part of the arctic shelf with primary production of less than 50 mgs m2 per day belongs to ultra oligotrophic areas but in some local areas production is hundreds of times higher flint 2010 2015 ilyash et al 2012 on average the indicators are extremely low 8 mgs m3 per day and the range of variations in the values of primary production is up in the order of magnitude from 1 12 to 66 31 mgs m3 per day flint 2015 sukhanova et al 2009 bioproductivity in the edge arctic seas is extremely low and determines poorness in the biological resources in contrast to high productivity and diversity of biological resources in the southern seas as well as in the barents and bering seas in coastal highly productive ecosystems indicators of phytoplankton spring development reach its maximum with a biomass of 1 to 3 mg m3 barents sea fig 2a during the phytoplankton development spring phase in the low productive ecosystems of the arctic kara sea it reaches much lower values up to 1 5 mg m3 fig 2b at the same time the highly productive ecosystems of the arctic area possess at least two annual maximums in the biomass and abundance varieties fig 2a while the low productive ecosystems are characterized by a only one biomass maximum and abundance during a year fig 2b phytoplankton biomass values variability at the transarctic section about 6 thousand km long lies in the interval between 40 and 700 mg m3 and a chlorophyll within the surface layer from 0 04 to 2 32 mg m3 demidov et al 2014 flint 2010 ilyash et al 2012 expedition studies revealed the presence of a physical barrier i e strong desalination in the 5 12 m surface layer due to river runoff to the edge arctic seas from the kara sea to the chukchi sea flint 2010 the formed density stratification is so stable that it is not covered by vertical seasonal convection and therefore the photic layer is not enriched with biogenic elements involved in the photosynthesis process flint 2015 even contemporary climatic changes i e increase in the ice free period and warming of the water surface layer do not weaken the barrier connected to limiting photosynthesis by biogenic elements demidov et al 2014 2017 flint 2010 invasive processes characterizing several areas in the arctic shelf also make a significant contribution to the ecosystems particular functioning thus the chionoecetes opilio crab population density in the western part of the kara sea constituted 0 1 0 12 sp m2 or 951 1124 species per 1 ha flint 2010 adult nobilous forms predominate in the population which serves as an evidence of the reproducing population formation in the kara sea flint 2010 taking into account such features in the arctic marine ecosystems functioning would determine different levels of environmental risk and therefore different levels of the anthropogenic impact acceptability according to integrated observations data demidov et al 2014 2017 flint 2010 2015 ilyash et al 2012 sukhanova et al 2009 annual phytoplankton biomass variation characterizing high productive fig 2a and low productive fig 2b ecosystems was compiled these values were used as the n max nkp pam p am e m ν and e m ν input data in ecoscreening risk assessments section 4 3 4 calculation 4 1 space of stressors it is necessary to take into account the most adverse natural conditions and anthropogenic impacts in order to obtain the assessment of risk in the necessary direction from above let us take into consideration three classes of stressors 1 unfavorable natural conditions including the climatic for example for phytoplankton this means reduced illumination or decrease in the photosynthetically active radiation volume and biogenic substances low concentration 2 anthropogenic effects including a regular and normal emissions of the pollutants insignificant amounts for long time periods chronic stress b short term pollutants emissions in large quantities acute stress for an ecosystem during the technical systems accidental effects in the process of shelf resources development c imposition of short term high intensity impact on regular emissions 3 alien species invasion these three classes are located in the space of stressors fig 3 where along the x y and z axes respectively classes 1 3 stressors could be found positive axis corresponds to a stressor presence negative to its absence fig 3 clearly demonstrates possible combinations of the stressors different classes most dangerous situation for a marine ecological system occurs with a combination of natural adverse conditions anthropogenic influences and invasions darkened area in fig 3 the least dangerous ecological conditions correspond to the area of only the adverse natural conditions presence and the absence of anthropogenic effects and invasions fig 3 further calculations in the environmental risk assessment would be carried out step by step starting from the stressors least dangerous area to the most dangerous one fig 3 4 2 scenarios and numerical experiments with the north caspian shelf ecosystem model march 1 was chosen as the initial

as initial conditions such initial conditions as the calculation showed turned out to be close to those established in the model for the given annual period in accordance with the selected external

2004 2017 the system of ordinary differential eq 7 with high nonlinearity on the right hand side which describes the existing relationships between the main components of the northern caspian ecosystem was solved by the runge kutta method with second order accuracy and with a time increment of 2 h numerical experiments made it possible to reveal coefficients to which the model is the most sensitive the significant coefficients among them are the maximum rates of phytoplankton cell division the constant of luminance on the water body surface the index of vertical irradiance attenuation and the coefficient of mortality unrelated to predators solovjova 2016 2018a 2018b solovjova et al 2018 previous researches provide an opportunity to use the already conducted numerical experiments

into account only the adverse natural factors impact fig 3 in article solovjova 2016 while simulating the north caspian ecosystem state a series of numerical experiments were carried out with model

conditions fig 4 ecosystem functioning and structure remains the same therefore this kind of impact could be attributed to the e compensatory effect that preserves the ecosystem parameters within the framework of their values natural variation scenario 2 next scenario of numerical experiments consists in combining the reduced illumination unfavorable conditions and the photosynthesis low rates k10

2018a simulation results fig 5b solovjova 2018a solovjova et al 2018 show a strong decrease in phytoplankton biomass values at the spring peak as a consequence that means a decrease in zooplankton biomass and its factual transition to a stagnant mode this led to alteration in the entire ecosystem characteristic functioning and to the summer plankton maximum absence at the same time such conditions were not catastrophic for the ecosystem and by the second calculated year its functioning was restored in the absence of any anthropogenic impacts fig 5b ecological risk assessment will be calculated in section 4 3 under scenario 3 in regard to two types of ecosystems with different degrees of sensitivity scenarios 3a and 3b comparative analysis of numerical experiments with the field observations data solovjova et al 2018 shiganova et al 2003 2004 demonstrated not only the qualitative agreement but also the quantitative agreement up to the calculated values order of magnitude these preliminary model calculations were not intended to reflect a specific situation but only to show a possibility of applying the ecosystem model numerical calculation results to subsequent assessment of the ecological risk in order to calculate using the ecoscreening risk model section 4 3 we used results of the north caspian ecosystem phytoplankton u1 t and zooplankton u3 t u8 t biomass modeling calculation 4 3 ecological risk calculations q simulation was carried out for two ecosystems of different vulnerability degree highly productive northern caspian ecosystem shelf and low productive kara sea ecosystem some studies consider that low productive ecosystems are less vulnerable to anthropogenic impact than those highly productive ones but conclusions on the vulnerability degree and consequently on the ecosystems allowable impact could only be made taking into account the cumulative factors effect including temporary overlays of ecological and technological components therefore we were conducting risk calculations in regard to two contrasting ecosystems under the most unfavorable conditions scenario 3a north caspian sea and scenario 3b arctic shelf ecosystems in order to calculate the maximum allowable probability of anthropogenic impacts q value results obtained in numerical experiments with the northern caspian sea model section 4 2 and data originating from generalized observations in the low productive kara sea areas section 3 3 were used the yd values eq 6 are selected on the basis of data related to technogenic impact and ecological consequences generalized assessment demidov et al 2017 at the shelf oil resources development stages matishov et al 2006 patin 2017 according to these data the values interval for the allowable ecological risk probability in varying types and stages of technological activity ranges from 10 7 to 10 1 patin 2017 in essence these are probabilities of violating the state of a population in terms of the average biomass values variation beyond the violation threshold which constitutes 10 of deviation patin 2017 based on these data the yd 10 5 value was chosen for the q calculation the qk probability of impact on an ecosystem by technical systems in the course of work on the shelf embedded in the technological processes was chosen taking into account foreign gesamp 1993 and domestic matishov et al 2006 patin 2017 data the qk range deviations from 10 4 to 10 1 patin 2017 provided a rare event probability value of q1 10 3 average frequency event of q2 10 2 and frequently occurring event of q3 10 1 tables 1 and 2 two impact types could be distinguished in emergency situations that occur in the shelf oil development 1 short term pollutant emissions in large volumes acute stress for ecosystem and 2 regular standard emissions in small volumes over a long time period chronic stress besides it is possible to identify a third group of adverse impact combinations i e imposition of short term high intensity impacts on regular emissions using the above indicated conditions and data obtained in numerical experiments from eqs 1 6 estimated calculation of the q impact allowable probability on an ecosystem were conducted under the following scenarios scenario 3a for the north caspian ecosystem n max 7 103 mg m3 maximum and ncr 10 mg m3 critical biomass values were obtained in the simulation section 4 2 combination of natural adverse factors were taken into consideration together with anthropogenic impact of the following type one month technical system failure during the phytoplankton biomass spring peak in the pam tm t 1 12 eq 3 phyto and zooplankton biomass obtained in numerical experiments with a model designed for the normal and lowered photosynthesis rate cases were taken as the emv biomass average values section 4 2 data as well as ecological risk and allowable exposure calculation results are presented in table 1 analysis of the result obtained fig 6 showed that only at q1 10 3 rare ecosystem impact event and high phytoplankton biomass values 6 103 mg m3 table 1 calculation provides high values up to 0 9 characterizing human impact allowable probability of a specified type at low biomass values and rare anthropogenic impact the q allowable probability does not exceed 0 2 fig 6 table 1 and with more frequent technological emergency modes q2 10 2 and q3 10 1 allowable impact probability should not exceed units and fractions of a percent fig 6 ecological risk assessment results showed that the northern caspian ecosystem is characterized by natural seasons and anthropogenic impact scenarios that could reduce technological processes reliable support without prejudice to ecological safety in resources development thereby reducing costs and widening the applied technologies spectrum scenario 3b for the arctic seas low productive ecosystems with a single summer phytoplankton biomass maximum fig 2b allowable probability of a more prolonged impact was calculated over three calculated months pam tm t 1 4 using the same q1 q2 and q3 values emv average phytoplankton biomass values eq 4 used observations data flint 2015 2010 which indicated that primary production was less than 50 mgs m3 per day in the larger part of the arctic shelf average production 8 mgs m3 per day and the primary production value variation range was much higher from 1 12 to 66 31 mgs m3 per day flint 2015 phytoplankton biomass value variability appears in the range from 40 to 700 mg m3 and that of chlorophyll in the surface layer from 0 04 to 2 32 mg m3 flint 2015 ilyash et al 2012 sukhanova et al 2009 fig 2b the value of the n max 7 102 mg m3 maximum and ncr 10 mg m3 critical biomass values were taken from the observation section 3 3 initial data and calculation results are shown in table 2 results obtained demonstrated that the three months increase in the anthropogenic impact duration reduces the allowable probability of such a load by almost two times compared to scenario 1 for a low productive arctic ecosystem q 0 42 table 2 fig 7 this conclusion indicates that the vulnerability degree is not determined by an ecosystem productivity level but requires combined consideration of temporary ecological and technological factors 5 discussion the present paper did not set the goal of calculating risks to a specific ecosystem we proposed an ecological risk assessment tool which variations are difficult to account using the known ranking methods section 2 the proposed eero approach to ecological risk assessment modeling appears to be a new one compared to the existing methods section 2 imposing stressors dynamics on the natural ecosystem dynamics makes it possible to obtain intra year variations in risk values and consequently the allowable probability of anthropogenic impact section 3 1 such calculations take into account all significant stressors section 4 1 their modes and dynamics in mutual relations with the ecosystem seasonal dynamics in order to show mechanism and efficiency of the eero method numerical experiments were conducted with a dynamic model of the north caspian ecosystem under the stressors activity section 3 2 simulation results were used as input data for the ecoscreening risk assessment ecological risk was also estimated in regard to the contrasting ecosystem of the arctic shelf observations data in this case were used as the input for the ecoscreening risk model section 3 3 the space of stressors included unfavorable natural conditions anthropogenic and invasive impacts as far as anthropogenic impacts are concerned established and emergency modes of the technical facilities operation were taken into account when developing the shelf oil resources section 4 3 the results obtained section 4 3 demonstrated the eero method operability based on the synthesis of dynamic modeling and ecoscreening risk assessments at the same time our calculations led to nontrivial conclusions regarding risk assessment for ecosystems with varying degrees of sensitivity an assumption that low productive ecosystems are less vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts than highly productive ones was not confirmed calculation results showed that the vulnerability degree was not determined by an ecosystem productivity degree but required accumulated consideration of temporary ecological and technological factors section 4 3 possible prospects for the method further development are associated with combining the eero with the ranking methods or with the risk assessment matrix methods section 2 independent application of the proposed method is also rather relevant and efficient within the framework of the ecosystem oriented research concept combining natural and economic aspects the eero method would help to avoid errors of the 2nd kind and to minimize expenses the errors of the 1st and 2nd kind concept are taken from the statistical test theory in the practical use of risk assessment methods it is important to distinguish three ranges on the probability scale high risk probability low and intermediate range of acceptable risks which is normalized and regulated by the standards of different countries determining boundaries and criteria of the acceptable ecological risk in different countries and with different ways of developing marine resources is rather conditional and depends not only on environmental requirements but also on economic social and other restrictions a 1st kind error is falsely inferring the existence or reality of something that is in fact not real or does not in fact exist while a 2nd kind error is to falsely infer the absence or non existence of something that is real or does exist the analogy for environmental risk assessments is as follows let us accept as safe the state where risk probability values are insignificant a threshold value can be varied to make the test more restrictive or more sensitive with the more restrictive tests increasing the risk of rejecting true positives and the more sensitive tests increasing the risk of accepting false positives if there is a 1st kind error i e a safe situation is taken as a situation posing a threat to an ecosystem safety then the excessive over cautiousness associated with a false alarm is not that dangerous although resulting in unjustified expenses as the 2nd kind error when a dangerous situation is hidden by external well being when in fact a risk is present in the environmental and economic aspect the use of eero would help to minimize economic expenses in the development of shelf resources calculation of the intra annual ecological risk variations and the corresponding calculation of the anthropogenic impact allowable probability would make it possible to vary expenses on the ecological protection measures the volume of such measures would be determined by increasing or decreasing requirements to the acceptable anthropogenic load calculated in accordance with the model in the case of a minimum level of ecological risk the acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact can be increased to the maximum value in order to reduce the economic requirements on arrangements of environmental safety at this stage on the contrary at a maximum level of environmental risk the acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact has to be minimized however this will lead to additional costs thus redistribution of annual economic costs will be determined by correspondingly varying the probability of ecological risk to optimize the efficiency of financial investments efficient practical implementation of this approach requires a fairly complete database of field observations that include components and processes in ecosystems under study as well as preliminary series of numerical experiments with ecosystem models lowering the conditional risk assessment for the living organisms groups as the situation uncertainty decreases when carrying out necessary research and database updating leads to a refinement of the human impact allowable probability value the latter is directly connected to a decrease in the reliability requirements to equipment being operated and widens the range of using various technologies this creates conditions for reducing the cost of creating maintaining and operating technical systems thus ensuring safe development of the shelf ecosystems resources analysis of the anthropogenic impact consequences on the shelf ecosystems showed that under normal and accident free oil and gas facilities operation impact on an ecosystem is of moderate and reversible character not leading to structural and functional damages patin 2017 more significant consequences that bring ecosystem basic parameters functioning beyond the values natural variation limits are associated with processes of the alien species invasion and or with a long term and significant exposure to the abnormal operating conditions of technical systems ecological consequences manifestation during invasions differs significantly from those caused by direct anthropogenic impacts the invasive consequences start is not clearly expressed and is increasing gradually in contrast to the anthropogenic discharges that are rapidly manifested in fact only simulation could assist in identifying states close to losing the ecosystem stability in case of the adverse natural conditions combination in an ecosystem exposed to invasive impact in case of alien species migration into ecosystem allowable impact probability could be estimated only by preliminary simulations with an ecosystem model taking into account new trophic relationships in other words assessment of risk originating from invasions is possible only within the frames of the ecosystem model variable structure 6 conclusions intra annual eero ecological risk variations modeling based on the synthesis of dynamic and ecoscreening models is an effective tool for calculating the degree of acceptable anthropogenic impacts under the stressors cumulative effect preliminary ecological risk modeling in regard to ecosystems with varying degrees of vulnerability demonstrated efficiency of the proposed method the proposed approach possesses an important practical implication when developing the shelf resources and in particular in the arctic region calculations showed that the assumption of a lower degree of vulnerability in the arctic shelf low productive ecosystems is erroneous comparison of the calculated risk probability in the north caspian high productive ecosystem and the kara sea low productive ecosystem revealed that the vulnerability degree is not determined by the ecosystem productivity degree but requires joint consideration of temporary ecological and technological factors combined employment of various modeling methods for risk assessment opens possibility to pass to the risk management level and is relevant in coordinating ecological requirements and economic opportunities for solving problems of ecological safety relationship between the ecosystem allowable risk and the anthropogenic impact allowable probability objectifies importance of risk assessments under emergency situations and normal operating conditions of technical systems the main indicator provided by technical projects is the allowable accident probability or any other technogenic impact type which determines the project cost therefore improving the allowable risk assessment by an order of magnitude could reduce by the same order the cost of providing a reliable technical system support ecosystem allowable impact variations during a year would allow to reduce economic expenses on maintaining ecological safety in other words there is a possibility for optimal coordination of ecological and economic requirements which often in practice come into contradiction analyzing sufficient number of numerical experiments using the model under various impact combinations would allow to delineate risk areas and using the proposed method would allow to vary the ecological protection costs while maintaining the ecological requirements priority acknowledgements this paper was prepared as part of the state assignment no 0149 2019 0005 the author expresses

25030,this paper proposes a method for mathematical modeling and ecological risk assessment in marine ecosystems under the combined action of natural anthropogenic climatic and invasive factors the method is based on the combined use of dynamic models probabilistic eco screening risk assessments and observational data eero main advantage of the proposed approach in comparing with the already known methods lies in modeling the stressors effect on the ecosystem main components intra annual functioning mode this allows obtaining the ecological risk intra annual variations identifying the intra year intervals of increased danger and calculating the corresponding acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact risk simulation examples in regard to the temperate latitude regions northern caspian highly productive ecosystems and to the arctic area low productive ecosystems are provided results obtained brought to nontrivial conclusions on the ecosystems vulnerability and on the necessity to prioritize ecological risk calculation followed by assessment of the allowable exposure probability in the environmental and economic aspect the use of eero would help to minimize economic expenses in the development of shelf resources calculation of the intra annual ecological risk variations and the corresponding calculation of the anthropogenic impact allowable probability would make it possible to vary expenses on the ecological protection measures the volume of such measures would be determined by increasing or decreasing requirements to the acceptable anthropogenic load calculated in accordance with the model the paper substantiates the primacy nature of determining the acceptable ecological risk value and further the acceptable intensity of anthropogenic impact that opens a possibility to receive answers to questions on the basic acceptability of accidents of a certain scale the method is efficient in assessing the risk to ecosystems with varying degrees of vulnerability the proposed approach is important for practical coordination of ecological and economic requirements in safe development of shelf resources and in costs minimizing keywords mathematical modeling ecological risk ecosystem vulnerability 1 introduction requirement to assess the ecological risk simulation is due to reorientation in the ecological safety from the absolute safety concept to the allowable risk concept or combination thereof in case we are required to assess the ecological risk to marine ecosystems it is necessary to take into account not only the set of different genesis stressors their cumulative effect and impact modes but also to combine these factors with the dynamics of ecological systems functioning at the same time ecosystems themselves are within the continuous dynamics of functioning which is a characteristic feature for each of them and could possess a varying degree of vulnerability stressors action is being imposed upon the dynamics of the ecosystems natural functioning intra annual variations in the marine ecosystems main components in the stressors action context is causing variations in the degree of danger and consequently in the ecological risk annual variations the method proposed allows considering the combined stressors of different nature action on the marine ecosystems natural functioning process identifying the intervals of increased ecological risk in the course of modeling and calculating the acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact based on probabilistic models the method eero is based on the synthesis of the known dynamic ecosystem approach eco screening risk assessments and the use of observation data at the same time calculations using eero help to obtain non trivial conclusions on the acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact on ecosystems with varying degrees of vulnerability the need to develop ecological risk modeling methods for ecosystems with varying degree of vulnerability is based on the fact that the very degree of vulnerability is identified after causing practical damage to ecosystems it is hardly possible to recognize the trial and error method effective in the development of resources under such different geographic climatic biological hydrophysical and other conditions appearing on the arctic baltic caspian black seas and far east seas shelves ecosystem effects of the marine areas mineral hydrocarbon and biological resources development depend not only on the intensity of anthropogenic impact high productive and low productive ecosystems have different degrees of sensitivity and vulnerability under the cumulative effect of the factors different genesis thus the arctic shelf ecosystems are more vulnerable because of the low degree of biodiversity and lower temperatures affecting the pollutants decomposition rate such ecosystems response to external factors including climatic changes negative natural conditions anthropogenic and invasive effects would be different from the temperate latitudes ecosystems it is of special importance for the shelf marine ecosystems of varying sensitivity not only to obtain a forecast of their state but also to assess risks under probable scenarios of the external factors combination another eero method development direction lies in harmonization of ecological and economic requirements accompanied by minimization of the financial expenses combined achievement of ecological safety and minimization of expenses for these safety causes are arising significant difficulties this could be explained not only by contradictions between the tasks of ecology and economics but also by the established practice of independent approaches in each of these areas without taking into account holistic reflection of a real object under study in the technocratic practice adoption of business decisions is primarily oriented towards economic indicators in the absence of due ecological factor consideration primacy in determining the allowable ecological risk value and on its basis the allowable anthropogenic impact intensity in the risk simulation method eero would allow to coordinate ecological and economic requirements accompanied by probable safety expenses minimization in other words there is no requirement to permanently maintain a constant level of financing economic measures to ensure the ecological safety fleishman 1995 solovjova 1999 a more rational approach could be in coordinating the risk variation course and expenses required to prevent it it is clear that admissibility of anthropogenic impact should be considered within the framework of an allowable risk where complete risk elimination is either practically impossible or economically unjustified within the process of implementing large scale projects in the marine resources development for example oil and gas fields development errors in risk assessment could lead to serious ecologic and economic losses thus risk value overestimation for example when accepting the incredibly high probability of an accident could lead to spending non required large financial resources to prevent consequences which probability is insignificant patin 2004 at the same time risk assessment underestimation dangerous situation is concealed by external well being could lead to disastrous consequences patin 2017 the most important issue in obtaining risk assessments is the primacy of determining the allowable risk magnitude for ecological systems and not vice versa determining the anthropogenic impact allowable intensity fleishman 1995 this makes it possible to take into account specifics of the ecological safety tasks consisting in the asymmetry of requirements regarding elimination of 1st and 2nd kind errores if there is a 1st kind error i e a safe situation is taken as a situation posing a threat to an ecosystem safety then the excessive overcautiousness associated with a false alarm is not that dangerous although resulting in unjustified expenses as the 2nd kind error when a dangerous situation is hidden by external well being it is rather difficult to derive any regularity in the consequences of the entire variety of the human business activities scenarios in regard to ecosystems of different sensitivity at the same time it is still necessary to quantitatively assess the allowable level of anthropogenic impact on the environment taking into account the climatic response allowable impact probability on a shelf ecosystem implies preservation of the natural system its trophic structure functioning and components composition sustainability at the same time the area of dynamic systems sustainability which could include an ecosystem is not statically fixed but covers alterations within the limits of its basic parameters variations the very magnitude of an ecosystem critical state if formalization thereof is possible would not be permanent it nonlinearly depends on external natural conditions anthropogenic impact and ecosystem system itself at the current and previous points of time 2 study area substantiation on the risk assessment development method prospective is associated with overcoming the limitations in regard to the stressors nature diversity and their cumulative effect on marine ecosystems and with diversity of the ecosystem response to react to the external influences chen et al 2011 2013 van den brink et al 2016 the environmental protection agency framework proposed an integrated framework that covered both human health and ecological risk assessment era quantitative ecological risk assessment era methods are the tools for natural resource management chen et al 2006 dale et al 2008 environmental risk assessment includes the effects of chemical and non chemical stresses on various levels of biological organization and spatial scale ecological risk assessments era of marine systems are often

the potential of becoming quantitative tools of management decision if it integrated with economy chen et al 2011 rrm was used to analyze the pacific herring reduction causes and risks landis et al

risk assessment of river ecosystems after dam construction chen et al 2010 for establishing reference domain in functional assessment of an estuary christian et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2015 different approaches to assessing the risk originating from individual stressors are based both on quantitative methods and on ranking the stressors on risk level indexation mapping and preparation of risk matrices network utility matrices expert estimates and semi quantitative methods within this process stochastic monte carlo methods for example in the aquatic ecosystems toxicological risks assessment qu et al 2016 as well as the category estimation indexing methods bayesian estimates herring et al 2015 jons et al 2017 techniques from linear algebra are used ecological risk methodology assessment is most actively developed in regard to oil spill accidents kraly et al 2001 linkov and clark 2003 ly et al 2004 patin 2004 aurand et al 2005 stevens et al 2005 the risk in this case is defined as the result of an emergency situation probability and the severity of its consequences patin 2004 based on these estimates risk ranking matrices are compiled dixon and rath 1999 chen et al 2013 and they are used for a comprehensive risk analysis and danger prevention dragsund et al 2004 motroen and wentworth 2004 ly et al 2004 one of the well known approaches to risk assessment is construction of environmental risk matrices that reflect probability of a dangerous event and severity of possible consequences taking into consideration the known technologies in the shelf oil and gas production facilities patin 2017 using such matrices makes it possible to estimate the extent of damage to the shelf natural resources and the recovery time after a dangerous event for example oil spill drilling mud discharge etc this method takes into account the space time range of processes affecting the risk however dynamics of namely the ecological risk within the limits of basic ecosystem parameters variation remains unidentified the latter gains importance with combined action of climatic natural adverse factors and anthropogenic impact based on the precautionary principles patin 2004 2017 special attention should be paid to a combined action of the most unfavorable conditions impact on an ecosystem and to predicting consequences of cumulative effect thereof ecological risk assessment of anthropogenic and natural factors favorable and unfavorable consequences on ecosystems of varying vulnerability operation requires application of all available methods field and laboratory studies expert systems matrix analysis risk assessment methods etc including mathematical modelling the latter becomes especially important if within the spectrum all impacts and invasive processes are taken into account which consequences are manifested differently than anthropogenic consequences haak et al 2017 and quite often lead to restructuring the ecosystem as well as to significant economic and financial losses unfortunately a wide range of methods and efforts undertaken to create an effective tool for assessing the environmental risk prove to be in insignificant demand due to very general recommendations the models are restricted to instant cause effect computation of single factors and often ignore the systems effects therefore fail to implement a holistic assessment at an ecosystem scale chen et al 2011 ecological risk assessment has found relatively few applications outside that of managing chemicals landis 2009 this is in spite of its intrinsic cause effect modeling and its applicability to the management of invasive species aquaculture watersheds use change analysis of various approaches to ecological risk assessment demonstrates that in order to increase efficiency and methods demand the most preferable way is the synthesis of various approaches the assessing ecological risk by using system based models at different levels of organization in a combined way is an evolutionary step for the application of risk evaluation in environmental management chen et al 2013 however it is clear that it is not sufficient to consider only the stressors cumulative effect under the static ecosystem conditions it is necessary to combine the stressors dynamics with the ecosystem functioning dynamics this could be done by synthesizing dynamic models of ecosystems state with eco screening models of the probabilistic risk assessments under the stressors cumulative effect which is actually proposed in the present paper 3 materials and methods this paper suggests using the synthesis of ecosystem simulation belyaev 1984 belyaev and konduforova solovjova 1990 and ecoscreening risk assessments fleishman 1982 solovjova 1999 to evaluate the risk of marine ecosystems with varying vulnerability degrees the proposed approach makes it possible to move from a fixed shelf resources value introduced in project which ensures allowable impact on an ecosystem due to its variations during the year such alterations would be determined by the ecological risk variations for the ecosystems with varying vulnerability levels the proposed method scheme of matching the allowable anthropogenic impact and ecological risks is presented in fig 1 method structure involves the following sequence of actions ecoscreening risk assessments section 3 1 are calculated on the basis of field observations section 5 and ecosystem modeling sections 3 and 4 the risk assessment model input data are compiled based on the data from the biomass field observations of organisms shiganova et al 2003 2004 matishov et al 2006 sukhanova et al 2009 ilyash et al 2012 flint 2010 2015 demidov et al 2014 2017 or the results of simulating an ecosystem state using dynamic models

populations that are used as the input data to calculate the ecological risk probability which values are also undergoing alterations over the course of a year the ecological risk probability values allow to estimate probabilities of the allowable anthropogenic load on ecosystem and to coordinate ecological and economic requirements fig 1 3 1 risk modeling based on ecoscreening approach ecosystem and ecoscreening simulation synthesis method eero uses the concept of ecological risk as a probability of an individual or the organisms population death the intra annual risk variability model is based on the following in real conditions the number of individuals constituting a population is changing regularly throughout a year under the influence of natural factors i e changes in solar radiation nutrient substances amount internal relationships between components etc these changes could be obtained as a result of in situ measurements section 3 3 or ecosystem model numerical simulation section 3 2 moreover to assess the risk in the right direction from above fleishman 1982 it is necessary to take into account the most unfavorable natural conditions precautionary principle patin 2017 simulations using the ecosystem aggregated components model reflect the biomass quantity population natural peak and declines section 3 2 population quantity peak and decline periods do not coincide with the calendar seasons maximum numbers for each nmax m peak and nmax m decline at m 1 m and m are the numbers of peak declined periods during a year besides the average values obtained at

generalized observation data were used demidov et al 2014 2017 flint 2010 2015 ilyash et al 2012 matishov et al 2006 sukhanova et al 2009 the ecosystem of the northern caspian is highly productive observations in 2002 2010 and subsequent years revealed a wide range of quantitative indices of the spring development of phytoplankton in the northern caspian area according to the results of observations in august 2002 shiganova et al 2004 the total biomass of phytoplankton cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae varied from 79 9 to 280 7 30 7 to 208 2 6 2 to 46 and 0 33 to 52 4 mg m3 respectively the average biomass for the entire region was 180 73 mg m3 and the average abundance was 195 590 114 070 cells l which is characteristic of the lower limit of mesotrophic waters shiganova et al 2004 however the real biomass and abundance of phytoplankton was probably 20 to 30 higher owing to unaccounted fractions picoplankton 2 μm and small phytoflagellates 4 8 μm the invasion of ctenophore consuming zooplankton reduced the pressure on phytoplankton the quantitative indices of which have increased over the past decade shiganova et al 2004 the end of biological spring is observed in june which is due to changes in the species composition of phytoplankton in this period the total observed biomass decreases to 1 2 2 g m3 ivanov and sokolsky 2000 the decrease in temperature characteristic of autumn leads to a decrease in phytoplankton biomass according to long term data of field observations by 1 2 g m3 to 2 3 g m3 ivanov and sokolsky 2000 shiganova et al 2004 the observed autumn maximum of phytoplankton biomass is 2 3 times lower than the summer maximum the seasonal growth in zooplankton biomass lags behind the seasonal peak of phytoplankton biomass which reflects the trophic relationship between these components according to observations the quantitative characteristics of zooplankton development varied in a wide range of values in 2005 to 2010 the average zooplankton abundance in summer varied from 110 000 to 800 000 spec m3 and the biomass varied from 900 to 6000 mg m3 these indices were generally lower in autumn than in summer being 45

which indicates its grazing by ctenophore shiganova et al 2004 the maxima of the ctenophore biomass lag behind the peak values of zooplankton biomass observations showed two such maxima the summer maximum and autumn maximum which correspond to the intense development of ctenophore in the northern caspian ghabooli et al 2010 observations data were used in a comparative analysis accompanied by

arctic shelf is concerned data was used originating from generalized field observations of annual variations in phytoplankton biomass with highly productive fig 2 a and low productive fig 2b ecosystems flint 2010 2015 ilyash et al 2012 matishov et al 2006 the larger part of the arctic shelf with primary production of less than 50 mgs m2 per day belongs to ultra oligotrophic areas but in some local areas production is hundreds of times higher flint 2010 2015 ilyash et al 2012 on average the indicators are extremely low 8 mgs m3 per day and the range of variations in the values of primary production is up in the order of magnitude from 1 12 to 66 31 mgs m3 per day flint 2015 sukhanova et al 2009 bioproductivity in the edge arctic seas is extremely low and determines poorness in the biological resources in contrast to high productivity and diversity of biological resources in the southern seas as well as in the barents and bering seas in coastal highly productive ecosystems indicators of phytoplankton spring development reach its maximum with a biomass of 1 to 3 mg m3 barents sea fig 2a during the phytoplankton development spring phase in the low productive ecosystems of the arctic kara sea it reaches much lower values up to 1 5 mg m3 fig 2b at the same time the highly productive ecosystems of the arctic area possess at least two annual maximums in the biomass and abundance varieties fig 2a while the low productive ecosystems are characterized by a only one biomass maximum and abundance during a year fig 2b phytoplankton biomass values variability at the transarctic section about 6 thousand km long lies in the interval between 40 and 700 mg m3 and a chlorophyll within the surface layer from 0 04 to 2 32 mg m3 demidov et al 2014 flint 2010 ilyash et al 2012 expedition studies revealed the presence of a physical barrier i e strong desalination in the 5 12 m surface layer due to river runoff to the edge arctic seas from the kara sea to the chukchi sea flint 2010 the formed density stratification is so stable that it is not covered by vertical seasonal convection and therefore the photic layer is not enriched with biogenic elements involved in the photosynthesis process flint 2015 even contemporary climatic changes i e increase in the ice free period and warming of the water surface layer do not weaken the barrier connected to limiting photosynthesis by biogenic elements demidov et al 2014 2017 flint 2010 invasive processes characterizing several areas in the arctic shelf also make a significant contribution to the ecosystems particular functioning thus the chionoecetes opilio crab population density in the western part of the kara sea constituted 0 1 0 12 sp m2 or 951 1124 species per 1 ha flint 2010 adult nobilous forms predominate in the population which serves as an evidence of the reproducing population formation in the kara sea flint 2010 taking into account such features in the arctic marine ecosystems functioning would determine different levels of environmental risk and therefore different levels of the anthropogenic impact acceptability according to integrated observations data demidov et al 2014 2017 flint 2010 2015 ilyash et al 2012 sukhanova et al 2009 annual phytoplankton biomass variation characterizing high productive fig 2a and low productive fig 2b ecosystems was compiled these values were used as the n max nkp pam p am e m ν and e m ν input data in ecoscreening risk assessments section 4 3 4 calculation 4 1 space of stressors it is necessary to take into account the most adverse natural conditions and anthropogenic impacts in order to obtain the assessment of risk in the necessary direction from above let us take into consideration three classes of stressors 1 unfavorable natural conditions including the climatic for example for phytoplankton this means reduced illumination or decrease in the photosynthetically active radiation volume and biogenic substances low concentration 2 anthropogenic effects including a regular and normal emissions of the pollutants insignificant amounts for long time periods chronic stress b short term pollutants emissions in large quantities acute stress for an ecosystem during the technical systems accidental effects in the process of shelf resources development c imposition of short term high intensity impact on regular emissions 3 alien species invasion these three classes are located in the space of stressors fig 3 where along the x y and z axes respectively classes 1 3 stressors could be found positive axis corresponds to a stressor presence negative to its absence fig 3 clearly demonstrates possible combinations of the stressors different classes most dangerous situation for a marine ecological system occurs with a combination of natural adverse conditions anthropogenic influences and invasions darkened area in fig 3 the least dangerous ecological conditions correspond to the area of only the adverse natural conditions presence and the absence of anthropogenic effects and invasions fig 3 further calculations in the environmental risk assessment would be carried out step by step starting from the stressors least dangerous area to the most dangerous one fig 3 4 2 scenarios and numerical experiments with the north caspian shelf ecosystem model march 1 was chosen as the initial calculations date during this period most of the ecosystem components are of less importance compared to their subsequent values u1 20 u2 1000 u3 20 u4 50 u5 10 u6 800 u7 20 and u8 10 mg m3 were taken as initial conditions such initial conditions as the calculation showed turned out to be close to those established in the model for the given annual period in accordance with the selected external factors values the constants of the model are given in belyaev and konduforova solovjova 1990 shiganova et al 2003 2004 ivanov and sokolsky 2000 solovjova 1999 2016 2018b solovjova et al 2018 patin 2004 2017 the system of ordinary differential eq 7 with high nonlinearity on the right hand side which describes the existing relationships between the main components of the northern caspian ecosystem was solved by the runge kutta method with second order accuracy and with a time increment of 2 h numerical experiments made it possible to reveal coefficients to which the model is the most sensitive the significant coefficients among them are the maximum rates of phytoplankton cell division the constant of luminance on the water body surface the index of vertical irradiance attenuation and the coefficient of mortality unrelated to predators solovjova 2016 2018a 2018b solovjova et al 2018 previous researches provide an opportunity to use the already conducted numerical experiments with the model under the combined action of the north caspian ecosystem adverse natural anthropogenic and invasive factors solovjova 1999 2016 2018b solovjova et al 2018 scenario 1 first let us take into account only the adverse natural factors impact fig 3 in article solovjova 2016 while simulating the north caspian ecosystem state a series of numerical experiments were carried out with model solovjova 1999 at different photosynthetically active radiation intensity affecting the phytoplankton photosynthesis rate fig 4 demonstrates results of phytoplankton a zooplankton b and nitrates c phosphates d and suspended and dissolved organic matter e biomass and concentration calculation under the lack of light according to ivanov and sokolsky 2000 and phytoplankton photosynthesis rate insufficiency photosynthesis rate constant values from a range k10 3 5 и k10 3 solovjova 2016 calculations result shows a quantitative decrease in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass under adverse conditions fig 4 ecosystem functioning and structure remains the same therefore this kind of impact could be attributed to the e compensatory effect that preserves the ecosystem parameters within the framework of their values natural variation scenario 2 next scenario of numerical experiments consists in combining the reduced illumination unfavorable conditions and the photosynthesis low rates k10

biomass values while preserving the overall ecosystem structural and functional properties fig 5a solovjova 2018a solovjova et al 2018 scenario 3 numerical experiments scenario when applying it to the previous adverse conditions and the anthropogenic impact i e pollutants emergency discharge at the spring phytoplankton outbreak increasing its mortality by two times was realized in paper solovjova 2018a simulation results fig 5b solovjova 2018a solovjova et al 2018 show a strong decrease in phytoplankton biomass values at the spring peak as a consequence that means a decrease in zooplankton biomass and its factual transition to a stagnant mode this led to alteration in the entire ecosystem characteristic functioning and to the summer plankton maximum absence at the same time such conditions were not catastrophic for the ecosystem and by the second calculated year its functioning was restored in the absence of any anthropogenic impacts fig 5b ecological risk assessment will be calculated in section 4 3 under scenario 3 in regard to two types of ecosystems with different degrees of sensitivity scenarios 3a and 3b comparative analysis of numerical experiments with the field observations data solovjova et al 2018 shiganova et al 2003 2004 demonstrated not only the qualitative agreement but also the quantitative agreement up to the calculated values order of magnitude these preliminary model calculations were not intended to reflect a specific situation but only to show a possibility of applying the ecosystem model numerical calculation results to subsequent assessment of the ecological risk in order to calculate using the ecoscreening risk model section 4 3 we used results of the north caspian ecosystem phytoplankton u1 t and zooplankton u3 t u8 t biomass modeling calculation 4 3 ecological risk calculations q simulation was carried out for two ecosystems of different vulnerability degree highly productive northern caspian ecosystem shelf and low productive kara sea ecosystem some studies consider that low productive ecosystems are less vulnerable to anthropogenic impact than those highly productive ones but conclusions on the vulnerability degree and consequently on the ecosystems allowable impact could only be made taking into account the cumulative factors effect including temporary overlays of ecological and technological components therefore we were conducting risk calculations in regard to two contrasting ecosystems under the most unfavorable conditions scenario 3a north caspian sea and scenario 3b arctic shelf ecosystems in order to calculate the maximum allowable probability of anthropogenic impacts q value results obtained in numerical experiments with the northern caspian sea model section 4 2 and data originating from generalized observations in the low productive kara sea areas section 3 3 were used the yd values eq 6 are selected on the basis of data related to technogenic impact and ecological consequences generalized assessment demidov et al 2017 at the shelf oil resources development stages matishov et al 2006 patin 2017 according to these data the values interval for the allowable ecological risk probability in varying types and stages of technological activity ranges from 10 7 to 10 1 patin 2017 in essence these are probabilities of violating the state of a population in terms of the average biomass values variation beyond the violation threshold which constitutes 10 of deviation patin 2017 based on these data the yd 10 5 value was chosen for the q calculation the qk probability of impact on an ecosystem by technical systems in the course of work on the shelf embedded in the technological processes was chosen taking into account foreign gesamp 1993 and domestic matishov et al 2006 patin 2017 data the qk range deviations from 10 4 to 10 1 patin 2017 provided a rare event probability value of q1 10 3 average frequency event of q2 10 2 and frequently occurring event of q3 10 1 tables 1 and 2 two impact types could be distinguished in emergency situations that occur in the shelf oil development 1 short term pollutant emissions in large volumes acute stress for ecosystem and 2 regular standard emissions in small volumes over a long time period chronic stress besides it is possible to identify a third group of adverse impact combinations i e imposition of short term high intensity impacts on regular emissions using the above indicated conditions and data obtained in numerical experiments from eqs 1 6 estimated calculation of the q impact allowable probability on an ecosystem were conducted under the following scenarios scenario 3a for the north caspian ecosystem n max 7 103 mg m3 maximum and ncr 10 mg m3 critical biomass values were obtained in the simulation section 4 2 combination of natural adverse factors were taken into consideration together with anthropogenic impact of the following type one month technical system failure during the phytoplankton biomass spring peak in the pam tm t 1 12 eq 3 phyto and zooplankton biomass obtained in numerical experiments with a model designed for the normal and lowered photosynthesis rate cases were taken as the emv biomass average values section 4 2 data as well as ecological risk and allowable exposure calculation results are presented in table 1 analysis of the result obtained fig 6 showed that only at q1 10 3 rare ecosystem impact event and high phytoplankton biomass values 6 103 mg m3 table 1 calculation provides high values up to 0 9 characterizing human impact allowable probability of a specified type at low biomass values and rare anthropogenic impact the q allowable probability does not exceed 0 2 fig 6 table 1 and with more frequent technological emergency modes q2 10 2 and q3 10 1 allowable impact probability should not exceed units and fractions of a percent fig 6 ecological risk assessment results showed that the northern caspian ecosystem is characterized by natural seasons and anthropogenic impact scenarios that could reduce technological processes reliable support without prejudice to ecological safety in resources development thereby reducing costs and widening the applied technologies spectrum scenario 3b for the arctic seas low productive ecosystems with a single summer phytoplankton biomass maximum fig 2b allowable probability of a more prolonged impact was calculated over three calculated months pam tm t 1 4 using the same q1 q2 and q3 values emv average phytoplankton biomass values eq 4 used observations data flint 2015 2010 which indicated that primary production was less than 50 mgs m3 per day in the larger part of the arctic shelf average production 8 mgs m3 per day and the primary production value variation range was much higher from 1 12 to 66 31 mgs m3 per day flint 2015 phytoplankton biomass value variability appears in the range from 40 to 700 mg m3 and that of chlorophyll in the surface layer from 0 04 to 2 32 mg m3 flint 2015 ilyash et al 2012 sukhanova et al 2009 fig 2b the value of the n max 7 102 mg m3 maximum and ncr 10 mg m3 critical biomass values were taken from the observation section 3 3 initial data and calculation results are shown in table 2 results obtained demonstrated that the three months increase in the anthropogenic impact duration reduces the allowable probability of such a load by almost two times compared to scenario 1 for a low productive arctic ecosystem q 0 42 table 2 fig 7 this conclusion indicates that the vulnerability degree is not determined by an ecosystem productivity level but requires combined consideration of temporary ecological and technological factors 5 discussion the present paper did not set the goal of calculating risks to a specific ecosystem we proposed an ecological risk assessment tool which variations are difficult to account using the known ranking methods section 2 the proposed eero approach to ecological risk assessment modeling appears to be a new one compared to the existing methods section 2 imposing stressors dynamics on the natural ecosystem dynamics makes it possible to obtain intra year variations in risk values and consequently the allowable probability of anthropogenic impact section 3 1 such calculations take into account all significant stressors section 4 1 their modes and dynamics in mutual relations with the ecosystem seasonal dynamics in order to show mechanism and efficiency of the eero method numerical experiments were conducted with a dynamic model of the north caspian ecosystem under the stressors activity section 3 2 simulation results were used as input data for the ecoscreening risk assessment ecological risk was also estimated in regard to the contrasting ecosystem of the arctic shelf observations data in this case were used as the input for the ecoscreening risk model section 3 3 the space of stressors included unfavorable natural conditions anthropogenic and invasive impacts as far as anthropogenic impacts are concerned established and emergency modes of the technical facilities operation were taken into account when developing the shelf oil resources section 4 3 the results obtained section 4 3 demonstrated the eero method operability based on the synthesis of dynamic modeling and ecoscreening risk assessments at the same time our calculations led to nontrivial conclusions regarding risk assessment for ecosystems with varying degrees of sensitivity an assumption that low productive ecosystems are less vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts than highly productive ones was not confirmed calculation results showed that the vulnerability degree was not determined by an ecosystem productivity degree but required accumulated consideration of temporary ecological and technological factors section 4 3 possible prospects for the method further development are associated with combining the eero with the ranking methods or with the risk assessment matrix methods section 2 independent application of the proposed method is also rather relevant and efficient within the framework of the ecosystem oriented research concept combining natural and economic aspects the eero method would help to avoid errors of the 2nd kind and to minimize expenses the errors of the 1st and 2nd kind concept are taken from the statistical test theory in the practical use of risk assessment methods it is important to distinguish three ranges on the probability scale high risk probability low and intermediate range of acceptable risks which is normalized and regulated by the standards of different countries determining boundaries and criteria of the acceptable ecological risk in different countries and with different ways of developing marine resources is rather conditional and depends not only on environmental requirements but also on economic social and other restrictions a 1st kind error is falsely inferring the existence or reality of something that is in fact not real or does not in fact exist while a 2nd kind error is to falsely infer the absence or non existence of something that is real or does exist the analogy for environmental risk assessments is as follows let us accept as safe the state where risk probability values are insignificant a threshold value can be varied to make the test more restrictive or more sensitive with the more restrictive tests increasing the risk of rejecting true positives and the more sensitive tests increasing the risk of accepting false positives if there is a 1st kind error i e a safe situation is taken as a situation posing a threat to an ecosystem safety then the excessive over cautiousness associated with a false alarm is not that dangerous although resulting in unjustified expenses as the 2nd kind error when a dangerous situation is hidden by external well being when in fact a risk is present in the environmental and economic aspect the use of eero would help to minimize economic expenses in the development of shelf resources calculation of the intra annual ecological risk variations and the corresponding calculation of the anthropogenic impact allowable probability would make it possible to vary expenses on the ecological protection measures the volume of such measures would be determined by increasing or decreasing requirements to the acceptable anthropogenic load calculated in accordance with the model in the case of a minimum level of ecological risk the acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact can be increased to the maximum value in order to reduce the economic requirements on arrangements of environmental safety at this stage on the contrary at a maximum level of environmental risk the acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact has to be minimized however this will lead to additional costs thus redistribution of annual economic costs will be determined by correspondingly varying the probability of ecological risk to optimize the efficiency of financial investments efficient practical implementation of this approach requires a fairly complete database of field observations that include components and processes in ecosystems under study as well as preliminary series of numerical experiments with ecosystem models lowering the conditional risk assessment for the living organisms groups as the situation uncertainty decreases when carrying out necessary research and database updating leads to a refinement of the human impact allowable probability value the latter is directly connected to a decrease in the reliability requirements to equipment being operated and widens the range of using various technologies this creates conditions for reducing the cost of creating maintaining and operating technical systems thus ensuring safe development of the shelf ecosystems resources analysis of the anthropogenic impact consequences on the shelf ecosystems showed that under normal and accident free oil and gas facilities operation impact on an ecosystem is of moderate and reversible character not leading to structural and functional damages patin 2017 more significant consequences that bring ecosystem basic parameters functioning beyond the values natural variation limits are associated with processes of the alien species invasion and or with a long term and significant exposure to the abnormal operating conditions of technical systems ecological consequences manifestation during invasions differs significantly from those caused by direct anthropogenic impacts the invasive consequences start is not clearly expressed and is increasing gradually in contrast to the anthropogenic discharges that are rapidly manifested in fact only simulation could assist in identifying states close to losing the ecosystem stability in case of the adverse natural conditions combination in an ecosystem exposed to invasive impact in case of alien species migration into ecosystem allowable impact probability could be estimated only by preliminary simulations with an ecosystem model taking into account new trophic relationships in other words assessment of risk originating from invasions is possible only within the frames of the ecosystem model variable structure 6 conclusions intra annual eero ecological risk variations modeling based on the synthesis of dynamic and ecoscreening models is an effective tool for calculating the degree of acceptable anthropogenic impacts under the stressors cumulative effect preliminary ecological risk modeling in regard to ecosystems with varying degrees of vulnerability demonstrated efficiency of the proposed method the proposed approach possesses an important practical implication when developing the shelf resources and in particular in the arctic region calculations showed that the assumption of a lower degree of vulnerability in the arctic shelf low productive ecosystems is erroneous comparison of the calculated risk probability in the north caspian high productive ecosystem and the kara sea low productive ecosystem revealed that the vulnerability degree is not determined by the ecosystem productivity degree but requires joint consideration of temporary ecological and technological factors combined employment of various modeling methods for risk assessment opens possibility to pass to the risk management level and is relevant in coordinating ecological requirements and economic opportunities for solving problems of ecological safety relationship between the ecosystem allowable risk and the anthropogenic impact allowable probability objectifies importance of risk assessments under emergency situations and normal operating conditions of technical systems the main indicator provided by technical projects is the allowable accident probability or any other technogenic impact type which determines the project cost therefore improving the allowable risk assessment by an order of magnitude could reduce by the same order the cost of providing a reliable technical system support ecosystem allowable impact variations during a year would allow to reduce economic expenses on maintaining ecological safety in other words there is a possibility for optimal coordination of ecological and economic requirements which often in practice come into contradiction analyzing sufficient number of numerical experiments using the model under various impact combinations would allow to delineate risk areas and using the proposed method would allow to vary the ecological protection costs while maintaining the ecological requirements priority acknowledgements this paper was prepared as part of the state assignment no 0149 2019 0005 the author expresses

25031,to support pest management innovation in international trade a model is provided to calculate the efficacy of potential combinations of phytosanitary measures each of which has an uncertain effect the efficacy of each measure was considered in terms of residual infestation or infestation remaining proportion following implementation of the measure the cumulative result is the product of that for the individual measures described by an interval of the base variable the proportion of infested units in the export lot of a commodity the residual infestation associated with the measures was described by linguistic terms negligible to very high also corresponding to intervals in the base variable calculated using three principles 1 a consistent efficacy ratio across linguistic terms so very low has the same relationship to negligible as low to very low and so on 2 a definition of negligible based on pest detection probability and 3 the anchoring of medium to 50 efficacy the intervals may overlap depending on their perceived uncertainty the cumulative result of all measures implemented has some level of overlap with one or more linguistic terms and this indicates the extent to which the result fits concepts like negligible very low low etc with reference to a published trade case analysis of thrips palmi control on thai orchid exports the degree of overlap of suggested management alternatives with the concept of negligible infestation was calculated illustrating how the support can be provided for judgements made by risk managers when giving opinions about the potential effectiveness of phytosanitary measures keywords systems approach pest management quantitative model international trade risk reduction 1 introduction recent approaches to quantification in pest risk analysis pra have frequently focussed on probabilistic methods and monte carlo simulation efsa et al 2018 holt et al 2016 douma et al 2015 this is only one of several general approaches to quantitative risk assessment wilcox and ayyub 2003 ferson et al 1997 and in other fields of applied research fuzzy sets zadeh 1965 have been used to quantify uncertainty and for information poor risk analysis problems can have advantages over probabilistic methods particularly in dealing with uncertainty of information as opposed to parameter variability arunraj et al 2013 fuzzy set theory was introduced by zadeh 1965 1978 for treating vague concepts in a mathematical sense one reason for the increased interest in quantitative approaches to pra stems from concern over the vagueness of the terms used in pra schemes to describe the level of a risk factor e g low medium an expressed objective efsa et al 2018 was to minimise the use of ambiguous expressions of risk and to better inform risk management decisions by treating the expressions of risk as linguistic variables zadeh 1975 they are described as a mathematical function of the underlying variable without the need to estimate event probabilities fuzzy sets have been used for related questions but not in a general approach to pra gevrey et al 2006 used fuzzy sets to interpret results from self organising maps to make predictions about invasive species establishment in pest climate modelling scherm 2000 compared a range of possible outcomes with a best estimate a type of uncertainty that was simulated by expressing climate change as a range of possible values a similar approach was used here in which fuzzy numbers were expressed as intervals and their manipulation carried out by interval arithmetic as described in wilcox and ayyub 2003 if a variable such as the proportion of units of a consignment of flowers infested by a pest is represented on a linguistic scale negligible very low low moderate high very high then the sum of the probabilities of these six states naturally sum to one if instead we treat these terms as linguistic variables sensu zadeh 1975 then they are conceptually quite different and we can say that each of these terms has some level of compatibility with the proportion of units infested so for example a proportion of 0 0001 may have some compatibility with the concept of low but also with the concept of very low a linguistic variable is some function of the underlying or base variable to which it relates and accordingly any term we choose to use to describe the base variable imposes a restriction on it unlike probabilities these restricted subsets may overlap in any way according to their perceived meaning the concept of compatibility has nothing to do with probability but is an indication of the extent to which a value in this example the proportion of commodity units infested fits defined concepts such as low moderate or any other term when judgement rather than empirical data is used compatibility may be less problematic than probability a phytosanitary measure can be any legislation regulation or official procedure having the purpose to prevent the introduction or spread of quarantine pests or to limit the economic impact of regulated non quarantine pests fao 2017 here we focus on practical measures that may be put in place to manage pest risk in international trade and the calculation of the efficacy of a combination of such measures a pest risk management option that integrates different measures at least two of which act independently with cumulative effect is described by the international plant protection convention ippc standard ispm 14 as a systems approach fao 2002 this recommends that the combination of the efficacy should wherever possible be expressed in quantitative terms with a confidence interval but where such calculations are not possible or not done the efficacy may be expressed in qualitative terms such as high medium and low it can be daunting for exporting countries to argue the contributions to pest risk reduction of the measures which they or their trade partners are proposing quinlan et al 2016 to achieve implementation of a systems approach a demonstration can be helpful that the combined efficacy of a proposed series of measures is likely to be at least as high if not higher than what it is intended to replace we refer to a trade case of thrips palmi control on thai orchid exports taekul et al 2013 2016 which was part of the project beyond compliance mengersen et al 2012 this project was designed to support the accessibility of systems approaches particularly to developing country exporters and data from the trade case analysis presented in quinlan et al 2016 are used here orchid cut flowers from thailand are commonly treated for thrips palmi by applying methyl bromide fumigation prior to export to eu countries the treatment meets eu requirements but a high level of pest interception eu 2010 indicates that the treatment applied is sometimes insufficient it may also reduce the flower quality and face future restriction the objective therefore was to explore the potential to replace methyl bromide treatments with a package of other measures that could be demonstrated to meet eu efficacy requirements each proposed measure may reduce infestation of the consignment to some extent but there is likely in many cases to be considerable uncertainty about the efficacy that will be achieved by each uncertainty may arise from abiotic and biotic variation the standard of measure implementation and lack of knowledge the use of fuzzy sets to make the calculation allows linguistic concepts to be imprecise corresponding to overlapping intervals of the base variable which overlap more when uncertainty is high the calculation of the degree of compatibility of suggested management alternatives with an efficacy goal of negligible infestation is illustrated export lot size and inspection sample size were used to define negligible by an infestation detection probability 0 05 i e a 95 chance that the infestation is too small to be detected the detection probabilities implied by different management alternatives were calculated for comparison uncertainty in the model is expressed by the precision of the linguistic terms so that if the perceived meaning of a term is less precise the associated interval in the base variable is larger the sensitivity of the model to uncertainty was gauged by the change in the number of measures required to achieve the efficacy goal as uncertainty increased 2 methods eppo pest risk assessment uses a five point rating scale from very low to very high and a three point uncertainty score low medium or high eppo 2011 the gb non native risk assessment panel used a four point uncertainty scale mumford et al 2010 corresponding scales were used here but the interpretation of the terminology differs as linguistic variables the terms were related to the underlying base variable to which they relate using a compatibility function in this case the base variable is the proportion of commodity units infested the compatibility functions were ranges of values or intervals of the base variable to which each term corresponded the restriction imposed by these terms specified the interval they could represent the width of this interval being dependent on the uncertainty associated with the meaning of the term for each measure implemented an additional term negligible was also included corresponding to the level of infestation below a statistical pest detection threshold to be regarded as effective phytosanitary action is usually required to reduce residual infestation to very low levels and such action may take the form of a single highly effective measure or the combined use of several measures in a systems approach it is implicit in a systems approach that no single component measure achieves negligible infestation otherwise a systems approach would not be needed the purpose of the modelling exercise is therefore to provide a tool to support discussion about the efficacy of systems approaches model results derived from the perceptions elicited and collated in quinlan et al 2016 were examined the risk managers had used judgement rather than empirical data when giving their opinions about the efficacy of phytosanitary measures three treatment scenarios were considered here in which the efficacy of the methyl bromide treatment was compared with two systems approaches one comprising methyl bromide supported by some other measures methyl bromide plus and the other a set of measures avoiding the use of methyl bromide without methyl bromide the model provides a calculated interval of residual infestation following the implementation of all measures selected the degree of compatibility of the calculated result with each linguistic term provides a way to evaluate the uncertainty it is a fuzzy set describing the extent to which the result is a member of each of the linguistic terms used to characterise the infestation level compatibility is determined by the extent of overlap between the interval defining the result and that defining the linguistic terms each linguistic term ti described a compatibility function which was a restricted interval of the base variable with lower limit x and upper limit y t i u x i u y i u where i 0 5 corresponding to negligible to very high respectively the degree of restriction imposed by each term also depended on the uncertainty u and a higher uncertainty was reflected by a wider interval so less restriction in the base variable the residual infestation q following the implementation of a measure j was described by the interval of the appropriate linguistic term moderate high etc and the level of uncertainty q j i u t i u the product gives the residual infestation interval resulting for all measures used q a l l i n t e r v a l p r o d u c t j q j i u the compatibility ci of qall with each of the terms ti is the overlap of qall and ti as a proportion of qall c i q a l l t i q a l l for q a l l t i and c i 1 for q a l l t i if the result qall is a subset of a linguistic term then its compatibility with the term is 1 if there is no overlap then the compatibility is 0 if there is some overlap then the compatibility is the proportion of the result interval which overlaps with the term see illustration fig 1 the lower and upper bounds of the linguistic terms x i u y i u may be determined solely by whatever range is perceived to correspond to the terms but here a structure was provided so that the terms related to each other in a consistent manner three concepts were introduced a definition of negligible a relationship between linguistic terms and overlap between linguistic terms negligible was defined by the interval between zero and a target level of reduced infestation w corresponding to a probability of pest detection p 0 05 calculated as described later when considering the relationship between terms a measure that provides a low residual infestation is not as effective as one that provides a very low residual infestation and an efficacy ratio v described a consistent relationship between each step of the series for example the efficacy ratio v is the number of measures giving a low residual infestation that is comparable in effect to one measure providing a very low residual infestation so q i q i 1 v where qi is the residual infestation resulting from a measure with efficacy corresponding to ti using the two parameters w and v the upper and lower bounds of each linguistic term in the base variable are then given by y i w 1 v i and x i 0 for i 0 and x i y i 1 otherwise from the first few terms of this series w w 1 v w 1 v 2 w 1 v 3 it can be seen that w 1 v 2 w 1 v 3 v and in general w 1 v i w 1 v i 1 v as required log w y i is therefore a geometric series in which the ratio of one term to the next is v the proportion of commodity units infested cannot exceed 1 and the terms of series y i approach 1 as i increases no terms expressing more than very high residual loss were distinguished as they were not of practical relevance table 1 the efficacy ratio describes the relative efficacy of different measures and its value was derived by consistently anchoring the linguistic scale at a mid point by fixing the upper bound of medium y 3 u 0 5 for u 0 so v ln w ln y 3 1 3 the upper bound of negligible y 0 w was obtained from the size of the lot exported and the sampling employed by the relevant plant health inspection regime the concept of negligible infestation was equated to a 95 chance of non detection i e a 5 chance of detecting an infestation which is present in a lot though a more or less stringent criterion could be used adapted from appendix 2 of fao 2008 the probability of detection is approximated by p d 1 2 n 2 n q a l l s n 1 2 n n 1 n where n is the number of units in a lot n the number of units sampled qall describing the proportion of units infested in this case corresponding to the upper bound of negligible infestation w and s the sampling efficiency proportion of inspected infested units in which an infestation is found solving this expression for w is difficult so numerical methods were used to obtain the value of w corresponding to p d 0 05 this was done by plotting p d over a range of possible values of w to find the value at which p d 0 05 the other parameters n and n are determined according to the trade chain concerned uncertainty in the bounds of the linguistic variables u is described by the proportion of its interval which overlaps with adjacent intervals parametrised in terms of the degree of overlap the lower and upper bounds of each term ti u become 2 x i u x i y i 2 1 u u x i y i 2 y i 2 u 1 with the constraints 0 u 1 x i u 0 and y i u 1 term overlap proportions of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 were used to represent low medium and high uncertainty respectively with very low uncertainty u 0 and the expression t i u x i u y i u is recovered with no overlap between the intervals corresponding to the linguistic terms the model is therefore fully described by just four parameters commodity lot size n phytosanitary inspection sample size n sampling efficiency s and linguistic term precision described by term overlap u 3 results the perceived efficacies and associated uncertainties of the set of measures put forward for inclusion in the illustrated systems approach table 2 varied widely and this is reflected in the ranges of residual infestation associated with each measure fig 2 measures 6 8 and 12 were perceived to be the most effective delivering low or very low residual infestation and measure 12 selection of export quality stems to remove defective flowers harbouring pests or signs of pests and dispose in an assigned area was perceived to have similar efficacy and uncertainty to a methyl bromide treatment the remainder of the measures had residual infestations of medium or greater an important aspect of this exercise was the calculation of the combined effect of several measures each of which alone may have quite modest effects on pest infestation three treatment scenarios were compared methyl bromide only and two systems approaches methyl bromide plus and without methyl bromide table 2 the first scenario provided a baseline result for methyl bromide acting on its own the second the methyl bromide treatment plus three other measures concerned with aspects of the preparation of the commodity for export and the third which included all measures in table 2 except the methyl bromide treatment to determine a reasonable value for negligible infestation the inspection regime adopted for flower imports to the netherlands was used eu 2011 taking into account a modification made from june 2012 onwards for very small lots comprising less than 400 stems the recommendation was to inspect 50 of the stems and for very large lots comprising between 150 000 and 200 000 stems the recommendation was to inspect 1100 stems the detectability limit w was calculated to be 0 00039 and 0 000046 for the smallest lots and very large lots respectively assuming n 200 n 100 and n 175 000 n 1100 respectively assuming that the infestation was found if an infested stem was inspected the sampling efficiency s is equal to 1 two upper bounds of what could be described as negligible infestation were used in the analysis the more stringent and less stringent values calculated 0 000046 and 0 00039 respectively the residual infestation remaining using the treatment scenarios were calculated and the overlap ci of the result qall with each of the terms ti obtained it was found that the calculated interval for the scenario without methyl bromide had overlap with both negligible and very low under more stringent detection and had overlap with negligible only with less stringent detection fig 3 in both cases the other two scenarios exhibited a broader range of overlap with very low and for methyl bromide only also low as expected with less stringent detection the more forgiving concept of negligible cast a favourable light on all treatment scenarios the without methyl bromide scenario had about 30 and 100 overlap with the concept of negligible for the more stringent and less stringent detection situations respectively whilst methyl bromide plus had about 10 and 30 overlap with negligible respectively methyl bromide only was least affected with approximately 60 and 40 overlap with very low and low in both cases the linguistic term intervals were determined by both the definition of negligible and the definition of medium y 3 0 5 given these fixed points the calculated efficacy ratio v was 2 43 and 2 25 for the more stringent and less stringent detection situations respectively in the first case 2 43 measures producing very low residual infestation are comparable in effect to one measure producing negligible infestation and so on for the other relationships between terms the scaling of the linguistic variables therefore has the property that the relationship in terms of measure effect between negligible and very low is the same as that between very low and low low and medium and so on in each case the first being v times more effective than the second in the less stringent detection situation this efficacy ratio is 2 25 and with a less demanding requirement for infestation reduction it is easier for partially effective measures to accumulate to produce the desired result the number of measures of each linguistic rating required to deliver negligible residual infestation are 1 2 43 5 92 14 40 35 02 85 18 table 1 and 1 2 25 5 05 11 34 25 47 and 57 24 for v 2 43 and 2 25 respectively for measures rated very low low medium high and very high respectively for example with v 2 43 it takes 15 medium rated measures to reach the negligible residual infestation threshold these exact efficacy ratios apply to the situation without term overlap i e very low uncertainty but with greater levels of measure uncertainty the general principle still applies the methyl bromide only scenario exhibited almost the same overlap with linguistic terms under the different detection situation fig 3 because effects accumulated across several measures are irrelevant with a single measure the result can also be considered in terms of the detectability of the residual infestation following each of the treatment scenarios the interval of detection probability p d corresponding to the residual infestation interval qall obtained for each scenario showed the very high chance of detection following a methyl bromide treatment alone and a considerably lower chance of detection following the without methyl bromide treatment fig 4 under less stringent detection the probability range was slightly lower p d 0 04 than that of negligible defined with upper limit p d 0 05 consistent with complete overlap with the linguistic term fig 3 but with more stringent detection p d 0 16 consistent with partial overlap with both negligible and very low the methyl bromide plus scenario was intermediate between the other two the overlap between linguistic terms provided a gradient of uncertainty an example of which can be viewed in fig 2 for example measure 1 2 and 4 all incur high residual infestation but with differing uncertainties high medium and low respectively the sensitivity of the results to uncertainty was examined by using four different groups of measures and each group was just enough to reduce residual infestation to negligible as far as possible the groups comprised measures of the same efficacy measures a comprised one measure offering negligible residual infestation measures b two measures offering very low residual infestation plus one measure offering medium and one high measures c six measures offering low residual infestation and measures d fourteen measures offering medium residual infestation plus one offering high these groupings gave the closest values possible to p d 0 05 without exceeding it for example for measures b two measures offering very low was too few but three was too many whereas for the combination described p d was just less than 0 05 with increasing uncertainty expressed as decreasing precision of the linguistic terms the numbers of measures required to achieve the threshold for negligible increased table 3 shows the minimum numbers of measures required to reduce residual pest infestation to negligible under different levels of term precision for example measures a is a single measure which when uncertainty is very low delivers negligible infestation under circumstances of greater uncertainty less precision this must be supplemented with an additional measure which delivers high medium or low residual infestation depending on the level of uncertainty measures d is a group delivering medium residual infestation or higher and under the high uncertainty the numbers of such measures required increases to thirty table 3 the effect of uncertainty was least for measures a and greatest for measures d the more measures involved the greater the compounding of uncertainty 4 discussion the three treatment scenarios were clearly distinguished by the method even though all offered substantial reduction in residual infestation the differences for infestation detectability were particularly marked and only the without methyl bromide scenario had the capacity to deliver a residual infestation below detection limits whether it did so was dependent on the inspection efficiency in the analysis of the trade case taekul et al 2013 quinlan et al 2016 there was no category negligible available in the elicitation but discussions with the experts suggested that it might have been used if it had been available a well implemented methyl bromide treatment is highly effective but it is also known that maintaining implementation standards can be problematic had it been possible to select negligible with high uncertainty to reflect these circumstances then the methyl bromide treatment alone would have 57 overlap with negligible infestation and an infestation detection probability of 0 086 a result more like that of the without methyl bromide scenario in the analysis of the trade case quinlan et al 2016 it was concluded that selected measures including spray programmes and field sanitation were likely to alter the use of methyl bromide fumigation to control t palmi infestation in export orchids it was concluded that more evaluation may be needed to obtain better results with these alternative measures the selected measures referred to above correspond to measures 6 8 and 9 alone these measures delivered 68 overlap with a very low and 31 overlap with a low infestation similar to that obtained with methyl bromide only fig 3 this is because of the efficacy ratio v the very low residual infestation associated with measure 14 methyl bromide can also be achieved by the combination of the low low and medium residual infestations associated with measures 6 8 and 9 respectively though dependent on the assumptions made in calculating measure efficacy ratio this is consistent with the conclusion that other measures could be substituted for methyl bromide if however the methyl bromide treatment is regarded as delivering negligible rather than very low infestation then the substitution is less plausible either way the calculations here suggest that it would be necessary to include most of the other measures put forward for a systems approach to achieve a detection probability 0 05 without the use of methyl bromide the original elicitation was done with linguistic terms unsupported my mathematical definition the reinterpretation of the results discussed here is therefore considered in relative terms but the approach can provide a quantitative footing which accords with a goal expressed in efsa et al 2018 for absolute rather than comparative assessments in phytosanitary risk assessment there is often a lack of empirical data and so risk managers frequently use qualitative linguistic scales to describe components of risk and the effectiveness of potential risk reduction options that could be applied to inhibit the introduction of quarantine pests e g eppo 2011 that linguistic terms describing likelihood and magnitude are interpreted differently has been demonstrated in the phytosanitary sphere e g macleod and pietravalle 2017 using fuzzy sets this study provides a method to employ judgments regarding the effectiveness of a range of phytosanitary measures expressed on a verbal scale together with an indication of uncertainty in the judgment to determine the effectiveness of combinations of phytosanitary measures a direct arithmetic calculation of a diminishing proportion of residual loss as additional measures are implemented is performed on the base variable and the linguistic terms have the role of describing the intervals associated with the effect of the different measures as well as a frame of reference for the result in pra most attempts to quantify intervals for linguistic terms have approached the problem by attributing values directly to each term here we calculate the values corresponding to the terms using three principles 1 a consistent efficacy ratio across terms so very low has the same relationship to negligible as low to very low and so on 2 a definition of negligible based on detection probability and 3 an anchoring of medium to 50 efficacy the efficacy ratio and the term boundaries change according to 2 such that the sequence negligible very low low and medium always fully describes the interval between zero and 50 infestation while maintaining a consistent relationship between terms the boundaries of high and very high follow by maintaining the same between term relationship the meaning of negligible infestation was calculated from plant commodity import inspection protocols efsa et al 2018 and though it appeared that there was considerable range of detection probability according to commodity lot size the sampling method may reduce the detection efficiency associated with larger lots because for practical reasons only a limited number of boxes can be opened from which to select the required number of stems eu 2011 the infestation level corresponding to the more stringent detection threshold may therefore be a too conservative definition of negligible infestation perhaps therefore providing a detection efficiency best case the values of negligible used here were specific to eu flower imports and a different situation requires accompanying lot size sample size and sampling efficiency information in probabilistic models that employ discrete variables the possible states often described by terms such as low medium etc are mutually exclusive and calculations concern the changing probability of each state according to the dependencies between variables e g holt et al 2018 conditional probabilities describe these dependencies and the number of probabilities requiring estimation can become quickly large although sometimes it is possible to infer parameters from more general concepts holt et al 2013 by using linguistic variables uncertainty is expressed differently by the precision of the terms with greater uncertainty the interval encompassed by a term becomes larger and any calculation incorporates this so it becomes more likely that the result will have some overlap with a broader range of terms an approach using fuzzy sets can offer advantages in parameter estimation and just three values of u were used to express different degrees of overlap between adjacent linguistic terms e g between low and very low the output distribution may look deceptively like a probability distribution except the compatibilities need not sum to unity but it merely shows the overlap of the result with the terms earlier defined it provides a result arithmetically consistent with the description of the terms for result comparison no term overlap was used fig 1a so the uncertainty was fully expressed in the rating intervals for example as shown in fig 2 the model offers a calculation applicable to a set of independent measures in a systems approach there can also be interactions between two or more measures which influences their combined effect described as dependent measures in fao 2002 this situation could be modelled here by considering these interdependent measures together as a group processes in time could also be reflected for example where pest reinvasion occurs following implementation of a measure the measure efficacy may be rated less than in the absence of reinvasion or uncertainty increased according to the perceived consequence the model incorporates pest pressure and if known the proportion of commodity units infested in the absence of any control measures may provide a baseline corresponding to no action here simulating a worst case infestation of the commodity in the absence of phytosanitary measures was assumed to affect all commodity units and the cumulative reduction of residual infestation achieved by the control measures used this as a starting point though an estimation of probabilities is not required the compatibility functions or subsets which correspond to the linguistic terms must be specified in general there are no restrictions on how broad an interval a subset encompasses or on the units of the base variable concerned numbers likelihoods impacts according to the variable neither does the specification of the compatibility function for one term influence that for other terms so if required subsets of varying interval and overlap may be employed in this case an interrelated consistent definition of term intervals was used illustrated here with phytosanitary measures the method is extendable to integrated pest management more generally and other applications where the compatibility functions for linguistic terms can be characterised a similar measure efficacy calculation may be used to support the development of novel integrated pest management innovations which also involve collections of measures e g emphasis 2019 in a pest management context the requirement for infestation reduction may be less stringent and loss of commodity quantity or quality is usually more important than pest infestation per se in an application of the approach to pest management therefore residual commodity loss may be a more appropriate base variable and the target residual loss may be determined by producer requirements rather than detection probability the approach described here offers quantitative discrimination between the efficacy of different measure combinations in reducing pest infestation rating categories which can have wide overlapping limits to reflect uncertainty and parameter estimation based on the practical limits of pest detectability it provides a means by which the implications of varying perceptions of measure efficacy and uncertainty held by different stakeholders e g the exporter and the importer can be calculated the model described is written in excel 2016 and is provided as an empty template for own data entry

climate change as a range of possible values a similar approach was used here in which fuzzy numbers were expressed as intervals and their manipulation carried out by interval arithmetic as described in wilcox and ayyub 2003 if a variable such as the proportion of units of a consignment of flowers infested by a pest is represented on a linguistic scale negligible very low low moderate high very high then the sum of the probabilities of these six states naturally sum to one if instead we treat these terms as linguistic variables sensu zadeh 1975 then they are conceptually quite different and we can say that each of these terms has some level of compatibility with the proportion of units infested so for example a proportion of 0 0001 may have some compatibility with the concept of low but also with the concept of very low a linguistic variable is some function of the underlying or base variable to which it relates and accordingly any term we choose to use to describe the base variable imposes a restriction on it unlike probabilities these restricted subsets may overlap in any way according to their perceived meaning the concept of compatibility has nothing to do with probability but is an indication of the extent to which a value in this example the proportion of commodity units infested fits defined concepts such as low moderate or any other term when judgement rather than empirical data is used compatibility may be less problematic than probability a phytosanitary measure can be any legislation regulation or official procedure having the purpose to prevent the introduction or spread of quarantine pests or to limit the economic impact of regulated non quarantine pests fao 2017 here we focus on practical measures that may be put in place to manage pest risk

with cumulative effect is described by the international plant protection convention ippc standard ispm 14 as a systems approach fao 2002 this recommends that the combination of the efficacy should wherever possible be expressed in quantitative terms with a confidence interval but where such calculations are not possible or not done the efficacy may be expressed in qualitative terms such as high medium and low it can be daunting for exporting countries to argue the contributions to pest risk reduction of the measures which they or their trade partners are proposing quinlan et al 2016 to achieve implementation of a systems approach a demonstration can be helpful that the combined efficacy of a proposed series of measures is likely to be at least as high if not higher than what it is intended to replace we refer to a trade case of thrips palmi control on thai orchid exports taekul et al 2013 2016 which was part of the project beyond compliance mengersen et al 2012 this project was designed to support the accessibility of systems approaches particularly to developing country exporters and data from the trade case analysis presented in quinlan et al 2016 are used here orchid cut flowers from thailand are commonly treated for thrips palmi by applying methyl bromide fumigation prior to export to eu countries the treatment meets eu requirements but a high level of pest interception eu 2010 indicates that the treatment applied is sometimes insufficient it may also reduce the flower quality and face future restriction the objective therefore was to explore the potential to replace methyl bromide treatments with a package of other measures that could be demonstrated to meet eu efficacy requirements each proposed measure may reduce infestation of the consignment to some extent but there is likely in many cases to be considerable uncertainty about the efficacy that will be achieved by each uncertainty may arise from abiotic and biotic variation the standard of measure implementation and lack of knowledge the use of fuzzy sets to make the calculation allows linguistic concepts to be imprecise corresponding to overlapping intervals of the base variable which overlap more when uncertainty is high the calculation of the degree of compatibility of suggested management alternatives with an efficacy goal of negligible infestation is illustrated export lot size and inspection sample size were used to define negligible by an infestation detection probability 0 05 i e a 95 chance that the infestation is too small to be detected the detection probabilities implied by different management alternatives were calculated for comparison uncertainty in the model is expressed by the precision of the linguistic terms so that if the perceived meaning of a term is less precise the associated interval in the base variable is larger the sensitivity of the model to uncertainty was gauged by the change in the number of measures required to achieve the efficacy goal as uncertainty increased 2 methods eppo pest risk assessment uses a five point rating scale from very low to very high and a three point uncertainty score low medium or high eppo 2011 the gb non native risk assessment panel used a four point uncertainty scale mumford et al 2010 corresponding scales were used here but the interpretation of the terminology differs as linguistic variables the terms were related to the underlying base variable to which they relate using a compatibility function in this case the base variable is the proportion of commodity units infested the compatibility functions were ranges of values or intervals of the base variable to which each term corresponded the restriction imposed by these terms specified the interval they could represent the width of this interval being dependent on the uncertainty associated with the meaning of the term for each measure implemented an additional term negligible was also included corresponding to the level of infestation below a statistical pest detection threshold to be regarded as effective phytosanitary action is usually required to reduce residual infestation to very low levels and such action may take the form of a single highly effective measure or the combined use of several measures in a systems approach it is implicit in a systems approach that no single component measure achieves negligible infestation otherwise a systems approach would not be needed the purpose of the modelling exercise is therefore to provide a tool to support discussion about the efficacy of systems approaches model results derived from the perceptions elicited and collated in quinlan et al 2016 were examined the risk managers had used judgement rather than empirical data when giving their opinions about the efficacy of phytosanitary measures three treatment scenarios were considered here in which the efficacy of the methyl bromide treatment was compared with two systems approaches one comprising methyl bromide supported by some other measures methyl bromide plus and the other a set of measures avoiding the use of methyl bromide without methyl bromide the model provides a calculated interval of residual infestation following the implementation of all measures selected the degree of compatibility of the calculated result with each linguistic term provides a way to evaluate the uncertainty it is a fuzzy set describing the extent to which the result is a member of each of the linguistic terms used to characterise the infestation level compatibility is determined by the extent of overlap between the interval defining the result and that defining the linguistic terms each linguistic term ti described a compatibility function which was a restricted interval of the base variable with lower limit x and upper limit y t i u x i u y i u where i 0 5 corresponding to negligible to very high respectively the degree of restriction imposed by each term also depended on the uncertainty u and a higher uncertainty was reflected by a wider interval so less restriction in the base variable the residual infestation q following the implementation of a measure j was described by the interval of the appropriate linguistic term moderate high etc and the level of uncertainty q j i u t i u the product gives the residual infestation interval resulting for all measures used q a l l i n t e r v a l p r o d u c t j q j i u the compatibility ci of qall with each of the terms ti is the overlap of qall and ti as a proportion of qall c i q a l l t i q a l l for q a l l t i and c i 1 for q a l l t i if the result qall is a subset of a linguistic term then its compatibility with the term is 1 if there is no overlap then the compatibility is 0 if there is some overlap then the compatibility is the proportion of the result interval which overlaps with the term see illustration fig 1 the lower and upper bounds of the linguistic terms x i u y i u may be determined solely by whatever range is perceived to correspond to the terms but here a structure was provided so that the terms related to each other in a consistent manner three concepts were introduced a definition of negligible a relationship between linguistic terms and overlap between linguistic terms negligible was defined by the interval between zero and a target level of reduced infestation w corresponding to a probability of pest detection p 0 05 calculated as described later when considering the relationship between terms a measure that provides a low residual infestation is not as effective as one that provides a very low residual infestation and an efficacy ratio v described a consistent relationship between each step of the series for example the efficacy ratio v is the number of measures giving a low residual infestation that is comparable in effect to one measure providing a very low residual infestation so q i q i 1 v where qi is the residual infestation resulting from a measure with efficacy corresponding to ti using the two parameters w and v the upper and lower bounds of each linguistic term in the base variable are then given by y i w 1 v i and x i 0 for i 0 and x i y i 1 otherwise from the first few terms of this series w w 1 v w 1 v 2 w 1 v 3 it can be seen that w 1 v 2 w 1 v 3 v and in general w 1 v i w 1 v i 1 v as required log w y i is therefore a geometric series in which the ratio of one term to the next is v the proportion of commodity units infested cannot exceed 1 and the terms of series y i approach 1 as i increases no terms expressing more than very high residual loss were distinguished as they were not of practical relevance table 1 the efficacy ratio describes the relative efficacy of different measures and its value was derived by consistently anchoring the linguistic scale at a mid point by fixing the upper bound of medium y 3 u 0 5 for u 0 so v ln w ln y 3 1 3 the upper bound of negligible y 0 w was obtained from the size of the lot exported and the sampling employed by the relevant plant health inspection regime the concept of negligible infestation was equated to a 95 chance of non detection i e a 5 chance of detecting an infestation which is present in a lot though a more or less stringent criterion could be used adapted from appendix 2 of fao 2008 the probability of detection is approximated by p d 1 2 n 2 n q a l l s n 1 2 n n 1 n where n is the number of units in a lot n the number of units sampled qall describing the proportion of units infested in this case corresponding to the upper bound of negligible infestation w and s the sampling efficiency proportion of inspected infested units in which an infestation is found solving this expression for w is difficult so numerical methods were used to obtain the value of w corresponding to p d 0 05 this was done by plotting p d over a range of possible values of w to find the value at which p d 0 05 the other parameters n and n are determined according to the trade chain concerned uncertainty in the bounds of the linguistic variables u is described by the proportion of its interval which overlaps with adjacent intervals parametrised in terms of the degree of overlap the lower and upper bounds of each term ti u become 2 x i u x i y i 2 1 u u x i y i 2 y i 2 u 1 with the constraints 0 u 1 x i u 0 and y i u 1 term overlap proportions of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 were used to represent low medium and high uncertainty respectively with very low uncertainty u 0 and the expression t i u x i u y i u is recovered with no overlap between the intervals corresponding to the linguistic terms the model is therefore fully described by just four parameters commodity lot size n phytosanitary inspection sample size n sampling efficiency s and linguistic term precision described by term overlap u 3 results the perceived efficacies and associated uncertainties of the set of measures put forward for inclusion in the illustrated systems approach table 2 varied widely and this is reflected in the ranges of residual infestation associated with each measure fig 2 measures 6 8 and 12 were perceived to be the most effective delivering low or very low residual infestation and measure 12 selection of export quality stems to remove defective flowers harbouring pests or signs of pests and dispose in an assigned area was perceived to have similar efficacy and uncertainty to a methyl bromide treatment the remainder of the measures had residual infestations of medium or greater an important aspect of this exercise was the calculation of the combined effect of several measures each of which alone may have quite modest effects on pest infestation three treatment scenarios were compared methyl bromide only and two systems approaches methyl bromide plus and without methyl bromide table 2 the first scenario provided a baseline result for methyl bromide acting on its own the second the methyl bromide treatment plus three other measures concerned with aspects of the preparation of the commodity for export and the third which included all measures in table 2 except the methyl bromide treatment to determine a reasonable value for negligible infestation the inspection regime adopted for flower imports to the netherlands was used eu 2011 taking into account a modification made from june 2012 onwards for very small lots comprising less than 400 stems the recommendation was to inspect 50 of the stems and for very large lots comprising between 150 000 and 200 000 stems the recommendation was to inspect 1100 stems the detectability limit w was calculated to be 0 00039 and 0 000046 for the smallest lots and very large lots respectively assuming n 200 n 100 and n 175 000 n 1100 respectively assuming that the infestation was found if an infested stem was inspected the sampling efficiency s is equal to 1 two upper bounds of what could be described as negligible infestation were used in the analysis the more stringent and less stringent values calculated 0 000046 and 0 00039 respectively the residual infestation remaining using the treatment scenarios were calculated and the overlap ci of the result qall with each of the terms ti obtained it was found that the calculated interval for the scenario without methyl bromide had overlap with both negligible and very low under more stringent detection and had overlap with negligible only with less stringent detection fig 3 in both cases the other two scenarios exhibited a broader range of overlap with very low and for methyl bromide only also low as expected with less stringent detection the more forgiving concept of negligible cast a favourable light on all treatment scenarios the without methyl bromide scenario had about 30 and 100 overlap with the concept of negligible for the more stringent and less stringent detection situations respectively whilst methyl bromide plus had about 10 and 30 overlap with negligible respectively methyl bromide only was least affected with approximately 60 and 40 overlap with very low and low in both cases the linguistic term intervals were determined by both the definition of negligible and the definition of medium y 3 0 5 given these fixed points the calculated efficacy ratio v was 2 43 and 2 25 for the more stringent and less stringent detection situations respectively in the first case 2 43 measures producing very low residual infestation are comparable in effect to one measure producing negligible infestation and so on for the other relationships between terms the scaling of the linguistic variables therefore has the property that the relationship in terms of measure effect between negligible and very low is the same as that between very low and low low and medium and so on in each case the first being v times more effective than the second in the less stringent detection situation this efficacy ratio is 2 25 and with a less demanding requirement for infestation reduction it is easier for partially effective measures to accumulate to produce the desired result the number of measures of each linguistic rating required to deliver negligible residual infestation are 1 2 43 5 92 14 40 35 02 85 18 table 1 and 1 2 25 5 05 11 34 25 47 and 57 24 for v 2 43 and 2 25 respectively for measures rated very low low medium high and very high respectively for example with v 2 43 it takes 15 medium rated measures to reach the negligible residual infestation threshold these exact efficacy ratios apply to the situation without term overlap i e very low uncertainty but with greater levels of measure uncertainty the general principle still applies the methyl bromide only scenario exhibited almost the same overlap with linguistic terms under the different detection situation fig 3 because effects accumulated across several measures are irrelevant with a single measure the result can also be considered in terms of the detectability of the residual infestation following each of the treatment scenarios the interval of detection probability p d corresponding to the residual infestation interval qall obtained for each scenario showed the very high chance of detection following a methyl bromide treatment alone and a considerably lower chance of detection following the without methyl bromide treatment fig 4 under less stringent detection the probability range was slightly lower p d 0 04 than that of negligible defined with upper limit p d 0 05 consistent with complete overlap with the linguistic term fig 3 but with more stringent detection p d 0 16 consistent with partial overlap with both negligible and very low the methyl bromide plus scenario was intermediate between the other two the overlap between linguistic terms provided a gradient of uncertainty an example of which can be viewed in fig 2 for example measure 1 2 and 4 all incur high residual infestation but with differing uncertainties high medium and low respectively the sensitivity of the results to uncertainty was examined by using four different groups of measures and each group was just enough to reduce residual infestation to negligible as far as possible the groups comprised measures of the same efficacy measures a comprised one measure offering negligible residual infestation measures b two measures offering very low residual infestation plus one measure offering medium and one high measures c six measures offering low residual infestation and measures d fourteen measures offering medium residual infestation plus one offering high these groupings gave the closest values possible to p d 0 05 without exceeding it for example for measures b two measures offering very low was too few but three was too many whereas for the combination described p d was just less than 0 05 with increasing uncertainty expressed as decreasing precision of the linguistic terms the numbers of measures required to achieve the threshold for negligible increased table 3 shows the minimum numbers of measures required to reduce residual pest infestation to negligible under different levels of term precision for example measures a is a single measure which when uncertainty is very low delivers negligible infestation under circumstances of greater uncertainty less precision this must be supplemented with an additional measure which delivers high medium or low residual infestation depending on the level of uncertainty measures d is a group delivering medium residual infestation or higher and under the high uncertainty the numbers of such measures required increases to thirty table 3 the effect of uncertainty was least for measures a and greatest for measures d the more measures involved the greater the compounding of uncertainty 4 discussion the three treatment scenarios were clearly distinguished by the method even though all offered substantial reduction in residual infestation the differences for infestation detectability were particularly marked and only the without methyl bromide scenario had the capacity to deliver a residual infestation below detection limits whether it did so was dependent on the inspection efficiency in the analysis of the trade case taekul et al 2013 quinlan et al 2016 there was no category negligible available in the elicitation but discussions with the experts suggested that it might have been used if it had been available a well implemented methyl bromide treatment is highly effective but it is also known that maintaining implementation standards can be problematic had it been possible to select negligible with high uncertainty to reflect these circumstances then the methyl bromide treatment alone would have 57 overlap with negligible infestation and an infestation detection probability of 0 086 a result more like that of the without methyl bromide scenario in the analysis of the trade case quinlan et al 2016 it was concluded that selected measures including spray programmes and field sanitation were likely to alter the use of methyl bromide fumigation to control t palmi infestation in export orchids it was concluded that more evaluation may be needed to obtain better results with these alternative measures the selected measures referred to above correspond to measures 6 8 and 9 alone these measures delivered 68 overlap with a very low and 31 overlap with a low infestation similar to that obtained with methyl bromide only fig 3 this is because of the efficacy ratio v the very low residual infestation associated with measure 14 methyl bromide can also be achieved by the combination of the low low and medium residual infestations associated with measures 6 8 and 9 respectively though dependent on the assumptions made in calculating measure efficacy ratio this is consistent with the conclusion that other measures could be substituted for methyl bromide if however the methyl bromide treatment is regarded as delivering negligible rather than very low infestation then the substitution is less plausible either way the calculations here suggest that it would be necessary to include most of the other measures put forward for a systems approach to achieve a detection probability 0 05 without the use of methyl bromide the original elicitation was done with linguistic terms unsupported my mathematical definition the reinterpretation of the results discussed here is therefore considered in relative terms but the approach can provide a quantitative footing which accords with a goal expressed in efsa et al 2018 for absolute rather than comparative assessments in phytosanitary risk assessment there is often a lack of empirical data and so risk managers frequently use qualitative linguistic scales to describe components of risk and the effectiveness of potential risk reduction options that could be applied to inhibit the introduction of quarantine pests e g eppo 2011 that linguistic terms describing likelihood and magnitude are interpreted differently has been demonstrated in the phytosanitary sphere e g macleod and pietravalle 2017 using fuzzy sets this study provides a method to employ judgments regarding the effectiveness of a range of phytosanitary measures expressed on a verbal scale together with an indication of uncertainty in the judgment to determine the effectiveness of combinations of phytosanitary measures a direct arithmetic calculation of a diminishing proportion of residual loss as additional measures are implemented is performed on the base variable and the linguistic terms have the role of describing the intervals associated with the effect of the different measures as well as a frame of reference for the result in pra most attempts to quantify intervals for linguistic terms have approached the problem by attributing values directly to each term here we calculate the values corresponding to the terms using three principles 1 a consistent efficacy ratio across terms so very low has the same relationship to negligible as low to very low and so on 2 a definition of negligible based on detection probability and 3 an anchoring of medium to 50 efficacy the efficacy ratio and the term boundaries change according to 2 such that the sequence negligible very low low and medium always fully describes the interval between zero and 50 infestation while maintaining a consistent relationship between terms the boundaries of high and very high follow by maintaining the same between term relationship the meaning of negligible infestation was calculated from plant commodity import inspection protocols efsa et al 2018 and though it appeared that there was considerable range of detection probability according to commodity lot size the sampling method may reduce the detection efficiency associated with larger lots because for practical reasons only a limited number of boxes can be opened from which to select the required number of stems eu 2011 the infestation level corresponding to the more stringent detection threshold may therefore be a too conservative definition of negligible infestation perhaps therefore providing a detection efficiency best case the values of negligible used here were specific to eu flower imports and a different situation requires accompanying lot size sample size and sampling efficiency information in probabilistic models that employ discrete variables the possible states often described by terms such as low medium etc are mutually exclusive and calculations concern the changing probability of each state according to the dependencies between variables e g holt et al 2018 conditional probabilities describe these dependencies and the number of probabilities requiring estimation can become quickly large although sometimes it is possible to infer parameters from more general concepts holt et al 2013 by using linguistic variables uncertainty is expressed differently by the precision of the terms with greater uncertainty the interval encompassed by a term becomes larger and any calculation incorporates this so it becomes more likely that the result will have some overlap with a broader range of terms an approach using fuzzy sets can offer advantages in parameter estimation and just three values of u were used to express different degrees of overlap between adjacent linguistic terms e g between low and very low the output distribution may look deceptively like a probability distribution except the compatibilities need not sum to unity but it merely shows the overlap of the result with the terms earlier defined it provides a result arithmetically consistent with the description of the terms for result comparison no term overlap was used fig 1a so the uncertainty was fully expressed in the rating intervals for example as shown in fig 2 the model offers a calculation applicable to a set of independent measures in a systems approach there can also be interactions between two or more measures which influences their combined effect described as dependent measures in fao 2002 this situation could be modelled here by considering these interdependent measures together as a group processes in time could also be reflected for example where pest reinvasion occurs following implementation of a measure the measure efficacy may be rated less than in the absence of reinvasion or uncertainty increased according to the perceived consequence the model incorporates pest pressure and if known the proportion of commodity units infested in the absence of any control measures may provide a baseline corresponding to no action here simulating a worst case infestation of the commodity in the absence of phytosanitary measures was assumed to affect all commodity units and the cumulative reduction of residual infestation achieved by the control measures used this as a starting point though an estimation of probabilities is not required the compatibility functions or subsets which correspond to the linguistic terms must be specified in general there are no restrictions on how broad an interval a subset encompasses or on the units of the base variable concerned numbers likelihoods impacts according to the variable neither does the specification of the compatibility function for one term influence that for other terms so if required subsets of varying interval and overlap may be employed in this case an interrelated consistent definition of term intervals was used illustrated here with phytosanitary measures the method is extendable to integrated pest management more generally and other applications where the compatibility functions for linguistic terms can be characterised a similar measure efficacy calculation may be used to support the development of novel integrated pest management innovations which also involve collections of measures e g emphasis 2019 in a pest management context the requirement for infestation reduction may be less stringent and loss of commodity quantity or quality is usually more important than pest infestation per se in an application of the approach to pest management therefore residual commodity loss may be a more appropriate base variable and the target residual loss may be determined by producer requirements rather than detection probability the approach described here offers quantitative discrimination between the efficacy of different measure combinations in reducing pest infestation rating categories which can have wide overlapping limits to reflect uncertainty and parameter estimation based on the practical limits of pest detectability it provides a means by which the implications of varying perceptions of measure efficacy and uncertainty held by different stakeholders e g the exporter and the importer can be calculated the model described is written in excel 2016 and is provided as an empty template for own data entry

25032,climate is changing globally and its impacts can arise at different levels of biological organization yet cross level consequences of climate change are still poorly understood designing effective environmental management and adaptation plans requires implementation of mechanistic models that span the biological hierarchy because biological systems are inherently complex and dynamic in nature dealing with complexities efficiently necessitates simplification of systems or approximation of relevant processes but there is little consensus on mathematical approaches to scale from genes to populations here we present an effort that aims to bring together groups that often do not interact but that are essential to illuminating the complexities of life empirical scientists and mathematical modelers spanning levels of biological organization from genomes to organisms to populations through interplay between theory models and data we aim to facilitate the generation of a new synthesis and a conceptual framework for biology across levels 1 predicting impacts of climate change from genomes to phenomes to populations climate is changing at a global scale with extreme weather events rahmstorf and coumou 2011 shifts in seasonality and precipitation patterns and an overall increase in the mean and variance of temperatures as some of the more noticeable consequences houghton et al 2001 these environmental changes can compromise organismal fitness through changes in species phenologies and mismatches with their resources parmesan and yohe 2003 as well as potential intraspecific mismatches during reproductive periods williams et al 2017 furthermore extreme weather patterns can increase stress levels which can lead to decreased disease resistance and reduced fitness wingfield et al 2011 potentially jeopardizing population viability and long term persistence of many species impacts of climate change can arise at different levels of biological organization either simultaneously or sequentially woodward et al 2010 with different ramifications and feedbacks across levels most available information or that which is being gathered is specific to levels spanning genomes to individuals over relatively short timeframes yet we are interested in how populations respond to altered conditions if and how they adapt and how adaptation influences persistence across long time scales we are even less aware of the potential cascading feedbacks from populations to individuals and genomes and how these connections either direct or indirect can buffer or accelerate adverse impacts of a changing environment on species or populations there is a need to have a mechanistic understanding of nested and non nested hierarchies allen and starr 2017 i e of the bidirectional connections from genotypes to populations in sufficient detail so that relevant feedbacks are captured evans et al 2013 understanding connectivities and feedbacks is crucial to the design of effective management plans to mitigate the impacts of climate change on populations 2 dealing with complexities across levels of biological organization biological systems are inherently complex and dynamic in nature developing models to represent these systems has traditionally focused on defined levels driven by specific needs and questions for example human health applications have been the main driver of novel developments in whole cell modeling the model of a mycoplasma genitalium cell realistically accounts for different cellular processes including dna decay and repair gene transcription and translation metabolism decay and recycling of rna and formation of the dividing rings karr et al 2012 even though this model is represented as a unit it is comprised of 28 separate modules that use different mathematical approaches that are linked to represent the whole cell by extension scaling up from cells to populations might require numerous additional modules making the mathematical connection between genes and populations incredibly complex mathematically complex models can be formulated to include multiple scales of biological processes and organization in the context of multiscale modeling for example in pharmaceutical research and chemical risk assessment physiologically based pharmaco toxicokinetic pbpk models are used to predict the absorption distribution metabolism and elimination of chemicals e g drugs and environmental toxicants in humans and wildlife in short pbpk models predict organ and tissue concentrations based on a given chemical exposure gibaldi and perrier 1982 multiscale models that utilize a pbpk framework as a means of integrating processes across scales include liver metabolism of acetaminophen in humans to predict variability of effects among different groups of individuals sluka et al 2016 models of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis to predict the effect of endocrine active chemicals on fish reproductive endpoints murphy et al 2005 li et al 2011 gillies et al 2016 and recent efforts to link across scales for endocrine active chemicals on rainbow trout reproduction leading to population level effects forbes et al 2019 in addition to a longer history of modeling animal nutrition baldwin and sainz 1995 efforts are being made to model physiology such as what is being done in the fields of stress physiology romero et al 2015 del giudice et al 2018 and metabolic organization jusup et al 2017 critical to the success of these efforts is the availability of data to parameterize the models in order to maintain biologically plausible values the availability of data will ultimately limit the complexity and predictive power of the models although population level processes clearly emerge from individual level processes that themselves depend on physiology cells and gene expression ecological research on populations and species interactions such as competition predation and mutualism has traditionally ignored lower levels of organization furthermore most models of ecological dynamics regard populations as homogeneous compartments expressed as states in differential equations that allow for analytical solutions of equilibria and mathematical tractability with the realization that population composition and structure influences population dynamics more structured models started emerging caswell 2001 hastings et al 2018 these included models representing population structure in several designated groups e g age or stage based matrix models and models representing each individual in the population e g individual based models grimm and railsback 2005 increases in computational power and more flexible modeling approaches are now opening doors to permit representation of hierarchies by including various processes and mechanisms at the levels of cells and tissues still to further our understanding and mitigation of impacts of a changing environment we need to find ways of dealing with complexities efficiently by simplifying systems or approximating relevant processes evans et al 2013 when considering the processes that will be included in a model s mathematical formulation having clarity on the model s purpose is essential that is characteristic spatial and temporal scales may need to be considered in order to simplify equations and prune processes that are not essential contributors to model output prediction s one example of a coherent scientific framework based on a set of mechanistic models describing energy acquisition and allocation is the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 originally developed to better quantify impacts of chemicals on species physiology and life history deb models are applied to understand and predict biological responses to various environmental factors galic and forbes 2017 including temperature and resource availability kearney and porter 2009 jusup et al 2017 as the currencies in deb theory are mass and energy this framework provides a natural link between suborganismal organismal population and ecosystem processes and has often been applied for understanding how impacts of stressors on individual organisms translate into impacts at higher levels nisbet et al 2000 martin et al 2013 galic et al 2017 however there is little consensus on mathematical approaches to scale from genes to populations key unanswered questions include do all levels of organization need to be modeled explicitly or can some levels be condensed for simplicity and tractability if they are all included does each level need to be addressed with the same degree of detail do we need to consider all of the genes and the genome architecture or can we focus on a subset are there any modules that can be treated as universal such that cross species variation or evolution can be ignored 3 the role of microevolution and plasticity in shaping genomes and phenomes fundamental to understanding organismal responses to environmental change through time is to understand the roles of evolution and phenotypic plasticity in altering organism performance in response to stressors while phenotypic plasticity is an individual characteristic microevolution refers to genotypic changes at the population level interactions between environmental change and genotypes distributed within a population can occur both upstream and downstream of phenotypic changes that can be measured as physiological or biochemical specializations of individuals diamond and martin 2016 the linkage between genotype and phenotype within the context of environmental perturbation can be experimentally tracked via reaction norms a reaction norm encompasses a typical response or plastic range of responses to environmental variation by a single genotype houston and mcnamara 1992 gotthard and nylin 1995 reaction norms are particularly useful in comparisons of closely related populations and may be a key feature of modeling the range of available responses for sub populations and ultimately their fate in the face of changing environments de facto each parameter used in models addressing processes from genes to populations reflects an organism s phenotype and thus is subject to evolution and also may have plastic characteristics delong et al 2016 predicting changes in these parameters is thus critical to using multi scale models to capture responses to climate change evolutionary approaches such as quantitative genetics link mean trait change to population dynamics but treat genes and their expression across levels of organization as a black box lande 1976 abrams et al 1993 alternatively population genetics focuses on the change in allele frequencies at specific sets of genes but treats the emergence of phenotypes from genotypes as black boxes messer et al 2016 more recent approaches such as gillespie eco evolutionary models gems integrate demographic stochasticity and genetic drift with quantitative genetics in a community context delong and gibert 2016 but still do not account for all of the steps leading from genes to populations although data remain scarce for mammals in particular it is now possible to tease apart the driving forces of phenotypic plasticity versus microevolutionary changes on responses to environmental variability boutin and lane 2014 it is critical to recognize that scaling up from genes to populations likely requires taking into account changes in genes through time 4 collaborative developments across communities of experts tackling any big challenge especially that of expected and unexpected future changes in climate patterns and consequences for local biota will require connecting experts across disciplines the scientific community tends to operate in silos of expertise for instance in biological research it is still rare for teams of researchers to span more than two levels of biological organization it is even more uncommon to include mathematical or theoretical biologists into such efforts from the beginning but see e g forbes et al 2017 it is evident that collective intelligence supersedes that of individual scientists woolley et al 2010 and the need for more interdisciplinary research collaborations has been voiced by the scientific community schwenk et al 2009 mykles et al 2010 here we present an effort that aims to coalesce groups that often do not interact but their collaboration is essential to illuminate the complexities of life empirical scientists and mathematical modelers spanning levels of biological organization from genomes to organisms to populations insights into how systems function at different scales have the potential to provide a synthetic understanding of how animals operate and serve as the basis for quantitative models to predict resilience and vulnerability of species in a changing world thus the overarching goal of our research coordination network rcn titled predicting vertebrate responses to a changing climate modeling genomes to phenomes to populations g2p2pop is to facilitate refine and diversify scientific discourse among biologists and mathematicians with expertise that spans from genomes to populations we anticipate that the rcn will create pivotal linkages among multiple disciplines of biology and mathematics such that collaborations will form naturally and result in bidirectional interplay between theory and experimentation to develop unified mechanistic models of genomes to phenomes to populations fig 1 it is only through such interactions between experts and interplay between theory models and data that we can hope to facilitate the generation of a new synthesis and a conceptual framework for biology across levels

effective environmental management and adaptation plans requires implementation of mechanistic models that span the biological hierarchy because biological systems are inherently complex and dynamic in nature dealing with complexities efficiently necessitates simplification of systems or approximation of relevant processes but there is little consensus on mathematical approaches to scale from genes to populations here we present an effort that aims to bring together groups that often do not interact but that are essential to illuminating the complexities of life empirical scientists and mathematical modelers spanning levels of biological organization from genomes to organisms to populations through interplay between theory models and data we aim to facilitate the generation of a new synthesis and a conceptual framework for biology across levels 1 predicting impacts of climate change from genomes to phenomes to populations climate is changing at a global scale with extreme weather events rahmstorf and coumou 2011 shifts in seasonality and precipitation patterns and an overall increase in the mean and variance of temperatures as some of the more noticeable consequences houghton et al 2001 these environmental changes can compromise organismal fitness through changes in species phenologies and mismatches with their resources parmesan and yohe 2003 as well as potential intraspecific mismatches during reproductive periods williams et al 2017 furthermore extreme weather patterns can increase stress levels which can lead to decreased disease resistance and reduced fitness wingfield et al 2011 potentially jeopardizing population viability and long term persistence of many species impacts of climate change can arise at different levels of biological organization either simultaneously or sequentially woodward et al 2010 with different ramifications and feedbacks across levels most available information or that which is being gathered is specific to levels spanning genomes to individuals over relatively short timeframes yet we are interested in how populations respond to altered conditions if and how they adapt and how adaptation influences persistence across long time scales we are even less aware of the potential cascading feedbacks from populations to individuals and genomes and how these connections either direct or indirect can buffer or accelerate adverse impacts of a changing environment on species or populations there is a need to have a mechanistic understanding of nested and non nested hierarchies allen and starr 2017 i e of the bidirectional connections from genotypes to populations in sufficient detail so that relevant feedbacks are captured evans et al 2013 understanding connectivities and feedbacks is crucial to the design of effective management plans to mitigate the impacts of climate change on populations 2 dealing with complexities across levels of biological organization biological systems are inherently complex and dynamic in nature developing models to represent these systems has traditionally focused on defined levels driven by specific needs and questions for example human health applications have been the main driver of novel developments in whole cell modeling the model of a mycoplasma genitalium cell realistically accounts for different cellular processes including dna decay and repair gene transcription and translation metabolism decay and recycling of rna and formation of the dividing rings karr et al 2012 even though this model is represented as a unit it is comprised of 28 separate modules that use different mathematical approaches that are linked to represent the whole cell by extension scaling up from cells to populations might require numerous additional modules making the mathematical connection between genes and populations incredibly complex mathematically complex models can be formulated to include multiple scales of biological processes and organization in the context of multiscale modeling for example in pharmaceutical research and chemical risk assessment physiologically based pharmaco toxicokinetic pbpk models are used to predict the absorption distribution metabolism and elimination of chemicals e g drugs and environmental toxicants in humans and wildlife in short pbpk models predict organ and tissue concentrations based on a given chemical exposure gibaldi and perrier 1982 multiscale models that utilize a pbpk framework as a means of integrating processes across scales include liver metabolism of acetaminophen in humans to predict variability of effects among different groups of individuals sluka et al 2016 models of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis to predict the effect of endocrine active chemicals on fish reproductive endpoints murphy et al 2005 li et al 2011 gillies et al 2016 and recent efforts to link across scales for endocrine active chemicals on rainbow trout reproduction leading to population level effects forbes et al 2019 in addition to a longer history of modeling animal nutrition baldwin and sainz 1995 efforts are being made to model physiology such as what is being done in the fields of stress physiology romero et al 2015 del giudice et al 2018 and metabolic organization jusup et al 2017 critical to the success of these efforts is the availability of data to parameterize the models in order to maintain biologically plausible values the availability of data will ultimately limit the complexity and predictive power of the models although population level processes clearly emerge from individual level processes that themselves depend on physiology cells and gene expression ecological research on populations and species interactions such as competition predation and mutualism has traditionally ignored lower levels of organization furthermore most models of ecological dynamics regard populations as homogeneous compartments expressed as states in differential equations that allow for analytical solutions of equilibria and mathematical tractability with the realization that population composition and structure influences population dynamics more structured models started emerging caswell 2001 hastings et al 2018 these included models representing population structure in several designated groups e g age or stage based matrix models and models representing each individual in the population e g individual based models grimm and railsback 2005 increases in computational power and more flexible modeling approaches are now opening doors to permit representation of hierarchies by including various processes and mechanisms at the levels of cells and tissues still to further our understanding and mitigation of impacts of a changing environment we need to find ways of dealing with complexities efficiently by simplifying systems or approximating relevant processes evans et al 2013 when considering the processes that will be included in a model s mathematical formulation having clarity on the model s purpose is essential that is characteristic spatial and temporal scales may need to be considered in order to simplify equations and prune processes that are not essential contributors to model output prediction s one example of a coherent scientific framework based on a set of mechanistic models describing energy acquisition and allocation is the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 originally developed to better quantify impacts of chemicals on species physiology and life history deb models are applied to understand and predict biological responses to various environmental factors galic and forbes 2017 including temperature and resource availability kearney and porter 2009 jusup et al 2017 as the currencies in deb theory are mass and energy this framework provides a natural link between suborganismal organismal population and ecosystem processes and has often been applied for understanding how impacts of stressors on individual organisms translate into impacts at higher levels nisbet et al 2000 martin et al 2013 galic et al 2017 however there is little consensus on mathematical approaches to scale from genes to populations key unanswered questions include do all levels of organization need to be modeled explicitly or can some levels be condensed for simplicity and tractability if they are all included does each level need to be addressed with the same degree of detail do we need to consider all of the genes and the genome architecture or can we focus on a subset are there any modules that can be treated as universal such that cross species variation or evolution can be ignored 3 the role of microevolution and plasticity in shaping genomes and phenomes fundamental to understanding organismal responses to environmental change through time is to understand the roles of evolution and phenotypic plasticity in altering organism performance in response to stressors while phenotypic plasticity is an individual characteristic microevolution refers to genotypic changes at the population level interactions between environmental change and genotypes distributed within a population can occur both upstream and downstream of phenotypic changes that can be measured as physiological or biochemical specializations of individuals diamond and martin 2016 the linkage between genotype and phenotype within the context of environmental perturbation can be experimentally tracked via reaction norms a reaction norm encompasses a typical response or plastic range of responses to environmental variation by a single genotype houston and mcnamara 1992 gotthard and nylin 1995 reaction norms are particularly useful in comparisons of closely related populations and may be a key feature of modeling the range of available responses for sub populations and ultimately their fate in the face of changing environments de facto each parameter used in models addressing processes from genes to populations reflects an organism s phenotype and thus is subject to evolution and also may have plastic characteristics delong et al 2016 predicting changes in these parameters is thus critical to using multi scale models to capture responses to climate change evolutionary approaches such as quantitative genetics link mean trait change to population dynamics but treat genes and their expression across levels of organization as a black box lande 1976 abrams et al 1993 alternatively population genetics focuses on the change in allele frequencies at specific sets of genes but treats the emergence of phenotypes from genotypes as black boxes messer et al 2016 more recent approaches such as gillespie eco evolutionary models gems integrate demographic stochasticity and genetic drift with quantitative genetics in a community context delong and gibert 2016 but still do not account for all of the steps leading from genes to populations although data remain scarce for mammals in particular it is now possible to tease apart the driving forces of phenotypic plasticity versus microevolutionary changes on responses to environmental variability boutin and lane 2014 it is critical to recognize that scaling up from genes to populations likely requires taking into account changes in genes through time 4 collaborative developments across communities of experts tackling any big challenge especially that of expected and unexpected future changes in climate patterns and consequences for local biota will require connecting experts across disciplines the scientific community tends to operate in silos of expertise for instance in biological research it is still rare for teams of researchers to span more than two levels of biological organization it is even more uncommon to include mathematical or theoretical biologists into such efforts from the beginning but see e g forbes et al 2017 it is evident that collective intelligence supersedes that of individual scientists woolley et al 2010 and the need for more interdisciplinary research collaborations has been voiced by the scientific community schwenk et al 2009 mykles et al 2010 here we present an effort that aims to coalesce groups that often do not interact but their collaboration is essential to illuminate the complexities of life empirical scientists and mathematical modelers spanning levels of biological organization from genomes to organisms to populations insights into how systems function at different scales have the potential to provide a synthetic understanding of how animals operate and serve as the basis for quantitative models to predict resilience and vulnerability of species in a changing world thus the overarching goal of our research coordination network rcn titled predicting vertebrate responses to a changing climate modeling genomes to phenomes to populations g2p2pop is to facilitate refine and diversify scientific discourse among biologists and mathematicians with expertise that spans from genomes to populations we anticipate that the rcn will create pivotal linkages among multiple disciplines of biology and mathematics such that collaborations will form naturally and result in bidirectional interplay between theory and experimentation to develop unified mechanistic models of genomes to phenomes to populations fig 1 it is only through such interactions between experts and interplay between theory models and data that we can hope to facilitate the generation of a new synthesis and a conceptual framework for biology across levels

25033,the invasion of exotic species in aquatic environments is one of the several disturbance factors responsible for altering the dynamics of fish communities the golden mussel limnoperna fortunei was first recorded in the upper uruguay river brazil in 2012 and since then it has been needed to discuss and evaluate how this invasive species interferes with the dynamics of the ten most abundant fishes of this region literature lacks works that investigate how to model and control the effect of such kind of invasion this paper proposes a polynomial nonlinear state space representation to model the dynamics of the these fish communities whose parameters are identified with the use of least squares procedures considering in loci collected data from 2007 to 2016 this work also evaluates quantitatively by relying on simulation results how the sudden presence of the golden mussel medelled with the aquatic life of the upper uruguay river the obtained model allows some ambitious automatic control objectives using a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc approach an automatic controller is designed to determine how much and how often the golden mussel should be removed from the water in order for the most affected species to once again exhibit sustainable life conditions in terms of its k condition factor and abundance the nmpc strategy is synthesized considering performance constraints and piecewise constant control trajectories by relying on simulation results this work elucidates how an automatic controller could be implemented as management policies established by environmental agencies to gradually restore the fish ecological balance of the upper uruguay river previously unsettled by an exotic invasor keywords predictive control of invasive species systems biology fish condition factor upper uruguay river nonlinear model 1 introduction 1 1 ecological feedback control for many years the study of differential equations was considered an advanced topic in biomathematics and therefore beyond the reach of most biologists milton 2015 nonetheless this barrier became weaker over the last few years due to an increasing number of textbooks on biomathematics easily implementable software packages and the growth of multi disciplinary workshops bringing together ecologist biologists and engineers to exchange ideas concerning feedback control in mutual beneficence a recognized principle of ecology is that the interactions between organisms and their environment occur in reciprocal ways the environment meddles with the terms by which life goes on although organisms influence the conditions that prevail in their environment translating this to feedback control the conditions of the organisms controlled outputs are given with respect to the environments changes control inputs and disturbances in essence there exist two primary reasons for developing control strategies for ecological systems cunha and pagano 2002 meza et al 2002 silveira and pagano 2005 2004 the first is to permit a sustainable exploitation of its assets the other is to restore some harmonic ecological balance 1 1 the main problem of feedback control is how to determine adequate control inputs over time such that the controlled outputs attain an expected performance for instance in the case of ecological systems this issue translates into how much a biological invasor has to be removed for an invaded system to return to some nominal sustainable condition avoiding a possible environmental catastrophe disrupted by the invasor given this context the control of biological and ecological systems is rather new in the literature some first attempts towards this issue were written in the 60s by stark and young 1964 and atkinson 1965 anyhow from then on only few works have successfully presented effective studies that depart from scratch present dynamic modelling and actually reach good experimental results some of these are listed below in terms of automatica publications the modelling identification and control of denitrifying biofilters is studied in bourrel et al 2000 in alexiadis et al 2007 a dynamical model for membranes is proposed in harmand et al 2008 the issue of controlling microbial ecology with molecular biology is studied most importantly in silveira and pagano 2005 and silveira and pagano 2004 an approach to control predator prey system is presented using piecewise constant controls and low sampling rates which thus allow practical implementation by means of management policies established by environmental agencies notice that most of these works are data derived simulation results with respect to ecology journals a few other works must be remembered state space models for marked individuals have been analysed by gimenez et al 2007 considering nonlinear state space dynamic models for ecological systems some methods for their estimation have been studied in pedersen et al 2011 in jones et al 2017 some dynamic models are presented for the management of invasive species considering the control of the grey squirrel on anglesey using optimal control theory edholm et al 2018 discussed how to manage invasive insect species 1 2 the ecological problem commonly known as the golden mussel limnoperna fortunei fig 1 is a freshwater bivalve mollusk from the mytilidae family native from rivers and streams in china and southeast asia this small mollusk is nowadays a major ecological issue in brazil considering favorable conditions of growth and dispersion a recent work made a prevision that this mollusk will reach the northern regions of the country until 2050 barbosa et al 2018 which in practice would lead to a real ecological catastrophe in a national scale the invasion of the golden mussel in the upper uruguay river occurred in 2012 agudo padrón et al 2012 this has directly and indirectly affected the incipient ichthyofauna and this invasor has been incorporated into the diets of some local fishes as discussed in cantanhêde et al 2008 lopes and vieira 2012 in addition this filter feeding mollusk moves large amounts of plankton in the water column to the sediment as pseudofeces fachini et al 2012 changing the availability of resources in the freshwater ecosystem little is known about the dynamics of how the l fortunei affects the ecology of this river in terms of fish abundance and condition factor of the most abundant fish species in fish biology such factor informs the physiological state of fish lima junior et al 2002 further details are provided in section 2 furthermore to the best of authors knowledge there are no studies that have actually touch the issue of what are the practical effects of mussel s presence with respect to the fish communities 2 2 regarding solely the dynamic modelling issue a prior preliminary paper has been presented by the present authors in morato et al 2019 and how can these effects be reverted 3 3 regarding actual automatic control strategies derived from accurate models no study has been made such predicted ecological catastrophe disrupted by the invasion of the golden mussel might be avoided if adequate environmental management policies are delimited these policies can be found also using feedback control many feedback control approaches have been studied in the literature the present authors previously investigated the use of pid controllers tuned with standard loop shaping techniques for such goal in morato et al 2019 via simulation results however the obtained results were not so satisfying once the complex model of this ecological system had to be significantly simplified for the tuning procedure and the implementation constraints could not be directly taken into account nonetheless the simulation results shown in morato et al 2019 suggest that control techniques that takes into account a full model and implementation constraints such as the model predictive control mpc framework could possibly result in interesting achievements mpc is now a very well established technique with a wide range of industrial applications it is a natural methodology towards optimal 4 4 note that the term optimal is used herein to represent the best possible option control of processes subject to constraints as introduced in camacho and bordons 2013 mpc computes some optimal control action at every computational instant by solving a quadratic optimization problem written in terms of the process model this control framework allows to explicitly consider the effect of input output and state constraints in the control design procedure which is rather convenient it has to be remarked that as in any standard discrete control method mpc laws are piecewise constant signals for sampled data systems and therefore this is the framework used in this work 1 3 paper contributions to model the ecological system considered in this work is a complex task and very few results in this sense have been seen in the literature moreover having available field data in large scale to correctly validate ecological models is also rare during the last decade or so extensive work has been carried out by the lapad ufsc research group in brazil in order to collect and analyse data of various fish communities of the upper uruguay river avila simas 2018 the main motivation of this work is to propose and validade strategies that could lead to management policies of the l fortunei established by environmental agencies hence the main contribution with respect to prior discussions is twofold i firstly to obtain accurate dynamic models from the vast available field data of this region from lapad having adequate models allows one to make future predictions as well as to possibly apply feedback control techniques such as mpc laws ii then to propose and test a predictive control method that could be implemented in practice by the means of environmental management policies in order to mitigate reject the effect of this ecological invasor upon fish communities and by doing so restore ecological balance synthetically this paper proposes tests and analyses a model predictive control strategy for the regulation of the ecological effect of the golden mussel in the upper uruguay river all of this development is done of course considering the region of the upper uruguay river and based on field data sampled therein before and after the invasion period numerical simulations are presented to assess the results in terms of modelling and control it must be clearly stressed that this paper presents simulation results derived from data based models it is not in this work s intents to show or investigate how to suppress the golden mussel from the water with respect to this matter literature shows that there is a great difficulty on controlling invasive bivalves such as the experience with the zebra mussel ricciardi et al 1998 nalepa and schloesser 1992 strayer 2009 which motivates whole other practical investigation threads 1 4 organization of the paper the paper is organized as follows first of all fish ecology preliminaries are recalled in section 2 in order to adequate this paper to readers of both domains ecology and automatic control the proposed polynomial nonlinear state space model is presented in section 3 together with its least squares identification procedure section 4 presents the control performance objectives of the studied problem and most importantly presents the discrete control algorithm based on a nonlinear model predictive control technique that can be used to determine how often and how much of the golden mussel has to be withdrawn from the upper uruguay in order for the most affected fish species to return to ecological balance 5 5 throughout this paper ecological balance is meant as a situation in which the fish species present values of abundance and life condition factor close to the ones observed prior to the mussel invasion synthetically it is understood that the golden mussel invasion disrupted an ecologically unbalanced condition in the upper uruguay river that supposably can be partially reverted section 5 presents the obtained numerical simulation results of the proposed automatic control strategy the work ends with conclusions 2 fish ecology this section recalls some preliminaries notations and methodologies with respect to fish ecology 2 1 biological invasions recently most countries have been facing complex problems concerning the invasion of exotic species in their territories some examples are the zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha that impacts fishing mollusk diversity and electric energy generation in north america the water hyacinth eichornia crassipes which brought great issues to the navigation of lakes and rivers of congo egypt and many watercourses throughout the african continent patel 2012 the giant african snail achatina fulica that represents a threat to public health natural environments and agriculture and also new pathogenic organisms viruses bacterias protozoa that affect human animal and vegetal populations in various regions mcneely 2001 griffiths et al 1991 patel 2012 colley 2010 together with overexploitation and habitat destruction these biological invasions are pointed as the main cause for the loss of biodiversity and one of the key factor to provoke global changes sala et al 2000 elliott 2012 townsend et al 2003 various studies indicate that bio invasions are related to at least 38 of the total animal extinctions brown and lomolino 1998 and are also being responsible direct or indirectly for 49 of endangered species in the usa mack et al 2000 in terms of fish biodiversity studies point out that bio invasions are related to 50 of the extinctions in the world baillie et al 2004 2 2 the golden mussel limnoperna fortunei several biotic and abiotic factors influence fish dynamics in freshwater environments these influences can be reflected in the abundance of individuals by altering their reproduction and or feeding behaviours and even their well being in subtropical regions temperature is one of the main factors that influence fish dynamics however human intervention can be responsible for the invasion of exotic species in aquatic environments whether unintentionally or intentionally these invasions may have an even greater impact on the dynamics of the species and can often overlap changes provoked by abiotic factors the first records of biological invasions caused by the limnoperna fortunei date from 1965 in hong kong morton and miller 1973 and later in 1990 in japan magara et al 2001 and taiwan ricciardi 1998 in south america the golden mussel was first recorded in the prata river in argentina uruguay in 1993 darrigran and pastorino 1993 shifting through the paraná river waters in brazil the mussel dispersed north reaching five countries in a period of ten years argentina 1991 uruguay 1994 paraguay 1997 brazil and bolivia 1998 as stated in belz et al 2010 in the brazilian territory this species was first recorded in 1998 in two southern states de oliveira et al 2006 and then its presence was detected in the hydroelectric plant of itaipu zanella and marenda 2002 and in the state of são paulo avelar et al 2004 captured l fortunei specimens from the upper uruguay river between the states of santa catarina and rio grande do sul in brazil are shown in fig 2 these specimens were retrieved from the digestive tract of different fish caught in this region a paraloricaria vetula b c hypostomus roseopunctatus and d crenicichla celidochilus in a recent study realized in the paraná river mouth sylvester et al 2007 it was noticed that the golden mussel s predators in majority were capable of consuming approximately 6 kg of mussel per square meter reducing in up to 90 of the mussel biomass by analysing the digestory tract of commercial fish from the same river oliveira et al 2010 remarked that 67 of analysed species consumed l fortunei nonetheless both of these works together with iummato et al 2018 gattás et al 2018 discuss that the predatory suppression of the mussel seems rather unlikely and not a simple task being a topic for further investigation certainly the intense consumption of the mussel by a predatory species may represent an important role in the reduction of the mussel in environments with a great spread proliferation of such invasor also some filtering techniques can be used to undermine their procreation the goal of this paper is not to discuss how the removal of the mussel will be in fact performed but an essential and open question is to determine how much and how often has the golden mussel to be filtered for the aquatic fauna to return to ecologically balanced conditions the entry of the l fortunei in a new environment may provoke alterings in the native biodiversity due to resource competition darrigran and damborenea 2005 causing unmeasurable ecosystem impact also negative impacts also appear related to the hydroelectric energy generations once these mollusks fix themselves in cooling channels forcing a complete stop of the plants operation for their removal nakano and strayer 2014 which is actually very costly because human divers have to remove these mollusks individually from the channels 2 3 sampling protocol to investigate the effects caused in the upper uruguay river by the invasion of the golden mussel dating around 2012 fish were sampled in loci every three months to characterize each of the four seasons of the year between february 2007 and november 2016 by the lapad research team eight sampling sites were evaluated around the area influenced by the itá dam in brazil comprising the uruguay river some tributaries and diverse environments in the reservoir area this period of course covers the events before and after the invasion by the l fortunei samplings were carried out with a set of gill nets with different mesh sizes ranging from 1 5 to 8 0 cm adjacent knots plus hook and line cast net and seine to sample different fish populations in the studied area the fishing effort was approximately constant over time at all eight sampling sites which allows a comparison between data from different seasons fig 3 shows the eight sampling sites in the region of the upper uruguay river brazil these sites are represented by bold dots 2 4 fish community abundance to describe the abundance of fish communities near the itá reservoir over the 10 years of study this work opts for the use of the catch per unit effort cpue measurement this unit describes how many individuals are caught with gill nets of 100 m2 within 12 h usually used in aquaculture and conservation biology this measure is an indirect indicator of the abundance of some given species changes in the cpue of a given species mean that there is also some change in the species abundance as states puertas and bodmer 2004 constant cpue stand for sustainable harvesting while decreasing cpue are related to overexploitation a total of 42 282 fish were caught from 2007 to 2016 within the coverage area of the itá reservoir and the ten most abundant 6 6 these are 1 apareiodon affinis 2 astyanax fasciatus 3 astyanax lacustris 4 acestrorhynchus pantaneiro 5 hypostomus isbrueckeri 6 iheringichthys labrosus 7 loricariichthys anus 8 parapimelodus valenciennis 9 steindachnerina brevipinna 10 schizodon nasutus fish species represented 70 52 of this total to illustrate how the cpue became influenced by the presence of the mussel fig 4 7 7 note that in this figure and in the ones that follow the vertical red line golden mussel invasion stands for the first record of the limnoperna fortunei in the upper uruguay river waters shows the variations over time for the mean cpue measurement from the eight sampling sites for apareiodon affinis loricariichthys anus and iheringichthys labrosus it is evident that the invasion of the mussel disrupted variation effects on the abundance of these species once their mean cpue variations increase for the two later species and decreases for the first the evidence of effects caused by the mussel was also verified for the other seven species 2 5 well being of fish communities k factor the k condition factor is an index that is widely used to evaluate the welfare of fish communities vazzoler 1996 this factor is computed via a weight length relationship and quantitatively presents the physiological conditions of the analysed fish such factor is correlated with changes in biotic and abiotic variables lizama and ambrosio 2002 and it can be interpreted roughly as the human body mass index bmi for fishes after all fish caught in the samplings were identified all specimens were measured considering total length and mass the condition factor k can be computed with the use of k m l β where m stands for the mass of a given specimen in a sample measured in g and l represents the length of that same individual measured in cm the average k value for a given species is obtained as the average k for the specimens in a sample the parameter β is a length mass ratio related for each fish species as discussed by le cren 1951 this parameter varies for each species as depicted in table 1 therein species are enumerated from 1 to 10 in respect to the alfabetical given in footnote 6 it must be remarked that this parameter should not be used to compare distinct fish species once its value is intrinsically linked to the body morphology of each fish species larger values of k stand for rounder fish with greater body height while smaller values are observed for elongated and spindle shaped species for readers to grasp how the fish condition factor is indeed disrupted by the golden mussel invasion fig 5 shows the variations over time for the mean cpue measurement from the eight sampling sites for iheringichthys labrosus schizodon nasutus and apareiodon affinis it is evident that the invasion of the mussel disrupted variation effects on the life condition of these species which was also verified for the other seven fish communities the first two species present an average increase on the k factor whereas the latter presents a small average decrease 3 dynamic modelling once the preliminaries have been presented and the situation of the invasion of the golden mussel in the upper uruguay river has been detailed this section proposes a dynamical model to describe the effect of the presence of the l fortunei upon the fish community ecology of the upper uruguay river note that if feedback control goals are sought a good model is necessary to provide a mathematical description of how the system will behave due applied inputs and external disturbances it must be noticed that the sampled data described in section 2 stand for three month periodic measurements of each one of the ten most abundant fish species in each of the eight sampling sites which represents an enormous amount of data to find an adequate model the describes the relationship of the golden mussel presence and the k and cpue values two alternate paths may be followed i to model the dynamics of each sampling site independently or ii to model the average dynamics of the fish in the upper uruguay river this work opts for the second path and therefore uses mean values to describe the global situation of the river by using weighted averages from the data of the eight distinct sampling sites which reduces the amount of data by an eighth 3 1 chosen model firstly two phenomena have to be mathematically evaluated the presence or not of the golden is given by a discrete time function g k and the removal of the mussel from the water is given as u k which is to be determined by the predictive feedback controller and implemented in practice as environmental management policies for now the system is modelled as an isolated open loop condition without human intervention i e u is null once no feedback control loop is set in section 4 closed loop assessments are discussed an open loop plant is one with no feedback control action u while closed loop has u is computed as a function of the measurable outputs y j with a working feedback controller likewise translating these two terms to ecology an open loop ecological system is said isolated i e u 0 and a closed loop one non isolated with direct human interference i e u 0 thus the ecological system is modelled considering that for each species namely j two outputs y j r are measured every three months the k factor and abundance factor cpue recall that both these outputs are related to the life conditions of a given fish community which has been unsettled by the invasion of the golden mussel these two outputs depend on the presence of the golden mussel g apart from other factors noise ν and other disturbances w also the system has some internal states x j that can be used to obtain y j via dynamic models in this study the states x j can be understood as the cpue average mass m and average length l of each species now considering a state space modelling representation the dynamics over time of the outputs y j of the ten most abundant each species j 1 10 with respect to the order of species in table 1 due to the presence of the golden mussel g the following state polynomial discrete time model for the isolated ecological system is proposed 8 8 such polynomial framework was chosen once good preliminary results were obtained in morato et al 2019 where the discrete variable k corresponds to the samples in time of every 3 months i e t kt s for t s 3 months state polynomial 1 x j 1 k 1 x j 2 k 1 x j 3 k 1 x j k 1 a 1 1 j x j k a 1 n j j x j k 1 n j a p j 1 j x j k p j a p j n j j x j k 1 n j p j b 1 1 j g k b 1 n j j g k 1 n j b p j 1 j g k p j b p j n j j g k n j p j b ν b j t ν k w k nonlinear outputs 2 y j k y j 1 k y j 2 k x j 1 k x j 2 k x j 3 k β j d j g k in eqs 1 and 2 x j 1 stands for the cpue of the species j x j 2 for the average mass of j and x j 3 for the average length of j notation v p means that every component of vector v is raised to the power p a j b p j n j j are constant matrices parameter p j stands for the maximal polynomial dependence of 1 while n j represents the order of the system note that the proposed model is output wise nonlinear due to y j 2 furthermore notice that the sudden presence of the mussel at instant k is directly seen in the outputs 9 9 in automatica this is said to be a direct energy transfer from input g to outputs via matrix d j remark 1 in avila simas 2018 empirical observation derived from a series of biological and ecological tests verified that there is no physical coupling between the states length mass abundance of different fish species j this means that there is no sense to consider a model that incorporates the dynamics of more than one species at once furthermore these tests verified that these three states are not necessarily coupled between themselves which means that matrices a 1 1 j a p j n j j are fixed as block diagonal ones remark 2 it is essential that the proposed model takes into consideration samples from prior invasion periods as well as post invasion this resides in the fact that the internal dynamics of the life growth conditions of the fish species must be described by the isolated model the proposed model is control oriented which means it must present good fidelity in the considered control situations so that the achieved simulation results presented later on in section 5 can be trustworthy 3 2 identification procedure now that the proposed model has been detailed this subsection is dedicated to the identification of the model parameters that is estimating all matrices in eq 1 for each of the ten most abundant species j in the upper uruguay river firstly some assumptions have to be made assumption 1 the presence of the golden mussel g k from 2012 onwards can be somewhat accurately modelled as a step function varying from 0 no presence to 1 100 present at some instant k assumption 2 noise is distributed uniformly between states and outputs mathematically this is expressed by taking b ν as an identity matrix also to take into account the effect of other unknown ecological variables that do influence the fish dynamics term b j w k is taken as distributed colored non gaussian noise remark 3 an exact quantification of the amount of golden mussel in upper uruguay river is not well known in the present this is why this work opts for a percentage signal which means that the proposed model is normalized with respect to g the absolute value g corresponding to 100 is to be determined in future works the density of the mussel can be obtained via meticulous sampling and counting the number of adult specimens per m2 which can be extended to the area of the river note that while the presence of the golden mussel g is normalized the field data states and outputs are not therefore without loss of generality g can be considered as 1 with a normalization b n j j of the matrices b n j j in eq 1 once the identification of b n j j is performed with the normalized input g 1 one may then take b 1 n j j b 1 n j j g b 2 n j j b 2 n j j g 2 and so on where g is the absolute value for the presence of mussel so as to transform the normalized percentage data model into an absolute one data data in order to identify the proposed model an extended least squares method is applied to the available field data from the fish sampling sites considering eqs 1 and 2 this method is very well established in the literature see ljung 1998 and aims to achieve non biased unpolarized parameters ρ models matrices by minimizing the quadratic difference between model y j k for each species j and field measurements y j f k its main steps applied for each of the ten species separately are rapidly recalled in the sequel i solve the following quadratic problem 3 min ρ 1 n k 1 n y j f k y j k 2 with an n steps horizon for the ten considered years n 40 samples ii compute the residue vector ϵ j y j f y j iii use the residue ϵ j from step ii as a guess for unknown inputs w ν repeating step i until the results converge to a certain pre specified precision remark 4 it must noted that the degree order of the proposed models given by the pair n j p j in eq 1 was fixed for each species j via optimization this means that on top of the minimization problem 3 another minimization problem was set find the degree pair n j p j that yields the minimimal model residue possible note that larger polynomial orders i e larger values for p j were penalized the regression order n j was also penalized in order to avoid overparametrization 3 3 discussion the following identification results were achieved using the matlab software package mathworks 2017 the proposed models were identified for each of the ten most abundant species of the upper uruguay river table 2 synthesizes the obtained parameters and the results in terms of the ordinary coefficient of determination r 2 between model outputs y j r k and real data y j r f k with r 1 2 related to each output in table 3 corroborating assessments are presented to qualify the identified models therein the level of precision of these models is given in terms of residuals square norm of each ϵ j r smaller values stand for a more perfect fit between model and field data the results of a likelihood ratio test 10 10 this test compares the restricted model with unrestricted data comparing loglikelihood maxima values with respect to the available degrees of freedom i e n j p j are presented which give the probability of the data set to be described by the proposed models standard deviation for the model data residuals are also given overall the proposed model achieves good results with the r 2 values close to 1 indicating high fidelity between model and data nonetheless in some cases the order of the achieved polynomial is 1 which corresponds to a linear model it must be remarked that the presence of the golden mussel g indeed directly influences the abundance and condition factor of the fish species model outputs y j r for all ten fish species this is verified by three different corroborating confirmations i the identified values for matrices b 1 1 j b p j n j j are non null which means the identification procedure mathematically weights that g meddles with y j r ii in the thesis avila simas 2018 a qualification of the field data is performed examining which species are the mostaffected ones due to the mussel invasion by the means of statistical analysis and biological procedures 11 11 in avila simas 2018 two points stand out 1 input output relationship significance is observed and 2 some fish specimens were cut open and it was seen that the most affected populations according to the statistical procedures had incorporated the mussel into their diets and iii in the preliminary paper morato et al 2019 a h norm 12 12 note that the h norm computes the energy to energy gain whereas the h 2 norm computes an impulse to energy gain the first norm is a good indicator because it calculates the worse case i o magnification note that bigger values for the h 2 norm would be verified with respect to influence of noise i e noisy measurements have bigger h 2 norms but this does not greatly impacts on the h sense is computed for the linearized g y j r models quantifying these input output relationship larger values were verified for those species that had incorporated the mussels into their diets therefore the relationship of causality between the golden mussel invasion and changes on cpue and k values is indeed reasonable to illustrate the achieved modelling results figs 6 8 show a comparison between the models and the real field data for the output dynamics of three species h isbrueckeri s nasutus and a lacustris respectively 13 13 similar results were achieved for the other fish communities and are not shown due to lack of space the simulations considered additive colored noise to mimic the effect of other disturbances w ν from these figures it can be concluded that the proposed model yields good accurate results remark 5 to assess the quality of the obtained control oriented models several procedures were performed including cross validation and parameter sensitivity analysis they are not presented here due to lack of space but served to conclude that the achieved models indeed presented a good fidelity with respect to the available data thus describing relatively well the dynamics of cpue and k factor with and without the presence of the golden mussel which is enough for our control purposes 4 proposed closed loop control algorithm in this section the second main contribution of this work is developed i e to propose and test a predictive control method that could be implemented in practice by the means of environmental management policies in order to mitigate the effect disrupted by the invasion of the golden mussel upon the fish communities of the upper uruguay river 4 1 control objectives the golden mussel should be removed in such a way that the life conditions cpue k of the three most affected species return to an ecologically balanced condition such as prior to the invasion this section debates such control objectives in this work the control signal u stands for the amount of l fortunei to be withdrawn from the upper uruguay river waters given in percentage while g stands for the presence of the mussel noted as 100 from the invasion date 2012 onwards as described in assumption 1 to apply feedback control policies a non isolated model of the studied ecological system must be presented they correspond to the identified polynomial discrete time model given by eqs 1 and 2 with g k replaced by g k u k this results in a model that takes into account the presence of the mussel g and the control action human intervention u 4 x j k 1 a 1 1 j x j k a 1 n j j x j k 1 n j a p j 1 j x j k p j a p j n j j x j k 1 n j p j b 1 1 j g k u k b 1 n j j g k n j u k n j b p j 1 j g k u k p j b p j n j j g k 1 n j u k 1 n j p j b ν b j t ν k w k 5 y j k y j 1 k y j 2 k x j 1 k x j 2 k x j 3 k β j d j g k u k to elucidate the non isolated model 4 and 5 represents the discrete time dynamics of the ecological system and its outputs due to the presence of the mussel g constant as 100 and the human intervention by means of establishing environmental policies that act to withdraw mussel from the water u it is implied with this model that a controller determines a removal quota u at each sampling instant k then within the following sampling period three months the actuation that corresponds to such u k is performed the dynamics of the actuator the management policies determined by environmental agencies are assumed to be negligible with respect to the model sampling period of three months 14 14 it is assumed that the effects of the actuation arise on the non isolated system within three months roughly once actuation will be performed alongside sampling the environmental policy would represent a discrete pulse sequence signal these policies are assumed to be realized within a few days or so for instance this actuation could be the addition of mussel consuming fish or mollusk oriented pesticides diluted into water in ten days moreover this model assumes that there is a direct correlation of the amount of mussel removal u k to the amount of actuation mathematically this is stated as 6 u t u k u k kt s t k 1 t s where u t is the actual control policy to be implemented by environmental agencies it must be stressed out that the goal of this paper is neither to analyse nor to discusse possible in loci ecological control efforts to reduce the abundance of the l fortunei this is a topic to be addressed by the environmental agencies themselves the control paradigm here proposed only determines adequate mussel removal references nevertheless it has been discussed in recent literature that the golden mussel can be filtered or removed partially from the water via the addition of some chemical molluscicides such as chloride please refer to sylvester et al 2005 boltovskoy and cataldo 1999 iummato et al 2018 gattás et al 2018 boltovskoy et al 2013 such tests are done usually inside closed hydroelectric plants that exhibit problems due to the presence of the golden mussel incrusted on shovels tubes and so on note that all of these studies presents works in terms of how effective are different kinds of mussel filtering methods but none of them in fact analyse how to periodically act with this filtering mechanism itself as done in feedback control such as in this work also note that the filtering rates themselves are not taken into account in this paper because different actuation approaches might be chosen by the environmental agency nonetheless this does not add much complexity in terms of control given that these rates usually stand for the response of first order linear systems the present work does not aim to actually implement an automatic controller that removes in practice the golden mussel from the water so that ecological balance is restored in the upper uruguay river as in silveira and pagano 2005 2004 the goal is to determine control signals u that can be implemented in practice by the means of management policies established by environmental agencies in other words the problem of determining an automatic controller that sets feasible control laws which can be implemented by such agencies is tackled in this work the control strategy that makes such implementation possible is presented in the sequence note that for the studied ecological system the control law u will be applied to the system itself by an actuator if a discrete time piecewise constant removal policy u k is found by some feedback controller then in real life an actuation law would be derived to be implemented by the environmental policies from the moment that u is determined by some feedback controller the isolated ecological system 1 and 2 becomes non isolated as given by eqs 4 and 5 thus this control law must be adequate and compatible with the studied ecological system and with the implementation by the means of environmental policies inadequate choices of control laws could for instance excite unmodeled dynamics or even make the mathematical model of the plant invalid in such way that future predictions of the behaviour of the real system would not be accurate therefore two adequate signals are sought in this section i a feasible type of control law and ii a compatible reference performance 4 2 control law as discussed in silveira and pagano 2005 2004 it has to be remarked that the implementation of a certain control policy derived from u k in the real ecological system may light upon two starring issues a feedback control in the continuous time domain would require the measurement of the abundance and k condition factor of each analysed fish community at every instant of time however this is not possible in the system here considered and as its dynamics are slow a discrete control strategy is to be used b the control signal should essentially model the human action on the studied aquatic ecosystem as argued above the human action corresponds to environmental policies actuation the work by beddington and may 1980 discusses that a constant harvest quota is an ideal possibility of that can lead to maximum sustainable yields in fisheries in parallel pimentel et al 2005 analyses the environmental and economic costs associated with invasive species in the usa thus it seems reasonable to consider that the removal of the golden mussel to be adopted in practice by environmental agencies is piecewise constant as in 6 with t s 3 months this is a fair hypothesis to consider since three month periodic sampling protocol is already performed on the region henceforth this paper follows the suggestion proposed in silveira and pagano 2004 2005 consider a piecewise constant control signal generated from periodic measurements every t s 3 months one will consider that 7 u k 0 for k 0 u k u k 1 δ u k for k 0 note that the control law 6 that derives from the above u k will clearly be a piecewise constant signal it must be pointed out that k 0 stands for the instant corresponding to the last sampled field data year of 2016 apart from being piecewise constant the control law u must obey two other main restrictions in order to be implementable in practice 1 it must depart from u 0 0 i e the mussels are 100 present in the year of last observation 2016 2 it must have slow negative variations in order to be consistent with a practical removal policy of the mollusk from water due to actuation via environmental policies mathematically both these restrictions stand for constraints upon the signal u and its variation δu k u k u k 1 for the control action to be slow these variation must be small this leads to 8 δ u u k 1 u k δ u k 0 9 0 u k 1 k 0 note that 9 follows from assumption 1 moreover the actual amount of mussel in the water at each sampling instant is given by g k u k 4 3 reference performance it is imperious to mention that the plant being controlled is a complex living system and not an inanimate machine thence one concludes that the dynamics cpue k of each fish community in a controlled closed loop non isolated situation should be similar to those of the isolated system silveira and pagano 2004 2005 the control objectives of this work are to return the life conditions of the ten most abundant fish communities to ecologically balanced baselines of course this may be a harsh extremely costly goal nonetheless in order to achieve this the measured outputs y j 1 and y j 2 of each species should return to similar values as those prior to the mussel invasion thus the following reference signals shall be considered y j 1 r and y j 2 r which are designed respectively for y j 1 and y j 2 for each species j when the studied ecological system becomes non isolated controlled it is desired that each output follows its corresponding references signal closely mathematically speaking the equivalent constraints to do so are 10 lim k n p y j 1 k y j 1 r k ξ j 1 n p 11 lim k n p y j 2 k y j 2 r k ξ j 2 n p where n p is a prediction horizon that corresponds to the time interval of t p n p t s notice that ξ j 1 k and ξ j 2 k are slack variables to be minimized furthermore upper and lower constraints upon the reference signal are also considered to be coherent with ecological observation a 20 reference envelope is considered 12 0 8 y j 1 r k y j 1 k 1 2 y j 1 r k 13 0 8 y j 2 r k y j 2 k 1 2 y j 2 r k as it is desired that the dynamics of the non isolated system are coherent with respect to those of the original isolated one the reference signals y j 1 r k and y j 2 r k must be such that the settling periods 15 15 notion of how long does a system take to stabilize of the closed loop plant are close to those of the natural isolated plant to do so since the original isolated system 1 and 2 is stable with g 0 it is natural to consider the following reference system 14 y j r k y j 1 r k y j 2 r k x j 1 r k x j 2 r k x j 3 r k β j where the reference states x j r are given by the isolated model 1 with g k 0 and x j r 0 as equal to the last available field measurements year of 2016 notice that such references are in accordance with the settling period of each y j 4 4 controlling the presence of the golden mussel the control and performance objectives presented in the beginning of this section must be taken into account directly when computing the control action this may not be done directly via standard pid techniques but is easily handled by the mpc framework which is thus used in the sequel first of all a key assumption on the studied ecological system has to be made the dynamics of 4 and 5 are sufficiently slow such that the computational time to determine and implement the control signal u can be disregarded silveira and pagano 2005 2004 this is in fact true for the ecological system under investigation since the control signal will be computed at most within some minutes by some quadratic solver whereas period of 1 and 2 is in the order of years or months now consider the following a well posed quadratic function j 16 16 in fact j is a function of many variables that is j j u x 1 x 10 y 1 1 r y 10 1 r y 1 2 r y 10 2 r ξ 1 1 ξ 10 1 ξ 1 2 ξ 10 2 n p 15 j i 1 n p j 1 10 α j y j 1 k i k y j 1 r k i k ξ j 1 k i k 2 i 1 n p j 1 10 λ j y j 2 k i k y j 2 r k i k ξ j 2 k i k 2 j 0 n p 1 q u u k i k 2 where n p is a given prediction horizon and q u α j and λ j are weighting parameters the notation k i k stands for a model based prediction for instant k j made at instant k a vector u of control efforts inside the prediction horizon to be optimized is also considered 16 u k u k k u k 1 k u k n p 1 k t furthermore take each ξ j as 17 ξ j k ξ j 1 k 1 k ξ j 1 k n p k ξ j 2 k 1 k ξ j 2 k n p k t note that j given in eq 15 is formulated in such way that it can be directly solved by a model predictive control framework see camacho and bordons 2013 moreover mpc determines by definition control laws of the form of eq 7 therefore the mpc approach to mitigate the effect of the golden mussel invasion in the upper uruguay consists in minimizing the cost function j at every discrete time step k in a computational time smaller than the sampling period t s of three months with respect to the previously discussed constraints that is 18 min u ξ 1 ξ 10 j subject to reference constraints eqs 12 and 13 reference system eq 14 control signal constraints eqs 8 and 9 model based predictions eqs 4 and 5 if this problem is adequately solved by a quadratic optimizer then eqs 10 and 11 will be met which means that the most affected species by the l fortunei shall once again exhibit ecologically balanced life conditions in terms of condition k factor and abundance 5 results analysis and discussion in this section numerical simulation results are presented and discussed considering the problem of regulating the effect of the golden mussel invasion in the upper uruguay river within the nonlinear model predictive control framework as the control goal is to force the most abundant species to return to ecologically balanced conditions in terms of abundance and k factor table 4 elucidates the weighting parameters used and mean steady state reference values note that such chosen references values stand for the mean variations of y j 1 and y j 2 pior to the invasion of the mussel the control weighting paramaters α j and λ j are chosen so that the reference tracking control is prioritized according to the discussing given in morato et al 2019 reference tracking of abundance values are prioritized for a affinis j 1 i labrosus j 6 and p valenciennis j 8 while of k factor values for a affinis j 1 h isbrueckeri j 5 i labrosus j 6 and p valenciennis j 8 in sort the control aims to remove the mussel in such way that the most affected fish species in terms of abundance and k factor return to ecologically balanced conditions larger α j and λ j stand for higher priority note that α j 1 while λ j 2 so as to determine the cost function j with normalized weights at most equal to 2 that further prioritizes 11 over 10 once λ j α j the remaining weight q u is taken as 0 5 so to penalize excessive control action the rate constraints used are δ u 4 5 and δ u 0 such constraints 17 17 such values were chosen via empirical observations and plausible removal action refer to gattás et al 2018 imply that the computed control signal must be monotonically decreasing with respect to k which is coherent with the control constraint to only remove mussel from the water and adding more mussel is not allowed since it would not make practical sense these values mean ecologically speaking that the addition of a biological inhibitor that eradicates the golden mussel to the water may only remove at most 4 5 per each 3 months interval the nmpc problem given by eq 18 is nonlinear and highly constrained due to the inherent polynomial models proposed in section 3 therefore its computational complexity is quite large when using full model predictions to balance the nmpc with adequate results smaller predictions horizon are sought thereby one has chosen that the prediction horizon is of n p 3 samples this means that the control action computed at a given instant k is concerned with its effect on the non isolated biological system up to 3t s i e nine months ahead of time moreover such prediction horizon is consistent with the condition that the proposed polynomial models were balanced for a given somewhat steady state operation point p 0 and therefore longer horizons might imply in an exceedingly large model plant mismatch once the outputs would distance themselves from such point it must also be noticed that the chosen nmpc formulation takes into account the same value for both prediction and control horizons i e n c n p indeed sometimes the control horizon can be chosen smaller than the prediction horizon and still yield results as good as if they were equal with smaller computational effort nonetheless in this work the available computational time is in the range of days and therefore there is no problem in using n c n p 3 with all these parameters and weights the nmpc strategy was synthesized with the aid of the software packages matlab mathworks 2017 and yalmip toolbox lofberg 2004 the average computational time of the proposed strategy is in the range of a few seconds with modern desktops 18 18 the following results come from numerical simulation on a 2 4 ghz 8 gb ram macintosh computer which is obviously smaller than the sampling period t s before presenting the actual results the feedback control logic must be once more recalled the numerical simulations shown in the sequel consider that at each three months from 2016 onwards i measurements are made in loci in terms of abundance y j 1 and k factor y j 2 ii these measurements are fed to a computer that computes a control action solving the nmpc problem given by eq 18 and iii via management policies established by environmental agencies such control action is to be implemented in the same sampling protocol pulse like actuation the insight that the following results present is very simple to grasp naturally if 100 of the mussel were to be removed ecologically balanced life conditions of the analysed fish species would once again be attained just as prior to the invasion but if some references are set as in table 4 an automatic controller can compute via simulation with the identified models within a few seconds minutes how much mussel should be removed so that such reference performances are achieved and it does not necessarily mean to remove 100 of it which would stand for an exceedingly large ecological effort in the obtained results it can be seen that by removing only 65 of the total initial amount of the mussel would already allow very interesting life conditions for the majority of the predominant fish species the presence of mussel g k u k is seen in fig 9 as well as the corresponding removal policy u k to be implemented by an environmental agency notice that such steady state value is found after approximately 20 months of almost constant removal of mussel close to 4 per sampling such non isolated control duration is compatible with the isolated ecological system s settling time which raises a guarantee of real life applicability of the proposed nmpc loop reader must bear in mind that the control policy u computed by the nmpc loop given in fig 9 is essentially a constant mussel removal policy such kind of law has been found once no load disturbances were considered in the numerical simulations presented only colored noise w such load perturbations to the non isolated ecological system in fact occur in real life and in practice the nmpc would act to overcome their effects on the measured outputs nonetheless it is impossible to simulate them numerically with fidelity once these disturbances say for instance presence of resource of predator fish etc have not been quantified in the proposed polynomial model figs 10 12 present real data from t 0 months up to 120 i e from 2006 to 2016 with the invasion occurring in 2012 i e t 60 months and simulation data with the nmpc loop from this point onwards figs 10 and 11 show cpue reference tracking while fig 12 shows k factor reference tracking these results consider additive coloured noise to mimic the effect of an unknown noise w in eqs 4 and 5 moreover measurement noise ν is considered as a white random signal with zero mean the results in terms of abundance cpue reference tracking for the following species are seen in fig 10 a affinis j 1 i labrosus j 6 and p valenciennis j 8 notice that the controlled non isolated plant is able to remain close to the aimed abundance references ecologically balanced values with the nmpc control law notice moreover that the settling time of such control action is within 5 6 years which is compatible with the isolated system and that these results are possible with an almost constant δu k 4 5 for all k which ensures further implementation feasibility via environmental policies in fig 11 the first plot of fig 10 is shown in greater detail which explicitly exhibits the used reference signal y j 1 r showing the upper and lower bounds i e eq 12 and 13 used by the nmpc loop clearly the used reference is in accordance with the ecological system s isolated behaviour the results in terms of k factor reference tracking for the following species are seen in fig 12 a affinis j 1 h isbrueckeri j 5 i labrosus j 6 and p valenciennis j 8 once again it is clear that the non isolated plant is also able to follow the aimed k factor references ecologically balanced values with the nmpc control law finally notice that in both figs 10 and 12 the non isolated system stabilized once the control action remains constant near the original ecological equilibrium point prior to the invasion of the mussel in the upper uruguay river waters 6 conclusions this paper presented a nonlinear model predictive control strategy that aims to restore ecological balance of the upper uruguay river due to the biological invasion by the golden mussel l fortunei this strategy periodically every three months determines controls that in principle may be implemented by environmental agencies by the means of ecological management policies in terms of the main contributions of this paper it must be stressed that a polynomial model was proposed to describe the discrete time dynamics of the life dynamics k condition factor and abundance of ten fish communities affected by the golden mussel invasion such model was identified and validated very good results model data fidelity were obtained numerical simulations were shown demonstrating that the proposed nmpc strategy if applied in practice would be able to re balance the fish ecology of the upper uruguay river previously unsettled by the invasion of the l fortunei for future works robustness analysis considering other sources of external disturbances may be considered in the control scheme here proposed as well as including the actuator dynamics in the model acknowledgements authors thank engie consórcio de itá cnpq and capes for funding 
25033,the invasion of exotic species in aquatic environments is one of the several disturbance factors responsible for altering the dynamics of fish communities the golden mussel limnoperna fortunei was first recorded in the upper uruguay river brazil in 2012 and since then it has been needed to discuss and evaluate how this invasive species interferes with the dynamics of the ten most abundant fishes of this region literature lacks works that investigate how to model and control the effect of such kind of invasion this paper proposes a polynomial nonlinear state space representation to model the dynamics of the these fish communities whose parameters are identified with the use of least squares procedures considering in loci collected data from 2007 to 2016 this work also evaluates quantitatively by relying on simulation results how the sudden presence of the golden mussel medelled with the aquatic life of the upper uruguay river the obtained model allows some ambitious automatic control objectives using a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc approach an automatic controller is designed to determine how much and how often the golden mussel should be removed from the water in order for the most affected species to once again exhibit sustainable life conditions in terms of its k condition factor and abundance the nmpc strategy is synthesized considering performance constraints and piecewise constant control trajectories by relying on simulation results this work elucidates how an automatic controller could be implemented as management policies established by environmental agencies to gradually restore the fish ecological balance of the upper uruguay river previously unsettled by an exotic invasor keywords predictive control of invasive species systems biology fish condition factor upper uruguay river nonlinear model 1 introduction 1 1 ecological feedback control for many years the study of differential equations was considered an advanced topic in biomathematics and therefore beyond the reach of most biologists milton 2015 nonetheless this barrier became weaker over the last few years due to an increasing number of textbooks on biomathematics easily implementable software packages and the growth of multi disciplinary workshops bringing together ecologist biologists and engineers to exchange ideas concerning feedback control in mutual beneficence a recognized principle of ecology is that the interactions between organisms and their environment occur in reciprocal ways the environment meddles with the terms by which life goes on although organisms influence the conditions that prevail in their environment translating this to feedback control the conditions of the organisms controlled outputs are given with respect to the environments changes control inputs and disturbances in essence there exist two primary reasons for developing control strategies for ecological systems cunha and pagano 2002 meza et al 2002 silveira and pagano 2005 2004 the first is to permit a sustainable exploitation of its assets the other is to restore some harmonic ecological balance 1 1 the main problem of feedback control is how to determine adequate control inputs over time such that the controlled outputs attain an expected performance for instance in the case of ecological systems this issue translates into how much a biological invasor has to be removed for an invaded system to return to some nominal sustainable condition avoiding a possible environmental catastrophe disrupted by the invasor given this context the control of biological and ecological systems is rather new in the literature some first attempts towards this issue were written in the 60s by stark and young 1964 and atkinson 1965 anyhow from then on only few works have successfully presented effective studies that depart from scratch present dynamic modelling and actually reach good experimental results some of these are listed below in terms of automatica publications the modelling identification and control of denitrifying biofilters is studied in bourrel et al 2000 in alexiadis et al 2007 a dynamical model for membranes is proposed in harmand et al 2008 the issue of controlling microbial ecology with molecular biology is studied most importantly in silveira and pagano 2005 and silveira and pagano 2004 an approach to control predator prey system is presented using piecewise constant controls and low sampling rates which thus allow practical implementation by means of management policies established by environmental agencies notice that most of these works are data derived simulation results with respect to ecology journals a few other works must be remembered state space models for marked individuals have been analysed by gimenez et al 2007 considering nonlinear state space dynamic models for ecological systems some methods for their estimation have been studied in pedersen et al 2011 in jones et al 2017 some dynamic models are presented for the management of invasive species considering the control of the grey squirrel on anglesey using optimal control theory edholm et al 2018 discussed how to manage invasive insect species 1 2 the ecological problem commonly known as the golden mussel limnoperna fortunei fig 1 is a freshwater bivalve mollusk from the mytilidae family native from rivers and streams in china and southeast asia this small mollusk is nowadays a major ecological issue in brazil considering favorable conditions of growth and dispersion a recent work made a prevision that this mollusk will reach the northern regions of the country until 2050 barbosa et al 2018 which in practice would lead to a real ecological catastrophe in a national scale the invasion of the golden mussel in the upper uruguay river occurred in 2012 agudo padrón et al 2012 this has directly and indirectly affected the incipient ichthyofauna and this invasor has been incorporated into the diets of some local fishes as discussed in cantanhêde et al 2008 lopes and vieira 2012 in addition this filter feeding mollusk moves large amounts of plankton in the water column to the sediment as pseudofeces fachini et al 2012 changing the availability of resources in the freshwater ecosystem little is known about the dynamics of how the l fortunei affects the ecology of this river in terms of fish abundance and condition factor of the most abundant fish species in fish biology such factor informs the physiological state of fish lima junior et al 2002 further details are provided in section 2 furthermore to the best of authors knowledge there are no studies that have actually touch the issue of what are the practical effects of mussel s presence with respect to the fish communities 2 2 regarding solely the dynamic modelling issue a prior preliminary paper has been presented by the present authors in morato et al 2019 and how can these effects be reverted 3 3 regarding actual automatic control strategies derived from accurate models no study has been made such predicted ecological catastrophe disrupted by the invasion of the golden mussel might be avoided if adequate environmental management policies are delimited these policies can be found also using feedback control many feedback control approaches have been studied in the literature the present authors previously investigated the use of pid controllers tuned with standard loop shaping techniques for such goal in morato et al 2019 via simulation results however the obtained results were not so satisfying once the complex model of this ecological system had to be significantly simplified for the tuning procedure and the implementation constraints could not be directly taken into account nonetheless the simulation results shown in morato et al 2019 suggest that control techniques that takes into account a full model and implementation constraints such as the model predictive control mpc framework could possibly result in interesting achievements mpc is now a very well established technique with a wide range of industrial applications it is a natural methodology towards optimal 4 4 note that the term optimal is used herein to represent the best possible option control of processes subject to constraints as introduced in camacho and bordons 2013 mpc computes some optimal control action at every computational instant by solving a quadratic optimization problem written in terms of the process model this control framework allows to explicitly consider the effect of input output and state constraints in the control design procedure which is rather convenient it has to be remarked that as in any standard discrete control method mpc laws are piecewise constant signals for sampled data systems and therefore this is the framework used in this work 1 3 paper contributions to model the ecological system considered in this work is a complex task and very few results in this sense have been seen in the literature moreover having available field data in large scale to correctly validate ecological models is also rare during the last decade or so extensive work has been carried out by the lapad ufsc research group in brazil in order to collect and analyse data of various fish communities of the upper uruguay river avila simas 2018 the main motivation of this work is to propose and validade strategies that could lead to management policies of the l fortunei established by environmental agencies hence the main contribution with respect to prior discussions is twofold i firstly to obtain accurate dynamic models from the vast available field data of this region from lapad having adequate models allows one to make future predictions as well as to possibly apply feedback control techniques such as mpc laws ii then to propose and test a predictive control method that could be implemented in practice by the means of environmental management policies in order to mitigate reject the effect of this ecological invasor upon fish communities and by doing so restore ecological balance synthetically this paper proposes tests and analyses a model predictive control strategy for the regulation of the ecological effect of the golden mussel in the upper uruguay river all of this development is done of course considering the region of the upper uruguay river and based on field data sampled therein before and after the invasion period numerical simulations are presented to assess the results in terms of modelling and control it must be clearly stressed that this paper presents simulation results derived from data based models it is not in this work s intents to show or investigate how to suppress the golden mussel from the water with respect to this matter literature shows that there is a great difficulty on controlling invasive bivalves such as the experience with the zebra mussel ricciardi et al 1998 nalepa and schloesser 1992 strayer 2009 which motivates whole other practical investigation threads 1 4 organization of the paper the paper is organized as follows first of all fish ecology preliminaries are recalled in section 2 in order to adequate this paper to readers of both domains ecology and automatic control the proposed polynomial nonlinear state space model is presented in section 3 together with its least squares identification procedure section 4 presents the control performance objectives of the studied problem and most importantly presents the discrete control algorithm based on a nonlinear model predictive control technique that can be used to determine how often and how much of the golden mussel has to be withdrawn from the upper uruguay in order for the most affected fish species to return to ecological balance 5 5 throughout this paper ecological balance is meant as a situation in which the fish species present values of abundance and life condition factor close to the ones observed prior to the mussel invasion synthetically it is understood that the golden mussel invasion disrupted an ecologically unbalanced condition in the upper uruguay river that supposably can be partially reverted section 5 presents the obtained numerical simulation results of the proposed automatic control strategy the work ends with conclusions 2 fish ecology this section recalls some preliminaries notations and methodologies with respect to fish ecology 2 1 biological invasions recently most countries have been facing complex problems concerning the invasion of exotic species in their territories some examples are the zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha that impacts fishing mollusk diversity and electric energy generation in north america the water hyacinth eichornia crassipes which brought great issues to the navigation of lakes and rivers of congo egypt and many watercourses throughout the african continent patel 2012 the giant african snail achatina fulica that represents a threat to public health natural environments and agriculture and also new pathogenic organisms viruses bacterias protozoa that affect human animal and vegetal populations in various regions mcneely 2001 griffiths et al 1991 patel 2012 colley 2010 together with overexploitation and habitat destruction these biological invasions are pointed as the main cause for the loss of biodiversity and one of the key factor to provoke global changes sala et al 2000 elliott 2012 townsend et al 2003 various studies indicate that bio invasions are related to at least 38 of the total animal extinctions brown and lomolino 1998 and are also being responsible direct or indirectly for 49 of endangered species in the usa mack et al 2000 in terms of fish biodiversity studies point out that bio invasions are related to 50 of the extinctions in the world baillie et al 2004 2 2 the golden mussel limnoperna fortunei several biotic and abiotic factors influence fish dynamics in freshwater environments these influences can be reflected in the abundance of individuals by altering their reproduction and or feeding behaviours and even their well being in subtropical regions temperature is one of the main factors that influence fish dynamics however human intervention can be responsible for the invasion of exotic species in aquatic environments whether unintentionally or intentionally these invasions may have an even greater impact on the dynamics of the species and can often overlap changes provoked by abiotic factors the first records of biological invasions caused by the limnoperna fortunei date from 1965 in hong kong morton and miller 1973 and later in 1990 in japan magara et al 2001 and taiwan ricciardi 1998 in south america the golden mussel was first recorded in the prata river in argentina uruguay in 1993 darrigran and pastorino 1993 shifting through the paraná river waters in brazil the mussel dispersed north reaching five countries in a period of ten years argentina 1991 uruguay 1994 paraguay 1997 brazil and bolivia 1998 as stated in belz et al 2010 in the brazilian territory this species was first recorded in 1998 in two southern states de oliveira et al 2006 and then its presence was detected in the hydroelectric plant of itaipu zanella and marenda 2002 and in the state of são paulo avelar et al 2004 captured l fortunei specimens from the upper uruguay river between the states of santa catarina and rio grande do sul in brazil are shown in fig 2 these specimens were retrieved from the digestive tract of different fish caught in this region a paraloricaria vetula b c hypostomus roseopunctatus and d crenicichla celidochilus in a recent study realized in the paraná river mouth sylvester et al 2007 it was noticed that the golden mussel s predators in majority were capable of consuming approximately 6 kg of mussel per square meter reducing in up to 90 of the mussel biomass by analysing the digestory tract of commercial fish from the same river oliveira et al 2010 remarked that 67 of analysed species consumed l fortunei nonetheless both of these works together with iummato et al 2018 gattás et al 2018 discuss that the predatory suppression of the mussel seems rather unlikely and not a simple task being a topic for further investigation certainly the intense consumption of the mussel by a predatory species may represent an important role in the reduction of the mussel in environments with a great spread proliferation of such invasor also some filtering techniques can be used to undermine their procreation the goal of this paper is not to discuss how the removal of the mussel will be in fact performed but an essential and open question is to determine how much and how often has the golden mussel to be filtered for the aquatic fauna to return to ecologically balanced conditions the entry of the l fortunei in a new environment may provoke alterings in the native biodiversity due to resource competition darrigran and damborenea 2005 causing unmeasurable ecosystem impact also negative impacts also appear related to the hydroelectric energy generations once these mollusks fix themselves in cooling channels forcing a complete stop of the plants operation for their removal nakano and strayer 2014 which is actually very costly because human divers have to remove these mollusks individually from the channels 2 3 sampling protocol to investigate the effects caused in the upper uruguay river by the invasion of the golden mussel dating around 2012 fish were sampled in loci every three months to characterize each of the four seasons of the year between february 2007 and november 2016 by the lapad research team eight sampling sites were evaluated around the area influenced by the itá dam in brazil comprising the uruguay river some tributaries and diverse environments in the reservoir area this period of course covers the events before and after the invasion by the l fortunei samplings were carried out with a set of gill nets with different mesh sizes ranging from 1 5 to 8 0 cm adjacent knots plus hook and line cast net and seine to sample different fish populations in the studied area the fishing effort was approximately constant over time at all eight sampling sites which allows a comparison between data from different seasons fig 3 shows the eight sampling sites in the region of the upper uruguay river brazil these sites are represented by bold dots 2 4 fish community abundance to describe the abundance of fish communities near the itá reservoir over the 10 years of study this work opts for the use of the catch per unit effort cpue measurement this unit describes how many individuals are caught with gill nets of 100 m2 within 12 h usually used in aquaculture and conservation biology this measure is an indirect indicator of the abundance of some given species changes in the cpue of a given species mean that there is also some change in the species abundance as states puertas and bodmer 2004 constant cpue stand for sustainable harvesting while decreasing cpue are related to overexploitation a total of 42 282 fish were caught from 2007 to 2016 within the coverage area of the itá reservoir and the ten most abundant 6 6 these are 1 apareiodon affinis 2 astyanax fasciatus 3 astyanax lacustris 4 acestrorhynchus pantaneiro 5 hypostomus isbrueckeri 6 iheringichthys labrosus 7 loricariichthys anus 8 parapimelodus valenciennis 9 steindachnerina brevipinna 10 schizodon nasutus fish species represented 70 52 of this total to illustrate how the cpue became influenced by the presence of the mussel fig 4 7 7 note that in this figure and in the ones that follow the vertical red line golden mussel invasion stands for the first record of the limnoperna fortunei in the upper uruguay river waters shows the variations over time for the mean cpue measurement from the eight sampling sites for apareiodon affinis loricariichthys anus and iheringichthys labrosus it is evident that the invasion of the mussel disrupted variation effects on the abundance of these species once their mean cpue variations increase for the two later species and decreases for the first the evidence of effects caused by the mussel was also verified for the other seven species 2 5 well being of fish communities k factor the k condition factor is an index that is widely used to evaluate the welfare of fish communities vazzoler 1996 this factor is computed via a weight length relationship and quantitatively presents the physiological conditions of the analysed fish such factor is correlated with changes in biotic and abiotic variables lizama and ambrosio 2002 and it can be interpreted roughly as the human body mass index bmi for fishes after all fish caught in the samplings were identified all specimens were measured considering total length and mass the condition factor k can be computed with the use of k m l β where m stands for the mass of a given specimen in a sample measured in g and l represents the length of that same individual measured in cm the average k value for a given species is obtained as the average k for the specimens in a sample the parameter β is a length mass ratio related for each fish species as discussed by le cren 1951 this parameter varies for each species as depicted in table 1 therein species are enumerated from 1 to 10 in respect to the alfabetical given in footnote 6 it must be remarked that this parameter should not be used to compare distinct fish species once its value is intrinsically linked to the body morphology of each fish species larger values of k stand for rounder fish with greater body height while smaller values are observed for elongated and spindle shaped species for readers to grasp how the fish condition factor is indeed disrupted by the golden mussel invasion fig 5 shows the variations over time for the mean cpue measurement from the eight sampling sites for iheringichthys labrosus schizodon nasutus and apareiodon affinis it is evident that the invasion of the mussel disrupted variation effects on the life condition of these species which was also verified for the other seven fish communities the first two species present an average increase on the k factor whereas the latter presents a small average decrease 3 dynamic modelling once the preliminaries have been presented and the situation of the invasion of the golden mussel in the upper uruguay river has been detailed this section proposes a dynamical model to describe the effect of the presence of the l fortunei upon the fish community ecology of the upper uruguay river note that if feedback control goals are sought a good model is necessary to provide a mathematical description of how the system will behave due applied inputs and external disturbances it must be noticed that the sampled data described in section 2 stand for three month periodic measurements of each one of the ten most abundant fish species in each of the eight sampling sites which represents an enormous amount of data to find an adequate model the describes the relationship of the golden mussel presence and the k and cpue values two alternate paths may be followed i to model the dynamics of each sampling site independently or ii to model the average dynamics of the fish in the upper uruguay river this work opts for the second path and therefore uses mean values to describe the global situation of the river by using weighted averages from the data of the eight distinct sampling sites which reduces the amount of data by an eighth 3 1 chosen model firstly two phenomena have to be mathematically evaluated the presence or not of the golden is given by a discrete time function g k and the removal of the mussel from the water is given as u k which is to be determined by the predictive feedback controller and implemented in practice as environmental management policies for now the system is modelled as an isolated open loop condition without human intervention i e u is null once no feedback control loop is set in section 4 closed loop assessments are discussed an open loop plant is one with no feedback control action u while closed loop has u is computed as a function of the measurable outputs y j with a working feedback controller likewise translating these two terms to ecology an open loop ecological system is said isolated i e u 0 and a closed loop one non isolated with direct human interference i e u 0 thus the ecological system is modelled considering that for each species namely j two outputs y j r are measured every three months the k factor and abundance factor cpue recall that both these outputs are related to the life conditions of a given fish community which has been unsettled by the invasion of the golden mussel these two outputs depend on the presence of the golden mussel g apart from other factors noise ν and other disturbances w also the system has some internal states x j that can be used to obtain y j via dynamic models in this study the states x j can be understood as the cpue average mass m and average length l of each species now considering a state space modelling representation the dynamics over time of the outputs y j of the ten most abundant each species j 1 10 with respect to the order of species in table 1 due to the presence of the golden mussel g the following state polynomial discrete time model for the isolated ecological system is proposed 8 8 such polynomial framework was chosen once good preliminary results were obtained in morato et al 2019 where the discrete variable k corresponds to the samples in time of every 3 months i e t kt s for t s 3 months state polynomial 1 x j 1 k 1 x j 2 k 1 x j 3 k 1 x j k 1 a 1 1 j x j k a 1 n j j x j k 1 n j a p j 1 j x j k p j a p j n j j x j k 1 n j p j b 1 1 j g k b 1 n j j g k 1 n j b p j 1 j g k p j b p j n j j g k n j p j b ν b j t ν k w k nonlinear outputs 2 y j k y j 1 k y j 2 k x j 1 k x j 2 k x j 3 k β j d j g k in eqs 1 and 2 x j 1 stands for the cpue of the species j x j 2 for the average mass of j and x j 3 for the average length of j notation v p means that every component of vector v is raised to the power p a j b p j n j j are constant matrices parameter p j stands for the maximal polynomial dependence of 1 while n j represents the order of the system note that the proposed model is output wise nonlinear due to y j 2 furthermore notice that the sudden presence of the mussel at instant k is directly seen in the outputs 9 9 in automatica this is said to be a direct energy transfer from input g to outputs via matrix d j remark 1 in avila simas 2018 empirical observation derived from a series of biological and ecological tests verified that there is no physical coupling between the states length mass abundance of different fish species j this means that there is no sense to consider a model that incorporates the dynamics of more than one species at once furthermore these tests verified that these three states are not necessarily coupled between themselves which means that matrices a 1 1 j a p j n j j are fixed as block diagonal ones remark 2 it is essential that the proposed model takes into consideration samples from prior invasion periods as well as post invasion this resides in the fact that the internal dynamics of the life growth conditions of the fish species must be described by the isolated model the proposed model is control oriented which means it must present good fidelity in the considered control situations so that the achieved simulation results presented later on in section 5 can be trustworthy 3 2 identification procedure now that the proposed model has been detailed this subsection is dedicated to the identification of the model parameters that is estimating all matrices in eq 1 for each of the ten most abundant species j in the upper uruguay river firstly some assumptions have to be made assumption 1 the presence of the golden mussel g k from 2012 onwards can be somewhat accurately modelled as a step function varying from 0 no presence to 1 100 present at some instant k assumption 2 noise is distributed uniformly between states and outputs mathematically this is expressed by taking b ν as an identity matrix also to take into account the effect of other unknown ecological variables that do influence the fish dynamics term b j w k is taken as distributed colored non gaussian noise remark 3 an exact quantification of the amount of golden mussel in upper uruguay river is not well known in the present this is why this work opts for a percentage signal which means that the proposed model is normalized with respect to g the absolute value g corresponding to 100 is to be determined in future works the density of the mussel can be obtained via meticulous sampling and counting the number of adult specimens per m2 which can be extended to the area of the river note that while the presence of the golden mussel g is normalized the field data states and outputs are not therefore without loss of generality g can be considered as 1 with a normalization b n j j of the matrices b n j j in eq 1 once the identification of b n j j is performed with the normalized input g 1 one may then take b 1 n j j b 1 n j j g b 2 n j j b 2 n j j g 2 and so on where g is the absolute value for the presence of mussel so as to transform the normalized percentage data model into an absolute one data data in order to identify the proposed model an extended least squares method is applied to the available field data from the fish sampling sites considering eqs 1 and 2 this method is very well established in the literature see ljung 1998 and aims to achieve non biased unpolarized parameters ρ models matrices by minimizing the quadratic difference between model y j k for each species j and field measurements y j f k its main steps applied for each of the ten species separately are rapidly recalled in the sequel i solve the following quadratic problem 3 min ρ 1 n k 1 n y j f k y j k 2 with an n steps horizon for the ten considered years n 40 samples ii compute the residue vector ϵ j y j f y j iii use the residue ϵ j from step ii as a guess for unknown inputs w ν repeating step i until the results converge to a certain pre specified precision remark 4 it must noted that the degree order of the proposed models given by the pair n j p j in eq 1 was fixed for each species j via optimization this means that on top of the minimization problem 3 another minimization problem was set find the degree pair n j p j that yields the minimimal model residue possible note that larger polynomial orders i e larger values for p j were penalized the regression order n j was also penalized in order to avoid overparametrization 3 3 discussion the following identification results were achieved using the matlab software package mathworks 2017 the proposed models were identified for each of the ten most abundant species of the upper uruguay river table 2 synthesizes the obtained parameters and the results in terms of the ordinary coefficient of determination r 2 between model outputs y j r k and real data y j r f k with r 1 2 related to each output in table 3 corroborating assessments are presented to qualify the identified models therein the level of precision of these models is given in terms of residuals square norm of each ϵ j r smaller values stand for a more perfect fit between model and field data the results of a likelihood ratio test 10 10 this test compares the restricted model with unrestricted data comparing loglikelihood maxima values with respect to the available degrees of freedom i e n j p j are presented which give the probability of the data set to be described by the proposed models standard deviation for the model data residuals are also given overall the proposed model achieves good results with the r 2 values close to 1 indicating high fidelity between model and data nonetheless in some cases the order of the achieved polynomial is 1 which corresponds to a linear model it must be remarked that the presence of the golden mussel g indeed directly influences the abundance and condition factor of the fish species model outputs y j r for all ten fish species this is verified by three different corroborating confirmations i the identified values for matrices b 1 1 j b p j n j j are non null which means the identification procedure mathematically weights that g meddles with y j r ii in the thesis avila simas 2018 a qualification of the field data is performed examining which species are the mostaffected ones due to the mussel invasion by the means of statistical analysis and biological procedures 11 11 in avila simas 2018 two points stand out 1 input output relationship significance is observed and 2 some fish specimens were cut open and it was seen that the most affected populations according to the statistical procedures had incorporated the mussel into their diets and iii in the preliminary paper morato et al 2019 a h norm 12 12 note that the h norm computes the energy to energy gain whereas the h 2 norm computes an impulse to energy gain the first norm is a good indicator because it calculates the worse case i o magnification note that bigger values for the h 2 norm would be verified with respect to influence of noise i e noisy measurements have bigger h 2 norms but this does not greatly impacts on the h sense is computed for the linearized g y j r models quantifying these input output relationship larger values were verified for those species that had incorporated the mussels into their diets therefore the relationship of causality between the golden mussel invasion and changes on cpue and k values is indeed reasonable to illustrate the achieved modelling results figs 6 8 show a comparison between the models and the real field data for the output dynamics of three species h isbrueckeri s nasutus and a lacustris respectively 13 13 similar results were achieved for the other fish communities and are not shown due to lack of space the simulations considered additive colored noise to mimic the effect of other disturbances w ν from these figures it can be concluded that the proposed model yields good accurate results remark 5 to assess the quality of the obtained control oriented models several procedures were performed including cross validation and parameter sensitivity analysis they are not presented here due to lack of space but served to conclude that the achieved models indeed presented a good fidelity with respect to the available data thus describing relatively well the dynamics of cpue and k factor with and without the presence of the golden mussel which is enough for our control purposes 4 proposed closed loop control algorithm in this section the second main contribution of this work is developed i e to propose and test a predictive control method that could be implemented in practice by the means of environmental management policies in order to mitigate the effect disrupted by the invasion of the golden mussel upon the fish communities of the upper uruguay river 4 1 control objectives the golden mussel should be removed in such a way that the life conditions cpue k of the three most affected species return to an ecologically balanced condition such as prior to the invasion this section debates such control objectives in this work the control signal u stands for the amount of l fortunei to be withdrawn from the upper uruguay river waters given in percentage while g stands for the presence of the mussel noted as 100 from the invasion date 2012 onwards as described in assumption 1 to apply feedback control policies a non isolated model of the studied ecological system must be presented they correspond to the identified polynomial discrete time model given by eqs 1 and 2 with g k replaced by g k u k this results in a model that takes into account the presence of the mussel g and the control action human intervention u 4 x j k 1 a 1 1 j x j k a 1 n j j x j k 1 n j a p j 1 j x j k p j a p j n j j x j k 1 n j p j b 1 1 j g k u k b 1 n j j

represents the discrete time dynamics of the ecological system and its outputs due to the presence of the mussel g constant as 100 and the human intervention by means of establishing environmental policies that act to withdraw mussel from the water u it is implied with this model that a controller determines a removal quota u at each sampling instant k then within the following sampling period three months the actuation that corresponds to such u k is performed the dynamics of the actuator the management policies determined by environmental agencies are assumed to be negligible with respect to the model sampling period of three months 14 14 it is assumed that the effects of the actuation arise on the non isolated system within three months roughly once actuation will be performed alongside sampling the environmental policy would represent a discrete pulse sequence signal these policies are assumed to be realized within a few days or so for instance this actuation could be the addition of mussel consuming fish or mollusk oriented pesticides diluted into water in ten days moreover this model assumes that there is a direct correlation of the amount of mussel removal u k to the amount of actuation mathematically this is stated as 6 u t u k u k kt s t k 1 t s where u t is the actual control policy to be implemented by environmental agencies it must be stressed out that the goal of this paper is neither to analyse nor to discusse possible in loci ecological control efforts to reduce the abundance of the l fortunei this is a topic to be addressed by the environmental agencies themselves the control paradigm here proposed only determines adequate mussel removal references nevertheless it has been discussed in recent literature that the golden mussel can be filtered or removed partially from the water via the addition of some chemical molluscicides such as chloride please refer to sylvester et al 2005 boltovskoy and cataldo 1999 iummato et al 2018 gattás et al 2018 boltovskoy et al 2013 such tests are done usually inside closed hydroelectric plants that exhibit problems due to the presence of the golden mussel incrusted on shovels tubes and so on note that all of these studies presents works in terms of how effective are different kinds of mussel filtering methods but none of them in fact analyse how to periodically act with this filtering mechanism itself as done in feedback control such as in this work also note that the filtering rates themselves are not taken into account in this paper because different actuation approaches might be chosen by the environmental agency nonetheless this does not add much complexity in terms of control given that these rates usually stand for the response of first order linear systems the present work does not aim to actually implement an automatic controller that removes in practice the golden mussel from the water so that ecological balance is restored in the upper uruguay river as in silveira and pagano 2005 2004 the goal is to determine control signals u that can be implemented in practice by the means of management policies established by environmental agencies in other words the problem of determining an automatic controller that sets feasible control laws which can be implemented by such agencies is tackled in this work the control strategy that makes such implementation possible is presented in the sequence note that for the studied ecological system the control law u will be applied to the system itself by an actuator if a discrete time piecewise constant removal policy u k is found by some feedback controller then in real life an actuation law would be derived to be implemented by the environmental policies from the moment that u is determined by some feedback controller the isolated ecological system 1 and 2 becomes non isolated as given by eqs 4 and 5 thus this control law must be adequate and compatible with the studied ecological system and with the implementation by the means of environmental policies inadequate choices of control laws could for instance excite unmodeled dynamics or even make the mathematical model of the plant invalid in such way that future predictions of the behaviour of the real system would not be accurate therefore two adequate signals are sought in this section i a feasible type of control law and ii a compatible reference performance 4 2 control law as discussed in silveira and pagano 2005 2004 it has to be remarked that the implementation of a certain control policy derived from u k in the real ecological system may light upon two starring issues a feedback control in the continuous time domain would require the measurement of the abundance and k condition factor of each analysed fish community at every instant of time however this is not possible in the system here considered and as its dynamics are slow a discrete control strategy is to be used b the control signal should essentially model the human action on the studied aquatic ecosystem as argued above the human action corresponds to environmental policies actuation the work by beddington and may 1980 discusses that a constant harvest quota is an ideal possibility of that can lead to maximum sustainable yields in fisheries in parallel pimentel et al 2005 analyses the environmental and economic costs associated with invasive species in the usa thus it seems reasonable to consider that the removal of the golden mussel to be adopted in practice by environmental agencies is piecewise constant as in 6 with t s 3 months this is a fair hypothesis to consider since three month periodic sampling protocol is already performed on the region henceforth this paper follows the suggestion proposed in silveira and pagano 2004 2005 consider a piecewise constant control signal generated from periodic measurements every t s 3 months one will consider that 7 u k 0 for k 0 u k u k 1 δ u k for k 0 note that the control law 6 that derives from the above u k will clearly be a piecewise constant signal it must be pointed out that k 0 stands for the instant corresponding to the last sampled field data year of 2016 apart from being piecewise constant the control law u must obey two other main restrictions in order to be implementable in practice 1 it must depart from u 0 0 i e the mussels are 100 present in the year of last observation 2016 2 it must have slow negative variations in order to be consistent with a practical removal policy of the mollusk from water due to actuation via environmental policies mathematically both these restrictions stand for constraints upon the signal u and its variation δu k u k u k 1 for the control action to be slow these variation must be small this leads to 8 δ u u k 1 u k δ u k 0 9 0 u k 1 k 0 note that 9 follows from assumption 1 moreover the actual amount of mussel in the water at each sampling instant is given by g k u k 4 3 reference performance it is imperious to mention that the plant being controlled is a complex living system and not an inanimate machine thence one concludes that the dynamics cpue k of each fish community in a controlled closed loop non isolated situation should be similar to those of the isolated system silveira and pagano 2004 2005 the control objectives of this work are to return the life conditions of the ten most abundant fish communities to ecologically balanced baselines of course this may be a harsh extremely costly goal nonetheless in order to achieve this the measured outputs y j 1 and y j 2 of each species should return to similar values as those prior to the mussel invasion thus the following reference signals shall be considered y j 1 r and y j 2 r which are designed respectively for y j 1 and y j 2 for each species j when the studied ecological system becomes non isolated controlled it is desired that each output follows its corresponding references signal closely mathematically speaking the equivalent constraints to do so are 10 lim k n p y j 1 k y j 1 r k ξ j 1 n p 11 lim k n p y j 2 k y j 2 r k ξ j 2 n p where n p is a prediction horizon that corresponds to the time interval of t p n p t s notice that ξ j 1 k and ξ j 2 k are slack variables to be minimized furthermore upper and lower constraints upon the reference signal are also considered to be coherent with ecological observation a 20 reference envelope is considered 12 0 8 y j 1 r k y j 1 k 1 2 y j 1 r k 13 0 8 y j 2 r k y j 2 k 1 2 y j 2 r k as it is desired that the dynamics of the non isolated system are coherent with respect to those of the original isolated one the reference signals y j 1 r k and y j 2 r k must be such that the settling periods 15 15 notion of how long does a system take to stabilize of the closed loop plant are close to those of the natural isolated plant to do so since the original isolated system 1 and 2 is stable with g 0 it is natural to consider the following reference system 14 y j r k y j 1 r k y j 2 r k x j 1 r k x j 2 r k x j 3 r k β j where the reference states x j r are given by the isolated model 1 with g k 0 and x j r 0 as equal to the last available field measurements year of 2016 notice that such references are in accordance with the settling period of each y j 4 4 controlling the presence of the golden mussel the control and performance objectives presented in the beginning of this section must be taken into account directly when computing the control action this may not be done directly via standard pid techniques but is easily handled by the mpc framework which is thus used in the sequel first of all a key assumption on the studied ecological system has to be made the dynamics of 4 and 5 are sufficiently slow such that the computational time to determine and implement the control signal u can be disregarded silveira and pagano 2005 2004 this is in fact true for the ecological system under investigation since the control signal will be computed at most within some minutes by some quadratic solver whereas period of 1 and 2 is in the order of years or months now consider the following a well posed quadratic function j 16 16 in fact j is a function of many variables that is j j u x 1 x 10 y 1 1 r y 10 1 r y 1 2 r y 10 2 r ξ 1 1 ξ 10 1 ξ 1 2 ξ 10 2 n p 15 j i 1 n p j 1 10 α j y j 1 k i k y j 1 r k i k ξ j 1 k i k 2 i 1 n p j 1 10 λ j y j 2 k i k y j 2 r k i k ξ j 2 k i k 2 j 0 n p 1 q u u k i k 2 where n p is a given prediction horizon and q u α j and λ j are weighting parameters the notation k i k stands for a model based prediction for instant k j made at instant k a vector u of control efforts inside the prediction horizon to be optimized is also considered 16 u k u k k u k 1 k u k n p 1 k t furthermore take each ξ j as 17 ξ j k ξ j 1 k 1 k ξ j 1 k n p k ξ j 2 k 1 k ξ j 2 k n p k t note that j given in eq 15 is formulated in such way that it can be directly solved by a model predictive control framework see camacho and bordons 2013 moreover mpc determines by definition control laws of the form of eq 7 therefore the mpc approach to mitigate the effect of the golden mussel invasion in the upper uruguay consists in minimizing the cost function j at every discrete time step k in a computational time smaller than the sampling period t s of three months with respect to the previously discussed constraints that is 18 min u ξ 1 ξ 10 j subject to reference constraints eqs 12 and 13 reference system eq 14 control signal constraints eqs 8 and 9 model based predictions eqs 4 and 5 if this problem is adequately solved by a quadratic optimizer then eqs 10 and 11 will be met which means that the most affected species by the l fortunei shall once again exhibit ecologically balanced life conditions in terms of condition k factor and abundance 5 results analysis and discussion in this section numerical simulation results are presented and discussed considering the problem of regulating the effect of the golden mussel invasion in the upper uruguay river within the nonlinear model predictive control framework as the control goal is to force the most abundant species to return to ecologically balanced conditions in terms of abundance and k factor table 4 elucidates the weighting parameters used and mean steady state reference values note that such chosen references values stand for the mean variations of y j 1 and y j 2 pior to the invasion of the mussel the control weighting paramaters α j and λ j are chosen so that the reference tracking control is prioritized according to the discussing given in morato et al 2019 reference tracking of abundance values are prioritized for a affinis j 1 i labrosus j 6 and p valenciennis j 8 while of k factor values for a affinis j 1 h isbrueckeri j 5 i labrosus j 6 and p valenciennis j 8 in sort the control aims to remove the mussel in such way that the most affected fish species in terms of abundance and k factor return to ecologically balanced conditions larger α j and λ j stand for higher priority note that α j 1 while λ j 2 so as to determine the cost function j with normalized weights at most equal to 2 that further prioritizes 11 over 10 once λ j α j the remaining weight q u is taken as 0 5 so to penalize excessive control action the rate constraints used are δ u 4 5 and δ u 0 such constraints 17 17 such values were chosen via empirical observations and plausible removal action refer to gattás et al 2018 imply that the computed control signal must be monotonically decreasing with respect to k which is coherent with the control constraint to only remove mussel from the water and adding more mussel is not allowed since it would not make practical sense these values mean ecologically speaking that the addition of a biological inhibitor that eradicates the golden mussel to the water may only remove at most 4 5 per each 3 months interval the nmpc problem given by eq 18 is nonlinear and highly constrained due to the inherent polynomial models proposed in section 3 therefore its computational complexity is quite large when using full model predictions to balance the nmpc with adequate results smaller predictions horizon are sought thereby one has chosen that the prediction horizon is of n p 3 samples this means that the control action computed at a given instant k is concerned with its effect on the non isolated biological system up to 3t s i e nine months ahead of time moreover such prediction horizon is consistent with the condition that the proposed polynomial models were balanced for a given somewhat steady state operation point p 0 and therefore longer horizons might imply in an exceedingly large model plant mismatch once the outputs would distance themselves from such point it must also be noticed that the chosen nmpc formulation takes into account the same value for both prediction and control horizons i e n c n p indeed sometimes the control horizon can be chosen smaller than the prediction horizon and still yield results as good as if they were equal with smaller computational effort nonetheless in this work the available computational time is in the range of days and therefore there is no problem in using n c n p 3 with all these parameters and weights the nmpc strategy was synthesized with the aid of the software packages matlab mathworks 2017 and yalmip toolbox lofberg 2004 the average computational time of the proposed strategy is in the range of a few seconds with modern desktops 18 18 the following results come from numerical simulation on a 2 4 ghz 8 gb ram macintosh computer which is obviously smaller than the sampling period t s before presenting the actual results the feedback control logic must be once more recalled the numerical simulations shown in the sequel consider that at each three months from 2016 onwards i measurements are made in loci in terms of abundance y j 1 and k factor y j 2 ii these measurements are fed to a computer that computes a control action solving the nmpc problem given by eq 18 and iii via management policies established by environmental agencies such control action is to be implemented in the same sampling protocol pulse like actuation the insight that the following results present is very simple to grasp naturally if 100 of the mussel were to be removed ecologically balanced life conditions of the analysed fish species would once again be attained just as prior to the invasion but if some references are set as in table 4 an automatic controller can compute via simulation with the identified models within a few seconds minutes how much mussel should be removed so that such reference performances are achieved and it does not necessarily mean to remove 100 of it which would stand for an exceedingly large ecological effort in the obtained results it can be seen that by removing only 65 of the total initial amount of the mussel would already allow very interesting life conditions for the majority of the predominant fish species the presence of mussel g k u k is seen in fig 9 as well as the corresponding removal policy u k to be implemented by an environmental agency notice that such steady state value is found after approximately 20 months of almost constant removal of mussel close to 4 per sampling such non isolated control duration is compatible with the isolated ecological system s settling time which raises a guarantee of real life applicability of the proposed nmpc loop reader must bear in mind that the control policy u computed by the nmpc loop given in fig 9 is essentially a constant mussel removal policy such kind of law has been found once no load disturbances were considered in the numerical simulations presented only colored noise w such load perturbations to the non isolated ecological system in fact occur in real life and in practice the nmpc would act to overcome their effects on the measured outputs nonetheless it is impossible to simulate them numerically with fidelity once these disturbances say for instance presence of resource of predator fish etc have not been quantified in the proposed polynomial model figs 10 12 present real data from t 0 months up to 120 i e from 2006 to 2016 with the invasion occurring in 2012 i e t 60 months and simulation data with the nmpc loop from this point onwards figs 10 and 11 show cpue reference tracking while fig 12 shows k factor reference tracking these results consider additive coloured noise to mimic the effect of an unknown noise w in eqs 4 and 5 moreover measurement noise ν is considered as a white random signal with zero mean the results in terms of abundance cpue reference tracking for the following species are seen in fig 10 a affinis j 1 i labrosus j 6 and p valenciennis j 8 notice that the controlled non isolated plant is able to remain close to the aimed abundance references ecologically balanced values with the nmpc control law notice moreover that the settling time of such control action is within 5 6 years which is compatible with the isolated system and that these results are possible with an almost constant δu k 4 5 for all k which ensures further implementation feasibility via environmental policies in fig 11 the first plot of fig 10 is shown in greater detail which explicitly exhibits the used reference signal y j 1 r showing the upper and lower bounds i e eq 12 and 13 used by the nmpc loop clearly the used reference is in accordance with the ecological system s isolated behaviour the results in terms of k factor reference tracking for the following species are seen in fig 12 a affinis j 1 h isbrueckeri j 5 i labrosus j 6 and p valenciennis j 8 once again it is clear that the non isolated plant is also able to follow the aimed k factor references ecologically balanced values with the nmpc control law finally notice that in both figs 10 and 12 the non isolated system stabilized once the control action remains constant near the original ecological equilibrium point prior to the invasion of the mussel in the upper uruguay river waters 6 conclusions this paper presented a nonlinear model predictive control strategy that aims to restore ecological balance of the upper uruguay river due to the biological invasion by the golden mussel l fortunei this strategy periodically every three months determines controls that in principle may be implemented by environmental agencies by the means of ecological management policies in terms of the main contributions of this paper it must be stressed that a polynomial model was proposed to describe the discrete time dynamics of the life dynamics k condition factor and abundance of ten fish communities affected by the golden mussel invasion such model was identified and validated very good results model data fidelity were obtained numerical simulations were shown demonstrating that the proposed nmpc strategy if applied in practice would be able to re balance the fish ecology of the upper uruguay river previously unsettled by the invasion of the l fortunei for future works robustness analysis considering other sources of external disturbances may be considered in the control scheme here proposed as well as including the actuator dynamics in the model acknowledgements authors thank engie consórcio de itá cnpq and capes for funding 
25034,the decision making process towards sustainability is usually based on quantitative indicators and becomes more complex the more indicators are considered the lack of a clear criterion i e a conceptual model of sustainability supporting the choice of one indicator rather than others creates doubts about the real attainments of such studies the holistic based approach in choosing indicators to express sustainability claims for a multicriteria perspective this work proposes a sustainability assessment tool based on the five sector sustainability 5sensu model that is capable to show the relationships between humans and the natural environment and the use of goal programming as a multicriteria method the advantages of the proposed tool are based on clear criteria in choosing indicators supported by the 5sensu model which recognizes the double functions as a donor and receiver of natural environment and society as well the application of goal programming to obtain an easy to understand final indicator the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssis the countries that form mercosur economic bloc were used as a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed model results have shown that uruguay holds the highest sustainability performance among all mercosur countries although still demanding efforts from public policies to improve its national happiness level k52 indicator employment rate k41 indicator and total emergy flow per capita k12 indicator instead of using a single criterion in choosing indicators this work provides a scientific based tool in choosing calculating and supporting discussions on the sustainability of production systems under a more holistic perspective keywords sustainability assessment multi criteria decision making goal programming sustainability model 1 introduction quantifying the sustainability of a given system is important to identify its strengths and weaknesses from the united nations brundtland report 1987 until the recent sustainable development goals sdgs un 2019 sustainability assessments are key in supporting more sustainable policies strategies and action plans towards a sustainable future due to its multidisciplinary aspects that include environmental social and economic aspects sometimes cultural and value based elements are also included the sustainability assessments must rely on scientific rooted bases in establishing definitions representative conceptual models and indicators different methods aiming to quantify sustainability are available in the scientific literature taking as example the sustainability assessments of urban systems methods based on different definitions conceptual models and indicators are being considered including emergy accounting sevegnani et al 2017 2018 agostinho et al 2018 material flow analysis barles 2009 ecological footprint barrett et al 2002 life cycle assessment corcelli et al 2019 and others although these studies aim to quantify sustainability they use different approaches for the same purpose is there a right or a wrong method is one method better than another as discussed by siche et al 2010a all methods have their advantages in representing sustainability but the theory supporting them must be clearly provided to allow a better understanding about the meaning of the calculated indicator studying the most used representative conceptual models and indicators to quantify sustainability giannetti et al 2010 compared the results obtained from emergy accounting against five sustainability metrics including ecological footprint surplus biocapacity environmental sustainability index wellbeing index and the ecosystem services product and highlighted that different metrics provide different interpretations about the sustainability of nations in a paper that evaluates the reliability of experts opinions to support the environmental sustainability index named esi 2005 giannetti et al 2009 presented the existence of inherent uncertainties on opinions that lead to inefficiency in measuring and monitoring the natural environment revealing a lack of a science of sustainability in an attempt to overcome the lack of a scientific based conceptual model to represent sustainability several authors have proposed models that have wider or more specific purposes for instance goodland and daly 1996 presented the types of sustainability including social economic and environmental which were merged into the sustainable development term leading to the concepts of strong and weak sustainability as discussed by ekins et al 2003 ulgiati et al 2006 proposed the sustainability multicriteria multiscale assessment summa aiming to overcome the problems related to the use of a single criteria approach in the life cycle assessments which can cause partial and often misleading results another important contribution comes from the work of pulselli et al 2015 that refers to the use of a logical physical and thermodynamic order to evaluate the sustainability of production systems under an input state output environmental society economy relationship the proposed input state output model might overcome the major drawbacks of common representations of sustainability recently rockström and sukhdev 2016 proposed a wider and more integrative view based on the triple bottom line considering the sustainable development goals sdgs by separating the sdgs in three rings containing the biosphere in the bottom society in the middle and economy in the top rings are connected by a double arrowed line representing the 17th sdg named partnership for the goals in spite of the more broader and integrative models our literature review indicated a lack of view based on functions in which the natural environment and society dimensions should be seen as both donors and receivers of energy materials and information flows additionally to the conceptual model issue there is a large number of indicators that can be used to represent sustainability results in a multicriteria situation when more and more information from different sources and focuses is available to represent a system the problem of choosing among alternatives comes up kalu 1999 decision makers often experience difficulties when selecting between options and these difficulties are even more evident when the decision involves multi criteria situations this applies also for the sustainability assessments of production systems in which a unique indicator hardly is able to represent all aspects embodied in it siche et al 2010a 2010b giannetti et al 2015 usually sustainability issues result in a trade off between environmental economic and social dimensions although some authors insert political or legal and technological concerns when analyzing projects under a multi criteria perspective decision making can be difficult since a win win scenario is hardly achieved the more criteria translated into indicators are added to each situation the more holistic and embracing should be the tools for decision making supported by scientific multi dimension models scott et al 2012 a decision regarding sustainability based on a multi criteria view by using data from different sources under different focuses and that involve several stakeholders can be translated in a term called multi criteria decision making mcdm or multi criteria decision analysis mcda according to kumar et al 2017 mcdm is defined as a branch of operational research that seeks to achieve optimal results in complex systems where several indicators multiple and conflicting objectives and criteria are involved literature is plentiful of papers regarding sustainability assessment using mcdm principles for instance martín gamboa et al 2017 provided a literature review on the application of mcdm to the sustainability assessment of energy systems while ibáñez forés et al 2014 have performed a literature review focused on methods including mcdm to select options from a sustainability perspective according to a literature review performed by scott et al 2012 focused on papers applying mcdm to the bioenergy sector authors find that mcdm can be considered a general term where more specifically indicators are embedded in several categories and inside the categories different mathematical methods are possible any mcdm demands a multicriteria tool to appropriately integrate under a quantitative analysis all the multiples numbers with different units being considered for this purpose the goal programming gp is an important tool gp is a mathematical method that was classified by ibáñez forés et al 2014 as a branch of the multi objective mathematical programming category gp was initially introduced by charnes cooper and ferguson in the 1950s charnes et al 1955 and further developed by other researchers ijiri 1965 lee 1972 ignizio 1978 romero 1985 currently gp is one of the most used multi criteria approaches in business practice and scientific research according to jayaraman et al 2015 gp is a popular and widely used technique to study decision problems in the face of multiple conflicting objectives zografidou et al 2017 stated that gp formulation is a multi criteria decision making type of analysis where certain goals are examined in terms of trade offs the authors provided an example of renewable energy type s selection in which a wind farm can provide clean energy and may contribute to the local economy of the region but it affects the normality of regional ecosystems gp applied to assess the sustainability of the most different production systems is largely found in the literature san cristóbal 2012a applied gp on an environmental input output linear programming model to the spanish economy and studied the capacity expansion planning for the renewable energy industry using the case study of the north of san cristóbal 2012b jayaraman et al 2015 proposed a weighted gp model that integrates efficient allocation of resources aiming to simultaneously achieve sustainability related goals on gross domestic product growth reduction of electricity consumption and greenhouse gases ghg emissions the model was applied in key economic sectors of the united arab emirates to be validated yang et al 2016 studied the application of a mcdm to assess the sustainable development of transport infrastructure projects chang 2015 proposed a so called multi choice gp model aiming to assess the expansion actions related to the renewable energy industry zografidou et al 2016 2017 applied gp tools to study the design of a renewable energy map by the allocation of solar plants to each region of greece the sustainability performance of european countries was studied by antanasijević et al 2017 who applied the differential multi criteria analysis technique to thirty european countries over 2004 and 2014 aiming to assess their progress in sustainability usually scientific papers focusing on sustainability assessments that have also applied gp supporting mcdm were developed without a deeper conceptual framework regarding sustainability concepts and definitions for instance some papers focus deeply on the technical issues of given activities and develop them under a narrow viewpoint considering only the technological benefits related to emissions reduction other researchers have performed the application of gp in a very comprehensive way choosing indicators that cover different aspects of sustainability of a given system but still without establishing a representative conceptual model yang et al 2016 zografidou et al 2016 2017 this aspect is also recognized by pulselli et al 2015 who argue that choice of one method or indicator rather than others can be always questioned because all of them have different abilities in representing the multidimensional aspects of sustainability according to our literature review we have identified a lack of a conceptual model of sustainability able to assign the multifunctions of each of the three dimensions environmental social and economic trying to overcome the lack of a strong conceptual model for sustainability assessments this paper proposes the five sector sustainability 5sensu model as the first step of an mcdm procedure the application of the proposed model would support interpretations and decisions based on a more holistic and embracing perspective since it addresses both the provider and receiver functions to environment and society here the 5sensu model is used with the goal programming to allow a multicriteria sustainability assessment the countries that form mercosur economic union were taken as a case study with the purpose of showing the application of the 5sensu but the procedure can be applied to study the sustainability of different productive systems identified as a mcdm situation 2 methods 2 1 five sector sustainability 5sensu model the conception of the 5sensu model is based on six basic axioms three i ii and iii from goodland 1995 and goodland and daly 1996 regarding the limits of natural resources in relation to their exploitation and consumption rates to guarantee the current development patterns and three axioms iv v and vi suggested by the authors of this work i no resource should be used at higher rates than its generation rate e g it takes thousand years to form oil reserves that can be explored and thus the time window of human existence and the formation of oil reserves are not compatible fossil oil will never be considered a renewable resource and in accordance with this axiom it should never be extracted except in a scenario as presented by the following axiom iii ii no contaminant should be produced at higher rates than their natural recycling process neutralization and absorption by the natural environment iii non renewable resource should never be used faster than the necessary time to replace it with a renewable resource iv there must be a balance between the environment as a supplier of resources and as receiver of waste and pollutants which could be achieved by cleaner production practices environmental care and conservation v the production of goods must be limited to the restrictions imposed by the sustainable exploitation of natural resources and by responsible consumption of the society vi for human as a social being its relationship with economic system through providing labor and receiving manufactured products must be balanced considering all these six axioms as well as the importance of three dimensions in representing sustainability the five sectors sustainability model 5sensu model was elaborated fig 1 the proposed model is aligned with the input state output environment society economy sustainability model proposed by pulselli et al 2015 which postulates sustainability as a matter of relationships among compartments allowing understanding human activity and its physical social and economic contexts according to bastianoni et al 2016 human driven systems are open since they demand energy and matter input flows and transform resources into goods and services by means of human labor efforts the model presented in fig 1 addresses to the environment the function of supplier and receiver the environment in sector 1 has a source function in providing for instance raw materials to support the production unit sector 3 functions the environment in sector 2 usually has a sink function being the receiver of the wastes and emissions generated by the production unit activities the same applies to the society that holds the functions of supplier and consumer society in sector 4 supplies socio economic resources to the production unit such as labor knowledge and know how and it receives money for this the production unit supplies products that will be consumed by the society that pays for them it is worthy to note that money only circulates on the right side of the diagram in activities that are human driven while the exchanges in the left side of the 5sensu model only contemplate flows of materials and energy in other words the resources provided by the environment are seen as free resources since no one paid for them the same reasoning applies to the waste released to the environment i e there is not a payment from the production unit to the environment as a counterpart of the dilution and decomposition services the idea of free resources hides the fact that the environment actually needs to converge energy either to generate resources and to assimilate or dilute the waste released by humans these can be understood as environmental services that are very often not taken into account in the traditional accounting practices the 5sensu model is a holistic model that comprises multi characteristics first the multi dimension is an important characteristic since it embraces social environmental and economic dimensions second it can be understood as a multi view model that may assume the point of view from the natural environment society as well as from the production unit third the indicators applied to the model are usually multi metric including energy volume mass money labor force etc fourth its multi criteria approach can be seen as an important feature of the tools considered within the 5sensu model since an unlimited combination of indicators with several weights and goals can be applied 2 2 principles for selecting indicators to feed the 5sensu the selection of indicators is inherent to each sector of the 5sensu for instance indicators related to environmental constraints must be located in the environmental sector and so on indicators can derive from previous studies or through criteria of experts chosen with non parametric statistical techniques among others the delphi approach dalkey and helmer 1963 is a participative approach that can be applied at this stage using the 5sensu model does not mean that indicators should be modified from their original rules algebra and definitions contrariwise they must respect their original procedures and meanings some general suggestions can be raised when chosing indicators to feed the 5sensu a social economic and environmental indicators must be considered to preserve the multidimensional characteristics of the model b the more indicators are considered for each sector the more holistic detailed complex and embracing the model becomes c indicators should respect as much as possible the same temporal analysis i e time window in order to have a consistent assessment within that time window d a balance should be sought in terms of the number of indicators selected by each sector in order to avoid assumed preferences for a specific sector important aspects to be considered as also suggested by blanc et al 2008 are representativeness relevance reliability sensitivity ease of understanding comparability and transparency when applying the 5sensu model the analyst must have in mind that besides selecting indicators it is necessary to determine the minimum and maximum values goals or targets of each indicator their desired direction positive or negative and their weighted values these parameters are mandatory to be used within the goal programming as explained in the next section similar to the indicators establishment the goals can be set from different approaches a by considering the expertise of analyst according to the case study being evaluated b participative meetings in which experts from different fields of knowledge can obtain a common agreement for instance using a non parametric statistical technique as delphi c governmental plans and reports d or even considering the threshold of each considered indicator 2 3 application of the fundamentals of goal programming to the 5sensu model goal programming gp can be understood as a mathematical method to handle problems with multiple and conflicting objectives that are translated into mcdm situations gp is one of the possible methods to be applied in the mcdm problems and it is used in this paper for the multicriteria modelling one of the most important aspects of gp is simon s satisfactory logic simon 1955 i e the gp is developed within the satisfactory paradigm rather than the optimizer paradigm the shift in simon s situational logic from optimized to satisfactory solutions implies in the search for solutions that are closest as possible to the chosen aspiration level or goal however the found solutions are not obligatorily the optimum ones the calculation algebra of the proposed sustainability assessment tool is based on the use of gp philosophy as a multicriteria analysis method to obtain the sustainability indicator this approach was firstly considered by goodland 1995 and goodland and daly 1996 as discussed by diaz balteiro 2008 2009 to express the results according to the proximity between the relative values of the indicators and their goals fig 2 shows in a qualitative way the philosophy derived from goal programming that is applied in the proposed tool to assess sustainability the schematic representation shows as an example that the objective of the indicator is to be minimized as the co2 emissions each evaluated system represented by circles have a different value for the indicator consequently there are different distances or deviations to the established goal for co2 emissions as the objective is to minimize the indicator those systems with co2 emissions above the goal 2 and 4 will receive higher punishments wabove goal than those systems below the goal wbelow goal 1 and 3 even the deviation of system 3 p 3 being higher than 2 p 2 and 4 p 4 or p 1 being the same as p 2 the final number is obtained by multiplying the deviation by its punishment resulting in p 1 wbelow goal for system 1 p 2 wabove goal for system 2 p 3 wbelow goal for system 3 and p 4 wabove goal for system 4 the same logic is applied when the objective is to maximize an indicator for instance profitability but in this case the higher punishments are set for those systems with profit value below the established goal the closer the indicator is to its established goal the higher will be the system performance for this indicator mainly for the indicator that respects the initial objective of minimization and or maximization i e it is located below or above the goal respectively in this work modifications have been made in the traditional goal programming in order to allow its application under the 5sensu model constraints which is hereafter explained under a mathematical background consider a decisional problem in which gi goals exist from the mathematical point of view the use of the gp philosophy in the 5sensu model is based on a linear objective function that aims to minimize the values of the unwanted deviations in the system weights are assigned to the indicators representing their relative importance to the system in this context the unwanted deviations are those ones that affect the performance of selected indicators expressed by 1 min z i wini wipi where min minimize z objective function w weighted value or aspiration of the deviation n negative deviation associated to higher better or maximize indicator p positive deviation associated to lower better or minimize indicator eq 1 is subject to the following constraints associated with the selected attributes or indicators 2 fi ki ni pi gi where fi ki mathematical expression for the i th indicator g aspiration level or goal n and p as previously defined under the following restrictions 3 ni 0 pi 0 ni pi 0 it is assumed that each sustainability indicator ki is associated with a linear function fi ki that characterizes its behavior this linear function is considered as a weak constraint in the gp before presenting the next deduction steps a definition of positive and negative indicators is needed positive indicators are those in which higher values mean better performance while the negative are those in which higher values represent worse performance for positive indicators constraint type the variable of undesired deviation is the negative one ni meaning that pi 0 and therefore the objective function would be min z ni subject to fi ki gi ni pi or fi ki ni pi gi ni gi fi ki for negative indicators constraint type the variable of undesired deviation is the positive one pi meaning that ni 0 and therefore the objective function would be min z pi subject to fi ki gi ni pi or fi ki ni pi gi pi fi ki gi when it is desired to reach exactly the level of aspiration constraint type the undesirable deviation variables are both positive pi and negative ni and therefore the objective function would be min z ni pi subject to fi ki gi ni pi or fi ki ni pi gi when applying the philosophy of goal programming the unwanted variables depend on the type of indicator positive or negative for positive indicators the undesired variable is the negative deviation n ijk with systems that reach the aspiration level set as a target or have a higher value of the positive deviation variable p ijk for negative indicators the undesirable variable is the positive deviation variable p ijk with systems that reach the target aspiration level or a higher value of the negative deviation variable n ijk thus for the higher better positive indicators we have 4 n i j k g j k k i j k k i j k g j k 0 k i j k g j k i 1 2 n e j 1 2 n s k 1 2 n i 5 p i j k k i j k g j k k i j k g j k 0 k i j k g j k i 1 2 n e j 1 2 n s k 1 2 n

positive or negative indicator g ijk g ijk goal value for the positive or negative indicator the index of sustainability goal of indicator isg ijk and isg ijk is obtained from eqs 4 5 6 and 7 8 i s g

w j k represent the weighted value of deviation g j k and g j k represent the goal established for the indicator although recognizing all the subjectivity involved weighting variables is an important and mandatory aspect within a multicriteria approach by weighting variables the analysist is able to make final numbers more realistic in representing the real world and useful for policy makers as usual the weighting procedure can be based mainly on the choice of the analyst who is supposed to be an expert in the case study being evaluated however participative approaches based on a common agreement of experts in different fields of knowledge are usually considered more robust and acceptable for the purposes of this work the weighting values procedure was based on the expertise of authors and it is recommended that w jk w jk for positive indicators and w jk w jk for negative indicators where w j k w j k r 0 w j k w j k 100 the chosen values applied in our case study were 0 2

proposal for establishing levels of sustainability the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssis can be used for two main purposes a to define a ranking of sustainability among the sample studied which allows establishing work priorities and reduce the gaps among the different systems b the classification of the studied systems in sustainability levels sl based on the criteria presented in table 1 it is important to emphasize that sl is primarily a proposition in classifying or labelling the evaluated systems in different sustainability levels rather than mandatory this step can be applied by those ones who desire this kind of classification for their ultimate purposes although establishing sls could be considered important depending on the political purposes it can be applied only when a large sample is being studied due to the demanded statistical inferences on the obtained ssis as maximum and minimum values average and standard deviation all these statistical parameters are used in establishing the confidence intervals for the ssis sample 2 5 guidelines for the application of 5sensu model fig 3 presents a general framework for applying the proposed sustainability assessment tool driven by the 5sensu model data stage i for each sector are gathered with the concern of being representative and having as much as possible the same temporal basis for the parameters definitions the indicators stage ii for sectors are chosen and calculated each one with its own original definitions meanings rules and algebra goals stage iii are established for each indicator previously chosen and then settled to be maximized or minimized the weighting stage iv demands the establishment of weights for each indicator representing a punishment for those ones that are more distant from the fixed goals by means of the goal programming algebra as presented in the previous sections the sector sustainability indicator ssii and sustainability synthetic indicator of each system for each sector isgs is calculated stage v finally the final stage vi is the interpretation of the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssisi to support discussions and public policies appendix c shows all procedures of fig 3 automatized in a computer application it can be developed in different computational languages including a spreadsheet using the excel software 3 results and discussion the mercosur countries named from here as systems were used as a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed tool in assessing sustainability the mercosur is formed by full member countries and associate countries where argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay are full member countries venezuela was a full member but it was suspended in 2016 as associate countries there are bolivia chile colombia ecuador peru and suriname suriname even being an associate country was not included in this work due to the lack of data primary data were gathered from several sources as individually presented in the next sections the ideal situation would be having all data from the same year but this was not possible at this moment although from different years the used data do not impair the application of the proposed tool in assessing sustainability 3 1 establishing indicators goals and weight values to feed the 5sensu rather than choosing indicators and goals through a participatory meeting with experts they were chosen according to authors experience and data availability with the main purpose to illustrate the proposed approach two indicators per sector were chosen to feed the 5sensu model totalizing ten indicators details and the reasons in choosing indicators and goals are hereafter presented indicators are represented by the letter k followed by the number of the sector i and by its number in the sector j or kij the time window considered for all indicators is one year 3 1 1 sector 1 environment as a provider k11 biocapacity per capita 2012 according to the global footprint network 2017 biocapacity indicates the ecosystems capacity to produce resources used by people and to absorb waste generated by humans under current management schemes and extraction technologies thus k11 is an indicator that should be maximized the mean value added to the standard deviation was set as goal considering our expertise in the subject and due to data availability other authors wackernagel et al 2017 lewan and simmons 2001 moran et al 2008 liu et al 2017 have used this indicator to access the sustainability of countries k12 total emergy flow per capita 2008 emergy is defined as the sum of all inputs of energy directly or indirectly needed to make any product or service odum 1996 specifically the empower i e emergy per year is used this indicator must be maximized since the higher the empower per capita the more real wealth the nation holds the established goal was based on the same criteria as for k11 emergy flow per capita has been used by several authors fan et al 2018 liu et al 2017 viglia et al 2018 giannetti et al 2013 2018 in evaluating the sustainability of nations 3 1 2 sector 2 environment as a receiver k21 amount of co2 capita 2012 emissions according to the world bank 2017 data carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from fossil fuels burn this indicator must be minimized to avoid global warming as the co2 emissions is a current issue that deserves strong action to be minimized its goal was pushed as the minimum value on the evaluated sample of mercosur countries added to its standard deviation these statistical parameters were set according to authors expertise and data availability similar uses of this indicator in assessing the sustainability of nations have been made by liu et al 2017 and bekun et al 2019 k22 municipal solid waste per capita 2012 according to the pan american health organization paho the definition of municipal solid waste presented in the world bank s 2012 report what a waste a global review of solid waste management is solid or semi solid waste generated in population centers including domestic commercial wastes as well as those originated by the small scale industries and institutions including hospital and clinics market street sweeping and from public cleansing are included this indicator should be minimized to align with circular economy concepts and its goal was set as 1 1 kg capita day which is the average for latin america according to the paho report other authors used this indicator in similar assessments tomić and schneider 2017 cremiato et al 2018 3 1 3 sector 3 production unit k31 gdp per capita based on purchasing power parity gdp ppp per capita 2012 according to the world bank 2017 data gdp ppp is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates an international dollar has the same purchasing power over gdp as the u s dollar has in the united states this indicator must be maximized since it reflects the economic power of the nation the goal set for this indicator was pushed as the maximum value found in the evaluated sample of mercosur countries since the country that presents this level could be seen as a reference for the other ones similar uses of this indicator have been made by menegaki and tiwari 2017 and kurniawan and managi 2018 k32 gini 2013 gini index is a general measure of economic inequality according to the world bank data this index measures the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals or households within an economy deviates from an equal distribution an index of 0 represents perfect equality while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality thus gini must be minimized the goal set for this indicator was the minimum value existent in the sample of evaluated mercosur countries again because it could be considered as a reference to the others in achieving similar economic in equality level among several others examples of gini index usage can be found in menegaki and tiwari 2017 armiento 2018 neri et al 2017 and pulselli et al 2015 3 1 4 sector 4 society as a provider k41 employment rate 2012 according to the world bank 2017 data this indicator represents the proportion of a country s population that is employed thus it should be maximized since a job represents more than exclusively a source of economic resources in exchange of a delivered service among others a job also represents a social acceptance of a human being in its societal environment the established goal was pushed to 100 example of employment rate use can be found in antanasijević et al 2017 and ge et al 2017 k42 expected years of schooling according to the unpd 2017 this indicator represents the number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if the prevailing patterns of age specific enrolment rates persist throughout the child s life this indicator must be maximized meaning that more years spent in school higher educational level the population holds the goal was set as 16 years since this is the approximate value observed for countries with a high human development index as presented by the unpd database example of its usage can be found in the work of shen et al 2017 3 1 5 sector 5 society as a receiver k51 human development index hdi 2012 unpd 2017 defines hdi as an aggregated measure of the achievements in key dimensions of human development including long and healthy life being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living hdi values range from 0 worst scenario to 1 best scenario thus it must be maximized the value 0 8 was set as a goal since this is the lowest value of hdi to label a country as high level as shown by unpd database among other users shaker 2018 have used hdi in studying countries k52 national happiness level 2013 this indicator is available in the world happiness report published by the united nations sustainable development solutions network unsdsn 2013 it reflects the level of happiness of a given society this indicator is to be maximized which means higher happiness levels and the criteria to set the goal were the same as for k11 and k12 examples of its use can be found in verma 2017 and laczniak and santos 2018 table 2 summarizes all the chosen indicators for each sector as well as the goals set for each of them the values of each indicator for each country are shown in table 3 all the calculation procedures of fig 3 and appendix c were inserted into an excel spreadsheet where the gp mathematics fundamentals were set an application was designed in visual basic language for calculation purposes and then tabulated in a microsoft excel sheet supplementary material which applies the gp philosophy to classify the countries based on the 5sensu model 3 2 performance on sustainability for the mercosur countries intervals hierarchy and policy implications the sustainability of the mercosur bloc depends on the performance of each nation translated by their different indicators within the sectors of the 5sensu model as exposed in the calculation procedure modelling countries with lower ssisi values are more sustainable since their overall performance is closer to the established goals the level of sustainability is determined by the intervals as shown in table 4 which indicates a high sustainability level for uruguay and chile colombia and paraguay achieved low sustainability levels while all other countries are within the medium level it is worth to note that sustainability levels as presented in table 4 are valid exclusively for the sample 10 mercosur countries used in this work anyhow the focus here is the approach used in establishing the sustainability levels that can be replicated in other studies regarding a visual form on the hierarchy of sustainability based on numbers presented at appendix d fig 4 was developed to provide an easier and faster interpretation of the results this figure is the representation of the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssisi which locates the countries depending on their performance that is the most sustainable countries would be those with the lowest ssisi value the first column presents the sustainability final ranked countries according to their ssisi when all indicators of all sectors are simultaneously considered the country that shows the highest degree of sustainability is uruguay reaching a total ssis of 4 17 although uruguay is the most sustainable country under an overall perspective in some sectors it is not the most sustainable one for instance it holds 3rd 2nd 3rd and 4th positions in sectors 1 2 4 and 5 respectively paraguay showed the lowest degree of sustainability when all indicators are considered which is evidenced by its ssis of 15 11 it is interesting to note that in sector 4 brazil and venezuela are overlapped because they have the same value of ssisi for that sector although fig 4 shows easily understandable results it comes from deep previous complex calculating procedures as provided by the framework presented in fig 3 without a mathematical method it would be a hard task to consider all the indicators under a multicriteria perspective that result in a single number as expressed by the ssisi as already recognized by bastianoni et al 2016 the aggregation of a large number of specific indicators into a single one could be considered as positive due to its easy interpretation by a decision maker thinking towards a macro view on the other hand the extreme concentration of information into a single number could lead to loss of information hindering more specific public policies in this sense besides providing an aggregated result fig 4 highlights information on each sector evaluated and shows evidences to establish priorities among sectors regarding specific public policies the decision maker can use the proposed tool to verify in which sector a particular system has low performance in this case the analyst can go back in the calculations to verify which indicators are driving the low performance in that sector taking chile as an example the country holds the 4th position in sector 1 which is represented by indicators k11 biocapacity per capita and k12 total emergy flow per capita observing the data presented in appendix d indicator k12 generated a ssis12 that is the best one among all countries on the other hand indicator k11 generated a ssis11 that pulled down the position in the overall analysis of sector 1 for chile in this way indicator k11 would be a focus for improvements another example is uruguay that could make efforts to increase its total emergy flow per capita k12 increase the employment rate k41 and increase its national happiness index k52 the same analysis can be done for all other countries evaluated in this study 4 conclusions the 5sensu model is proposed to support a sustainability assessment based on a more holistic perspective of a system when compared to the existing approaches found in the scientific literature it considers the environment either as a supplier of resources and or as a receiver of waste and emissions the society is also seen as a provider of labor force and as a receiver of goods the model drives the analyst and policymakers to seek a balance among the 5sensu sectors towards sustainability the application of the gp philosophy supporting the calculation algebra within the proposed tool works as a multicriteria analysis allowing the sustainability performance evaluation of the different sectors considering the goals of the selected indicators the approach allows measuring the system s sustainability performance in order to rank and classify them in levels of sustainability the 5sensu model brings some advantages such as the holistic view of the system the recognition of the double functions for the environment and society and the importance of using a multi criteria approach when dealing with sustainability on the other hand the main limitation which is also shared with all other multicriteria based assessment methods is related to the need for a larger amount of primary data for calculating the indicators as well as establishing goals and weights the case study allowed ranking the sustainability of the mercosur countries where the performance in the different sectors is clearly presented furthermore countries were classified into high uruguay and chile medium venezuela brazil argentina bolivia peru and ecuador and low colombia and paraguay sustainability levels although the sustainability levels classification is specific for the sample under study it can be considered important in a macro analysis where clusters are essential to highlight differences while the macro analysis reveals what spots or sectors must be primarily focused for specific public policies the analyst may go back in the calculations to verify which indicators should be improved for achieving higher sustainability in this sense results showed that uruguay holds the best position when all indicators of all sectors are considered however improvements are demanded on specific indicators in sectors 5 4 and 1 precisely the national happiness level k52 employment rate k41 and total emergy flow per capita k12 the 5sensu model provides a strong scientific basis to evaluate the sustainability of production systems at any scale including regional analysis by organizing the sectors as donors and receivers the model also provides a holistic view of how a given system may improve or balance its relationship among the components sectors the 5sensu model can be applied to other case studies to validate its use as well as a subsidy

25034,the decision making process towards sustainability is usually based on quantitative indicators and becomes more complex the more indicators are considered the lack of a clear criterion i e a conceptual model of sustainability supporting the choice of one indicator rather than others creates doubts about the real attainments of such studies the holistic based approach in choosing indicators to express sustainability claims for a multicriteria perspective this work proposes a sustainability assessment tool based on the five sector sustainability 5sensu model that is capable to show the relationships between humans and the natural environment and the use of goal programming as a multicriteria method the advantages of the proposed tool are based on clear criteria in choosing indicators supported by the 5sensu model which recognizes the double functions as a donor and receiver of natural environment and society as well the application of goal programming to obtain an easy to understand final indicator the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssis the countries that form mercosur economic bloc were used as a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed model results have shown that uruguay holds the highest sustainability performance among all mercosur countries although still demanding efforts from public policies to improve its national happiness level k52 indicator employment rate k41 indicator and total emergy flow per capita k12 indicator instead of using a single criterion in choosing indicators this work provides a scientific based tool in choosing calculating and supporting discussions on the sustainability of production systems under a more holistic perspective keywords sustainability assessment multi criteria decision making goal programming sustainability model 1 introduction quantifying the sustainability of a given system is important to identify its strengths and weaknesses from the united nations brundtland report 1987 until the recent sustainable development goals sdgs un 2019 sustainability assessments are key in supporting more sustainable policies strategies and action plans towards a sustainable future due to its multidisciplinary aspects that include environmental social and economic aspects sometimes cultural and value based elements are also included the sustainability assessments must rely on scientific rooted bases in establishing definitions representative conceptual models and indicators different methods aiming to quantify sustainability are available in the scientific literature taking as example the sustainability assessments of urban systems methods based on different definitions conceptual models and indicators are being considered including emergy accounting sevegnani et al 2017 2018 agostinho et al 2018 material flow analysis barles 2009 ecological footprint barrett et al 2002 life cycle assessment corcelli et al 2019 and others although these studies aim to quantify sustainability they use different approaches for the same purpose is there a right or a wrong method is one method better than another as discussed by siche et al 2010a all methods have their advantages in representing sustainability but the theory supporting them must be clearly provided to allow a better understanding about the meaning of the calculated indicator studying the most used representative conceptual models and indicators to quantify sustainability giannetti et al 2010 compared the results obtained from emergy accounting against five sustainability metrics including ecological footprint surplus biocapacity environmental sustainability index wellbeing index and the ecosystem services product and highlighted that different metrics provide different interpretations about the sustainability of nations in a paper that evaluates the reliability of experts opinions to support the environmental sustainability index named esi 2005 giannetti et al 2009 presented the existence of inherent uncertainties on opinions that lead to inefficiency in measuring and monitoring the natural environment revealing a lack of a science of sustainability in an attempt to overcome the lack of a scientific based conceptual model to represent sustainability several authors have proposed models that have wider or more specific purposes for instance goodland and daly 1996 presented the types of sustainability including social economic and environmental which were merged into the sustainable development term leading to the concepts of strong and weak sustainability as discussed by ekins et al 2003 ulgiati et al 2006 proposed the sustainability multicriteria multiscale assessment summa aiming to overcome the problems related to the use of a single criteria approach in the life cycle assessments which can cause partial and often misleading results another important contribution comes from the work of pulselli et al 2015 that refers to the use of a logical physical and thermodynamic order to evaluate the sustainability of production systems under an input state output environmental society economy relationship the proposed input state output model might overcome the major drawbacks of common representations of sustainability recently rockström and sukhdev 2016 proposed a wider and more integrative view based on the triple bottom line considering the sustainable development goals sdgs by separating the sdgs in three rings containing the biosphere in the bottom society in the middle and economy in the top rings are connected by a double arrowed line representing the 17th sdg named partnership for the goals in spite of the more broader and integrative models our literature review indicated a lack of view based on functions in which the natural environment and society dimensions should be seen as both donors and receivers of energy materials and information flows additionally to the conceptual model issue there is a large number of indicators that can be used to represent sustainability results in a multicriteria situation when more and more information from different sources and focuses is available to represent a system the problem of choosing among alternatives comes up kalu 1999 decision makers often experience difficulties when selecting between options and these difficulties are even more evident when the decision involves multi criteria situations this applies also for the sustainability assessments of production systems in which a unique indicator hardly is able to represent all aspects embodied in it siche et al 2010a 2010b giannetti et al 2015 usually sustainability issues result in a trade off between environmental economic and social dimensions although some authors insert political or legal and technological concerns when analyzing projects under a multi criteria perspective decision making can be difficult since a win win scenario is hardly achieved the more criteria translated into indicators are added to each situation the more holistic and embracing should be the tools for decision making supported by scientific multi dimension models scott et al 2012 a decision regarding sustainability based on a multi criteria view by using data from different sources under different focuses and that involve several stakeholders can be translated in a term called multi criteria decision making mcdm or multi criteria decision analysis mcda according to kumar et al 2017 mcdm is defined as a branch of operational research that seeks to achieve optimal results in complex systems where several indicators multiple and conflicting objectives and criteria are involved literature is plentiful of papers regarding sustainability assessment using mcdm principles for instance martín gamboa et al 2017 provided a literature review on the application of mcdm to the sustainability assessment of energy systems while ibáñez forés et al 2014 have performed a literature review focused on methods including mcdm to select options from a sustainability perspective according to a literature review performed by scott et al 2012 focused on papers applying mcdm to the bioenergy sector authors find that mcdm can be considered a general term where more specifically indicators are embedded in several categories and inside the categories different mathematical methods are possible any mcdm demands a multicriteria tool to appropriately integrate under a quantitative analysis all the multiples numbers with different units being considered for this purpose the goal programming gp is an important tool gp is a mathematical method that was classified by ibáñez forés et al 2014 as a branch of the multi objective mathematical programming category gp was initially introduced by charnes cooper and ferguson in the 1950s charnes et al 1955 and further developed by other researchers ijiri 1965 lee 1972 ignizio 1978 romero 1985 currently gp is one of the most used multi criteria approaches in business practice and scientific research according to jayaraman et al 2015 gp is a popular and widely used technique to study decision problems in the face of multiple conflicting objectives zografidou et al 2017 stated that gp formulation is a multi criteria decision making type of analysis where certain goals are examined in terms of trade offs the authors provided an example of renewable energy type s selection in which a wind farm can provide clean energy and may contribute to the local economy of the region but it affects the normality of regional ecosystems gp applied to assess the sustainability of the most different production systems is largely found in the literature san cristóbal 2012a applied gp on an environmental input output linear programming model to the spanish economy and studied the capacity expansion planning for the renewable energy industry using the case study of the north of san cristóbal 2012b jayaraman et al 2015 proposed a weighted gp model that integrates efficient allocation of resources aiming to simultaneously achieve sustainability related goals on gross domestic product growth reduction of electricity consumption and greenhouse gases ghg emissions the model was applied in key economic sectors of the united arab emirates to be validated yang et al 2016 studied the application of a mcdm to assess the sustainable development of transport infrastructure projects chang 2015 proposed a so called multi choice gp model aiming to assess the expansion actions related to the renewable energy industry zografidou et al 2016 2017 applied gp tools to study the design of a renewable energy map by the allocation of solar plants to each region of greece the sustainability performance of european countries was studied by antanasijević et al 2017 who applied the differential multi criteria analysis technique to thirty european countries over 2004 and 2014 aiming to assess their progress in sustainability usually scientific papers focusing on sustainability assessments that have also applied gp supporting mcdm were developed without a deeper conceptual framework regarding sustainability concepts and definitions for instance some papers focus deeply on the technical issues of given activities and develop them under a narrow viewpoint considering only the technological benefits related to emissions reduction other researchers have performed the application of gp in a very comprehensive way choosing indicators that cover different aspects of sustainability of a given system but still without establishing a representative conceptual model yang et al 2016 zografidou et al 2016 2017 this aspect is also recognized by pulselli et al 2015 who argue that choice of one method or indicator rather than others can be always questioned because all of them have different abilities in representing the multidimensional aspects of sustainability according to our literature review we have identified a lack of a conceptual model of sustainability able to assign the multifunctions of each of the three dimensions environmental social and economic trying to overcome the lack of a strong conceptual model for sustainability assessments this paper proposes the five sector sustainability 5sensu model as the first step of an mcdm procedure the application of the proposed model would support interpretations and decisions based on a more holistic and embracing perspective since it addresses both the provider and receiver functions to environment and society here the 5sensu model is used with the goal programming to allow a multicriteria sustainability assessment the countries that form mercosur economic union were taken as a case study with the purpose of showing the application of the 5sensu but the procedure can be applied to study the sustainability of different productive systems identified as a mcdm situation 2 methods 2 1 five sector sustainability 5sensu model the conception of the 5sensu model is based on six basic axioms three i ii and iii from goodland 1995 and goodland and daly 1996 regarding the limits of natural resources in relation to their exploitation and consumption rates to guarantee the current development patterns and three axioms iv v and vi suggested by the authors of this work i no resource should be used at higher rates than its generation rate e g it takes thousand years to form oil reserves that can be explored and thus the time window of human existence and the formation of oil reserves are not compatible fossil oil will never be considered a renewable resource and in accordance with this axiom it should never be extracted except in a scenario as presented by the following axiom iii ii no contaminant should be produced at higher rates than their natural recycling process neutralization and absorption by the natural environment iii non renewable resource should never be used faster than the necessary time to replace it with a renewable resource iv there must be a balance between the environment as a supplier of resources and as receiver of waste and pollutants which could be achieved by cleaner production practices environmental care and conservation v the production of goods must be limited to the restrictions imposed by the sustainable exploitation of natural resources and by responsible consumption of the society vi for human as a social being its relationship with economic system through providing labor and receiving manufactured products must be balanced considering all these six axioms as well as the importance of three dimensions in representing sustainability the five sectors sustainability model 5sensu model was elaborated fig 1 the proposed model is aligned with the input state output environment society economy sustainability model proposed by pulselli et al 2015 which postulates sustainability as a matter of relationships among compartments allowing understanding human activity and its physical social and economic contexts according to bastianoni et al 2016 human driven systems are open since they demand energy and matter input flows and transform resources into goods and services by means of human labor efforts the model presented in fig 1 addresses to the environment the function of supplier and receiver the environment in sector 1 has a source function in providing for instance raw materials to support the production unit sector 3 functions the environment in sector 2 usually has a sink function being the receiver of the wastes and emissions generated by the production unit activities the same applies to the society that holds the functions of supplier and consumer society in sector 4 supplies socio economic resources to the production unit such as labor knowledge and know how and it receives money for this the production unit supplies products that will be consumed by the society that pays for them it is worthy to note that money only circulates on the right side of the diagram in activities that are human driven while the exchanges in the left side of the 5sensu model only contemplate flows of materials and energy in other words the resources provided by the environment are seen as free resources since no one paid for them the same reasoning applies to the waste released to the environment i e there is not a payment from the production unit to the environment as a counterpart of the dilution and decomposition services the idea of free resources hides the fact that the environment actually needs to converge energy either to generate resources and to assimilate or dilute the waste released by humans these can be understood as environmental services that are very often not taken into account in the traditional accounting practices the 5sensu model is a holistic model that comprises multi characteristics first the multi dimension is an important characteristic since it embraces social environmental and economic dimensions second it can be understood as a multi view model that may assume the point of view from the natural environment society as well as from the production unit third the indicators applied to the model are usually multi metric including energy volume mass money labor force etc fourth its multi criteria approach can be seen as an important feature of the tools considered within the 5sensu model since an unlimited combination of indicators with several weights and goals can be applied 2 2 principles for selecting indicators to feed the 5sensu the selection of indicators is inherent to each sector of the 5sensu for instance indicators related to environmental constraints must be located in the environmental sector and so on indicators can derive from previous studies or through criteria of experts chosen with non parametric statistical techniques among others the delphi approach dalkey and helmer 1963 is a participative approach that can be applied at this stage using the 5sensu model does not mean that indicators should be modified from their original rules algebra and definitions contrariwise they must respect their original procedures and meanings some general suggestions can be raised when chosing indicators to feed the 5sensu a social economic and environmental indicators must be considered to preserve the multidimensional characteristics of the model b the more indicators are considered for each sector the more holistic detailed complex and embracing the model becomes c indicators should respect as much as possible the same temporal analysis i e time window in order to have a consistent assessment within that time window d a balance should be sought in terms of the number of indicators selected by each sector in order to avoid assumed preferences for a specific sector important aspects to be considered as also suggested by blanc et al 2008 are representativeness relevance reliability sensitivity ease of understanding comparability and transparency when applying the 5sensu model the analyst must have in mind that besides selecting indicators it is necessary to determine the minimum and maximum values goals or targets of each indicator their desired direction positive or negative and their weighted values these parameters are mandatory to be used within the goal programming as explained in the next section similar to the indicators establishment the goals can be set from different approaches a by considering the expertise of analyst according to the case study being evaluated b participative meetings in which experts from different fields of knowledge can obtain a common agreement for instance using a non parametric statistical technique as delphi c governmental plans and reports d or even considering the threshold of each considered indicator 2 3 application of the fundamentals of goal programming to the 5sensu model goal programming gp can be understood as a mathematical method to handle problems with multiple and conflicting objectives that are translated into mcdm situations gp is one of the possible methods to be applied in the mcdm problems and it is used in this paper for the multicriteria modelling one of the most important aspects of gp is simon s satisfactory logic simon 1955 i e the gp is developed within the satisfactory paradigm rather than the optimizer paradigm the shift in simon s situational logic from optimized to satisfactory solutions implies in the search for solutions that are closest as possible to the chosen aspiration level or goal however the found solutions are not obligatorily the optimum ones the calculation algebra of the proposed sustainability assessment tool is based on the use of gp philosophy as a multicriteria analysis method to obtain the sustainability indicator this approach was firstly considered by goodland 1995 and goodland and daly 1996 as discussed by diaz balteiro 2008 2009 to express the results according to the proximity between the relative values of the indicators and their goals fig 2 shows in a qualitative way the philosophy derived from goal programming that is applied in the proposed tool to assess sustainability the schematic representation shows as an example that the objective of the indicator is to be minimized as the co2 emissions each evaluated system represented by circles have a different value for the indicator consequently there are different distances or deviations to the established goal for co2 emissions as the objective is to minimize the indicator those systems with co2 emissions above the goal 2 and 4 will receive higher punishments wabove goal than those systems below the goal wbelow goal 1 and 3 even the deviation of system 3 p 3 being higher than 2 p 2 and 4 p 4 or p 1 being the same as p 2 the final number is obtained by multiplying the deviation by its punishment resulting in p 1 wbelow goal for system 1 p 2 wabove goal for system 2 p 3 wbelow goal for system 3 and p 4 wabove goal for system 4 the same logic is applied when the objective is to maximize an indicator for instance profitability but in this case the higher punishments are set for those systems with profit value below the established goal the closer the indicator is to its established goal the higher will be the system performance for this indicator mainly for the indicator that respects the initial objective of minimization and or maximization i e it is located below or above the goal respectively in this work modifications have been made in the traditional goal programming in order to allow its application under the 5sensu model constraints which is hereafter explained under a mathematical background consider a decisional problem in which gi goals exist from the mathematical point of view the use of the gp philosophy in the 5sensu model is based on a linear objective function that aims to minimize the values of the unwanted deviations in the system weights are assigned to the indicators representing their relative importance to the system in this context the unwanted deviations are those ones that affect the performance of selected indicators expressed by 1 min z i wini wipi where min minimize z objective function w weighted value or aspiration of the deviation n negative deviation associated to higher better or maximize indicator p positive deviation associated to lower better or minimize indicator eq 1 is subject to the following constraints associated with the selected attributes or indicators 2 fi ki ni pi gi where fi ki mathematical expression for the i th indicator g aspiration level or goal n and p as previously defined under the following restrictions 3 ni 0 pi 0 ni pi 0 it is assumed that each sustainability indicator ki is associated with a linear function fi ki that characterizes its behavior this linear function is considered as a weak constraint in the gp before presenting the next deduction steps a definition of positive and negative indicators is needed positive indicators are those in which higher values mean better performance while the negative are those in which higher values represent worse performance for positive indicators constraint type the variable of undesired deviation is the negative one ni meaning that pi 0 and therefore the objective function would be min z ni subject to fi ki gi ni pi or fi ki ni pi gi ni gi fi ki for negative indicators constraint type the variable of undesired deviation is the positive one pi meaning that ni 0 and therefore the objective function would be min z pi subject to fi ki gi ni pi or fi ki ni pi gi pi fi ki gi when it is desired to reach exactly the level of aspiration constraint type the undesirable deviation variables are both positive pi and negative ni and therefore the objective function would be min z ni pi subject to fi ki gi ni pi or fi ki ni pi gi when applying the philosophy of goal programming the unwanted variables depend on the type of indicator positive or negative for positive indicators the undesired variable is the negative deviation n ijk with systems that reach the aspiration level set as a target or have a higher value of the positive deviation variable p ijk for negative indicators the undesirable variable is the positive deviation variable p ijk with systems that reach the target aspiration level or a higher value of the negative deviation variable n ijk thus for the higher better positive indicators we have 4 n i j k g j k k i j k k i j k g j k 0 k i j k g j k i 1 2 n e j 1 2 n s k 1 2 n i 5 p i j k k i j k g j k k i j k g j k 0 k i j k g j k i 1 2 n e j 1 2 n s k 1 2 n

w j k represent the weighted value of deviation g j k and g j k represent the goal established for the indicator although recognizing all the subjectivity involved weighting variables is an important and mandatory aspect within a multicriteria approach by weighting variables the analysist is able to make final numbers more realistic in representing the real world and useful for policy makers as usual the weighting procedure can be based mainly on the choice of the analyst who is supposed to be an expert in the case study being evaluated however participative approaches based on a common agreement of experts in different fields of knowledge are usually considered more robust and acceptable for the purposes of this work the weighting values procedure was based on the expertise of authors and it is recommended that w jk w jk for positive indicators and w jk w jk for negative indicators where w j k w j k r 0 w j k w j k 100 the chosen values applied in our case study were 0 2 and 100 considering eqs 8 and 9 the sector sustainability indicator ssiij is calculated as the sum of the differences between the positive and negative indicators 10 s s i i j i j k i s g i j k i s g

value or relative weight of each sector of the system being 0 wsj 1 and j w s j 5 0 w s j 1 finally eq 12 shows the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssisi which represents the overall performance of studied systems when considering the relationship among the indicators their nature established objectives and their relative importance 12 s s i s i j i s g s i j i 1 2 n e 2 4 a proposal for establishing levels of sustainability the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssis can be used for two main purposes a to define a ranking of sustainability among the sample studied which allows establishing work priorities and reduce the gaps among the different systems b the classification of the studied systems in sustainability levels sl based on the criteria presented in table 1 it is important to emphasize that sl is primarily a proposition in classifying or labelling the evaluated systems in different sustainability levels rather than mandatory this step can be applied by those ones who desire this kind of classification for their ultimate purposes although establishing sls could be considered important depending on the political purposes it can be applied only when a large sample is being studied due to the demanded statistical inferences on the obtained ssis as maximum and minimum values average and standard deviation all these statistical parameters are used in establishing the confidence intervals for the ssis sample 2 5 guidelines for the application of 5sensu model fig 3 presents a general framework for applying the proposed sustainability assessment tool driven by the 5sensu model data stage i for each sector are gathered with the concern of being representative and having as much as possible the same temporal basis for the parameters definitions the indicators stage ii for sectors are chosen and calculated each one with its own original definitions meanings rules and algebra goals stage iii are established for each indicator previously chosen and then settled to be maximized or minimized the weighting stage iv demands the establishment of weights for each indicator representing a punishment for those ones that are more distant from the fixed goals by means of the goal programming algebra as presented in the previous sections the sector sustainability indicator ssii and sustainability synthetic indicator of each system for each sector isgs is calculated stage v finally the final stage vi is the interpretation of the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssisi to support discussions and public policies appendix c shows all procedures of fig 3 automatized in a computer application it can be developed in different computational languages including a spreadsheet using the excel software 3 results and discussion the mercosur countries named from here as systems were used as a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed tool in assessing sustainability the mercosur is formed by full member countries and associate countries where argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay are full member countries venezuela was a full member but it was suspended in 2016 as associate countries there are bolivia chile colombia ecuador peru and suriname suriname even being an associate country was not included in this work due to the lack of data primary data were gathered from several sources as individually presented in the next sections the ideal situation would be having all data from the same year but this was not possible at this moment although from different years the used data do not impair the application of the proposed tool in assessing sustainability 3 1 establishing indicators goals and weight values to feed the 5sensu rather than choosing indicators and goals through a participatory meeting with experts they were chosen according to authors experience and data availability with the main purpose to illustrate the proposed approach two indicators per sector were chosen to feed the 5sensu model totalizing ten indicators details and the reasons in choosing indicators and goals are hereafter presented indicators are represented by the letter k followed by the number of the sector i and by its number in the sector j or kij the time window considered for all indicators is one year 3 1 1 sector 1 environment as a provider k11 biocapacity per capita 2012 according to the global footprint network 2017 biocapacity indicates the ecosystems capacity to produce resources used by people and to absorb waste generated by humans under current management schemes and extraction technologies thus k11 is an indicator that should be maximized the mean value added to the standard deviation was set as goal considering our expertise in the subject and due to data availability other authors wackernagel et al 2017 lewan and simmons 2001 moran et al 2008 liu et al 2017 have used this indicator to access the sustainability of countries k12 total emergy flow per capita 2008 emergy is defined as the sum of all inputs of energy directly or indirectly needed to make any product or service odum 1996 specifically the empower i e emergy per year is used this indicator must be maximized since the higher the empower per capita the more real wealth the nation holds the established goal was based on the same criteria as for k11 emergy flow per capita has been used by several authors fan et al 2018 liu et al 2017 viglia et al 2018 giannetti et al 2013 2018 in evaluating the sustainability of nations 3 1 2 sector 2 environment as a receiver k21 amount of co2 capita 2012 emissions according to the world bank 2017 data carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from fossil fuels burn this indicator must be minimized to avoid global warming as the co2 emissions is a current issue that deserves strong action to be minimized its goal was pushed as the minimum value on the evaluated sample of mercosur countries added to its standard deviation these statistical parameters were set according to authors expertise and data availability similar uses of this indicator in assessing the sustainability of nations have been made by liu et al 2017 and bekun et al 2019 k22 municipal solid waste per capita 2012 according to the pan american health organization paho the definition of municipal solid waste presented in the world bank s 2012 report what a waste a global review of solid waste management is solid or semi solid waste generated in population centers including domestic commercial wastes as well as those originated by the small scale industries and institutions including hospital and clinics market street sweeping and from public cleansing are included this indicator should be minimized to align with circular economy concepts and its goal was set as 1 1 kg capita day which is the average for latin america according to the paho report other authors used this indicator in similar assessments tomić and schneider 2017 cremiato et al 2018 3 1 3 sector 3 production unit k31 gdp per capita based on purchasing power parity gdp ppp per capita 2012 according to the world bank 2017 data gdp ppp is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates an international dollar has the same purchasing power over gdp as the u s dollar has in the united states this indicator must be maximized since it reflects the economic power of the nation the goal set for this indicator was pushed as the maximum value found in the evaluated sample of mercosur countries since the country that presents this level could be seen as a reference for the other ones similar uses of this indicator have been made by menegaki and tiwari 2017 and kurniawan and managi 2018 k32 gini 2013 gini index is a general measure of economic inequality according to the world bank data this index measures the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals or households within an economy deviates from an equal distribution an index of 0 represents perfect equality while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality thus gini must be minimized the goal set for this indicator was the minimum value existent in the sample of evaluated mercosur countries again because it could be considered as a reference to the others in achieving similar economic in equality level among several others examples of gini index usage can be found in menegaki and tiwari 2017 armiento 2018 neri et al 2017 and pulselli et al 2015 3 1 4 sector 4 society as a provider k41 employment rate 2012 according to the world bank 2017 data this indicator represents the proportion of a country s population that is employed thus it should be maximized since a job represents more than exclusively a source of economic resources in exchange of a delivered service among others a job also represents a social acceptance of a human being in its societal environment the established goal was pushed to 100 example of employment rate use can be found in antanasijević et al 2017 and ge et al 2017 k42 expected years of schooling according to the unpd 2017 this indicator represents the number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if the prevailing patterns of age specific enrolment rates persist throughout the child s life this indicator must be maximized meaning that more years spent in school higher educational level the population holds the goal was set as 16 years since this is the approximate value observed for countries with a high human development index as presented by the unpd database example of its usage can be found in the work of shen et al 2017 3 1 5 sector 5 society as a receiver k51 human development index hdi 2012 unpd 2017 defines hdi as an aggregated measure of the achievements in key dimensions of human development including long and healthy life being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living hdi values range from 0 worst scenario to 1 best scenario thus it must be maximized the value 0 8 was set as a goal since this is the lowest value of hdi to label a country as high level as shown by unpd database among other users shaker 2018 have used hdi in studying countries k52 national happiness level 2013 this indicator is available in the world happiness report published by the united nations sustainable development solutions network unsdsn 2013 it reflects the level of happiness of a given society this indicator is to be maximized which means higher happiness levels and the criteria to set the goal were the same as for k11 and k12 examples of its use can be found in verma 2017 and laczniak and santos 2018 table 2 summarizes all the chosen indicators for each sector as well as the goals set for each of them the values of each indicator for each country are shown in table 3 all the calculation procedures of fig 3 and appendix c were inserted into an excel spreadsheet where the gp mathematics fundamentals were set an application was designed in visual basic language for calculation purposes and then tabulated in a microsoft excel sheet supplementary material which applies the gp philosophy to classify the countries based on the 5sensu model 3 2 performance on sustainability for the mercosur countries intervals hierarchy and policy implications the sustainability of the mercosur bloc depends on the performance of each nation translated by their different indicators within the sectors of the 5sensu model as exposed in the calculation procedure modelling countries with lower ssisi values are more sustainable since their overall performance is closer to the established goals the level of sustainability is determined by the intervals as shown in table 4 which indicates a high sustainability level for uruguay and chile colombia and paraguay achieved low sustainability levels while all other countries are within the medium level it is worth to note that sustainability levels as presented in table 4 are valid exclusively for the sample 10 mercosur countries used in this work anyhow the focus here is the approach used in establishing the sustainability levels that can be replicated in other studies regarding a visual form on the hierarchy of sustainability based on numbers presented at appendix d fig 4 was developed to provide an easier and faster interpretation of the results this figure is the representation of the sustainability synthetic indicator of systems ssisi which locates the countries depending on their performance that is the most sustainable countries would be those with the lowest ssisi value the first column presents the sustainability final ranked countries according to their ssisi when all indicators of all sectors are simultaneously considered the country that shows the highest degree of sustainability is uruguay reaching a total ssis of 4 17 although uruguay is the most sustainable country under an overall perspective in some sectors it is not the most sustainable one for instance it holds 3rd 2nd 3rd and 4th positions in sectors 1 2 4 and 5 respectively paraguay showed the lowest degree of sustainability when all indicators are considered which is evidenced by its ssis of 15 11 it is interesting to note that in sector 4 brazil and venezuela are overlapped because they have the same value of ssisi for that sector although fig 4 shows easily understandable results it comes from deep previous complex calculating procedures as provided by the framework presented in fig 3 without a mathematical method it would be a hard task to consider all the indicators under a multicriteria perspective that result in a single number as expressed by the ssisi as already recognized by bastianoni et al 2016 the aggregation of a large number of specific indicators into a single one could be considered as positive due to its easy interpretation by a decision maker thinking towards a macro view on the other hand the extreme concentration of information into a single number could lead to loss of information hindering more specific public policies in this sense besides providing an aggregated result fig 4 highlights information on each sector evaluated and shows evidences to establish priorities among sectors regarding specific public policies the decision maker can use the proposed tool to verify in which sector a particular system has low performance in this case the analyst can go back in the calculations to verify which indicators are driving the low performance in that sector taking chile as an example the country holds the 4th position in sector 1 which is represented by indicators k11 biocapacity per capita and k12 total emergy flow per capita observing the data presented in appendix d indicator k12 generated a ssis12 that is the best one among all countries on the other hand indicator k11 generated a ssis11 that pulled down the position in the overall analysis of sector 1 for chile in this way indicator k11 would be a focus for improvements another example is uruguay that could make efforts to increase its total emergy flow per capita k12 increase the employment rate k41 and increase its national happiness index k52 the same analysis can be done for all other countries evaluated in this study 4 conclusions the 5sensu model is proposed to support a sustainability assessment based on a more holistic perspective of a system when compared to the existing approaches found in the scientific literature it considers the environment either as a supplier of resources and or as a receiver of waste and emissions the society is also seen as a provider of labor force and as a receiver of goods the model drives the analyst and policymakers to seek a balance among the 5sensu sectors towards sustainability the application of the gp philosophy supporting the calculation algebra within the proposed tool works as a multicriteria analysis allowing the sustainability performance evaluation of the different sectors considering the goals of the selected indicators the approach allows measuring the system s sustainability performance in order to rank and classify them in levels of sustainability the 5sensu model brings some advantages such as the holistic view of the system the recognition of the double functions for the environment and society and the importance of using a multi criteria approach when dealing with sustainability on the other hand the main limitation which is also shared with all other multicriteria based assessment methods is related to the need for a larger amount of primary data for calculating the indicators as well as establishing goals and weights the case study allowed ranking the sustainability of the mercosur countries where the performance in the different sectors is clearly presented furthermore countries were classified into high uruguay and chile medium venezuela brazil argentina bolivia peru and ecuador and low colombia and paraguay sustainability levels although the sustainability levels classification is specific for the sample under study it can be considered important in a macro analysis where clusters are essential to highlight differences while the macro analysis reveals what spots or sectors must be primarily focused for specific public policies the analyst may go back in the calculations to verify which indicators should be improved for achieving higher sustainability in this sense results showed that uruguay holds the best position when all indicators of all sectors are considered however improvements are demanded on specific indicators in sectors 5 4 and 1 precisely the national happiness level k52 employment rate k41 and total emergy flow per capita k12 the 5sensu model provides a strong scientific basis to evaluate the sustainability of production systems at any scale including regional analysis by organizing the sectors as donors and receivers the model also provides a holistic view of how a given system may improve or balance its relationship among the components sectors the 5sensu model can be applied to other case studies to validate its use as well as a subsidy
