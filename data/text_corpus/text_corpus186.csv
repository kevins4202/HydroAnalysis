samples from the five sampling sites however the dietary composition of alcopapia alcalica showed microcystis sp as the most dominant species 4 discussion 4 1 water quality analysis the ph ammonium bod and cod parameters were above permissible limits by the world health organization who 2008 and the water quality standards regulations stipulated in the tanzania environmental management act of 2004 water quality standards regulations 2007 furthermore the mean values of some physico chemical parameters showed variations between sampling sites indicating a significant difference attributions of pollution determinants in the studied sites tables 2 and 3 appropriate alkalinity levels prevent fast ph change and thus balances the ph levels since aquatic life is sensitive to ph changes the maintenance of alkalinity levels has been reported to prevent rapid ph changes thus ecosystem sustainability mazlum et al 1999 the alkalinity levels increase as the alkaline compounds such as hydroxides bicarbonates hco3 and carbonates co3 2 increase these alkaline compounds eliminate the h ions from water which as a result lowers the acidity of the water and cause higher ph ph is an important limiting chemical factor for aquatic organisms and any changes in ph can change the characteristics of water chemistry enujiugha nwanna 2004 a ph between 7 and 8 5 is ideal for biological productivity and ph 4 is detrimental to aquatic life deekae et al 2010 ph changes with temperature and impacts the dissolved oxygen levels in water which in turn affects biochemical reactions such as photosynthesis which might result to impairing or killing of the aquatic organisms manjare et al 2013 mazlum et al 1999 the observed ph levels above the maximum permissible limits at lnrs lowers the water quality and thus impede the lnrs aquatic ecosystem health the increase of alkaline compounds at lnrs can be explained by various anthropogenic activities along engaresero and pinyinyi rivers a comparable observation was reported at these areas affecting the plankton and lesser flamingos abundance mgimwa et al 2021 moreover such water from river inlets found to be unsuitable for domestic use and irrigation purposes as the permissible limit is 9 since the ph of water sample from three sampling were above permissible limit of 6 5 8 5 and 6 5 8 of tanzania ema and who respectively table 2 and 3 it can be concluded that the water affects the lnrs aquatic organisms water quality standards regulations 2007 who 2008 temperature influences a number of other physical chemical and biological processes and the ecosystems balance in water bodies and therefore the concentration of many variables machena 1997 temperature influences water density whereby as the water becomes hot its density lowers and vice versa additionally it ipacts the solubility of chemical compounds hence solubility of some pollutants to dissolve in water increased temperature also contributes to increasing metabolic rates and decrease the solubility of gases in water especially oxygen which consequently threatens the survival of aquatic life high bod and cod concentration levels give insight on high water temperature that can be an indicator of poor water quality along lnrs catchment sharma capoor 2010 nutrient loading and temperature are important factors for cyanobacterial dominance where by growth physiology and rates of bloom forming cyanobacteria including potentially toxigenic members are optimal around or above 25 ballot et al 2004 blooming of such toxic cyanobacteria can have chronic effects on aquatic life water birds lesser flamingos and livestock animals ballot et al 2004 high water temperature levels can be attributed to loss of riparian vegetation along lnrs that opened the canopy cover resulting in direct heating of the water the recommended ammonium concentrations for aquatic life is below 0 1 mg l who 2008 although the alcolapia sp have been reported to survive in a range between 3 and 4 mg l the impacts of observed high amount of ammonium in lnrs contribute to the increase of ph levels ammonium in water increases as a result of waste decomposition in water and it is a measure of the amount of pollution in water which lowers oxygen levels and increases carbon dioxide additionally ammonium concentrations increase has been reported to correlate with temperature increases for this case the higher ammonium concentrations at lnrs could also be favored by hot weather during dry sampling september 2020 the finding of this study agrees with mgimwa et al 2021 who reported higher ammonium concentrations at magadini and pinyinyi in lake natron the study reported a significant correlation of ammonium concentrations and phytoplankton abundance which support waterbirds and lesser flamingos similar observations have been documented at lake manyara howell et al 2014 at lake bogoria nakuru and elementaita robinson 2015 in the particular study higher ammonia concentrations were recorded ranging between 2450 and 4900 mg l exceeding the permissible levels between 3 and 4 mg l it is the ammonia at an elevated ph that can be toxic to aquatic life the activity of ammonia is also influenced by temperature and ionic strength decomposition and ammonification of nutrient rich organic matter are the principal source of ammonia in african soda lakes clarisse et al 2019 generally this includes the breakdown of plankton waterbirds and lesser flamingos excreta and organic material from rivers crop residues agricultural run off and livestock and humans wastes gichuki et al 2006 riddick et al 2012 bod measures the amount of oxygen that is required by microorganism for aerobic decomposition of organic matter while cod represents the level of biodegradable and non degradable organic pollution azmi et al 2015 bhateria abdullah 2016 chandra et al 2012 the bod and cod are among potential and reliable indicators of water pollution in stream inlets by domestic industrial and agricultural activities hur et al 2010 according to tanzania environmental management act 2004 and its water quality standards regulations the permissible limits of cod levels should not exceed 60 mg l while that of bod should not exceed 30 mg l the higher bod above permissible standards depletes oxygen in aquatic ecosystem through the consumption of do by microorganisms masese et al 2009 the average do amount for aquatic life and fish survival is between 2 7 mg l the depletion of do is usually linked to accumulation and decomposition of organic matter which consumes oxygen and generates harmful gases such as methane mero 2011 high values of bod in lnrs could be explained by anthropogenic activities at lnrs catchment area a similar remark on bod high values was documented at engarasero and pinyinyi rivers in 2019 mgimwa et al 2021 waterbird faeces including the lesser flamingos have been accounted for the increased nutrient inputs in freshwater dessborn et al 2016 mgimwa et al 2021 apart from faeces high bod concentrations could have been contributed by the surface runoff and underground water movement containing leachates from the solid waste landfill found at engeresero landfill leachates may contain high bod up to 30 000 mg l and for young landfills it may reach 60 000 mg l el fadel et al 2003 additionally existence of nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates has been associated with higher bod levels nitrates and phosphates which are sometimes referred as plant nutrients alter plant and algae growth in water bwalya 2015 mwangi 2014 these nutrients have been observed to affect the primary productivity of an ecosystem and plankton abundance in soda lakes boros et al 2008 dessborn et al 2016 hahn et al 2008 manny et al 1994 mgimwa et al 2021 vanni 2002 however the measured nitrate levels were low to cause the assessed impacts to aquatic organisms at lnrs on the other hand it was found that the do demand for pollutant decomposition and other needs bod and cod is high as a result lower do under low do the aquatic ecosystem is degraded which in addition risk the aquatic life rickwood carr 2009 the decrease of do in water in lnrs was supported with observed open mouthed fish at the lake surface nevertheless considering the anthropogenic activities around lnrs further assessment on these nutrients impact is important atwood et al 2001 4 2 plankton analysis in african soda lakes blooms have been mostly caused by the dominance of the cyanobacteria genera spirulina cyanospira and arthrospira ballot et al 2004 deocampo renaut 2016 howell et al 2014 krienitz et al 2013 melack 1979 robinson 2015 vareschi 1982 in most cases the change in physico chemical parameters in the lake waters are highly linked to phytoplankton composition and ecosystems high levels of chloride bicarbonate and alkalinity concentrations in lnrs have been associated with microcystis dominancy de farias silva et al 2016 a similar situation was reported in the nearby soda lake lake baringo in kenya where microcystis sp dominated the plankton community during the dry period schagerl oduor 2003 the ability of cyanobacteria to out compete other algae in such habitats have been reported in kenyan rift valley s lakes ballot et al 2009 besides salinity other factors may influence the cyanobacterial species dominance in freshwater furthermore the eutrophic condition of lnrs can stimulate the growth of microcystis species ballot et al 2009 schagerl 2016 the inability of reporting plankton colonies in sampled water in lnrs could be due to water preservation method during sampling and transportation however microcystis sp dominancy in dietary composition of sampled fish indicate the presence of phytoplankton in lnrs 4 3 anthropogenic features anthropogenic activities such as unsustainable crop cultivation deforestation overgrazing and overfishing were observed around lnrs catchment these activities have been associated with water pollution at lnrs mgimwa et al 2021 additionally the highest water turbidity at lnrs could be explained by such ongoing anthropogenic activities along the lnrs catchment sediments flow from inlets rivers upstream due to unsustainable agricultural activities conducted upstream of pinyinyi and engaresero rivers is one of the contributing factors for water pollution a similar observation has been reported by mgimwa and colleagues 2021 moreover the results of this study agree with ballot 2009 who observed degradation and salinization in lakes naivasha and oloidien in kenya due to anthropogenic activities and landscape use change in addition to that the presence of aquatic plants including algae could also cause higher water turbidity leading to water pollution pollution of water at lnrs was ascertained with yellow green coloration of water high fish mortalities were reported from september 2020 a hot season and during which the water temperature is high the amount of water from lnrs catchment is also low due to dryness furthermore during this season the evaporation process is high and therefore contributes to increase of ph ammonium bod and cod as a result these physico chemical parameters lower the amount of do which is crucial for fish and other aquatic life mgimwa et al 2021 5 conclusion the study has provided insights into the water quality of the lnrs as an impact of population increase and anthropogenic activities the measured high levels of bod cod ammonium and ph physico chemical parameters stress the lnrs aquatic life which might have caused the reported fish mortalities these results necessitate further investigation to explore the environmental status and management approaches at lnrs for its ecosystem sustainability the study therefore proposes watershed management using nature based solutions including riparian vegetation restoration at lnrs catchment additionally education on environmental conservation and awareness for lnrs ecosystem sustainability through sustainable agriculture aquaculture and livestock practices along the catchment for sustainable lnrs moreover further analysis on algal toxins is recommended for more understandings on toxicity levels additionally biological chemical and physical conditions of lnrs are required for conclusive remarks on the cause of pelican mortalities further molecular analysis on fish and pelican samples to support these preliminary findings have to be undertaken authors contributions cy designed the study wrote the protocol

bod and cod parameters were above permissible limits by the world health organization who 2008 and the water quality standards regulations stipulated in the tanzania environmental management act of 2004 water quality standards regulations 2007 furthermore the mean values of some physico chemical parameters showed variations between sampling sites indicating a significant difference attributions of pollution determinants in the studied sites tables 2 and 3 appropriate alkalinity levels prevent fast ph change and thus balances the ph levels since aquatic life is sensitive to ph changes the maintenance of alkalinity levels has been reported to prevent rapid ph changes thus ecosystem sustainability mazlum et al 1999 the alkalinity levels increase as the alkaline compounds such as hydroxides bicarbonates hco3 and carbonates co3 2 increase these alkaline compounds eliminate the h ions from water which as a result lowers the acidity of the water and cause higher ph ph is an important limiting chemical factor for aquatic organisms and any changes in ph can change the characteristics of water chemistry enujiugha nwanna 2004 a ph between 7 and 8 5 is ideal for biological productivity and ph 4 is detrimental to aquatic life deekae et al 2010 ph changes with temperature and impacts the dissolved oxygen levels in water which in turn affects biochemical reactions such as photosynthesis which might result to impairing or killing of the aquatic organisms manjare et al 2013 mazlum et al 1999 the observed ph levels above the maximum permissible limits at lnrs lowers the water quality and thus impede the lnrs aquatic ecosystem health the increase of alkaline compounds at lnrs can be explained by various anthropogenic activities along engaresero and pinyinyi rivers a comparable observation was reported at these areas affecting the plankton and lesser flamingos abundance mgimwa et al 2021 moreover such water from river inlets found to be unsuitable for domestic use and irrigation purposes as the permissible limit is 9 since the ph of water sample from three sampling were above permissible limit of 6 5 8 5 and 6 5 8 of tanzania ema and who respectively table 2 and 3 it can be concluded that the water affects the lnrs aquatic organisms water quality standards regulations 2007 who 2008 temperature influences a number of other physical chemical and biological processes and the ecosystems balance in water bodies and therefore the concentration of many variables machena 1997 temperature influences water density whereby as the water becomes hot its density lowers and vice versa additionally it ipacts the solubility of chemical compounds hence solubility of some pollutants to dissolve in water increased temperature also contributes to increasing metabolic rates and decrease the solubility of gases in water especially oxygen which consequently threatens the survival of aquatic life high bod and cod concentration levels give insight on high water temperature that can be an indicator of poor water quality along lnrs catchment sharma capoor 2010 nutrient loading and temperature are important factors for cyanobacterial dominance where by growth physiology and rates of bloom forming cyanobacteria including potentially toxigenic members are optimal around or above 25 ballot et al 2004 blooming of such toxic cyanobacteria can have chronic effects on aquatic life water birds lesser flamingos and livestock animals ballot et al 2004 high water temperature levels can be attributed to loss of riparian vegetation along lnrs that opened the canopy cover resulting in direct heating of the water the recommended ammonium concentrations for aquatic life is below 0 1 mg l who 2008 although the alcolapia sp have been reported to survive in a range between 3 and 4 mg l the impacts of observed high amount of ammonium in lnrs contribute to the increase of ph levels ammonium in water increases as a result of waste decomposition in water and it is a measure of the amount of pollution in water which lowers oxygen levels and increases carbon dioxide additionally ammonium concentrations increase has been reported to correlate with temperature increases for this case the higher ammonium concentrations at lnrs could also be favored by hot weather during dry sampling september 2020 the finding of this study agrees with mgimwa et al 2021 who reported higher ammonium concentrations at magadini and pinyinyi in lake natron the study reported a significant correlation of ammonium concentrations and phytoplankton abundance which support waterbirds and lesser flamingos similar observations have been documented at lake manyara howell et al 2014 at lake bogoria nakuru and elementaita robinson 2015 in the particular study higher ammonia concentrations were recorded ranging between 2450 and 4900 mg l exceeding the permissible levels between 3 and 4 mg l it is the ammonia at an elevated ph that can be toxic to aquatic life the activity of ammonia is also influenced by temperature and ionic strength decomposition and ammonification of nutrient rich organic matter are the principal source of ammonia in african soda lakes clarisse et al 2019 generally this includes the breakdown of plankton waterbirds and lesser flamingos excreta and organic material from rivers crop residues agricultural run off and livestock and humans wastes gichuki et al 2006 riddick et al 2012 bod measures the amount of oxygen that is required by microorganism for aerobic decomposition of organic matter while cod represents the level of biodegradable and non degradable organic pollution azmi et al 2015 bhateria abdullah 2016 chandra et al 2012 the bod and cod are among potential and reliable indicators of water pollution in stream inlets by domestic industrial and agricultural activities hur et al 2010 according to tanzania environmental management act 2004 and its water quality standards regulations the permissible limits of cod levels should not exceed 60 mg l while that of bod should not exceed 30 mg l the higher bod above permissible standards depletes oxygen in aquatic ecosystem through the consumption of do by microorganisms masese et al 2009 the average do amount for aquatic life and fish survival is between 2 7 mg l the depletion of do is usually linked to accumulation and decomposition of organic matter which consumes oxygen and generates harmful gases such as methane mero 2011 high values of bod in lnrs could be explained by anthropogenic activities at lnrs catchment area a similar remark on bod high values was documented at engarasero and pinyinyi rivers in 2019 mgimwa et al 2021 waterbird faeces including the lesser flamingos have been accounted for the increased nutrient inputs in freshwater dessborn et al 2016 mgimwa et al 2021 apart from faeces high bod concentrations could have been contributed by the surface runoff and underground water movement containing leachates from the solid waste landfill found at engeresero landfill leachates may contain high bod up to 30 000 mg l and for young landfills it may reach 60 000 mg l el fadel et al 2003 additionally existence of nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates has been associated with higher bod levels nitrates and phosphates which are sometimes referred as plant nutrients alter plant and algae growth in water bwalya 2015 mwangi 2014 these nutrients have been observed to affect the primary productivity of an ecosystem and plankton abundance in soda lakes boros et al 2008 dessborn et al 2016 hahn et al 2008 manny et al 1994 mgimwa et al 2021 vanni 2002 however the measured nitrate levels were low to cause the assessed impacts to aquatic organisms at lnrs on the other hand it was found that the do demand for pollutant decomposition and other needs bod and cod is high as a result lower do under low do the aquatic ecosystem is degraded which in addition risk the aquatic life rickwood carr 2009 the decrease of do in water in lnrs was supported with observed open mouthed fish at the lake surface nevertheless considering the anthropogenic activities around lnrs further assessment on these nutrients impact is important atwood et al 2001 4 2 plankton analysis in african soda lakes blooms have been mostly caused by the dominance of the cyanobacteria genera spirulina cyanospira and arthrospira ballot et al 2004 deocampo renaut 2016 howell et al 2014 krienitz et al 2013 melack 1979 robinson 2015 vareschi 1982 in most cases the change in physico chemical parameters in the lake waters are highly linked to phytoplankton composition and ecosystems high levels of chloride bicarbonate and alkalinity concentrations in lnrs have been associated with microcystis dominancy de farias silva et al 2016 a similar situation was reported in the nearby soda lake lake baringo in kenya where microcystis sp dominated the plankton community during the dry period schagerl oduor 2003 the ability of cyanobacteria to out compete other algae in such habitats have been reported in kenyan rift valley s lakes ballot et al 2009 besides salinity other factors may influence the cyanobacterial species dominance in freshwater furthermore the eutrophic condition of lnrs can stimulate the growth of microcystis species ballot et al 2009 schagerl 2016 the inability of reporting plankton colonies in sampled water in lnrs could be due to water preservation method during sampling and transportation however microcystis sp dominancy in dietary composition of sampled fish indicate the presence of phytoplankton in lnrs 4 3 anthropogenic features anthropogenic activities such as unsustainable crop cultivation deforestation overgrazing and overfishing were observed around lnrs catchment these activities have been associated with water pollution at lnrs mgimwa et al 2021 additionally the highest water turbidity at lnrs could be explained by such ongoing anthropogenic activities along the lnrs catchment sediments flow from inlets rivers upstream due to unsustainable agricultural activities conducted upstream of pinyinyi and engaresero rivers is one of the contributing factors for water pollution a similar observation has been reported by mgimwa and colleagues 2021 moreover the results of this study agree with ballot 2009 who observed degradation and salinization in lakes naivasha and oloidien in kenya due to anthropogenic activities and landscape use change in addition to that the presence of aquatic plants including algae could also cause higher water turbidity leading to water pollution pollution of water at lnrs was ascertained with yellow green coloration of water high fish mortalities were reported from september 2020 a hot season and during which the water temperature is high the amount of water from lnrs catchment is also low due to dryness furthermore during this season the evaporation process is high and therefore contributes to increase of ph ammonium bod and cod as a result these physico chemical parameters lower the amount of do which is crucial for fish and other aquatic life mgimwa et al 2021 5 conclusion the study has provided insights into the water quality of the lnrs as an impact of population increase and anthropogenic activities the measured high levels of bod cod ammonium and ph physico chemical parameters stress the lnrs aquatic life which might have caused the reported fish mortalities these results necessitate further investigation to explore the environmental status and management approaches at lnrs for its ecosystem sustainability the study therefore proposes watershed management using nature based solutions including riparian vegetation restoration at lnrs catchment additionally education on environmental conservation and awareness for lnrs ecosystem sustainability through sustainable agriculture aquaculture and livestock practices along the catchment for sustainable lnrs moreover further analysis on algal toxins is recommended for more understandings on toxicity levels additionally biological chemical and physical conditions of lnrs are required for conclusive remarks on the cause of pelican mortalities further molecular analysis on fish and pelican samples to support these preliminary findings have to be undertaken authors contributions cy designed the study wrote the protocol

management keywords reservoir phytoplankton community assemblage ecohydrology species dynamics gis management 1 introduction phytoplankton is the primary producer in an aquatic ecosystem and an important part of the aquatic food chain therefore phytoplankton is essential to support a healthy aquatic ecosystem and used as ecological indicator xu et al 2001 the composition of phytoplankton community is a critical component in environmental monitoring ecosystem restoration and management arhonditsis et al 2003 arhonditsis and brett 2005 cottingham and carpenter 1998 the spatio temporal dynamics of phytoplankton community are closely related to variations of environmental conditions and define primary biotic structure of the ecological niche of a lake bellinger and sigee 2015 padisák et al 2009 the temporal and spatial variations of phytoplankton are an important factor to notify the instability of hydrological parameters and their cyclic changes the assemblage pattern of phytoplankton is influenced by various biotic camarena gómez et al 2018 as well as abiotic factors gogoi et al 2019 sarkar et al 2020 the main factors regulating phytoplankton growth are primarily temperature rainfall dissolved gases and nutrient concentrations reynolds 2006 these factors differently affect species influencing their differential growth of specific groups of phytoplankton and thereby affecting community dynamics edwards et al 2016a in tropical lakes the amount of precipitation and their changes physical and chemical conditions indirectly affect the phytoplankton growth i e

environmental conditions maileht et al 2013 parakkandi et al 2021 and thus they are suitable for ecological indicators bellinger and sigee 2015 gogoi et al 2021 in general the phytoplankton communities changes consistently with time and are highly influenced by seasonal dynamics weithoff et al 2015 the phytoplankton shows their responses towards frequently changing scenario of the environmental conditions especially to temperature light and nutrients carvalho et al 2013 gameiro et al 2007 water transparency is one of the crucial abiotic factors that allowing thelight permeability into the water which may directly affect the photosynthesis of autotrophs and thus impacting the phytoplankton growth and their overall distribution fleming lehtinen and laamanen 2012 jiang et al 2014 in the aquatic environment likewise seasonal dynamics as a result of climatic variability also influence the phytoplankton community structure directly edwards et al 2016b figueredo and giani 2001 mohanty et al 2022 therefore qualitative as well as quantitative assessment of plankton community assumes to be a significant criterion for devising sustainable management policies for the reservoir ecosystem india is bestowed with considerable number of man made impoundment resources with 3 51 million ha of reservoir area sarkar et al 2018 out of which odisha state is having 1 97

fisheries resource of the odisha 6 66 lakh ha parida et al 2022 however these small reservoirs have tremendous potential for fisheries enhancement and livelihood generation lianthuamluaia et al 2021 sandhya et al 2019 in particular the average fish production of the reservoir is much lower than the production potential sarkar et al 2018 several research has been paid attention towards stocking of fish for increasing fish yield but judicious stocking of cultured fishes based on the reservoir ecology has been neglected the researchers have been working for stock enhancement by establishing a relationship between stocking density and reservoir area without considering other ecological parameters sarkar et al 2020 2018 sugunan and katiha 2004 the reservoirs are distributed over diverse geo climatic conditions with different catchment ecosystems and drainage patterns in order to achieve full utilization of available ecological resources in the reservoir for fisheries enhancement systematic ecology and hydrology studies are required the present study was undertaken to assess the spatio temporal patterns of phytoplankton community structure in relation to environmental

merismopedia sp microcystis sp cylindrospermum sp and oscillatoria sp chlorophyta monoraphidium sp chlorella sp scenedesmus bijugatus scenedesmus dimorphus coelastrum sp and bacillariophyta aulacoseira sp and fragilaria sp table 2 among them the most dominant one in the reservoir was phormidium sp throughout the seasons y 0 16 0 12 0 15 in pre monsoon post monsoon and monsoon respectively microcystis sp and chroococcus sp were strongly dominated in summer season while merismopedia sp in monsoon under the group cyanophyta overall species monoraphidium sp and cylindrospermum sp was dominated during post monsoon season aulacoseira sp and fragilaria sp selected as dominant belonging to group bacillariophyta and primarily dominated duringmonsoon and post monsoon 3 3 diversity indices based on the diversity indices the diversity pattern and their abundance were plotted in gis platform fig 6 the shannon wiener diversity h and simpson index ranged from 3 09 to 3 58 and 0 92 to 0 95 respectively both the index values indicated high diversity during monsoon season margalef s species richness index also showed similar observation a greater number of species were recorded during monsoon station wise diversity indices reflected that zone 1 and zone 3 found to be highest number of species the h value was found to have ranged between 3 10 to 3 54 indicated a greater diversity in the semi lotic zone 3 and zone 1 respectively as compared to transitional and lacustrine zone of the reservoir the phytoplankton species were more uniformly distributed in zone 1 as compared to the other zones which was evident from the calculated value of pielou s evenness index j results of anova dunn s post hoc showed a significant variation p 0 05 of diversity indices d h and 1 d across seasons except j however all the indices did not exhibit significant spatial variation in the reservoir the variability and association pattern of 16 environmental variables and the group chlorophyta was presented using pca which explained 54 74 of variation on the first two principal components pc fig 7 it was found that chlorophyta abundance showed strong and positive association with the depth transparency chloride and total alkalinity but inversely associated with temperature for cyanophyta group pca explained 56 41 variabilityon the first two pcs factor loadings are presented in the supplementary file the most important variables for pc1 were water temperature 0 399 do 0 321 total hardness 0 379 and ca2 0 371 and for pc 2 transparency 0 326 specific conductivity 0 345 tds 0 334 phosphate 0 395 and silicate 0 421 similarly pca loading for group bacillariophyta showed that the group was negatively influenced by water temperature and nutrients phosphate and silicate while positively related with the specific conductivity do tds total hardness ca2 and transparency the observations for the euglenophyta revealed that pca1 explained 31 21 of the variation whereas axis 2 further accounted 56 46 variability however in the group zygnematophyta it exhibited 29 75 and 54 16 variability in axes 1 and 2 respectively the pca loading showed that the euglenophyta abundance was negatively influenced by water temperature specific conductivity and nutrients parameters phosphate and silicate and positively correlated with total hardness transparency and ca2 similarly zygnematophyta abundance was positively influenced by tds depth do total hardness transparency and ca2 and negatively correlated with phosphate silicate and water temperature overall principal component analysis revealed that the 9 important parameters viz water temperature transparency total hardness ph specific conductivity total alkalinity and nutrients parameters phosphate nitrate and silicate were the most important environmental parameter abiotic factors which influencing the phytoplankton community composition in the studied reservoir 3 4 cca on dominant species major phytoplankton groups and environmental factors cca was performed to analyze the relationship between phytoplankton groups as well as dominant species and nine environmental variables extracted from pca to understand the influential factors for the distribution and assemblage pattern of total phytoplankton population as well as the dominant species in the studied reservoir total 13 dominant species table no 2 bold values species and seven groups with nine environmental variables were selected for cca the cca ordination triplot for dominant species are shown in fig 8 the result of cca together explained 82 46 of the total variance for the dominant species while visualizing the correlation of dominant species phormidium sp closely associated with the specific conductivity total hardness and silicate whereas cylindrospermum sp chroococcus sp oscillatoria sp meresmopedia sp were negatively correlated to the phosphate similarly the microcystis sp grow well in the water rich with nitrate phosphate and ph and low concentration of total alkalinity had their close association with total alkalinity and temperature and nitrate while comparing the chlorophytes species it was reflected that chlorophyta had close association with the environmental variables such as total alkalinity total hardness and transparency species s dimorphus and s bijugatus and monorahidium sp were positively gradient towards total alkalinity and transparency and negatively towards nitrate whereas coelastrum sp was inclined towards total alkalinity than phosphate concentration genus aulacoseira sp had a close affinity with the water temperature and nitrate and diatom fragilaria sp with silicate the result indicated that total alkalinity water temperature and silicate were the influential factors for growth of bacillariophyta overall the cca canonical correspondence analysis depicted the environmental factors such as temperature total alkalinity total hardness transparency and ph and nutrients no3 n po4 p and sio4 si were the effective variables for the distribution of overall phytoplankton population and more specifically the dominant species of the reservoir 3 5 similarity pattern of phytoplankton the dendogram simprof test based on bray curtis similarity matrix revealed two clusters i e group i z2p z3p z4p and group ii z1pm z2pm z3pm z1m z2m z3m fig 9 left panel both the groups were not found to be statistically significant p 0 05 with a similarity percentage of 85 84 and 84 76 respectively however the phytoplankton compositions at the zone 1 during post monsoon was significantly different from the group i and showed a 77 similarity in their community compositions similarly the samples of the zone 4 during monsoon and pre monsoon also exhibited a significant variation from the group ii all the zones exhibited overall 75 similarity in their community compositions fig 9 right panel further anosim also portrayed a significant variation r 0 92 p 1 2 of the phytoplankton community compositions between the two groups simper analysis comparing the groups stated the average similarity percentage was found to be ranged between 80 82 with maximum in group i species phormidim sp 24 45 was the major contributor followed by chrococcus sp 16 33 meresmopedia sp 10 41 microcystis sp 7 12 cylindrospermum sp 6 58 dolichospermum sp 4 25 monoraphidium sp 2 68 and selenestrum sp 2 14 at the same time phormidium sp 14 61 also found to be key contributor in the group ii and other species were meresmopedia sp 11 76 chrococcus sp 9 37 cylindrospermum sp 5 79 microcystis sp 5 66 monoraphidium sp 4 53 aulacoseira sp 3 57 coelestrum sp 2 86 chlorela sp 2 63 selenestrum sp 2 54 and scenedesmus dimorphus 2 39 the average dissimilarity between the groups was stated with 32 81 table 3 the phytoplankton species mainly responsible for the differences in abundance pattern was phormidium sp microcystis sp chrococcus sp dolichospermum sp oscillatria sp aulacosira sp the cumulative dominance curve k dominance extracted for the studied reservoir indicated that the species abundance was distinctively higher during pre monsoon season and the plotted curves overlapped for monsoon and post monsoon seasons indicating a similar dominance pattern during those periods 3 6 correlation between fish species based on feeding guilds and algal groups to understand the relationship between the fish species characterized based on the feeding guilds and the phytoplankton groups a correlation matrix karl pearson s was performed table 4 the results portrayed that the herbivores fish species of the reservoir had a significant positive correlation with euglenophyta r 0 96 p 0 01 zygnematophyta r 0 72 p 0 01 and cryptophyta r 0 97 p 0 01 however the inverse scenario was seen with the bacillariophyta r 0 95 p 0 01 and cyanophyta r 0 34 p 0 01 the fish species having characterized as omnivores and carnivores had a strong association with the cyanophyta r 0 99 p 0 01 and bacillariophyta r 0 66 p 0 01 but strong negative correlation with zygnematophyta r 0 92 p 0 01 and dinophyta r 0 97 p 0 01 respectively on the other hand omnivores and carnivores also had a significant negative correlation with the cryptophyta 4 discussion 4 1 phytoplankton assemblages and distribution in the present study it was observed that the algal cell density was greater in zone 1 while lowest in zone 4 these differences are likely due to the environmental settings of the sites as mentioned that zone 1 is connected to a stream and is close to cluster of aquatic vegetation such as vallisneria potamogeton ceratophyllum etc in the reservoir the land use pattern of catchment area near this site is predominated with agricultural land and forestry thus the nutrients inputs to this zone were sufficient through the surface runoff and connecting channel which supports the growth of phytoplankton population stated that a high concentration of nutrients with in a certain range can promote an increase in phytoplankton density which can contribute to an increased growth of phytoplankton phytoplankton community structure and their distribution pattern are directly affected by the habitat yu et al 1994 although the depth was not detected as an influencing variable statistically the depth is the most important factor among the other morphometric factors that can be directly correlated with the phytoplankton productivity as because shallower area in the reservoir has larger proportions substrates in euphotic zone as compared to deeper ones here zone 4 depth 26 30 feet where most of the substrate is locked up as aphotic zones although the present study showed comparatively higher nutrients and transparency in the zone 4 the high depth exhibits inverse relationship with the major groups of phytoplankton production fig 2 thus depth could be correlated to low cell density coupled with other edaphic factors and physical factors in addition climatic factor such as wind direction in the reservoir is also responsible for scattering of drifting organisms which coincides the high phytoplankton abundance in the littoral zones in zone 1 algal groups cyanophyta bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were dominant the presence of macrophytes also supports as substrates for the bacillariophytes diatoms at the littoral zone as compared to the high depth zones cyanophytes viz phormidium oscillatoria favours their habitat at low depth zones with increased alkalinity which is typical with many previous studies palmer 1980 bhaumik et al 2017 naskar et al 2020 some of the filamentous algae dolichospermum sp lyngbya sp cylindrospermum sp did not influence by the water velocity and gradually increased their abundance from monsoon to post monsoon and pre monsoon season it also highlighted the broad tolerance of monsoonal perturbations by these algal species furthermore the shallow depth and availability of substrates also supports for increasing their colonization in the zone 1 the possible reason for lowest cell density in zone 4 was the flow velocity of water in dam site high depth and low concentration of dissolved salts during the release of water from the upstream in the dam site zone 4 the phytoplankton population is being washed away to downstream moreover colony forming cyanobacteria like microcystis sp aphanocapsa sp are affected by disintegration of the colony as well as filamentous algae due to high flow velocity during the time of water discharge and it later dispersed to the downstream that could be one of the reasons for low cell density at the dam site similar type of observation was made by descy et al 2017 martinet et al 2014 overall seasonality is the principal factor driving the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton communities in the studied reservoirs the finding was concurring with seip and reynolds 1995 who reported that the physical factors affected by the seasonal gradients that explains the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton 4 2 relationship between phytoplankton community and environmental factors the derjang reservoir is rich in phytoplankton diversity and their abundance varies according to seasonal pattern algal groups cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta were conspicuous across seasons in the reservoir which is consistent with the results of hong and chen 2002 and miao et al 2019 phytoplankton assemblages often show rapid and predictable changes to environmental conditions in particular to temperature light and nutrients carvalho et al 2013 gameiro et al 2007 thus a strong association was seen between temperature transparency and nutrients with the phytoplankton groups in the reservoir the maximum algal cell density in the reservoir was observed in zone 1 and zone 3 during pre monsoon these zones are known for semi lotic zone of the reservoir that the two streams having continuous inward flow to the reservoir driving the water body thus the phytoplankton may have benefited for their succession and growth by the nutrients received through streams run off coupled with shallow nature of this zone also the zone is exposes to sufficient light helps in phytoplankton productivity this may be one of the reasons that peak phytoplankton density in summer transparency strongly influenced the light availability for phytoplankton photosynthesis and therefore the light is directly related to phytoplankton growth in the present study the transparency of the water in reservoir was reached up to 87 88 27 47 cm in winter and lowest during summer 73 57 34 11 cm which could be correlated to the limited algal growth in winter and peak growth in summer present findings were supported by zhao et al 2015 the stable hydrographical conditions during summer might be one of the possible causes for greater algal density in the studied reservoir the second peak of the algal density was during monsoon period which may be due to high load of allochthonous organic matter in the system the inputs of allochthonous organic nutrient through surface run off from the catchment area during monsoon which in turn supports the succession of phytoplankton within the reservoir the result was consistent with mustapha 2010 from a small shallow tropical african reservoir tropical aquatic ecosystem shows seasonal patterns in many environmental variables often related to rainfall regime talling 1986 rainfall directly affects the phytoplankton by causing community and nutrient dilution outflow losses of phytoplankton and sediment resuspension increasing turbidity figueredo and giani 2001 zhou et al 2012 therefore the second peak of the algal density was found during monsoon period in the present study cyanophyta was the most dominant and leading phytoplankton group across seasons the present findings were coupled with many other studies deka 2009 jiang et al 2014 cardoso et al 2017 the dominant species were merismopedia sp phormidium sp microcystis sp chroococcus sp oscillatoria sp cylindrospermum sp throughout the year which indicating the adequate amount of nutrients that reinforce the growth of cyanobacteria however the abundance of phormidium sp was comparatively higher across seasons which accounted 16 16 of the total phytoplankton population indicating high load of allochthonous organic matter received from the catchment area and connecting channels further the riparian vegetation and geomorphology of the reservoir may have had an effect in the studied reservoirs in the transitional zone the phytoplankton abundance was maximum during pre monsoon and lowest in monsoon season this could be correlated to the hydrological instability and overflow during rainy season which can drastically reduce the biomass of cyanobacterial species mustapha 2010 stated that the higher abundance of cyanobacterial species in the transitional zone linked to the high nutrients transparency and water residence time during pre monsoon season the water temperature increases substantially which may lead to accelerated the decomposition process of organic matter in the reservoir which in turn suitable for the cyanobacteria multiplication guo et al 1997 such environmental condition might be one of the reasons for increasing cell density which encourages the succession of the dominant species of cyanophyta similar type observation was reported by li et al 2013 with the dominance of cyanobacteria in summer season from zhongxin lake in our study the environmental parameter such as ph water temperature and nutrients substrate such as phosphate and nitrate were the major influencing parameter in determining the cyanophyta abundant as evident from cca ordination diagram fig 8 the abundance of the group showed a strong positive correlation with phosphate and temperature while negative correlation with depth and transparency from pca results fig 7 nutrient concentrations tp no3 n and nh4 n were more important than climate conditions temperature and rainfall for differentiate phytoplankton assemblage structure due to their high variation among reservoirs cupertino et al 2019 nutrient availability strongly regulates the phytoplankton growth tilman et al 1982 and distinct nutrient uptake strategies are associated to phytoplankton physiology which determines species ability to compete for limiting nutrients litchman et al 2007 for instance nitrogen limitation can favour mixotrophic algae and some cyanobacteria species figueredo et al 2014 havens et al 2003 in the present study we observed that the distribution and growth of dominant species under this group were different ecological conditions with varying level of nutrient substrates for example the major influential factors involve for distribution of phormidium sp were specific conductivity total hardness and silicate whereas cylindrospermum sp chroococcus sp oscillatoria sp meresmopedia sp were influenced by phosphate as evident from the canonical value similarly the microcystis sp was strongly gradient towards nitrate phosphate ph and total alkalinity in the reservoir the present findings also in agreement with several previous studies havens et al 2003 padisák et al 2009 miao et al 2019 the chlorophyta group was the second most leading group after cyanophyta community in terms of quantitative component highest abundance at zone 1 followed by zone 3 during monsoon season was observed the greater abundance of chlorophyta during monsoon might be due to rich nutrients received from land runoff and dilution of nutrients during this period thomas et al 2000 has reported that high primary productivity in tropical reservoir is usually rain induced in the present study zone 1 and 3 exposes the surface to light due to shallow depth which induces the growth of chlorophytes three variables total alkalinity total hardness and transparency had a significant effect on the chlorophyta growth as evident from cca the increased temperature and long photoperiod greatly influenced the chlorophyta abundance as reported by nandan and aher 2005 which supports the present findings the group mainly dominated by the species monoraphidium sp coelastrum sp scenedesmus dimorphus s bijugatus chlorella sp selenastrum sp oocystis sp ayoade 2000 reported that under rich nitrate n and phosphate p the chlorophyceae species grow faster in the freshwater environment the third most important group was bacillariophyta in terms of numerical abundance spatial variation of this group was less as compared to temporal variation in the reservoir the abundance was found to have maximum during pre monsoon period while minimum during post monsoon it may be due to water column stability and silicate availability sharma 2009 and 2015 it was observed that the bacillariophyta cell density was maximum in zone 1 and minimum in zone 4 the abundance of this group showed a strong negative correlation with silicate study revealed that zone 1 had highest abundance of bacillariophyceae with least concentration of silicate as also reported by adhikary and sahu 1992 this inverse correlation can be a response of bacillariophyceae utilizing the silicate for their frustules construction horner 2002 therefore the abundance of bacillariophyceae increases by utilizing the silica present in the environment and lead to lessening the silicate concentration in the water body according to lins et al 2017 aulacoseira granulata predominated when water temperatures falls and duration of light increases borges et al 2008 chellappa et al 2009 this speceis is commonly found in shallow turbulent eutrophicated waters gogoi et al 2021 padisák et al 2009 however in the present study aulacoseira had a strong correlation with temperature and no3 n euglenophyta contributed only 3 6 to the total phytoplankton population in terms of annual average community composition and stands fourth position in the studied reservoir the highest abundance of euglenoids during post monsoon season is typical with the findings of vyas and kumar 1968 this is further confirmed by the appearance of euglena sp in winter at all the sampling sites which was mainly represented by phacus sp trachelomonas sp and euglena sp a significant positive correlation between euglenophyta and ca2 r 0 62 p 0 05 was observed in the studied reservoir similar type of observation made by khan and bhat 2000 with a statement that the growth of euglenoids is influenced by the ca2 ion concentration in summary spatio temporal variation of phytoplankton community structure in the studied reservoir due to variation in nutrients reservoir hydrology natural factors such as overflow during monsoon season which influences the phytoplankton community structure overall the abiotic factors such as water temperature transparency total hardness total alkalinity and specific conductivity nutrients nitrate phosphate and silicate influenced the phytoplankton assemblages in the reservoir 4 3 correlation of phytoplankton and fish feeding guilds and management issues the significant correlation between herbivores and euglenophyta zygnematophyta indicated the higher acceptance of this algal group by the herbivore fishes in the reservoirs labeo rohita labeo catla cirrhinus mrigala puntius sophore labeo bata amblypharyngodon mola garra gotyla ctenopharyngodon idella however it differs for the algal group bacillariophyta and cyanophyta depicting the less acceptance by the herbivories in the reservoir environment concurrently the omnivore and carnivore fishes are more tend to accept the bacillariophyta and cyanophyta as compared to the zygnematophyta and euglenophyta in the reservoir environment the phytoplankton is the base compartment in a trophic pyramid directly related to the fish guild structures in the aquatic environment indeed the changing pattern of phytoplankton biomass in an aquatic ecosystem influence not only the stocked fishes but also the indigenous forage fishes in the reservoir ecosystem and have impact on the food web structures three major fish guilds exist herbivores omnivores and carnivores with the predominance of omnivores and herbivores in the studied shallow reservoir which may be a good indication of the maximum utilization of trophic energy and it transforms to fish biomass depicting a healthy ecosystem in terms of fish productivity the present observations revealed that the increases of chlorophyta euglenophyta and filamentous zygnematophyta correlated to the increases of herbivory biomass lazzaro et al 2003 explained an excellent representation based on the data from 13 reservoir ecosystem stated that the chlorophyll concentration increases with the total phytoplankton coupled with the relative biomass of omnivores however the inverse scenario has been stated with the biomass of facultative piscivores concurrently the proportionate decrease of cyanobacteria impacted the decreases of facultative piscivores as compared to the omnivores in the present observation omnivores have directly related to the cyanophyta and bacillariophyta implied that these groups have influence on the distribution of omnivory groups in the studied reservoir indeed the incidental feeding of phytoplankton especially by the predatory carnivores may exists in the reservoir thus a positive correlation was seen between the carnivores with cyanophyta and bacillariophyta it is evident that the predominance of omnivory regulates the phytoplankton biomass regardless the piscivore biomass and omnivores lazzaro et al 2003 in indian context although fishes stocked in the small reservoirs for high fish productivity production the stock enhancement protocol has been followed which is largely depends on the natural foods exist in the respective ecosystem thus the phytoplankton management productivity of a reservoir ecosystem in an essence to meet the adequate growth of stocked fishes as well as other forage fishes in a sustainable way further the growth of stocked fishes in the enclosure culture cage and pen culture in the reservoir ecosystem is also remarkably influence by the autochthonous productivity therefore the detailed study on the utilization of trophic energy transformation of energy to fish biomass by manipulation of fishes in the reservoir ecosystem in the indian environment is still lacking the quantification in this regard may aid some of the novel information towards the appropriate management and policy issues for small medium and large reservoirs our observation provides insights into the contribution of ecohydrological variables on phytoplankton assemblage of a community managed

931,the present study assessed the spatio temporal dynamics of phytoplankton community structure and diversity using gis platform and their ecohydrological interactionsof a tropical reservoir located in eastern india altogether 74 species of phytoplankton belonging to 54 genera under seven taxonomic algal groups were recorded whose average annual abundance was 74 11 104 17 73 104 cells l 1 among seven algal groups chlorophyta cyanophyta bacillariophyta and euglenophyta were remarkably influencing the total phytoplankton population contributing 97 of the total phytoplankton population in the reservoir cyanophyta absolutely dominated in the total phytoplankton compositions and contributed a major share of 54 at the annual average level however the species richness was maximum under the group chlorophyta 35 genera in total thirteen phytoplankton taxa emerged as dominant γ 0 02 across seasons among them phormidium sp solely contributed 16 16 to the total phytoplankton population marked as dominant one in the reservoir the diversity indices indicated the greater phytoplankton diversity in the lotic zone as compared to the transitional and lacustrine zone showing significant variations p 0 05 across seasons permanova analysis exhibited a significant temporal variations of phytoplankton abundance f 1 15 p 0 02 as well asenvironmental variables f 1 82 p 0 05 but no significant spatial variations were recorded the principal component analysis pca revealed water temperature transparency total hardness ph specific conductivity total alkalinity and nutrients parameters viz phosphate nitrate and silicate were the most important abiotic factors having the significant influence on the phytoplankton community compositions canonical correspondence analysis cca depicted the environmental factors such as temperature total alkalinity total hardness transparency ph and nutrients no3 n po4 p and sio4 si were the determinants for the distribution of overall phytoplankton population especially the dominant phytoplankton species of the reservoir the findings provide a better understanding of the influence of ecohydrology on phytoplankton community of a community managed reservoir and also discuss management and researchable issues considering the feeding guild of reservoir fishes and phytoplankton assemblage for ecosystem based conservation and management keywords reservoir phytoplankton community assemblage ecohydrology species dynamics gis management 1 introduction phytoplankton is the primary producer in an aquatic ecosystem and an important part of the aquatic food chain therefore phytoplankton is essential to support a healthy aquatic ecosystem and used as ecological indicator xu et al 2001 the composition of phytoplankton community is a critical component in environmental monitoring ecosystem restoration and management arhonditsis et al 2003 arhonditsis and brett 2005 cottingham and carpenter 1998 the spatio temporal dynamics of phytoplankton community are closely related to variations of environmental conditions and define primary biotic structure of the ecological niche of a lake bellinger and sigee 2015 padisák et al 2009 the temporal and spatial variations of phytoplankton are an important factor to notify the instability of hydrological parameters and their cyclic changes the assemblage pattern of phytoplankton is influenced by various biotic camarena gómez et al 2018 as well as abiotic factors gogoi et al 2019 sarkar et al 2020 the main factors regulating phytoplankton growth are primarily temperature rainfall dissolved gases and nutrient concentrations reynolds 2006 these factors differently affect species influencing their differential growth of specific groups of phytoplankton and thereby affecting community dynamics edwards et al 2016a in tropical lakes the amount of precipitation and their changes physical and chemical conditions indirectly affect the phytoplankton growth i e by diminishing water temperature resuspending sediments fuentes and petrucio 2015 zhou et al 2012 the species composition of a specific group of phytoplankton communities relates well to the environmental conditions maileht et al 2013 parakkandi et al 2021 and thus they are suitable for ecological indicators bellinger and sigee 2015 gogoi et al 2021 in general the phytoplankton communities changes consistently with time and are highly influenced by seasonal dynamics weithoff et al 2015 the phytoplankton shows their responses towards frequently changing scenario of the environmental conditions especially to temperature light and nutrients carvalho et al 2013 gameiro et al 2007 water transparency is one of the crucial abiotic factors that allowing thelight permeability into the water which may directly affect the photosynthesis of autotrophs and thus impacting the phytoplankton growth and their overall distribution fleming lehtinen and laamanen 2012 jiang et al 2014 in the aquatic environment likewise seasonal dynamics as a result of climatic variability also influence the phytoplankton community structure directly edwards et al 2016b figueredo and giani 2001 mohanty et al 2022 therefore qualitative as well as quantitative assessment of plankton community assumes to be a significant criterion for devising sustainable management policies for the reservoir ecosystem india is bestowed with considerable number of man made impoundment resources with 3 51 million ha of reservoir area sarkar et al 2018 out of which odisha state is having 1 97 lakhs ha of reservoir area forming three major three medium and 1406 numbers of small or minor reservoirs which account 8 0 of the total reservoir areaof india and about 90 of the total inland fisheries resource of the odisha 6 66 lakh ha parida et al 2022 however these small reservoirs have tremendous potential for fisheries enhancement and livelihood generation lianthuamluaia et al 2021 sandhya et al 2019 in particular the average fish production of the reservoir is much lower than the production potential sarkar et al 2018 several research has been paid attention towards stocking of fish for increasing fish yield but judicious stocking of cultured fishes based on the reservoir ecology has been neglected the researchers have been working for stock enhancement by establishing a relationship between stocking density and reservoir area without considering other ecological parameters sarkar et al 2020 2018 sugunan and katiha 2004 the reservoirs are distributed over diverse geo climatic conditions with different catchment ecosystems and drainage patterns in order to achieve full utilization of available ecological resources in the reservoir for fisheries enhancement systematic ecology and hydrology studies are required the present study was undertaken to assess the spatio temporal patterns of phytoplankton community structure in relation to environmental variables in a tropical reservoir using gis tools the study aimed to develop a systematic approach for better understanding the dynamics of phytoplankton community structure and their relationship with the ecohydrological characteristics and discuss issues for ecosystem based management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling design the study area derjang reservoir is a small tropical reservoir 20 50 32 0 n 85 01 14 8 e covering an average submerged area of 530 ha located in odisha india though it is a small reservoir it provides livelihood of more than 200 fishers and offers several ecological services the dam was constructed way back in 1964 on the river brahmani odisha the catchments area of the reservoir is 399 sq km dept of water resource govt of odisha based on the geographic pattern location of the reservoir the area was divided into four zones i e zone 1 z1 zone 2 z2 zone 3 z3 and zone 4 z4 for sampling herein each zone comprises three sub stations and collected the samples accordingly the selected sampling zones zone 1 and zone 3 are interfaced with two small streams namely lingara and matalia that are the primary source of water to the reservoir and water flow exists in these two zones primarily during monsoon season based on this characteristic these two zones represented as the interface of semi lotic environment in the present study however the other seasons during pre monsoon and post monsoon the water flow is negligible forming a base flow zone likewise zone 4 is the dam area considered to be a lacustrine source of the reservoir the transitional part of the reservoir was zone 2 the major land use pattern of the catchment area near the sampling stations were agricultural and fallow land and forest coverage the data on phytoplankton species assemblages diversity and abundance including environmental parameters were collected seasonally viz pre monsoon march june monsoon july october and post monsoon november february during may 2017 to april 2019 total sixteen environmental variables were considered for the study small wooden boat dingi was used for collection of water and phytoplankton samples at each zone water samples were collected from subsurface 0 5 m depth by using standard water sampler based on design of ruttner water sampler and immediately transferred into pre rinsed polyethylene sample amber wide mouth bottles 1 l water temperature temp air temperature ph total dissolved solid tds and specific conductivity sp con were measured in the field using digital multiprobe eutech

recorded during monsoon station wise diversity indices reflected that zone 1 and zone 3 found to be highest number of species the h value was found to have ranged between 3 10 to 3 54 indicated a greater diversity in the semi lotic zone 3 and zone 1 respectively as compared to transitional and lacustrine zone of the reservoir the phytoplankton species were more uniformly distributed in zone 1 as compared to the other zones which was evident from the calculated value of pielou s evenness index j results of anova dunn s post hoc showed a significant variation p 0 05 of diversity indices d h and 1 d across seasons except j however all the indices did not exhibit significant spatial variation in the reservoir the variability and association pattern of 16 environmental variables and the group chlorophyta was presented using pca which explained 54 74 of variation on the first two principal components pc fig 7 it was found that chlorophyta abundance showed strong and positive association with the depth transparency chloride and total alkalinity but inversely associated with temperature for cyanophyta group pca explained 56 41 variabilityon the first two pcs factor loadings are presented in the supplementary file the most important variables for pc1 were water temperature 0 399 do 0 321 total hardness 0 379 and ca2 0 371 and for pc 2 transparency 0 326 specific conductivity 0 345 tds 0 334 phosphate 0 395 and silicate 0 421 similarly pca loading for group bacillariophyta showed that the group was negatively influenced by water temperature and nutrients phosphate and silicate while positively related with the specific conductivity do tds total hardness ca2 and transparency the observations for the euglenophyta revealed that pca1 explained 31 21 of the variation whereas axis 2 further accounted 56 46 variability however in the group zygnematophyta it exhibited 29 75 and 54 16 variability in axes 1 and 2 respectively the pca loading showed that the euglenophyta abundance was negatively influenced by water temperature specific conductivity and nutrients parameters phosphate and silicate and positively correlated with total hardness transparency and ca2 similarly zygnematophyta abundance was positively influenced by tds depth do total hardness transparency and ca2 and negatively correlated with phosphate silicate and water temperature overall principal component analysis revealed that the 9 important parameters viz water temperature transparency total hardness ph specific conductivity total alkalinity and nutrients parameters phosphate nitrate and silicate were the most important environmental parameter abiotic factors which influencing the phytoplankton community composition in the studied reservoir 3 4 cca on dominant species major phytoplankton groups and environmental factors cca was performed to analyze the relationship between phytoplankton groups as well as dominant species and nine environmental variables extracted from pca to understand the influential factors for the distribution and assemblage pattern of total phytoplankton population as well as the dominant species in the studied reservoir total 13 dominant species table no 2 bold values species and seven groups with nine environmental variables were selected for cca the cca ordination triplot for dominant species are shown in fig 8 the result of cca together explained 82 46 of the total variance for the dominant species while visualizing the correlation of dominant species phormidium sp closely associated with the specific conductivity total hardness and silicate whereas cylindrospermum sp chroococcus sp oscillatoria sp meresmopedia sp were negatively correlated to the phosphate similarly the microcystis sp grow well in the water rich with nitrate phosphate and ph and low concentration of total alkalinity had their close association with total alkalinity and temperature and nitrate while comparing the chlorophytes species it was reflected that chlorophyta had close association with the environmental variables such as total alkalinity total hardness and transparency species s dimorphus and s bijugatus and monorahidium sp were positively gradient towards total alkalinity and transparency and negatively towards nitrate whereas coelastrum sp was inclined towards total alkalinity than phosphate concentration genus aulacoseira sp had a close affinity with the water temperature and nitrate and diatom fragilaria sp with silicate the result indicated that total alkalinity water temperature and silicate were the influential factors for growth of bacillariophyta overall the cca canonical correspondence analysis depicted the environmental factors such as temperature total alkalinity total hardness transparency and ph and nutrients no3 n po4 p and sio4 si were the effective variables for the distribution of overall phytoplankton population and more specifically the dominant species of the reservoir 3 5 similarity pattern of phytoplankton the dendogram simprof test based on bray curtis similarity matrix revealed two clusters i e group i z2p z3p z4p and group ii z1pm z2pm z3pm z1m z2m z3m fig 9 left panel both the groups were not found to be statistically significant p 0 05 with a similarity percentage of 85 84 and 84 76 respectively however the phytoplankton compositions at

monsoon also exhibited a significant variation from the group ii all the zones exhibited overall 75 similarity in their community compositions fig 9 right panel further anosim also portrayed a significant variation r 0 92 p 1 2 of the phytoplankton community compositions between the two groups simper analysis comparing the groups stated the average similarity percentage was found to be ranged between 80 82 with maximum in group i species phormidim sp 24 45 was the major contributor followed by chrococcus sp 16 33 meresmopedia sp 10 41 microcystis sp 7 12 cylindrospermum sp 6 58 dolichospermum sp 4 25 monoraphidium sp 2 68 and selenestrum sp 2 14 at the same time phormidium sp 14 61 also found to be key contributor in the group ii and other species were meresmopedia sp 11 76 chrococcus sp 9 37 cylindrospermum sp 5 79 microcystis sp 5 66 monoraphidium sp 4 53 aulacoseira sp 3 57 coelestrum sp 2 86 chlorela sp 2 63 selenestrum sp 2 54 and scenedesmus dimorphus 2 39 the average dissimilarity between the groups was stated with 32 81 table 3 the phytoplankton species mainly responsible for the differences in abundance pattern was phormidium sp microcystis sp chrococcus sp dolichospermum sp oscillatria sp aulacosira sp the cumulative dominance curve k dominance extracted for the studied reservoir indicated that the species abundance was distinctively higher during pre monsoon season and the plotted curves overlapped for monsoon and post monsoon seasons indicating a similar dominance pattern during those periods 3 6 correlation between fish species based on feeding guilds and algal groups to understand the relationship between the fish species characterized based on the feeding guilds and the phytoplankton groups a correlation matrix karl pearson s was performed table 4 the results portrayed that the herbivores fish species of the reservoir had a significant positive correlation with euglenophyta r 0 96 p 0 01 zygnematophyta r 0 72 p 0 01 and cryptophyta r 0 97 p 0 01 however the inverse scenario was seen with the bacillariophyta r 0 95 p 0 01 and cyanophyta r 0 34 p 0 01 the fish species having characterized as omnivores and carnivores had a strong association with the cyanophyta r 0 99 p 0 01 and bacillariophyta r 0 66 p 0 01 but strong negative correlation with zygnematophyta r 0 92 p 0 01 and dinophyta r 0 97 p 0 01 respectively on the other hand omnivores and carnivores also had a significant negative correlation with the cryptophyta 4 discussion 4 1 phytoplankton assemblages and distribution in the present study it was observed that the algal cell density was greater in zone 1 while lowest in zone 4 these differences are likely due to the environmental settings of the sites as mentioned that zone 1 is connected to a stream and is close to cluster of aquatic vegetation such as vallisneria potamogeton ceratophyllum etc in the reservoir the land use pattern of catchment area near this site is predominated with agricultural land and forestry thus the nutrients inputs to this zone were sufficient through the surface runoff and connecting channel which supports the growth of phytoplankton population stated that a high concentration of nutrients with in a certain range can promote an increase in phytoplankton density which can contribute to an increased growth of phytoplankton phytoplankton community structure and their distribution pattern are directly affected by the habitat yu et al 1994 although the depth was not detected as an influencing variable statistically the depth is the most important factor among the other morphometric factors that can be directly correlated with the phytoplankton productivity as because shallower area in the reservoir has larger proportions substrates in euphotic zone as compared to deeper ones here zone 4 depth 26 30 feet where most of the substrate is locked up as aphotic zones although the present study showed comparatively higher nutrients and transparency in the zone 4 the high depth exhibits inverse relationship with the major groups of phytoplankton production fig 2 thus depth could be correlated to low cell density coupled with other edaphic factors and physical factors in addition climatic factor such as wind direction in the reservoir is also responsible for scattering of drifting organisms which coincides the high phytoplankton abundance in the littoral zones in zone 1 algal groups cyanophyta bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were dominant the presence of macrophytes also supports as substrates for the bacillariophytes diatoms at the littoral zone as compared to the high depth zones cyanophytes viz phormidium oscillatoria favours their habitat at low depth zones with increased alkalinity which is typical with many previous studies palmer 1980 bhaumik et al 2017 naskar et al 2020 some of the filamentous algae dolichospermum sp lyngbya sp cylindrospermum sp did not influence by the water velocity and gradually increased their abundance from monsoon to post monsoon and pre monsoon season it also highlighted the broad tolerance of monsoonal perturbations by these algal species furthermore the shallow depth and availability of substrates also supports for increasing their colonization in the zone 1 the possible reason for lowest cell density in zone 4 was the flow velocity of water in dam site high depth and low concentration of dissolved salts during the release of water from the upstream in the dam site zone 4 the phytoplankton population is being washed away to downstream moreover colony forming cyanobacteria like microcystis sp aphanocapsa sp are affected by disintegration of the colony as well as filamentous algae due to high flow velocity during the time of water discharge and it later dispersed to the downstream that could be one of the reasons for low cell density at the dam site similar type of observation was made by descy et al 2017 martinet et al 2014 overall seasonality is the principal factor driving the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton communities in the studied reservoirs the finding was concurring with seip and reynolds 1995 who reported that the physical factors affected by the seasonal gradients that explains the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton 4 2 relationship between phytoplankton community and environmental factors the derjang reservoir is rich in phytoplankton diversity and their abundance varies according to seasonal pattern algal groups cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta were conspicuous across seasons in the reservoir which is consistent with the results of hong and chen 2002 and miao et al 2019 phytoplankton assemblages often show rapid and predictable changes to environmental conditions in particular to temperature light and nutrients carvalho et al 2013 gameiro et al 2007 thus a strong association was seen between temperature transparency and nutrients with the phytoplankton groups in the reservoir the maximum algal cell density in the reservoir was observed in zone 1 and zone 3 during pre monsoon these zones are known for semi lotic zone of the reservoir that the two streams having continuous inward flow to the reservoir driving the water body thus the phytoplankton may have benefited for their succession and growth by the nutrients received through streams run off coupled with shallow nature of this zone also the zone is exposes to sufficient light helps in phytoplankton productivity this may be one of the reasons that peak phytoplankton density in summer transparency strongly influenced the light availability for phytoplankton photosynthesis and therefore the light is directly related to phytoplankton growth in the present study the transparency of the water in reservoir was reached up to 87 88 27 47 cm in winter and lowest during summer 73 57 34 11 cm which could be correlated to the limited algal growth in winter and peak growth in summer present findings were supported by zhao et al 2015 the stable hydrographical conditions during summer might be one of the possible causes for greater algal density in the studied reservoir the second peak of the algal density was during monsoon period which may be due to high load of allochthonous organic matter in the system the inputs of allochthonous organic nutrient through surface run off from the catchment area during monsoon which in turn supports the succession of phytoplankton within the reservoir the result was consistent with mustapha 2010 from a small shallow tropical african reservoir tropical aquatic ecosystem shows seasonal patterns in many environmental variables often related to rainfall regime talling 1986 rainfall directly affects the phytoplankton by causing community and nutrient dilution outflow losses of phytoplankton and sediment resuspension increasing turbidity figueredo and giani 2001 zhou et al 2012 therefore the second peak of the algal density was found during monsoon period in the present study cyanophyta was the most dominant and leading phytoplankton group across seasons the present findings were coupled with many other studies deka 2009 jiang et al 2014 cardoso et al 2017 the dominant species were merismopedia sp phormidium sp microcystis sp chroococcus sp oscillatoria sp cylindrospermum sp throughout the year which indicating the adequate amount of nutrients that reinforce the growth of cyanobacteria however the abundance of phormidium sp was comparatively higher across seasons which accounted 16 16 of the total phytoplankton population indicating high load of allochthonous organic matter received from the catchment area and connecting channels further the riparian vegetation and geomorphology of the reservoir may have had an effect in the studied reservoirs in the transitional zone the phytoplankton abundance was maximum during pre monsoon and lowest in monsoon season this could be correlated to the hydrological instability and overflow during rainy season which can drastically reduce the biomass of cyanobacterial species mustapha 2010 stated that the higher abundance of cyanobacterial species in the transitional zone linked to the high nutrients transparency and water residence time during pre monsoon season the water temperature increases substantially which may lead to accelerated the decomposition process of organic matter in the reservoir which in turn suitable for the cyanobacteria multiplication guo et al 1997 such environmental condition might be one of the reasons for increasing cell density which encourages the succession of the dominant species of cyanophyta similar type observation was reported by li et al 2013 with the dominance of cyanobacteria in summer season from zhongxin lake in our study the environmental parameter such as ph water temperature and nutrients substrate such as phosphate and nitrate were the major influencing parameter in determining the cyanophyta abundant as evident from cca ordination diagram fig 8 the abundance of the group showed a strong positive correlation with phosphate and temperature while negative correlation with depth and transparency from pca results fig 7 nutrient concentrations tp no3 n and nh4 n were more important than climate conditions temperature and rainfall for differentiate phytoplankton assemblage structure due to their high variation among reservoirs cupertino et al 2019 nutrient availability strongly regulates the phytoplankton growth tilman et al 1982 and distinct nutrient uptake strategies are associated to phytoplankton physiology which determines species ability to compete for limiting nutrients litchman et al 2007 for instance nitrogen limitation can favour mixotrophic algae and some cyanobacteria species figueredo et al 2014 havens et al 2003 in the present study we observed that the distribution and growth of dominant species under this group were different ecological conditions with varying level of nutrient substrates for example the major influential factors involve for distribution of phormidium sp were specific conductivity total hardness and silicate whereas cylindrospermum sp chroococcus sp oscillatoria sp meresmopedia sp were influenced by phosphate as evident from the canonical value similarly the microcystis sp was strongly gradient towards nitrate phosphate ph and total alkalinity in the reservoir the present findings also in agreement with several previous studies havens et al 2003 padisák et al 2009 miao et al 2019 the chlorophyta group was the second most leading group after cyanophyta community in terms of quantitative component highest abundance at zone 1 followed by zone 3 during monsoon season was observed the greater abundance of chlorophyta during monsoon might be due to rich nutrients received from land runoff and dilution of nutrients during this period thomas et al 2000 has reported that high primary productivity in tropical reservoir is usually rain induced in the present study zone 1 and 3 exposes the surface to light due to shallow depth which induces the growth of chlorophytes three variables total alkalinity total hardness and transparency had a significant effect on the chlorophyta growth as evident from cca the increased temperature and long photoperiod greatly influenced the chlorophyta abundance as reported by nandan and aher 2005 which supports the present findings the group mainly dominated by the species monoraphidium sp coelastrum sp scenedesmus dimorphus s bijugatus chlorella sp selenastrum sp oocystis sp ayoade 2000 reported that under rich nitrate n and phosphate p the chlorophyceae species grow faster in the freshwater environment the third most important group was bacillariophyta in terms of numerical abundance spatial variation of this group was less as compared to temporal variation in the reservoir the abundance was found to have maximum during pre monsoon period while minimum during post monsoon it may be due to water column stability and silicate availability sharma 2009 and 2015 it was observed that the bacillariophyta cell density was maximum in zone 1 and minimum in zone 4 the abundance of this group showed a strong negative correlation with silicate study revealed that zone 1 had highest abundance of bacillariophyceae with least concentration of silicate as also reported by adhikary and sahu 1992 this inverse correlation can be a response of bacillariophyceae utilizing the silicate for their frustules construction horner 2002 therefore the abundance of bacillariophyceae increases by utilizing the silica present in the environment and lead to lessening the silicate concentration in the water body according to lins et al 2017 aulacoseira granulata predominated when water temperatures falls and duration of light increases borges et al 2008 chellappa et al 2009 this speceis is commonly found in shallow turbulent eutrophicated waters gogoi et al 2021 padisák et al 2009 however in the present study aulacoseira had a strong correlation with temperature and no3 n euglenophyta contributed only 3 6 to the total phytoplankton population in terms of annual average community composition and stands fourth position in the studied reservoir the highest abundance of euglenoids during post monsoon season is typical with the findings of vyas and kumar 1968 this is further confirmed by the appearance of euglena sp in winter at all the sampling sites which was mainly represented by phacus sp trachelomonas sp and euglena sp a significant positive correlation between euglenophyta and ca2 r 0 62 p 0 05 was observed in the studied reservoir similar type of observation made by khan and bhat 2000 with a statement that the growth of euglenoids is influenced by the ca2 ion concentration in summary spatio temporal variation of phytoplankton community structure in the studied reservoir due to variation in nutrients reservoir hydrology natural factors such as overflow during monsoon season which influences the phytoplankton community structure overall the abiotic factors such as water temperature transparency total hardness total alkalinity and specific conductivity nutrients nitrate phosphate and silicate influenced the phytoplankton assemblages in the reservoir 4 3 correlation of phytoplankton and fish feeding guilds and management issues the significant correlation between herbivores and euglenophyta zygnematophyta indicated the higher acceptance of this algal group by the herbivore fishes in the reservoirs labeo rohita labeo catla cirrhinus mrigala puntius sophore labeo bata amblypharyngodon mola garra gotyla ctenopharyngodon idella however it differs for the algal group bacillariophyta and cyanophyta depicting the less acceptance by the herbivories in the reservoir environment concurrently the omnivore and carnivore fishes are more tend to accept the bacillariophyta and cyanophyta as compared to the zygnematophyta and euglenophyta in the reservoir environment the phytoplankton is the base compartment in a trophic pyramid directly related to the fish guild structures in the aquatic environment indeed the changing pattern of phytoplankton biomass in an aquatic ecosystem influence not only the stocked fishes but also the indigenous forage fishes in the reservoir ecosystem and have impact on the food web structures three major fish guilds exist herbivores omnivores and carnivores with the predominance of omnivores and herbivores in the studied shallow reservoir which may be a good indication of the maximum utilization of trophic energy and it transforms to fish biomass depicting a healthy ecosystem in terms of fish productivity the present observations revealed that the increases of chlorophyta euglenophyta and filamentous zygnematophyta correlated to the increases of herbivory biomass lazzaro et al 2003 explained an excellent representation based on the data from 13 reservoir ecosystem stated that the chlorophyll concentration increases with the total phytoplankton coupled with the relative biomass of omnivores however the inverse scenario has been stated with the biomass of facultative piscivores concurrently the proportionate decrease of cyanobacteria impacted the decreases of facultative piscivores as compared to the omnivores in the present observation omnivores have directly related to the cyanophyta and bacillariophyta implied that these groups have influence on the distribution of omnivory groups in the studied reservoir indeed the incidental feeding of phytoplankton especially by the predatory carnivores may exists in the reservoir thus a positive correlation was seen between the carnivores with cyanophyta and bacillariophyta it is evident that the predominance of omnivory regulates the phytoplankton biomass regardless the piscivore biomass and omnivores lazzaro et al 2003 in indian context although fishes stocked in the small reservoirs for high fish productivity production the stock enhancement protocol has been followed which is largely depends on the natural foods exist in the respective ecosystem thus the phytoplankton management productivity of a reservoir ecosystem in an essence to meet the adequate growth of stocked fishes as well as other forage fishes in a sustainable way further the growth of stocked fishes in the enclosure culture cage and pen culture in the reservoir ecosystem is also remarkably influence by the autochthonous productivity therefore the detailed study on the utilization of trophic energy transformation of energy to fish biomass by manipulation of fishes in the reservoir ecosystem in the indian environment is still lacking the quantification in this regard may aid some of the novel information towards the appropriate management and policy issues for small medium and large reservoirs our observation provides insights into the contribution of ecohydrological variables on phytoplankton assemblage of a community managed reservoir where culture based fisheries were practiced and could be useful for conservation and management ethics approval the research was done according to institute ethical standards authors

932,swamp forests are now at the edge of extinction in the haor haor ecosystem is a type of wetland comprised of swamp forest located in the lowlands of the north eastern part of bangladesh which is characterized by a bowl or saucer shaped shallow depression region of bangladesh to reverse such a trend there is an urgent need to start a reforestation program however the silvics of individual species and dynamics of swamp forest stands are only marginally understood hence the purpose of this study was to provide detailed information on swamp vegetation water tolerance range and to identify suitable habitat range for species that are dominant in the reforestation program it was found that high water tolerant species can tolerate waterlogging conditions for an average of 13 weeks followed by 07 weeks by medium water tolerant species and 02 weeks by low water tolerant species in the case of species water depth tolerance the high water tolerant group can tolerate an average of 4ft water followed by 2 5 ft water by medium and 1ft by low water tolerant group hijol barringtonia acutangula koroch pongamia pinnata pitali trewia nudiflora and borun crataeva magna were the dominant species used for existing small scale reforestation programs there are no significant differences in resistance against water flow among hijol koroch pitali and borun regardless of vegetation density and water depth for future large scale plantations the machine learning model shows that more than 50 of haor area is suitable for plantations by these four species the information generated through this study can be beneficial to planners and managers to aid in developing plantation plans and the design of habitat restoration and enhancement efforts keywords flash flood wave action erosion swamp vegetation loss reforestation plant water tolerance 1 introduction freshwater swamp forest ecosystems have significant socio ecological and economic importance drew et al 2005 the wetland ecosystem is a magnificent source of fish fiber fodder fuel water supply water purification climate regulation flood regulation coastal protection recreational opportunities and tourism among other services millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 mitsch et al 2015 in general this type of ecosystem has low vegetation diversity koponen et al 2004 despite the low species diversity and abundance the swamp ecosystem provides numerous ecosystems services such as providing habitat for wildlife e g migratory birds fish and regulating nutrients twilley et al 1986 harvey and hill 2001 mitsch et al 2015 most importantly wetland resources play an imperative role in the livelihood security of poor and developing countries newaz and rahman 2019 however the high rate of population growth and excess resource extraction from the wetlands are major problems for sustainable use of this resource sohel et al 2015 despite this importance wetland ecologists often argue that swamp forest vegetation is understudied the swamp forests in bangladesh that once used to be common in haor haor ecosystem is a type of wetland comprised of swamp forest located in the lowlands of the north eastern part of bangladesh which is characterized by a bowl or saucer shaped shallow depression areas have become severely degraded due to clearing cutting and other anthropogenic pressures iucn bangladesh 2004 the natural regeneration of swamp is hardly visible choudhury 2005 the reed beds have also been severely degraded and reduced because of over harvesting for fuel wood and converting land into settlements cropland and built up areas choudhury 2005 iucn bangladesh 2004 as a consequence many aquatic vegetation and wildlife that used to be common in the area became very rare and threatens the overall integrity of haor ecosystem alam et al 2015 degradation of swamp forest has severely impacted livelihoods of the local people swamp forest provides food and shelter for the fish population and therefore a reduction in fish production species diversity and the waterfowl population was observed over the past few decades choudhury 2005 sohel et al 2015 to reverse such degradation in the haor ecosystem of bangladesh reforestation of swamp areas is an urgent need in reducing flood flow in haor areas of bangladesh this in turn will increase food and shelter for the fish population and other wildlife however we don t have proper documentation on which swamp vegetation grows at what depth and how long swamp vegetation can tolerate flood conditions in addition to that increasing greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent global warming will alter local and regional freshwater faunal and floral diversity ipcc 2014 fluctuations in rainfall extended drought periods and long term water stagnancy may also potentially reduce the physical quality of freshwater ecosystems like wetlands ipcc 2014 these conditions may lead to the local extinction of some species therefore it is important to generate as much scientific information as possible particularly related to the habitat range of existing vegetation for future plantations such information may facilitate intensive habitat conservation and restoration planning in the reality of unforeseen future climate scenarios therefore to have a successful swamp reforestation program the study aims to identify suitable habitats and vegetation for reforestation so the purpose of this study was to 1 to provide detailed information on swamp vegetation water tolerance i e flood duration and inundation tolerance range 2 to identify major swamp species used for exiting reforestation programs and assess wave action flood flow reduction capacity 3 to predict dominant species suitable habitat range for future re introduction using a machine learning algorithm called maximum entropy model 2 methodology 2 1 study site there are seven districts in haor areas of bangladesh fig 1 among them five haor based districts namely brahmanbaria habiganj kishoregonj netrakona and sunamganj were selected purposively based on previous and ongoing reforestation programs it is important to note that haor of the north east region of bangladesh can be divided into three categories fig 1 depending on the area s geographical location and flooding characteristics such as foothill and near hill floodplain area haor and deeply flooded haor the haors along the border areas of sunamganj sylhet and all haors of habiganj and maulvibazar districts are situated near hills or at foothills most of the haor areas of sylhet netrakona and brahmanbaria are within the floodplains all the haors of kishoreganj and most of the haors of sunamganj districts are deeply flooded 2 2 swamp vegetation water depth and duration tolerance and their habitat swamp vegetation survival during plantations depends on the species water tolerance limit including water depth and duration water tolerance of plant species varies from species to species some species can tolerate extreme waterlogging conditions while some cannot survive extreme waterlogging conditions literature review field observation and consultation with local people were conducted in 28 locations of five haor districts to know plant species availability and their waterlogging characteristics based on water depth and duration swamp vegetation was grouped into high moderate and low water tolerant species species water tolerant grouping was done using hierarchical clustering methods cluster analysis is a method of classification aimed at grouping objects in this case species based on the similarity of their attributes in this case water depth and water duration euclidean distance was chosen as the criterion for cluster combination the procedure produces a dendrogram that indicates the relationships between all the samples based on a defined measure of similarity this dendrogram shows the level where clusters were joined together and the species within each cluster 2 3 swamp vegetation dominance in existing reforestation programs 2 3 1 vegetation survey and dominance analysis a total of 82 plots were established in 28 plantation sites each of which was 10 10m individual tree dbh 5 cm was considered all trees within 10m 10m plot size were enumerated both dbh and height were measured diversity analysis was calculated using the species richness shannon diversity h and simpson diversity d indices species accumulation curves sac were used to estimate the number of vegetation species in the plots species accumulation curves show the species richness for combinations of sites all the calculations and graphs were done using r packages biodiversityr kindt and coe 2005 and rcmdrplugin kmggplot2 sou 2015 2 4 manning s roughness coefficients estimation the existing swamp tree creates resistance against high water flow and monsoon wind generated waves through their root and trunk system manning s number can quantify this resistance to calculate manning s number of the dominant swamp tree species tree species related data and information such as root height from existing ground level m root diameter m ground coverage of root system in the area m2 tree density tree ha the diameter of the trunk m and water level m were collected the following presents the available dominant tree information of haor districts table 1 higher value of manning s number m indicates lower roughness thus lower resistance of trees species against high water flow or wave action the manning s roughness for the root system is calculated by using the following equation dasgupta et al 2019 dasgupta et al 2017 bangladesh water development board 2001 1 m g h 1 3 64 2 45 in k n h where m manning s roughness h is the water depth g gravitational acceleration 9 81 nikuradses roughness height kn and the manning s roughness for trunk system is calculated by using the following equation 2 m m 1 m 2 n a d c h 4 3 2 g 1 2 where m manning s roughness h is the water depth g gravitational acceleration 9 81 nikuradses roughness height kn c is a constant and d the diameter of the trunk of the existing tree species a is horizontal area of the existing tree coverage n is number of trees in the area 2 5 dominant swamp vegetation habitat range modelling for future reintroduction 2 5 1 species occurrence data and spatial rarefying swamp species occurrence data were collected from a vegetation plot survey conducted in 82 plots established in 28 plantation sites of haor districts our study used a total of 119 occurrence records fig 2 of dominant species such as kadam athocephalus chinensis hijol barringtonia acutangula borun crataeva magna jarul lagerstroemia speciosa koroch pongamia pinnata jam syzygium cumini pitali trewia nudiflora respectively from extensive field survey in a single plot there are different species in that case we took coordinates of all the species separately from that plot if any plots have only one species we consider coordinates of that plots only to represent that species all the species naturally grow in the northeastern region of bangladesh it is important to note that maxent requires input occurrence data to be spatially independent to perform well spatially auto correlated occurrence points introduce biases into the model which are often ignored by the researchers veloz 2009 hijimans et al 2012 boria et al 2014 to overcome such issues the number of spatially independent localities was spatially rarefied using sdm toolbox 2 030 in arcgis 10 3 by eliminating all but one point present within a single grid cell to avoid double counting of presence points this has reduced our sampled species occurrence points after spatial rarifying there were 52 occurrence spatially independent points fig 2 and only four species have the required number of points for habitat suitability models table 2 2 5 2 climate variables we primarily selected 19 bioclimatic variables obtained from the worldclim database ver 1 4 hijmans et al 2005 all variables were measured at the 1 km resolution and processed using sdmtoolbox v2 4 http www sdmtoolbox org and arcgis10 3 interface having the same cell size extent and projection systems wgs84 longitude latitude projection interpreting sdm results are difficult when predictor variables are highly correlated kivinen et al 2008 so only less correlated variables pearson correlation coefficient r 0 80 were used in the maxent model elith et al 2010 this was done using sdmtoolbx v2 4 finally eight 08 climate variables i e isothermality bio3 temperature annual range bio7 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio8 annual precipitation bio12 precipitation of driest month bio14 and precipitation seasonality bio15 were considered that influence the distribution of species table 3 it is important to note that inundation time and flood depth were highly influential factors for swamp vegetation survival however these variables were not considered as maxent input this is because the inclusion of such variables requires a high resolution digital elevation model dem and bathymetric survey open sources dem have a coarse resolution of 30m which is not enough to create a high quality inundation map on top of it a bathymetric study of these large haor areas requires enormous funds which we lack to overcome this limitation our modeling approach was to identify suitable habitats in terms of climatic variables we can then look for areas where different water tolerant group of species can be planted based on species specific inundation time and flood depth data gathered from local people 2 5 3 spatial modelling we used the maximum entropy algorithm maxent version 3 3 3 k for species distribution modeling in our study phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 maxent is a machine learning program that derives the probability of presence on a pixel by pixel basis and performs well compared with other species distribution models since it requires presence only data phillips et al 2004 2006 it is widely used for species distribution modeling as it is effective even with small sample sizes compared with other species distribution model sdms elith et al 2006 elith et al 2011 pearson et al 2007 kumar and stohlgren 2009 hernandez et al 2006 maxent was found to be the most capable sdm among many methods in producing meaningful results with sample sizes as small as 5 10 and 25 occurrences records hernandez et al 2006 another study conducted by van proosdij et al 2016 suggested that 14 occurrence records for rare species and 25 for widespread species gave good model results using maxent in ecological niche habitat suitability modeling sampling bias is a common problem to counter the sampling bias of occurrences a background selection process was implemented by using sdmtoolbox a python based plugin for arcgis the average of 15 replicates for each model was taken as the final predictions 2 5 4 model evaluation and interpretation to calibrate the model we used a 75 random selection of the presence points and 10 000 random selected background points and the other 25 presence points were used to evaluate the model s goodness of fit using the area under the receiving operator curve auc as the evaluation statistic to validate the model robustness we executed 10 replicated model runs for the species a greater area under the curve auc value 0 1 indicates a better predictive performance the jackknife test was adopted to assess the importance of each variable in the modeling maxent generates an estimate of habitat suitability for the species that varies from 0 lowest suitability to 1 highest suitability where areas with 0 5 was considered as good potential for species yang et al 2013 3 results 3 1 water tolerance of plant species based on water stagnancy duration and water depth identified swamp vegetation was grouped into high medium and low water tolerant species table 4 a total of 35 native swamp vegetation were grouped based on hierarchical cluster analysis considering both variables that form these three species clusters fig 3 it was observed that water stagnancy duration varies from 1 14 weeks and water depth 1 6 ft for different species high water tolerant species can tolerate waterlogging conditions for an average of 13 weeks followed by seven weeks by medium water tolerant species and two weeks by low water tolerant species fig 4 a in the case of species water depth tolerance a high water tolerant group can tolerate an average of 4 ft water followed by 2 5 ft water by medium and 1 ft by low water tolerant group fig 4b using water tolerance categories one can decide which species to consider for plantation in which sites it is important to note that no species were found that can tolerate water all time 3 2 swamp species dominance in reforestation programs the species accumulation curve shows the species richness for combinations of plantation sites these curves portray the average pooled species richness when all sites are combined the output indicates that the average richness for all possible combinations of 28 sites is 9 fig 5 a koroch was the dominant species among all the plots which was confirmed by the rank abundance curves followed by hijol and pitali fig 5b 3 3 dominant species resistance against flood flow wave action estimates of major swamp vegetation resistance to water flow at different planting densities are crucial for plantation design manning s roughness coefficients are widely used for vegetation resistance against water flow table 5 shows changes in manning s number with changes in planting density of the selected swamp species at different water depths the calculation shows that resistance of swamp vegetation to water flow increases with high density vegetation which is expected estimates indicate that resistance of borun exceeds that of pitali hijol and koroch for all water depths considered in this study for example at 3 5 m water depth and 2 m density the manning s coefficient for borun c magna is 4 55 followed by pitali t nudiflora 5 87 hijol b acutangula and koroch p pinnata 5 26 however manning s number calculation further indicates that there are no differences in resistance against water flow among hijol b acutangula koroch p pinnata and pitali t nudiflora regardless of vegetation density and water depth since the manning s number values among species does not have a big differences table 5 when root and trunk combined together manning s coefficients further confirm that resistance to water flow by haor vegetation increases with increase in the water depth as water interact with the root and trunk system for example with the increases of water depth manning s number started to decrease indicating increasing resistance table 5 3 4 dominant swamp tree species habitat range modeling for reintroduction 3 4 1 model evaluation the auc values were uniformly high for all four species where crataeva nurvala has auc 0 904 followed by pongamia pinnata auc 0 858 barringtonia acutangula auc 0 853 and trewia nudiflora auc 0 747 suggesting that the bioclimatic variables used for the model explained the predicted distribution very well the jackknife test showed that bio7 annual temperature range was the most influential variable for hijol koroch and pitali in contrast bio3 isothermality was the most influential climate variable in borun s distribution fig 6 increases in both these variables lead to a decline in the suitable habitats for all the four major species fig 7 3 4 2 species response and habitat suitability under present climatic conditions the predicted current distribution of four dominant swamp species under current climatic conditions is shown in figure 8 red colors indicate a highly suitable area for future plantations whereas deep blue colors indicate areas that are not suitable for plantations based on our model more than 50 of the study area is highly suitable for plantations for hijol koroch and pitali however a suitable area for borun is less than 50 of the whole haor area fig 8 4 discussion freshwater ecosystems support approximately 6 of the available global species heino et al 2009 however the rate of swamp species decline is comparatively faster than tropical rainforests xenopoulos et al 2005 this scenario is also true for the swamp ecosystem of bangladesh especially haor ecosystem swamp vegetation is declining day by day a recent bangladesh forest inventory report shows that the total area of tree dominated natural swamp forest is only 140 ha and the swamp planted area is only 628 ha which is significantly low gob 2019 if this scenario continues swamp forests and their related vegetation will be extinct in northwest bangladesh in the near future therefore it is urgent to document swamp vegetation adaptive capacity related information such as where the species can grow in the landscape and their water tolerance characteristics this will aid a better understanding of future reforestation programs our findings show that 35 native swamp plant species are available in the study area which is frequently available these species were grouped into high medium and low water tolerance categories based on water stagnant duration and inundation depth it is important to note that low water tolerance doesn t mean they are not suitable for plantations those species are of course suitable where water does not stay longer the study also found that hijol barringtonia acutangula koroch pongamia pinnata borun crataeva magna pitali trewia nudiflora is widely used for ongoing reforestation programs though this is not sufficient the habitat suitability model shows that more majority of the study area is highly suitable for hijol koroch pitali and borun species based on the findings the following recommendations are being proposed 1 immediate reforestation afforestation program using dominant swamp trees such as hijol barringtonia acutangula koroch pongamia pinnata and pitali trewia nudiflora the potential sites that may be planted with these species are the kanda areas submergible embankment edges in the floodplains edges of the kuas roadsides surrounding the homestead settlement areas settlement excavated canals and their banks this will undoubtedly increase vegetation cover which in turn will reduce wave action force 2 to reduce exploitation pressure on dominant swamp tree species hijol kororch and pitali plantations short rotation and economically important non timber species such as rattan calamus tenuis and murta schumannianthus dichotoma should be encouraged for plantation program both species have huge demand in local cottage industries it is important to note that murta is high water tolerant species whereas rattan is medium water tolerant this indicates they have high water tolerance ability and can be planted in kanda shallow sites and surrounding settlement areas 3 to reduce erosion and wave force in haor areas mixed plantation using the dominant species together with vetiver grass vetiveria zizanioides can increase resilience against climate extremes vetiver is moderate water tolerant species so this species can be planted in shallow waterlogged areas roadsides and surrounding settlement areas 5 conclusion the sustainable management of the swamp flora demands a detailed understanding of species composition and spatial distribution patterns utilizing swamp vegetation resources while retaining the ecohydrological characteristics of swamp flora mandates the preservation of the entire wetland ecosystem urgent action must be taken to develop a network of protected areas or reserve areas of representative wetlands to preserve the threatened swamp ecosystem a management mechanism that ensures the participation of the local people to meet the needs of the local communities and broaden the resource base is essential for a successful reforestation program declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest acknowledgement we would like to thank the local government engineering department lged for the initialization of this study we would also like to thank international fund for agricultural development ifad for funding this research through haor infrastructure and livelihood improvement project hilip project last but not the least thanks to the student of the department of forestry and environmental science sust for their help during data collection 
932,swamp forests are now at the edge of extinction in the haor haor ecosystem is a type of wetland comprised of swamp forest located in the lowlands of the north eastern part of bangladesh which is characterized by a bowl or saucer shaped shallow depression region of bangladesh to reverse such a trend there is an urgent need to start a reforestation program however the silvics of individual species and dynamics of swamp forest stands are only marginally understood hence the purpose of this study was to provide detailed information on swamp vegetation water tolerance range and to identify suitable habitat range for species that are dominant in the reforestation program it was found that high water tolerant species can tolerate waterlogging conditions for an average of 13 weeks followed by 07 weeks by medium water tolerant species and 02 weeks by low water tolerant species in the case of species water depth tolerance the high water tolerant group can tolerate an average of 4ft water followed by 2 5 ft water by medium and 1ft by low water tolerant group hijol barringtonia acutangula koroch pongamia pinnata pitali trewia nudiflora and borun crataeva magna were the dominant species used for existing small scale reforestation programs there are no significant differences in resistance against water flow among hijol koroch pitali and borun regardless of vegetation density and water depth for future large scale plantations the machine learning model shows that more than 50 of haor area is suitable for plantations by these four species the information generated through this study can be beneficial to planners and managers to aid in developing plantation plans and the design of habitat restoration and enhancement efforts keywords flash flood wave action erosion swamp vegetation loss reforestation plant water tolerance 1 introduction freshwater swamp forest ecosystems have significant socio ecological and economic importance drew et al 2005 the wetland ecosystem is a magnificent source of fish fiber fodder fuel water supply water purification climate regulation flood regulation coastal protection recreational opportunities and tourism among other services millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 mitsch et al 2015 in general this type of ecosystem has low vegetation diversity koponen et al 2004 despite the low species diversity and abundance the swamp ecosystem provides numerous ecosystems services such as providing habitat for wildlife e g migratory birds fish and regulating nutrients twilley et al 1986 harvey and hill 2001 mitsch et al 2015 most importantly wetland resources play an imperative role in the livelihood security of poor and developing countries newaz and rahman 2019 however the high rate of population growth and excess resource extraction from the wetlands are major problems for sustainable use of this resource sohel et al 2015 despite this importance wetland ecologists often argue that swamp forest vegetation is understudied the swamp forests in bangladesh that once used to be common in haor haor ecosystem is a type of wetland comprised of swamp forest located in the lowlands of the north eastern part of bangladesh which is characterized by a bowl or saucer shaped shallow depression areas have become severely degraded due to clearing cutting and other anthropogenic pressures iucn bangladesh 2004 the natural regeneration of swamp is hardly visible choudhury 2005 the reed beds have also been severely degraded and reduced because of over harvesting for fuel wood and converting land into settlements cropland and built up areas choudhury 2005 iucn bangladesh 2004 as a consequence many aquatic vegetation and wildlife that used to be common in the area became very rare and threatens the overall integrity of haor ecosystem alam et al 2015 degradation of swamp forest has severely impacted livelihoods of the local people swamp forest provides food and shelter for the fish population and therefore a reduction in fish production species diversity and the waterfowl population was observed over the past few decades choudhury 2005 sohel et al 2015 to reverse such degradation in the haor ecosystem of bangladesh reforestation of swamp areas is an urgent need in reducing flood flow in haor areas of bangladesh this in turn will increase food and shelter for the fish population and other wildlife however we don t have proper documentation on which swamp vegetation grows at what depth and how long swamp vegetation can tolerate flood conditions in addition to that increasing greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent global warming will alter local and regional freshwater faunal and floral diversity ipcc 2014 fluctuations in rainfall extended drought periods and long term water stagnancy may also potentially reduce the physical quality of freshwater ecosystems like wetlands ipcc 2014 these conditions may lead to the local extinction of some species therefore it is important to generate as much scientific information as possible particularly related to the habitat range of existing vegetation for future plantations such information may facilitate intensive habitat conservation and restoration planning in the reality of unforeseen future climate scenarios therefore to have a successful swamp reforestation program the study aims to identify suitable habitats and vegetation for reforestation so the purpose of this study was to 1 to provide detailed information on swamp vegetation water tolerance i e flood duration and inundation tolerance range 2 to identify major swamp species used for exiting reforestation programs and assess wave action flood flow reduction capacity 3 to predict dominant species suitable habitat range for future re introduction using a machine learning algorithm called maximum entropy model 2 methodology 2 1 study site there are seven districts in haor areas of bangladesh fig 1 among them five haor based districts namely brahmanbaria habiganj kishoregonj netrakona and sunamganj were selected purposively based on previous and ongoing reforestation programs it is important to note that haor of the north east region of bangladesh can be divided into three categories fig 1 depending on the area s geographical location and flooding characteristics such as foothill and near hill floodplain area haor and deeply flooded haor the haors along the border areas of sunamganj sylhet and all haors of habiganj and maulvibazar districts are situated near hills or at foothills most of the haor areas of sylhet netrakona and brahmanbaria are within the floodplains all the haors of kishoreganj and most of the haors of sunamganj districts are deeply flooded 2 2 swamp vegetation water depth and duration tolerance and their habitat swamp vegetation survival during plantations depends on the species water tolerance limit including water depth and duration water tolerance of plant species varies from species to species some species can tolerate extreme waterlogging conditions while some cannot survive extreme waterlogging conditions literature review field observation and consultation with local people were conducted in 28 locations of five haor districts to know plant species availability and their waterlogging characteristics based on water depth and duration swamp vegetation was grouped into high moderate and low water tolerant species species water tolerant grouping was done using hierarchical clustering methods cluster analysis is a method of classification aimed at grouping objects in this case species based on the similarity of their attributes in this case water depth and water duration euclidean distance was chosen as the criterion for cluster combination the procedure produces a dendrogram that indicates the relationships between all the samples based on a defined measure of similarity this dendrogram shows the level where clusters were joined together and the species within each cluster 2 3 swamp vegetation dominance in existing reforestation programs 2 3 1 vegetation survey and dominance analysis a total of 82 plots were established in 28 plantation sites each of which was 10 10m individual tree dbh 5 cm was considered all trees within 10m 10m plot size were enumerated both dbh and height were measured diversity analysis was calculated using the species richness shannon diversity h and simpson diversity d indices species accumulation curves sac were used to estimate the number of vegetation species in the plots species accumulation curves show the species richness for combinations of sites all the calculations and graphs were done using r packages biodiversityr kindt and coe 2005 and rcmdrplugin kmggplot2 sou 2015 2 4 manning s roughness coefficients estimation the existing swamp tree creates resistance against high water flow and monsoon wind generated waves through their root and trunk system manning s number can quantify this resistance to calculate manning s number of the dominant swamp tree species tree species related data and information such as root height from existing ground level m root diameter m ground coverage of root system in the area m2 tree density tree ha the diameter of the trunk m and water level m were collected the following presents the available dominant tree information of haor districts table 1 higher value of manning s number m indicates lower roughness thus lower resistance of trees species against high water flow or wave action the manning s roughness for the root system is calculated by using the following equation dasgupta et al 2019 dasgupta et al 2017 bangladesh water development board 2001 1 m g h 1 3 64 2 45 in k n h where m manning s roughness h is the water depth g gravitational acceleration 9 81 nikuradses roughness height kn and the manning s roughness for trunk system is calculated by using the following equation 2 m m 1 m 2 n a d c h 4 3 2 g 1 2 where m manning s roughness h is the water depth g gravitational acceleration 9 81 nikuradses roughness height kn c is a constant and d the diameter of the trunk of the existing tree species a is horizontal area of the existing tree coverage n is number of trees in the area 2 5 dominant swamp vegetation habitat range modelling for future reintroduction 2 5 1 species occurrence data and spatial rarefying swamp species occurrence data were collected from a vegetation plot survey conducted in 82 plots established in 28 plantation sites of haor districts our study used a total of 119 occurrence records fig 2 of dominant species such as kadam athocephalus chinensis hijol barringtonia acutangula borun crataeva magna jarul lagerstroemia speciosa koroch pongamia pinnata jam syzygium cumini pitali trewia nudiflora respectively from extensive field survey in a single plot there are different species in that case we took coordinates of all the species separately from that plot if any plots have only one species we consider coordinates of that plots only to represent that species all the species naturally grow in the northeastern region of bangladesh it is important to note that maxent requires input occurrence data to be spatially independent to perform well spatially auto correlated occurrence points introduce biases into the model which are often ignored by the researchers veloz 2009 hijimans et al 2012 boria et al 2014 to overcome such issues the number of spatially independent localities was spatially rarefied using sdm toolbox 2 030 in arcgis 10 3 by eliminating all but one point present within a single grid cell to avoid double counting of presence points this has reduced our sampled species occurrence points after spatial rarifying there were 52 occurrence spatially independent points fig 2 and only four species have the required number of points for habitat suitability models table 2 2 5 2 climate variables we primarily selected 19 bioclimatic variables obtained from the worldclim database ver 1 4 hijmans et al 2005 all variables were measured at the 1 km resolution and processed using sdmtoolbox v2 4 http www sdmtoolbox org and arcgis10 3 interface having the same cell size extent and projection systems wgs84 longitude latitude projection interpreting sdm results are difficult when predictor variables are highly correlated kivinen et al 2008 so only less correlated variables pearson correlation coefficient r 0 80 were used in the maxent model elith et al 2010 this was done using sdmtoolbx v2 4 finally eight 08 climate variables i e isothermality bio3 temperature annual range bio7 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio8 annual precipitation bio12 precipitation of driest month bio14 and precipitation seasonality bio15 were considered that influence the distribution of species table 3 it is important to note that inundation time and flood depth were highly influential factors for swamp vegetation survival however these variables were not considered as maxent input this is because the inclusion of such variables requires a high resolution digital elevation model dem and bathymetric survey open sources dem have a coarse resolution of 30m which is not enough to create a high quality inundation map on top of it a bathymetric study of these large haor areas requires enormous funds which we lack to overcome this limitation our modeling approach was to identify suitable habitats in terms of climatic variables we can then look for areas where different water tolerant group of species can be planted based on species specific inundation time and flood depth data gathered from local people 2 5 3 spatial modelling we used the maximum entropy algorithm maxent version 3 3 3 k for species distribution modeling in our study phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 maxent is a machine learning program that derives the probability of presence on a pixel by pixel basis and performs well compared with other species distribution models since it requires presence only data phillips et al 2004 2006 it is widely used for species distribution modeling as it is effective even with small sample sizes compared with other species distribution model sdms elith et al 2006 elith et al 2011 pearson et al 2007 kumar and stohlgren 2009 hernandez et al 2006 maxent was found to be the most capable sdm among many methods in producing meaningful results with sample sizes as small as 5 10 and 25 occurrences records hernandez et al 2006 another study conducted by van proosdij et al 2016 suggested that 14 occurrence records for rare species and 25 for widespread species gave good model results using maxent in ecological niche habitat suitability modeling sampling bias is a common problem to counter the sampling bias of occurrences a background selection process was implemented by using sdmtoolbox a python based plugin for arcgis the average of 15 replicates for each model was taken as the final predictions 2 5 4 model evaluation and interpretation to calibrate the model we used a 75 random selection of the presence points and 10 000 random selected background points and the other 25 presence points were used to evaluate the model s goodness of fit using the area under the receiving operator curve auc as the evaluation statistic to validate the model robustness we executed 10 replicated model runs for the species a greater area under the curve auc value 0 1 indicates a better predictive performance the jackknife test was adopted to assess the importance of each variable in the modeling maxent generates an estimate of habitat suitability for the species that varies from 0 lowest suitability to 1 highest suitability where areas with 0 5 was considered as good potential for species yang et al 2013 3 results 3 1 water tolerance of plant species based on water stagnancy duration and water depth identified swamp vegetation was grouped into high medium and low water tolerant species table 4 a total of 35 native swamp vegetation were grouped based on hierarchical cluster analysis considering both variables that form these three species clusters fig 3 it was observed that water stagnancy duration varies from 1 14 weeks and water depth 1 6 ft for different species high water tolerant species can tolerate waterlogging conditions for an average of 13 weeks followed by seven weeks by medium water tolerant species and two weeks by low water tolerant species fig 4 a in the case of species water depth tolerance a high water tolerant group can tolerate an average of 4 ft water followed by 2 5 ft water by medium and 1 ft by low water tolerant group fig 4b using water tolerance categories one can decide which species to consider for plantation in which sites it is important to note that no species were found that can tolerate water all time 3 2 swamp species dominance in reforestation programs the species accumulation curve shows the species richness for combinations of plantation sites these curves portray the average pooled species richness when all sites are combined the output indicates that the average richness for all possible combinations of 28 sites is 9 fig 5 a koroch was the dominant species among all the plots which was confirmed by the rank abundance curves followed by hijol and pitali fig 5b 3 3 dominant species resistance against flood flow wave action estimates of major swamp vegetation resistance to water flow at different planting densities are crucial for plantation design manning s roughness coefficients are widely used for vegetation resistance against water flow table 5 shows changes in manning s number with changes in planting density of the selected swamp species at different water depths the calculation shows that resistance of swamp vegetation to water flow increases with high density vegetation which is expected estimates indicate that resistance of borun exceeds that of pitali hijol and koroch for all water depths considered in this study for example at 3 5 m water depth and 2 m density the manning s coefficient for borun c magna is 4 55 followed by pitali t nudiflora 5 87 hijol b acutangula and koroch p pinnata 5 26 however manning s number calculation further indicates that there are no differences in resistance against water flow among hijol b acutangula koroch p pinnata and pitali t nudiflora regardless of vegetation density and water depth since the manning s number values among species does not have a big differences table 5 when root and trunk combined together manning s coefficients further confirm that resistance to water flow by haor vegetation increases with increase in the water depth as water interact with the root and trunk system for example with the increases of water depth manning s number started to decrease indicating increasing resistance table 5 3 4 dominant swamp tree species habitat range modeling for reintroduction 3 4 1 model evaluation the auc values were uniformly high for all four species where crataeva nurvala has auc 0 904 followed by pongamia pinnata auc 0 858 barringtonia acutangula auc 0 853 and trewia nudiflora auc 0 747 suggesting that the bioclimatic variables used for the model explained the predicted distribution very well the jackknife test showed that bio7 annual temperature range was the most influential variable for hijol koroch and pitali in contrast bio3 isothermality was the most influential climate variable in borun s distribution fig 6 increases in both these variables lead to a decline in the suitable habitats for all the four major species fig 7 3 4 2 species response and habitat suitability under present climatic conditions the predicted current distribution of four dominant swamp species under current climatic conditions is shown in figure 8 red colors indicate a highly suitable area for future plantations whereas deep blue colors indicate areas that are not suitable for plantations based on our model more than 50 of the study area is highly suitable for plantations for hijol koroch and pitali however a suitable area for borun is less than 50 of the whole haor area fig 8 4 discussion freshwater ecosystems support approximately 6 of the available global species heino et al 2009 however the rate of swamp species decline is comparatively faster than tropical rainforests xenopoulos et al 2005 this scenario is also true for the swamp ecosystem of bangladesh especially haor ecosystem swamp vegetation is declining day by day a recent bangladesh forest inventory report shows that the total area of tree dominated natural swamp forest is only 140 ha and the swamp planted area is only 628 ha which is significantly low gob 2019 if this scenario continues swamp forests and their related vegetation will be extinct in northwest bangladesh in the near future therefore it is urgent to document swamp vegetation adaptive capacity related information such as where the species can grow in the landscape and their water tolerance characteristics this will aid a better understanding of future reforestation programs our findings show that 35 native swamp plant species are available in the study area which is frequently available these species were grouped into high medium and low water tolerance categories based on water stagnant duration and inundation depth it is important to note that low water tolerance doesn t mean they are not suitable for plantations those species are of course suitable where water does not stay longer the study also found that hijol barringtonia acutangula koroch pongamia pinnata borun crataeva magna pitali trewia nudiflora is widely used for ongoing reforestation programs though this is not sufficient the habitat suitability model shows that more majority of the study area is highly suitable for hijol koroch pitali and borun species based on the findings the following recommendations are being proposed 1 immediate reforestation afforestation program using dominant swamp trees such as hijol barringtonia acutangula koroch pongamia pinnata and pitali trewia nudiflora the potential sites that may be planted with these species are the kanda areas submergible embankment edges in the floodplains edges of the kuas roadsides surrounding the homestead settlement areas settlement excavated canals and their banks this will undoubtedly increase vegetation cover which in turn will reduce wave action force 2 to reduce exploitation pressure on dominant swamp tree species hijol kororch and pitali plantations short rotation and economically important non timber species such as rattan calamus tenuis and murta schumannianthus dichotoma should be encouraged for plantation program both species have huge demand in local cottage industries it is important to note that murta is high water tolerant species whereas rattan is medium water tolerant this indicates they have high water tolerance ability and can be planted in kanda shallow sites and surrounding settlement areas 3 to reduce erosion and wave force in haor areas mixed plantation using the dominant species together with vetiver grass vetiveria zizanioides can increase resilience against climate extremes vetiver is moderate water tolerant species so this species can be planted in shallow waterlogged areas roadsides and surrounding settlement areas 5 conclusion the sustainable management of the swamp flora demands a detailed understanding of species composition and spatial distribution patterns utilizing swamp vegetation resources while retaining the ecohydrological characteristics of swamp flora mandates the preservation of the entire wetland ecosystem urgent action must be taken to develop a network of protected areas or reserve areas of representative wetlands to preserve the threatened swamp ecosystem a management mechanism that ensures the participation of the local people to meet the needs of the local communities and broaden the resource base is essential for a successful reforestation program declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest acknowledgement we would like to thank the local government engineering department lged for the initialization of this study we would also like to thank international fund for agricultural development ifad for funding this research through haor infrastructure and livelihood improvement project hilip project last but not the least thanks to the student of the department of forestry and environmental science sust for their help during data collection 
933,the combined effects of global changes and increasing water demand for human use are the main drivers of the increasing intermittence of most watercourses the disruption of lateral longitudinal and vertical connectivity during the dry phase in newly intermittent rivers may have dramatic effects on freshwater biota ecosystem structure and processes and may extend its influence also after several months from the return of superficial flow a few studies have systematically documented the dynamics of post drought recovery of freshwater communities in this paper we assessed the temporal dynamics of benthic invertebrate s recovery starting from the first day after superficial flow resumption and for the successive five months we demonstrated that the recolonization process of rewetted substrata was very low and partial and after five months from the return of superficial flow the richness and abundance of post drought re colonizers were markedly lower if compared with the pre drought community and with that of a near upstream perennial site in this context upstream drift seedbanks and hyporheic refugia would be of minor importance and the observed recolonization pattern may be mainly explained by the aerial dispersal from downstream perennial reaches of tolerant and generalist taxa therefore former perennial apennine rivers may be profoundly affected by modifications of the natural flow regime increasing intermittence of these watercourses may determine drastic changes in community structure and composition with species loss and species substitution in addition the high post drought functional turnover may have negative effects on key ecosystem processes as leaf litter breakdown and primary production keywords central italy apennine rivers irregular dryings flow resumption macroinvertebrates post drought recovery 1 introduction the natural flow regime of many watercourses is being drastically modified by the combined effects of global change and increasing water demand for human use poff et al 1997 milly et al 2005 perennial streams and rivers of some geographic regions are already experiencing recurrent drying events with extended period of superficial flow cessation and complete drought messager et al 2021 these phenomena are predicted to significantly increase in the coming decades and most former perennial watercourses of the mediterranean and temperate regions will be subjected to irregular and unpredictable drought periods skoulikidis et al 2017 this situation will determine a shift from perennial to non perennial flow regime with a consistent increase of intermittent rivers ir worldwide larned et al 2010 datry et al 2017 according to crabot et al 2021 communities and processes in newly intermittent rivers and streams nir respond differently to drying if compared to historically intermittent watercourses hir and the disruption of lateral longitudinal and vertical connectivity during the dry phase may have much more dramatic effects on freshwater biota in addition the negative effects of drought events may extend their influence also after several months from flow resumption determining a shift in community composition and functional organization with possible negative repercussions on key ecosystem processes bruder et al 2011 datry et al 2011 pinna et al 2016 piano et al 2019a 2020a di sabatino et al 2021 and freshwater ecosystem services di sabatino et al 2014 boulton 2014 datry et al 2018 some studies have already documented how communities and processes in intermittent streams may recover after antecedent droughts fowler 2004 acuña et al 2005 doretto et al 2020 and it was also demonstrated that resilience traits more than resistance mechanisms contribute most to community recovery chester robson 2011 datry et al 2017 van looy et al 2019 the presence of refuges and the recolonization by upstream drift have often been evocated as the main factors determining a high recovery capacity in hir datry et al 2017 and references therein however some authors have also demonstrated that dispersal and recolonization from nearby sources bogan et al 2015 robson et al 2011 sarremejane et al 2017 and the presence of resistance form in dry riverbed sediments seedbanks were the main drivers of community persistence in both hir and nir stubbington et al 2016 pařil et al 2019 in any case the length of dry period the intensity presence of residual pools wet substrata saturated hyporheic refugia and the predictability of drought events are important factors which may modulate the response of freshwater community and ecosystem processes to drying sanchez montoya et al 2018 majdi et al 2020 in this context information on the early stages of succession following superficial flow resumption would be of fundamental importance to better understand the resilience resistance capacity of communities in ir leigh et al 2016 vadher et al 2018 unfortunately only a few studies have documented the dynamics of post drought recovery during long term research on the ecological effects of flow regime modifications in a former perennial apennine river nir di sabatino et al 2021 have shown as the aterno river community still conserved the memory of antecedent drying events in comparison with a near upstream perennial site and after more than one year from the reestablishment of the natural flow regime the intermittent site community still showed substantial structural and functional differences however the study started after about 5 months from flow resumption and the authors were not able to document what happened at the intermittent site during the first phase of rewetting since after two consecutive years of a natural hydrological regime no droughts in summer 2020 the intermittent site was affected by a prolonged period from august to november of complete drying we had the opportunity to assess the temporal dynamics of community recovery starting just after the first day of flow resumption and for the successive five months based on results of previous studies pinna et al 2016 di sabatino et al 2021 and recent research on newly intermittent streams doretto et al 2020 piano et al 2019a 2020a crabot et al 2021 we hypothesized that the recolonization process of rewetted substrata would be very slow and not complete 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design we located our study site in a second order reach of the aterno river in central italy coordinate 42 23 27 82 n 13 18 58 01 e altitude 657 m asl at about 20 km distance from the spring source the river sub basin is characterized by low anthropogenic pressures with 1 7 of the territory interested by urbanization and 27 7 by agriculture the substratum at the sampling site was composed by a mix of 10 cobbles 50 pebbles 30 sand and 10 silt with patches of leaf litter detritus accumulation deriving from a narrow belt of natural riparian vegetation with populus nigra and salix alba trees in this reach the river was subjected to recent irregular intermittence phenomena in summer autumn months of the years 2017 and 2020 the streambed was completely dry fig 1 and no residuals pools persisted at the end of the dry period the field experiment started on 4th december 2020 one day after the complete flow resumption and continued until may 2021 to follow the temporal dynamics of macroinvertebrate community recovery the intermittent site was sampled weekly in december 2020 and then monthly or bimonthly for a total of six sampling dates covering about five months at the end of sampling period may 2021 samples were also taken in a 7 km upstream perennial site which never experienced superficial flow cessation in summer autumn months 2 2 sampling protocol and laboratory procedures macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were collected and measured at intervals of 1 12 19 49 80 and 150 days from the resumption of the superficial flow at each sampling occasion 3 surber samples area 0 06 m2 mesh size 200 µm were randomly taken along a 10 m channel length the material collected was stored in plastic jars and transported to the laboratory in a portable cooler macroinvertebrates were sorted under a stereomicroscope preserved in alcohol at 70 and subsequently identified at the lowest possible taxonomic level the taxa identified were also classified according to their feeding traits following tachet et al 2010 physicochemical parameters water temperature ph dissolved oxygen conductivity were recorded by using a multiparameter probe hach lange hq40d multi hydraulic parameters river depth current velocity were measured with a magnetic flow probe fp 01 and by dividing the orthogonal transect total width in 0 5 m distance cells instantaneous discharge was calculated as the sum of each cell discharge 0 5 x depth x current velocity and expressed as m3 sec 1 2 3 data analysis considering the objectives of the paper and the low number of replicates we used descriptive statistic to assess variation in structure of assemblages during the first 150 days from the return of superficial flow differences in the taxonomic structure of community total richness total abundance insect and non insect richness and abundance were graphically represented by cumulating 3 surber samples at each sampling date temporal differences in community composition were assessed with permanova and graphically represented by applying non metric multidimensional scaling nmds on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of square root transformed abundances the functional organization of the community at each sampling date was represented considering the occurrence and the relative abundance of feeding traits shredders collector gatherers collector filterers grazers scrapers and predators between sample functional differences were also graphically displayed by applying nmds on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of trait percentages macroinvertebrate data collected in may 2021 at the upstream perennial site and in may 2020 pre drought conditions at the same intermittent site after two consecutive no drought years were also utilised for some further comparisons statistical analyses were performed using xlstat 2016 02 27444 and primer v6 1 16 permanova v1 0 6 the significance of statistical tests was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 hydrological and physicochemical parameters during the whole study period the rewetted site was characterized by the presence of cold and well oxygenated waters after one day from the return of the superficial flow the instantaneous discharge was 0 34 m3 sec 1 but it doubled after ten days and reached 1 12 m3 sec 1 at the end of the sampling period current speed changed only slightly while the mean depth of the wetted channel increased from 8 cm after one day to 21 cm after 150 days water temperature was very low in december 2020 successively reached about 10 c in may 2021 conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen did not show substantial temporal variations and after about five months from flow resumption the environmental parameters of the intermittent site were very similar to those recorded at the upstream perennial site table 1 3 2 macroinvertebrates during the whole 150 days of the experiment we collected 2223 individuals belonging to 19 taxa table s1 in supplementary material insects occurred with 9 taxa and 1527 individuals while 696 individuals and 10 taxa were non insects four taxa baetis rhodani oligochaetes chironomidae and simulium variegatum dominated the assemblages and represented about 92 of the total individuals collected plecoptera and trichoptera except one single individual of hydropsyche sp were absent eight taxa were present in the first day immediately after the return of the superficial flow and 11 taxa recolonized the substrata after 12 days but taxa richness did not increase consistently in the successive periods fig 2 and after 150 days 11 taxa were present in the stream benthos total abundance was low until the first 20 days but with a successive sharp increase fig 2 insect richness and abundance increased over time after 50 days from rewetting while non insect richness declined but with almost constant lower abundances fig 3 the composition of assemblages changed consistently after the first day of substrate recolonization and followed a temporal succession with chironomidae oligochaetes mainly lumbricids and enchytraeids ostracoda and psychodiidae being the first re colonizers after 12 days the ephemeropteran baetis rhodani and the dipteran simulium variegatum made their first appearance followed after 7 days by the leech dina lineata and the gastropod bithynia tentaculata only after 80 days from rewetting we recorded the first occurrence of the dipteran families limoniidae and ceratopogonidae and after about further two months the ephemeropterans caenis martae and ephemerella sp first appeared in the stream benthos fig 4 ept taxa were absent in the first day after the superficial flow resumed and occurred for the first time after 12 days with two taxa baetis rhodani and hydropsyche sp successively trichopterans disappeared and baetis rhodani was the unique ept taxon occurring until may 2021 when only 3 ept taxa recolonized the intermittent site results of permanova clearly show that the composition of community changed significantly during the 150 days of recovery pseudo f5 12 4 86 p 0 001 the nmds ordination pattern clearly shows that the composition of community changed substantially during the first 20 days from rewetting and was also different from that observed in the following three months fig 5 therefore at the end of the study period the structure and composition of the post drought community was substantially different not only from that of the upstream perennial site 21 taxa 11 ept but also from that observed at the intermittent site in the same period of the antecedent no drought year 22 taxa 9 ept table 2 the analysis of feeding traits of post drought community fig 6 a showed that collectors mainly gatherers dominated during the whole recovery period with relative abundances of about 90 scrapers were present during the first phase upon rewetting but successively disappeared while shredder organisms were totally absent the functional organization of assemblages at the end of the study period may 2021 was consistently different from that of the 7 km upstream perennial site and also showed some differences with that observed at the same site in the previous no drought year fig 6b 4 discussion in a recent paper di sabatino et al 2021 documented that the macroinvertebrate community of the aterno river conserved the memory of antecedent drying events and after more than one year from the reestablishment of the natural flow regime still showed substantial structural and functional differences in comparison with a near upstream perennial site in this paper we confirm and corroborate these previous observations in fact the post drought recovery capacity of the intermittent reach community was very low and not complete after 150 days from superficial flow resumption the intermittent site was characterized by the presence of 11 taxa and this represents a consistent decline if compared to the pre drought condition 50 the richness of ept taxa was reduced much more 72 of the upstream perennial site and 67 of the pre drought community by contrast in a similar study on alpine streams doretto et al 2020 demonstrated that after 73 days from the return of superficial flow 14 taxa recolonized the benthos representing about 78 of those present at the upstream perennial site they also documented a complete recovery of ept taxa and after about two months from rewetting no substantial differences were found between perennial and intermittent communities similarly pařil et al 2019 documented that after 60 days upon rewetting almost 80 of macroinvertebrate taxa recolonized the streambed sediments of intermittent czech streams in this case the persistence in dry riverbeds of desiccation tolerant taxa contributed most to the fast initial recovery of the community a rapid recovery of both richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates was also reported for intermittent rivers of the mediterranean region doledec et al 2017 and for usa and uk streams after severe supraseasonal droughts bogan et al 2015 hill et al 2019 however it was also documented that though some community metrics richness and abundance may reach values like those of the antecedent pre drought period the composition of post drought communities was still different also after more than one year from the previous drying episode datry et al 2011 hill et al 2019 di sabatino et al 2021 our data on the dynamics of post drought recolonization in the aterno river show that the first pioneer taxa chironomids psychodids ostracods and lumbricid and enchytraeid oligochaetes appeared just after the first day from superficial flow resumptions most of these taxa are semiaquatic and well adapted to cope with periods of water flow cessation and their fast recolonization was mainly due to the persistence of resistance forms in the dry substrata or to immigration from riparian wet refugia acuña et al 2005 aspin et al 2018 white et al 2018 in the successive period the whole dynamics of community recovery could be separated into two distinct temporal phases in the first 20 days after flow resumption pioneer taxa both insects and non insects occurred with similar richness and abundance during the second phase new taxa recolonized the benthos caenis martae ephmerella sp limoniidae ceratopogonidae but some others disappeared helobdella stagnalis bithynia tentaculata hydropsiche sp ostracoda therefore total richness of assemblages after 150 days grew only slightly 11 taxa in confront to that of the first day 8 taxa by contrast densities increased exponentially starting from 20 days after rewetting and this was mainly due to the major occurrence of insects species with resilient fast colonization capacities and resistant traits sarremejane et al 2021 as baetis rhodani and simulium variegatum dominated the post drought assemblages and replaced more sensible and rheophile insect taxa plecopterans trichopterans and heptageniid ephemeropterans which although abundant at the perennial site and well represented in the pre drought community did not recolonize the intermittent reach at all therefore it seems that the recolonization process of rewetted substrata in the aterno river started with few semiaquatic or resistant taxa which persisted in the dry streambed successively aerial dispersal both active and passive from nearby downstream sources more than upstream drift or vertical migration from hyporheic refugia may better explains the observed recolonization pattern fig 7 although these latter two strategies have been often evocated as the main drivers of community resilience in intermittent watercourses leigh et al 2016 vander vorste et al 2016 doretto et al 2018 it seems that in the aterno river they played a minor role probably the intensity and duration of the antecedent drought more than 4 months with no residual pools the absence of saturated interstitial refugia and the distance from the upstream perennial reach represent a combination of factors which determined the low resilience of the aterno river macrobenthic community bogan et al 2015 hill et al 2019 moreover in contrast with results of previous research pařil et al 2019 stubbington and datry 2013 stubbington et al 2016 it seems that no active macroinvertebrate seedbanks were operating to ensure a rapid recolonization of rewetted substrata other than affecting community structure and composition irregular drought events may also determine a consistent shift in the functional organization of post drought community aspin et al 2018 leigh et al 2019 our results clearly show that despite the large amount of leaf litter accumulation prior and during the rewetting phase fig 1a shredder organisms were completely absent during the whole study period herbivores were abundant only the first day upon rewetting but successively decreased and disappeared after 80 days the total absence of shredder organisms in the post rewetting phase may have negative effects on coarse particulate organic matter cpom processing and stream ecosystem metabolism datry et al 2011 martínez et al 2015 monroy et al 2016 piano et al 2020b di sabatino et al 2021 in addition the scarce presence of herbivores during the first phase of rewetting and their almost total absence in the successive months may indirectly suggests some negative effects on periphyton recolonization of rewetted substrata piano et al 2019b despite some studies have documented a high resilience and a fast post drought recovery of periphyton robson 2000 timoner et al 2012 it was also noted that this capacity was mainly associated with the presence of residual pools or wet refugia during the dry phase robson et al 2008 2011 in the aterno river the prolonged dry period the absence of saturated refugia and the low adaptation of the algal community to regrow from dry biofilms may have negatively affected the recolonization of benthic autotrophs therefore after more than five months upon rewetting the invertebrate community still shows important and significant differences in comparison with the upstream perennial reach but also with the pre drought community of the intermittent reach in the previous year in conclusion although our findings are not generalizable yet we can affirm that former perennial apennine rivers may be profoundly affected by the modification of the natural flow regime the increasing intermittence of these watercourses may determine drastic changes in community structure and composition with species loss and species substitution sarremejane et al 2021 the high compositional and functional turnover of the recolonizing communities may also have severe consequences on stream ecosystem processes and functions ledger et al 2013 aspin et al 2018 leigh et al 2019 di sabatino et al 2021 considering the high fragility of these ecosystems low resistance and limited resilience more concrete actions are expected to mitigate the negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functions in nir networks for example more controls on illegal practices of water abstraction

933,the combined effects of global changes and increasing water demand for human use are the main drivers of the increasing intermittence of most watercourses the disruption of lateral longitudinal and vertical connectivity during the dry phase in newly intermittent rivers may have dramatic effects on freshwater biota ecosystem structure and processes and may extend its influence also after several months from the return of superficial flow a few studies have systematically documented the dynamics of post drought recovery of freshwater communities in this paper we assessed the temporal dynamics of benthic invertebrate s recovery starting from the first day after superficial flow resumption and for the successive five months we demonstrated that the recolonization process of rewetted substrata was very low and partial and after five months from the return of superficial flow the richness and abundance of post drought re colonizers were markedly lower if compared with the pre drought community and with that of a near upstream perennial site in this context upstream drift seedbanks and hyporheic refugia would be of minor importance and the observed recolonization pattern may be mainly explained by the aerial dispersal from downstream perennial reaches of tolerant and generalist taxa therefore former perennial apennine rivers may be profoundly affected by modifications of the natural flow regime increasing intermittence of these watercourses may determine drastic changes in community structure and composition with species loss and species substitution in addition the high post drought functional turnover may have negative effects on key ecosystem processes as leaf litter breakdown and primary production keywords central italy apennine rivers irregular dryings flow resumption macroinvertebrates post drought recovery 1 introduction the natural flow regime of many watercourses is being drastically modified by the combined effects of global change and increasing water demand for human use poff et al 1997 milly et al 2005 perennial streams and rivers of some geographic regions are already experiencing recurrent drying events with extended period of superficial flow cessation and complete drought messager et al 2021 these phenomena are predicted to significantly increase in the coming decades and most former perennial watercourses of the mediterranean and temperate regions will be subjected to irregular and unpredictable drought periods skoulikidis et al 2017 this situation will determine a shift from perennial to non perennial flow regime with a consistent increase of intermittent rivers ir worldwide larned et al 2010 datry et al 2017 according to crabot et al 2021 communities and processes in newly intermittent rivers and streams nir respond differently to drying if compared to historically intermittent watercourses hir and the disruption of lateral longitudinal and vertical connectivity during the dry phase may have much more dramatic effects on freshwater biota in addition the negative effects of drought events may extend their influence also after several months from flow resumption determining a shift in

superficial flow resumption would be of fundamental importance to better understand the resilience resistance capacity of communities in ir leigh et al 2016 vadher et al 2018 unfortunately only a few studies have documented the dynamics of post drought recovery during long term research on the ecological effects of flow regime modifications in a former perennial apennine river nir di sabatino et al 2021 have shown as the aterno river community still conserved the memory of antecedent drying events in comparison with a near upstream perennial site and after more than one year from the reestablishment of the natural flow regime the intermittent site community still showed substantial structural and functional differences however the study started after about 5 months from flow resumption and the authors were not able to document what happened at the intermittent site during the first phase of rewetting since after two consecutive years of a natural hydrological regime no droughts in summer 2020 the intermittent site was affected by a prolonged period from august to november of complete drying we had the opportunity to assess the temporal dynamics of community recovery starting just after the first day of flow resumption and for the successive five months based on results of previous studies pinna et al 2016 di sabatino et al 2021 and recent research on newly intermittent streams doretto et al 2020 piano et al 2019a 2020a crabot et al 2021 we hypothesized that the recolonization process of rewetted substrata would be very slow and not complete 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design we located our study site in a second order reach of the aterno river in central italy coordinate 42 23 27 82 n 13 18 58 01 e altitude 657 m asl at about 20 km distance from the spring source the river sub basin is characterized by low anthropogenic pressures with 1 7 of the territory interested by urbanization and 27 7 by agriculture the substratum at the sampling site was composed by a mix of 10 cobbles 50 pebbles 30 sand and 10 silt with patches of leaf litter detritus accumulation deriving from a narrow belt of natural riparian vegetation with populus nigra and salix alba trees in this reach the river was subjected to recent irregular intermittence phenomena in summer autumn months of the years 2017 and 2020 the streambed was completely dry fig 1 and no residuals pools persisted at the end of the dry period the field experiment started on 4th december 2020 one day after the complete flow resumption and continued until may 2021 to follow the temporal dynamics of macroinvertebrate community recovery the intermittent site was sampled weekly in december 2020 and then monthly or bimonthly for a total of six sampling dates covering about five months at the end of sampling period may 2021 samples were also taken in a 7 km upstream perennial site which never experienced superficial flow cessation in summer autumn months 2 2 sampling protocol and laboratory procedures macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were collected and measured at intervals of 1 12 19 49 80 and 150 days from the resumption of the superficial flow at each sampling occasion 3 surber samples area 0 06 m2 mesh size 200 µm were randomly taken along a 10 m channel length the material collected was stored in plastic jars and transported to the laboratory in a portable cooler macroinvertebrates were sorted under a stereomicroscope preserved in alcohol at 70 and subsequently identified at the lowest possible taxonomic level the taxa identified were also classified according to their feeding traits following tachet et al 2010 physicochemical parameters water temperature ph dissolved oxygen conductivity were recorded by using a multiparameter probe hach lange hq40d multi hydraulic parameters river depth current velocity were measured with a magnetic flow probe fp 01 and by dividing the orthogonal transect total width in 0 5 m distance cells instantaneous discharge was calculated as the sum of each cell discharge 0 5 x depth x current velocity and expressed as m3 sec 1 2 3 data analysis considering the objectives of the paper and the low number of replicates we used descriptive statistic to assess variation in structure of assemblages during the first 150 days from the return of superficial flow differences in the taxonomic structure of community total richness total abundance insect and non insect richness and abundance were graphically represented by cumulating 3 surber samples at each sampling date temporal differences in community composition were assessed with permanova and graphically represented by applying non metric multidimensional scaling nmds on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of square root transformed abundances the functional organization of the community at each sampling date was represented considering the occurrence and the relative abundance of feeding traits shredders collector gatherers collector filterers grazers scrapers and predators between sample functional differences were also graphically displayed by applying nmds on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of trait percentages macroinvertebrate data collected in may 2021 at the upstream perennial site and in may 2020 pre drought conditions at the same intermittent site after two consecutive no drought years were also utilised for some further comparisons statistical analyses were performed using xlstat 2016 02 27444 and primer v6 1 16 permanova v1 0 6 the significance of statistical tests was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 hydrological and physicochemical parameters during the whole study period the rewetted site was characterized by the presence of cold and well oxygenated waters after one day from the return of the superficial flow the instantaneous discharge was 0 34 m3 sec 1 but it doubled after ten days and reached 1 12 m3 sec 1 at the end of the sampling period current speed changed only slightly while the mean depth of the wetted channel increased from 8 cm after one day to 21 cm after 150 days water temperature was very low in december 2020 successively reached about 10 c in may 2021 conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen did not show substantial temporal variations and after about five months from flow resumption the environmental parameters of the intermittent site were very similar to those recorded at the upstream perennial site table 1 3 2 macroinvertebrates during the whole 150 days of the experiment we collected 2223 individuals belonging to 19 taxa table s1 in supplementary material insects occurred with 9 taxa and 1527 individuals while 696 individuals and 10 taxa were non insects four taxa baetis rhodani oligochaetes chironomidae and simulium variegatum dominated the assemblages and represented about 92 of the total individuals collected plecoptera and trichoptera except one single individual of hydropsyche sp were absent eight taxa were present in the first day immediately after the return of the superficial flow and 11 taxa recolonized the substrata after 12 days but taxa richness did not increase consistently in the successive periods fig 2 and after 150 days 11 taxa were present in the stream benthos total abundance was low until the first 20 days but with a successive sharp increase fig 2 insect richness and abundance increased over time after 50 days from rewetting while non insect richness declined but with almost constant lower abundances fig 3 the composition of assemblages changed consistently after the first day of substrate recolonization and followed a temporal succession with chironomidae oligochaetes mainly lumbricids and enchytraeids ostracoda and psychodiidae being the first re colonizers after 12 days the ephemeropteran baetis rhodani and the dipteran simulium variegatum made their first appearance followed after 7 days by the leech dina lineata and the gastropod bithynia tentaculata only after 80 days from rewetting we recorded the first occurrence of the dipteran families limoniidae and ceratopogonidae and after about further two months the ephemeropterans caenis martae and ephemerella sp first appeared in the stream benthos fig 4 ept taxa were absent in the first day after the superficial flow resumed and occurred for the first time after 12 days with two taxa baetis rhodani and hydropsyche sp successively trichopterans disappeared and baetis rhodani was the unique ept taxon occurring until may 2021 when only 3 ept taxa recolonized the intermittent site results of permanova clearly show that the composition of community changed significantly during the 150 days of recovery pseudo f5 12 4 86 p 0 001 the nmds ordination pattern clearly shows that the composition of community changed substantially during the first 20 days from rewetting and was also different from that observed in the following three months fig 5 therefore at the end of the study period the structure and composition of the post drought community was substantially different not only from that of the upstream perennial site 21 taxa 11 ept but also from that observed at the intermittent site in the same period of the antecedent no drought year 22 taxa 9 ept table 2 the analysis of feeding traits of post drought community fig 6 a showed that collectors mainly gatherers dominated during the whole recovery period with relative abundances of about 90 scrapers were present during the first phase upon rewetting but successively disappeared while shredder organisms were totally absent the functional organization of assemblages at the end of the study period may 2021 was consistently different from that of the 7 km upstream perennial site and also showed some differences with that observed at the same site in the previous no drought year fig 6b 4 discussion in a recent paper di sabatino et al 2021 documented that the macroinvertebrate community of the aterno river conserved the memory of antecedent drying events and after more than one year from the reestablishment of the natural flow regime still showed substantial structural and functional differences in comparison with a near upstream perennial site in this paper we confirm and corroborate these previous observations in fact the post drought recovery capacity of the intermittent reach community was very low and not complete after 150 days from superficial flow resumption the intermittent site was characterized by the presence of 11 taxa and this represents a consistent decline if compared to the pre drought condition 50 the richness of ept taxa was reduced much more 72 of the upstream perennial site and 67 of the pre drought community by contrast in a similar study on alpine streams doretto et al 2020 demonstrated that after 73 days from the return of superficial flow 14 taxa recolonized the benthos representing about 78 of those present at the upstream perennial site they also documented a complete recovery of ept taxa and after about two months from rewetting no substantial differences were found between perennial and intermittent communities similarly pařil et al 2019 documented that after 60 days upon rewetting almost 80 of macroinvertebrate taxa recolonized the streambed sediments of intermittent czech streams in this case the persistence in dry riverbeds of desiccation tolerant taxa contributed most to the fast initial recovery of the community a rapid recovery of both richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates was also reported for intermittent rivers of the mediterranean region doledec et al 2017 and for usa and uk streams after severe supraseasonal droughts bogan et al 2015 hill et al 2019 however it was also documented that though some community metrics richness and abundance may reach values like those of the antecedent pre drought period the composition of post drought communities was still different also after more than one year from the previous drying episode datry et al 2011 hill et al 2019 di sabatino et al 2021 our data on the dynamics of post drought recolonization in the aterno river show that the first pioneer taxa chironomids psychodids ostracods and lumbricid and enchytraeid oligochaetes appeared just after the first day from superficial flow resumptions most of these taxa are semiaquatic and well adapted to cope with periods of water flow cessation and their fast recolonization was mainly due to the persistence of resistance forms in the dry substrata or to immigration from riparian wet refugia acuña et al 2005 aspin et al 2018 white et al 2018 in the successive period the whole dynamics of community recovery could be separated into two distinct temporal phases in the first 20 days after flow resumption pioneer taxa both insects and non insects occurred with similar richness and abundance during the second phase new taxa recolonized the benthos caenis martae ephmerella sp limoniidae ceratopogonidae but some others disappeared helobdella stagnalis bithynia tentaculata hydropsiche sp ostracoda therefore total richness of assemblages after 150 days grew only slightly 11 taxa in confront to that of the first day 8 taxa by contrast densities increased exponentially starting from 20 days after rewetting and this was mainly due to the major occurrence of insects species with resilient fast colonization capacities and resistant traits sarremejane et al 2021 as baetis rhodani and simulium variegatum dominated the post drought assemblages and replaced more sensible and rheophile insect taxa plecopterans trichopterans and heptageniid ephemeropterans which although abundant at the perennial site and well represented in the pre drought community did not recolonize the intermittent reach at all therefore it seems that the recolonization process of rewetted substrata in the aterno river started with few semiaquatic or resistant taxa which persisted in the dry streambed successively aerial dispersal both active and passive from nearby downstream sources more than upstream drift or vertical migration from hyporheic refugia may better explains the observed recolonization pattern fig 7 although these latter two strategies have been often evocated as the main drivers of community resilience in intermittent watercourses leigh et al 2016 vander vorste et al 2016 doretto et al 2018 it seems that in the aterno river they played a minor role probably the intensity and duration of the antecedent drought more than 4 months with no residual pools the absence of saturated interstitial refugia and the distance from the upstream perennial reach represent a combination of factors which determined the low resilience of the aterno river macrobenthic community bogan et al 2015 hill et al 2019 moreover in contrast with results of previous research pařil et al 2019 stubbington and datry 2013 stubbington et al 2016 it seems that no active macroinvertebrate seedbanks were operating to ensure a rapid recolonization of rewetted substrata other than affecting community structure and composition irregular drought events may also determine a consistent shift in the functional organization of post drought community aspin et al 2018 leigh et al 2019 our results clearly show that despite the large amount of leaf litter accumulation prior and during the rewetting phase fig 1a shredder organisms were completely absent during the whole study period herbivores were abundant only the first day upon rewetting but successively decreased and disappeared after 80 days the total absence of shredder organisms in the post rewetting phase may have negative effects on coarse particulate organic matter cpom processing and stream ecosystem metabolism datry et al 2011 martínez et al 2015 monroy et al 2016 piano et al 2020b di sabatino et al 2021 in addition the scarce presence of herbivores during the first phase of rewetting and their almost total absence in the successive months may indirectly suggests some negative effects on periphyton recolonization of rewetted substrata piano et al 2019b despite some studies have documented a high resilience and a fast post drought recovery of periphyton robson 2000 timoner et al 2012 it was also noted that this capacity was mainly associated with the presence of residual pools or wet refugia during the dry phase robson et al 2008 2011 in the aterno river the prolonged dry period the absence of saturated refugia and the low adaptation of the algal community to regrow from dry biofilms may have negatively affected the recolonization of benthic autotrophs therefore after more than five months upon rewetting the invertebrate community still shows important and significant differences in comparison with the upstream perennial reach but also with the pre drought community of the intermittent reach in the previous year in conclusion although our findings are not generalizable yet we can affirm that former perennial apennine rivers may be profoundly affected by the modification of the natural flow regime the increasing intermittence of these watercourses may determine drastic changes in community structure and composition with species loss and species substitution sarremejane et al 2021 the high compositional and functional turnover of the recolonizing communities may also have severe consequences on stream ecosystem processes and functions ledger et al 2013 aspin et al 2018 leigh et al 2019 di sabatino et al 2021 considering the high fragility of these ecosystems low resistance and limited resilience

934,downstream displacement and stranding of fish are key impacts in hydropeaked rivers adversely affecting the organisms and subsequently the population while these phenomena have been extensively studied for salmonid fish few studies have been conducted on cyprinids particularly at heterogeneous river banks that provide nursery areas for the earliest life cycle stages this study examines the effects of rapid flow decreases i e down ramping on downstream displacement and stranding of common nase chondrostoma nasus larvae at two river bank morphologies a flat gravel bar and a heterogeneous river bank consisting of a sill and ditch and daytime periods day and night in a mesocosm facility for a subset of the sill and ditch experiments stranding location was noted to quantify the trapping effect of the structure the results show that nase larvae s downstream displacement and stranding rates were higher at the sill and ditch than at the flat gravel bar in addition the effects of down ramping were more visible at night than during the day the displacement and stranding rates were the highest for the sill and ditch structure at night in this case the stranding rate was four times higher in the ditch area compared to other available areas of the mesocosm riverbank depressions can increase the stranding risk when disconnected and dewatered from the main channel after down ramping constituting potential ecological traps for fish larvae these findings highlight the need to integrate riverbank morphology and flow schemes in hydropeaking mitigation frameworks to reduce fish displacement and stranding risks keywords hydropower pulsed flows flow ramping drift environmental flows hydro morphology ecological trap odds ratio 1 introduction the downstream displacement and stranding of aquatic organisms have been described as some of the key impacts in hydropeaked rivers melcher et al 2017 hayes et al 2022a causing adverse consequences for the affected organisms auer et

regarding fish research has predominantly focused on salmonid species to assess ecohydraulic links in hydropeaked rivers hayes et al 2019 studies on the more species rich cyprinid family are still comparatively scarce despite recent works highlighting this knowledge gap costa et al 2019a moreira et al 2019 of the few papers dealing with hydropeaking effects on cyprinid species most studies

effects of downstream displacement and stranding on early post hatch life stages of cyprinids have been poorly studied but see führer et al 2022 even though larvae have been identified as being highly sensitive to hydropeaking hayes et al 2019 godinho et al 2022 the rapid and artificial flow increases i e up ramping due to turbine operations can entail physical stress in aquatic organisms such as fish costa et al 2017 e g by increasing their energetic costs or changing oxygen metabolism due to higher swimming activity enders et al 2003 nadeau et al 2010 the persistent high flow magnitudes associated with hydroelectricity production may exceed the organism s capacity to maintain a holding position which results in involuntary downstream displacement hofer and kirchhofer 1996 auer et al 2014 2017 2022 zeiringer et al 2014 lechner et al 2016 this may exceed the natural drift rates affecting the population structure and function and ultimately leading to biodiversity loss after peak flows when the turbine flow volumes are cut back previously wetted shoreline areas fall dry often leading to stranding or trapping of fish that fail to follow receding water levels in time nagrodski et al 2012 auer et al 2014 2017 2022 zeiringer et al 2014 the downstream displacement and stranding risk of young of the year fish depend on multiple interacting factors including time of day and riverbank structure hauer et al 2014 moreira et al 2019 larrieu et al 2021 in an experimental hydropeaking study increased downstream displacement and stranding rates were observed in juvenile grayling thymallus thymallus during the night and day in heterogeneous gravel bars with potholes compared to flat riverbanks auer et al 2017 another study showed that bay areas that remain wetted after down ramping could significantly reduce downstream displacement and stranding compared to flat gravel bars zeiringer et al 2014 heterogeneous river banks with temporarily available habitats are often found in rivers inhabited by cyprinids and provide important nursery areas jungwirth et al 1993 schiemer et al 2001 it is well known that cyprinid larvae prefer sheltered habitats with low flow velocities e g bays backwater areas and depression pools as these habitats warm up during the day expediting fish growth winkler et al 1997 baras and nindaba 1999 during the summer juvenile fish conduct diurnal habitat shifts moving from sheltered habitats to neighboring riffles to feed baras and nindaba 1999 these habitat shifts underline the importance of morphological heterogeneity for rearing of cyprinid fish however in hydropeaked rivers such complex ecotones may present a significant risk to fish particularly if they provide suitable habitat during peak flow but dry out after down ramping moreira et al 2020 riverbank depressions may act as ecological traps in hydropeaked rivers battin 2004 still such structures have not yet been tested in hydropeaking studies with

riverbank morphology and daytime period in detail we quantified these effects at a flat gravel bar fgb and a sill and ditch structure s d both during the day and night moreover in a subset of the s d experiments the stranding location was assessed allowing us to compare fish stranded in the ditch with those in other areas of the gravel bar 4 1 downstream displacement fish exhibited higher displacement rates at the s d than at the fgb downstream displacement at the fgb stayed consistently low irrespective of the time of day in contrast at the s d displacement rates during the night were the highest of all four setups fig 3 table 2 it is well known that downstream migration plays an important role in early nase development hofer and kirchhofer 1996 pavlov et al 2008 fish slightly smaller 12 17 mm tl than the ones we used in our study mean 18 7 mm tl display a prevalence for active passive drift especially at flow velocities above the critical water velocity zens et al 2018 in detail nase sized around 20 mm tl can withstand maximum sustainable water velocities of 16 5 cm s 1 flore and keckeis 1998 such critical flow rates were not exceeded at the stocking point only at the lower end of the gravel bar fig 2 hence the low displacement rates at the fgb suggest that fish were capable of moving between microhabitats of favorable and unfavorable conditions lechner et al 2018 in contrast at the s d structure fish that moved from the shallowest gravel bank areas towards the more turbulent currents may have failed to find flow refuges and maintain stability heggenes 1988 liao 2007 subsequently being displaced downstream irvine 1986 the fact that this effect was especially pronounced during the night provides another interpretation related to natural habitat shifts between the day and night baras and nindaba 1999 report that nase 28 mm fork length inhabit calm shallow inshore bays during the day by nighttime however they have already moved into neighboring riffles hence the higher downstream displacement at the s d setup during the night compared to the day may have been caused by nase actively moving downstream to find more suitable night habitats however recordings of lateral displacement patterns would be necessary to validate these hypotheses 4 2 stranding only a few nase larvae stranded at the fgb reaching maximum stranding rates of 3 during the day and 8 at night these findings align with führer et al 2022 who conducted similar experiments with earlier nase larvae developmental stages at the s d structure however stranding significantly increased compared to the fgb during the day and night fig 4 table 3 experiments detailing the location of stranded fish confirmed the hypothesis that the presence of a ditch caused fish to become trapped and ultimately strand this was particularly prevalent during the night fig 5 a similar pattern was detected for juvenile grayling at pothole structures auer et al 2017 and the fry of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshwytscha and coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch in side channel pools bradford 1997 in both studies fish were more likely to be trapped in the depression structures than in other places at the gravel bar especially at night bradford 1997 auer et al 2017 thereby the s d structure could act as ecological traps in hydropeaked rivers battin 2004 at the onset of down ramping we observed that nase started to search for deeper sections which they temporarily found in the ditch on the bankside of the island soon however the connection to the low flow channel was cut off eliminating the last chances of escape and this ditch started to dry in general we observed that if single fish found an exit others often followed facilitating the escape of an entire shoal auer et al 2017 in this regard a reduction of visible communication queues during the night might have caused higher pool trapping rates compared to the day 4 3 management implications here we show for the first time that cyprinid larvae are susceptible to hydropeaking down ramping events at riverbanks with ditches leading to downstream displacement and stranding of fish such results of experimental studies are critical for management and policy by establishing key insights into cyprinid specific effects apart from salmonid studies hayes et al 2019 or expert judgments godinho et al 2022 used to date it was expected that downstream displacement and stranding rates of young of the year cyprinids such as the nase would be much higher than that of salmonids moreira et al 2019 e g considering that cyprinids have less aerobic red muscle tissue than salmonids bainbridge 1960 1962 however this was not the case and similar results were also documented for even smaller nase larvae führer et al 2022 still our results underline that the presence of temporarily available shoreline structures can increase fish displacement and stranding compared to the fgb setup considering that particularly shallow sheltered habitats like a s d are suitable for fish larvae winkler et al 1997 baras and nindaba 1999 these areas may pose increased risks when cut off and dewatered between hydropeaks the results of this study indicate that flow magnitude after down ramping is crucial for the survival of fish larvae in cut off ditches thereby underlining the importance of merging the topics of environmental flows and hydropeaking mitigation holzapfel et al 2014 jones 2014 boavida et al 2020 hayes 2021 if the low flow magnitude is small like in our experiments or the peak baseflow ratio is high the previously wetted ditch will become dewatered and fish may dry out or be predated if low flow magnitude is adequate to keep the depression inundated between hydropeaks fish have a greater chance of survival and may escape after re connection to the river nagrodski et al 2012 this relationship between river stage and ditch connection is highly site specific however detailed assessments of known larvae emergence habitats may help to establish river specific mitigation frameworks that will aid in improving the fish ecological status of the entire river reach other studies with salmonids have also reported how the photo phase influences fish stranding in similar summer experiments with larvae and juveniles of grayling and brown trout salmo trutta nighttime down ramping also led to higher fish stranding than daytime down ramping auer et al 2014 2017 indicating that preventing nighttime hydropeaking during early fish development is critical when establishing mitigation frameworks hayes et al 2019 4 4 limitations considering that the experiments were performed in net framed mesocosms the results of downstream displaced fish must be interpreted with caution the setup only allowed us to quantify fish movements after the completion of each replicate fish that were trapped in the net were classified as displaced however in contrast to channel experiments where fish can truly exit or drift out of the experimental area e g auer et al 2014 2017 2022 the mesocosm setup did not allow us to differentiate when fish were displaced i e during the acclimation peak flow or down ramping phase generally observations suggest that most fish drifted into the nets until the onset of the down ramping phase however as water levels receded during down ramping fish also tended to shift downstream laterally thereby some fleeing fish may have been trapped close to the net and subsequently been counted as displaced in contrast fish remaining in the net were sometimes observed to fling themselves more than one centimeter from the net onto the dewatered gravel if these processes were not observed displaced fish might have been classified as stranded and vice versa führer et al 2022 more generally the difficulty of visually observing fish behavior in the mesocosm limits interpretation regarding downstream displacement therefore future studies should employ camera observations to better assess fish behavior during hydropeaking experiments 4 5 conclusions this study assesses the effects of single peak down ramping scenarios on displacement and stranding of nase larvae in interactions of river bank morphology and time of day our results reveal that cyprinid larvae are susceptible to hydropeaking down ramping events particularly in the presence of riverbank ditches that constitute temporarily available habitats rates of displaced and stranded fish were higher at the s d structure than at the fgb especially at night these results show that riverbank features in combination with adequate flow operational schemes e g higher low flow magnitude lower peak baseflow ratio and amplitude slower ramping rates and adequate timing play a key role in preventing adverse effects of hydropeaking hayes et al 2019 2021 by keeping depression pools bays and backwater areas key habitats for cyprinid larvae development inundated between hydropeaking fish

934,downstream displacement and stranding of fish are key impacts in hydropeaked rivers adversely affecting the organisms and subsequently the population while these phenomena have been extensively studied for salmonid fish few studies have been conducted on cyprinids particularly at heterogeneous river banks that provide nursery areas for the earliest life cycle stages this study examines the effects of rapid flow decreases i e down ramping on downstream displacement and stranding of common nase chondrostoma nasus larvae at two river bank morphologies a flat gravel bar and a heterogeneous river bank consisting of a sill and ditch and daytime periods day and night in a mesocosm facility for a subset of the sill and ditch experiments stranding location was noted to quantify the trapping effect of the structure the results show that nase larvae s downstream displacement and stranding rates were higher at the sill and ditch than at the flat gravel bar in addition the effects of down ramping were more visible at night than during the day the displacement and stranding rates were the highest for the sill and ditch structure at night in this case the stranding rate was four times higher in the ditch area compared to other available areas of the mesocosm riverbank depressions can increase the stranding risk when disconnected and dewatered from the main channel after down ramping constituting potential ecological traps for fish larvae these findings highlight the need to integrate riverbank morphology and flow schemes in hydropeaking mitigation frameworks to reduce

associated with hydroelectricity production may exceed the organism s capacity to maintain a holding position which results in involuntary downstream displacement hofer and kirchhofer 1996 auer et al 2014 2017 2022 zeiringer et al 2014 lechner et al 2016 this may exceed the natural drift rates affecting the population structure and function and ultimately leading to biodiversity loss after peak flows when the turbine flow volumes are cut back previously wetted shoreline areas fall dry often leading to stranding or trapping of fish that fail to follow receding water levels in time nagrodski

grayling thymallus thymallus during the night and day in heterogeneous gravel bars with potholes compared to flat riverbanks auer et al 2017 another study showed that bay areas that remain wetted after down ramping could significantly reduce downstream displacement and stranding compared to flat gravel bars zeiringer et al 2014 heterogeneous river banks with temporarily available habitats are often found in rivers inhabited by cyprinids and provide important nursery areas jungwirth et al 1993 schiemer et al 2001 it is well known that cyprinid larvae prefer sheltered habitats with low flow

rearing of cyprinid fish however in hydropeaked rivers such complex ecotones may present a significant risk to fish particularly if they provide suitable habitat during peak flow but dry out after

ci 2 31 6 75 p 0 0297 fig 5 4 discussion this study assessed for the first time the downstream displacement and stranding rates of larvae of the cyprinid nase at down ramping events and according to riverbank morphology and daytime period in detail we quantified these effects at a flat gravel bar fgb and a sill and ditch structure s d both during the day and night moreover in a subset of the s d experiments the stranding location was assessed allowing us to compare fish stranded in the ditch with those in other areas of the gravel bar 4 1 downstream displacement fish exhibited higher displacement rates at the s d than at the fgb downstream displacement at the fgb stayed consistently low irrespective of the time of day in contrast at the s d displacement rates during the night were the highest of all four setups fig 3 table 2 it is well known that downstream migration plays an important role in early nase development hofer and kirchhofer 1996 pavlov et al 2008 fish slightly smaller 12 17 mm tl than the ones we used in our study mean 18 7 mm tl display a prevalence for active passive drift especially at flow velocities above the critical water velocity zens et al 2018 in detail nase sized around 20 mm tl can withstand maximum sustainable water velocities of 16 5 cm s 1 flore and keckeis 1998 such critical flow rates were not exceeded at the stocking point only at the lower end of the gravel bar fig 2 hence the low displacement rates at the fgb suggest that fish were capable of moving between microhabitats of favorable and unfavorable conditions lechner et al 2018 in contrast at the s d structure fish that moved from the shallowest gravel bank areas towards the more turbulent currents may have failed to find flow refuges and maintain stability heggenes 1988 liao 2007 subsequently being displaced downstream irvine 1986 the fact that this effect was especially pronounced during the night provides another interpretation related to natural habitat shifts between the day and night baras and nindaba 1999 report that nase 28 mm fork length inhabit calm shallow inshore bays during the day by nighttime however they have already moved into neighboring riffles hence the higher downstream displacement at the s d setup during the night compared to the day may have been caused by nase actively moving downstream to find more suitable night habitats however recordings of lateral displacement patterns would be necessary to validate these hypotheses 4 2 stranding only a few nase larvae stranded at the fgb reaching maximum stranding rates of 3 during the day and 8 at night these findings align with führer et al 2022 who conducted similar experiments with earlier nase larvae developmental stages at the s d structure however stranding significantly increased compared to the fgb during the day and night fig 4 table 3 experiments detailing the location of stranded fish confirmed the hypothesis that the presence of a ditch caused fish to become trapped and ultimately strand this was particularly prevalent during the night fig 5 a similar pattern was detected for juvenile grayling at pothole structures auer et al 2017 and the fry of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshwytscha and coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch in side channel pools bradford 1997 in both studies fish were more likely to be trapped in the depression structures than in other places at the gravel bar especially at night bradford 1997 auer et al 2017 thereby the s d structure could act as ecological traps in hydropeaked rivers battin 2004 at the onset of down ramping we observed that nase started to search for deeper sections which they temporarily found in the ditch on the bankside of the island soon however the connection to the low flow channel was cut off eliminating the last chances of escape and this ditch started to dry in general we observed that if single fish found an exit others often followed facilitating the escape of an entire shoal auer et al 2017 in this regard a reduction of visible communication queues during the night might have caused higher pool trapping rates compared to the day 4 3 management implications here we show for the first time that cyprinid larvae are susceptible to hydropeaking down ramping events at riverbanks with ditches leading to downstream displacement and stranding of fish such results of experimental studies are critical for management and policy by establishing key insights into cyprinid specific effects apart from salmonid studies hayes et al 2019 or expert judgments godinho et al 2022 used to date it was expected that downstream displacement and stranding rates of young of the year cyprinids such as the nase would be much higher than that of salmonids moreira et al 2019 e g considering that cyprinids have less aerobic red muscle tissue than salmonids bainbridge 1960 1962 however this was not the case and similar results were also documented for even smaller nase larvae führer et al 2022 still our results underline that the presence of temporarily available shoreline structures can increase fish displacement and stranding compared to the fgb setup considering that particularly shallow sheltered habitats like a s d are suitable for fish larvae winkler et al 1997 baras and nindaba 1999 these areas may pose increased risks when cut off and dewatered between hydropeaks the results of this study indicate that flow magnitude after down ramping is crucial for the survival of fish larvae in cut off ditches thereby underlining the importance of merging the topics of environmental flows and hydropeaking mitigation holzapfel et al 2014 jones 2014 boavida et al 2020 hayes 2021 if the low flow magnitude is small like in our experiments or the peak baseflow ratio is high the previously wetted ditch will become dewatered and fish may dry out or be predated if low flow magnitude is adequate to keep the depression inundated between hydropeaks fish have a greater chance of survival and may escape after re connection to the river nagrodski et al 2012 this relationship between river stage and ditch connection is highly site specific however detailed assessments of known larvae emergence habitats may help to establish river specific mitigation frameworks that will aid in improving the fish ecological status of the entire river reach other studies with salmonids have also reported how the photo phase influences fish stranding in similar summer experiments with larvae and juveniles of grayling and brown trout salmo trutta nighttime down ramping also led to higher fish stranding than daytime down ramping auer et al 2014 2017 indicating that preventing nighttime hydropeaking during early fish development is critical when establishing mitigation frameworks hayes et al 2019 4 4 limitations considering that the experiments were performed in net framed mesocosms the results of downstream displaced fish must be interpreted with caution the setup only allowed us to quantify fish movements after the completion of each replicate fish that were trapped in the net were classified as displaced however in contrast to channel experiments where fish can truly exit or drift out of the experimental area e g auer et al 2014 2017 2022 the mesocosm setup did not allow us to differentiate when fish were displaced i e during the acclimation peak flow or down ramping phase generally observations suggest that most fish drifted into the nets until the onset of the down ramping phase however as water levels receded during down ramping fish also tended to shift downstream laterally thereby some fleeing fish may have been trapped close to the net and subsequently been counted as displaced in contrast fish remaining in the net were sometimes observed to fling themselves more than one centimeter from the net onto the dewatered gravel if these processes were not observed displaced fish might have been classified as stranded and vice versa führer et al 2022 more generally the difficulty of visually observing fish behavior in the mesocosm limits interpretation regarding downstream displacement therefore future studies should employ camera observations to better assess fish behavior during hydropeaking experiments 4 5 conclusions this study assesses the effects of single peak down ramping scenarios on displacement and stranding of nase larvae in interactions of river bank morphology and time of day our results reveal that cyprinid larvae are susceptible to hydropeaking down ramping events particularly in the presence of riverbank ditches that constitute temporarily available habitats rates of displaced and stranded fish were higher at the s d structure than at the fgb especially at night these results show that riverbank features in combination with adequate flow operational schemes e g higher low flow magnitude lower peak baseflow ratio and amplitude slower ramping rates and adequate timing play a key role in preventing adverse effects of hydropeaking hayes et al 2019 2021 by keeping depression pools bays and backwater areas key habitats for cyprinid larvae development inundated between hydropeaking fish
